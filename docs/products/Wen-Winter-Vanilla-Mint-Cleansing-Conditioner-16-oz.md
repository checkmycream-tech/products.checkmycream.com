<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell was great. But leaves your hair heavy and greasy. First 2 days were fine but by the third day I had to use my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love the way it works n smells</li>
    <li> First off the scent is amazing and lasts. I found that the product does just what it claims. My hair has some damage from heat and sun. Now since I have used this my hair looks and feels healthy. I really do not have anything bad to say. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  love this</li>
    <li> Wonderful like all his other products change.  Try the  different kinds ur hair gets used to the same stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Ben using WEN for years now and my hair as never been healthier or prettier - except when I was younger and didn&#x27;t have stubborn grays or frequent coloring to hide said grays.  I do get cheap sometimes and try other cleansing conditioners, or new shampoos that make extravagant promises but my hair always rebels and responds only to WEN. All WEN products make my hair happy, but I&#x27;m not crazy about all the scents they offer. This scent is delicious, like chocolate mint cookies that are famously sold door to door.  Mmm!  So, I wholeheartedly recommend this product and scent. My only reservation is the cost is pretty high... But that&#x27;s partly overcome by being able to forego washing my hair everyday.</li>
    <li> makes my hair very soft,but it does tend to build up.so I need to use regular shampoo at least once a week</li>
    <li> Love this product. I always use it after color. It leaves my hair looking and feeling so nice, soft and it feels and looks like hair not straw!</li>
    <li> Love this one, the mint tingle and the aloe in it dose wonders for my hair and sculp.  I plan to repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> This was brand-new and in the original packaging, and I was very pleased about that. Then I used the product and fell in love with it! The smell was so delicious, just like a peppermint patty. I ordered a second one right away, since it is a seasonal scent. So happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This one is limited and was promoted in fall of 2011 and early in 2012.  Not sure if it will be offered in other seasons.  Unlike some WEN products, this has a scent that will work for men and women, with ease. The peppermint offers a clean feel, and is sensational in the shower.  This one is similar, from a result standpoint, to the even harder to find 6-13 formula.  Both offer superior shine, and tends to enhance hair volume.  From a guy stand point, if you happen to have thinning hair, this is a studio-quality product. Your hair will look better after one use, and continue to improve.  I think it takes about 3 washing/treatments to fully see the result. This can ALSO be used as a face-wash, with great results - leave it on for 1-2 minutes and you will see clean, and firm skin!  Not inexpensive, but worth it.  I would like to see Amazon offer this ( and the entire line), direct from the vendor, at some point.  For what it is worth, it is a product used on television and motion picture set&#x27;s.  It really works!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about the hype but I must say I am impressed.  My hair is bouncy, shiny, and frizz-free.  I used the Winter Mint for the second time today and it was even better than I thought it could be.  I dried my hair and for the first time ever did not use a flat iron to smooth out my shoulder length hair.  Even after I ventured out into the misty/foggy morning (usually means instant frizz for me) my hair is still soft and smooth.  I LOVE that I don&#x27;t have use multiple products to get this result (before I used shampoo, conditioner, and styling lotion).  Sure, you will need to experiment with the amount that you use on your hair to get the right number of pumps based on your hair type and length -- it is not one size fits all.  I used about 8-10 pumps today which is less than what the label recommends.  Play with it and you will figure it out.  The product is really worth it.  This is one of the few products I have used that really does exactly what it says it will do and believe me I had my doubts.  For the people that say this doesn&#x27;t work for them, I think it has to be user error (not enough cleanser, massage, time in hair, etc.).  If the price is what gives you pause you should combine the cost of shampoo+conditioner+frizz creme+whatever else you use and then compare that to this product for the best apple-apple comparison of price.  I was using Kerastase before and that was typically $30 shampoo (8.5 oz) and $56 deep conditioner (6.5 oz).  If I look at it that way then Wen is a definite savings!  Plus my hair feels and looks so much better.  I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Best hair ever!</li>
    <li> Love love Love Winter vanilla mint!!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing and leaves my thick long hair silly and so soft! I&#x27;m a wen girl:)  love watermelon for kids too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried this and I won&#x27;t!! Its the knock off by Gunthy Renker!! These sellers should be required to disclose who these are distributed by. I seen a few reviews that this is the real Wen but those were either paid review writers or confused.</li>
    <li> Product works and smells great, however...maybe I&#x27;m just grumpy, but this is the 2nd time I have bought a Wen cleansing product that the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I have never even been able to get it extended. Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin...no pop. You would think for $31 the pump would work....</li>
    <li> Love Wen products.............best thing for your hair.............</li>
    <li> I love WEN. Miracle hair care.</li>
    <li> I am a Wen girl for over a year now and I tried Pomegranate, which was great, then I tried Six Thirteen, which was outstanding, then I tried this one as a sample in the \\&quot;test tube\\&quot; and this one is just beyond belief.  I hope Chaz puts this in 32oz.  I also tried the Pumpkin one and that one is just wonderful.  The Pumpkin one has 858 five star reviews on QVC.  Wen just kicked in the door with these products.  Nothing comes close.  After washing and blow drying it&#x27;s like I just left a salon, really.  I would recommend this to everyone and hey, if you don&#x27;t like it for any reason, it will NOT hurt your hair in any way.  If I could give this one hundred stars, I would.  The Winter Vanilla Mint smells a bit like caramel, the Pumpkin smells like cinnamon, but a delicious cinnamon like you want to eat it.  I&#x27;m not nuts about the Winter Vanilla Mint smell, not that it smells bad, but the results are just phenomenal.  Go for it, seriously.</li>
    <li> love this flavor like I love sweet almond mint. they are clean and refreshing without lingering.</li>
    <li> The scent is a tad too minty for me -- BUT, the product is great and the shipping was on point - as usual. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using wen products for over a year now.  I just cannot go back to the ordinary shampoos.  Believer me I have used every type of shamapoo ther is on the market.  This is the best. This particular scent is like heaven.  I just love the way it makes my hair feel.  It is so soft and shinny.  I give this 10 stars :)  Suzy from Trinidad and Tobago.  I wish that I could sell it here in Trinidad that is the only bummer I have to import it every month.</li>
    <li> our local  &amp;#34;as seen on TV store &amp;#34;  is my go to store to buy -  WEN -  but they did not  carry the winter  product.. I&#x27;m  hooked on the smell/ feelof WEN products - and as long as you read the direction (  on how many pumps )  it does  what it claims too</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to make my hair smell like a York peppermint patty. I was expecting something a bit more subtle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but didn&#x27;t. I know SLS aren&#x27;t great for your hair-but I love suds. (I currently use Bumble and Bumble Coco shampoo, and it&#x27;s insane.) I tried using this on off days, but you can&#x27;t really use it two days in a row because it made my hair too heavy, and it felt kind of dirty. Now Chaz Dean is a great stylist, and I&#x27;m sure this is a great product-In all fairness, it smelled great, and left my hair very soft and healthy looking. But I have fine hair, a lot, and its just past shoulder length-so maybe this wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me and my hair type.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love, all of my WEN products, but this is my favorite scent so far!  It leaves my hair manageable, soft, and full of body!</li>
    <li> I just love the way the winter vanilla mint smells!  It has a lot of mint in it so it really makes your scalp tingle, which I love.  All the great cleansing effects of WEN and a whole lot of creamy, delicious smelling sweetness!  I won&#x27;t want the winter to end!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this wen, it is true that it smells a little more like mint than vanilla. This is my first time using wen, I have really long hair that is colored. It is usually a bit frizzy. The first time I used this I was pleasantly surprised, it was easy to use and I did not see any of my color run down the drain at all! I did notice that by the next day my hair was a bit greasy but I&#x27;ve only used it twice now. All in all I am very happy with wen!</li>
    <li> Probably my all time favorite scent, beat out the Summer Coconut mango for first place. Glad to have found it again.</li>
    <li> Pros - smells and feels amazing.  Incredible tingly sensation on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Price.  $33 for 16 oz.??  I couldn&#x27;t tell a $33 difference in my hair to ever spend this much again...  I was expecting miracles. And I got chump change.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing.  I mean..... AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its far too expensive for me to afford to use as directed.  I have found that it works well as a leave-in conditioner though, and that only takes a pump, instead of the 4-8 pumps needed to use it as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t use anything but wen , been over 10 years and i know it is the best , have recommended it to everyone i know. Have bought the kids cleansing conditioner for my grandaughters and they love it too</li>
    <li> I am an avid Wen user for the last four years, usually I stick to the sweet almond mint, but I LOVE the scent of this winter vanilla mint! Ironically it smells more like chocolate mint though! Left my scalp feeling more clean than the sweet almond mint too.</li>
    <li> Like the product, is as good as the other Wen hair care products really smelled good also. Was as described and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 4-5 years now and I alternate between Tea Tree and Sweet Almond day to day.  I decided to give this a try and my hair is heavenly!!! More Manageable and looks and feels great, I sometimes forgot what a change does for your hair after using the same thing over and over.  I have  shoulder length hair and use 5 pumps, not the amount directed on the bottle.  My hairdresser has commented how heathly my hair had become over the years and I color it every 4 weeks from a box.  I could not be happier with the results!! :)</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy the product based on some of the reviews (especially the review where one person said it stripped the color from her hair) but I have been using Wen for a month now and love it! The smell is great and leaves your scalp nice and perperminty cool! The drying time has been cut in half and the product has NOT dulled or stripped the color out of my hair (I have blonde highlights). I have been recommending this product to everyone I know! It is important to rinse for a really long time, especially with lighter hair because it can look greasy if there is any of the product left over in your hair, so be sure to follow the directions to a T!</li>
    <li> I am a regular Wen user but I don&#x27;t like the idea of being on the regular plan where they send you the product every couple months. I don&#x27;t need as much as they think I do. lol. So I like to buy it here. Winter Vanilla Mint is by far my favorite scent. A little tingly. Just yummy.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Wen Conditioners a lot. My curly hair does really well with not being washed every day and (especially in the summer) my hair craves the conditioning.</li>
    <li> You need a ton of this per wash, it says 16 pumps I believe.  I have hair almost to my waist, so that&#x27;s a lot more needed.  Well, it leaves hair clean.  It doesn&#x27;t leave it tangle free like on the commercial even when its in your hair for 10 minutes.  It has this menthol burning feeling that remains on you head and hands for a couple hours afterwords.  I would never dare use this on my kids.  There are better options if you see my reviews.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> The three stars for this review is for the technique alone.  Prior to trying Wen, I was using conditioner only on my hair.  My hair was soft and shiny, but I wanted something to give me more volume.  (For reference, I was using Suave Humectant shampoo).  I switched to Wen and did notice that my hair was shinier, however it did not have more volume initially.  Once I got better at the technique of using Wen my hair did have a bit more volume.  I tried Wen using the leave-in conditioner technique as well as just washing with Wen, and did not notice a difference in conditioner.  After using Wen for a few weeks and watching my conditioner supply deplete while I thought about how much money I spent on it, I decided to go back and try my Suave conditioner again - but using the Wen method.  The Wen method is to divide your hair up - roughly the top, and then two sides - apply conditioner liberally, massage it into the hair thoroughly, add a little watcer and lather, then leave it in until you are ready to get out of the shower.  You will want to rinse very thoroughly.  The short of it is that Wen does provide, in my opinion, a slightly better experience than just using Conditioner.  My hair was somewhat shinier, and had a bit more volume.  The difference for me is am I willing to spend 30.00 more a month for marginal differences?  No, I am not.  I will likely search for a different conditioner to use, but for me Wen&#x27;s value is in the technique, not the product itself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, and have purchased it from this seller within the last month (November 7, 2013) and only paid $37.50.  I just got ready to order some more and saw that the price jumped up.  SIGNIFICANTLY!  I am not talking just a 5% increase for the &amp;#34;holiday&amp;#34; or anything, a 72% increase bringing the price from $37.50 all the way to $64.95 in less than a month!  I will change to another seller and another scent until this is changed back to the price that made it no only a fantastic product, but a great seller to rely on.</li>
    <li> second review after a 2 week period of use love love love this product cant believe what this has done for my hair. just ordered a new bottle and will order through the infomercial for continous delivery</li>
    <li> I tried this after watching Wen&#x27;s infomercial.  Not wanting to sign up for a monthly subscription, I bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin, hair.  I&#x27;m not sure I care for the menthol - it tingled a whole lot at first, but the effect wore off gradually as I continued to use it.  The product did smell good.  I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much product as Wen recommended - I usually used about 3 pumps.  I think my hair got clean, and it didn&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down (I was a little concerned about that), but I just didn&#x27;t like the feeling of using only conditioner rather than a shampoo.  Considering the relatively high price, it&#x27;s not worth it to me to continue use.</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling formula&#x27;s of Wen. And it works like a charm!! Designed for all hair types. Awesome that it&#x27;s out of stock on the actual site. But still available here. Fantastic buy!</li>
    <li> Works as well as the Sweet Almond Mint for me, and smells terrific. I love vanilla scented beauty products, and this is a beautiful one without being over powering.</li>
    <li> this one is my favorite of the Wen products. It smells so fantastic, and makes my head tingly and refreshing. It also does a superb job of conditioning my hair and making it healthy. love love love</li>
    <li> This legit does what the infomercial claims.  My hair is soft, managable and shiny.  (I have thin hair, but a LOT of it, so it&#x27;s often difficult to find product that&#x27;s effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foaming agents tend to make my face itch, so it&#x27;s nice to have a product without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often, so this bottle can last about 12 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different scents, but this is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> My hair was really damage so I tried wen.  I used the shampoo and the conditioning balm.  I would leave it (the balm) in my hair over night.  Within 1 week I could tell the difference.  Within 2 weeks people in my office were noticing my hair.  I also use the balm when I don&#x27;t want to dry my hair.  I rub about the size of a 50 cent piece though my hair, mostly on the ends and then scrunch it so it will curl.  Holds curl better than any gel I have used.  I love this product and plan on using  only this.  I also like that their is no detergents in it.  Better for my septic and the environment.</li>
    <li> PRETTY STRONG SCENT. USED 5 PUMPS, MY HAIR IS ALMOST BELOW MY SHOULDER BLADES.&lt;br /&gt;IT BURNED THE TOP OF MY SCALP- SO I DIDN&#x27;T LEAVE IT ON AS LONG AS I SHOULD HAVE.&lt;br /&gt;I DIDN&#x27;T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE YET. NOT SURE IF I WILL RUB IT IN NEXT TIME. DEF NOT GETTING RID OF- TOO EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> I adore Wen. I normally use the Almond Mint but I decided to try this new scent because I love vanilla. This scent is really yummy but doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla at all to me. It smells just like York Peppermint Patties. I do not like it as much as the Sweet Almond Mint, I feel like it leaves my hair looking a tad bit greasy. But it still leaves me hair soft and shiny. My hair is pretty fine so it might be perfect for thicker hair.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product and FAST delivery! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Packaging was very nicely wrapped and my product was protected.  I received everything very fast.  Love Prime!</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, because I have thin, medium length hair. It intimidated me that this &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t actually lather. I gave it a shot anyway, and I love it! I would recommend purchasing some Big Sexy Hair products to go with it, because it does make it a little flat. But curls hold longer, less frizz, and more shine! This is my favorite scent. I have had no hair loss, allergic reaction, ect.</li>
    <li> I have tried TONS of shampoos and conditioners, varying from salon quality to cheap pharmacy ones. Some worked for a while, and the other destroyed and dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this product while looking for something else to try. Friends have used it and claimed Wen to work fabulously. Honestly, I was very skeptical. Being used to shampoo and conditioner, I believed that Wen wouldn&#x27;t work on my very dry, long, (dye) damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen improved the quality of my hair, made it MUCH easier to brush, and brought life back into it! My hair is not voluminous and tangle free! Not to mention, it made my waves a lot less frizzy and more prominent. Don&#x27;t have a rats nest for hair anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s expensive. But I believe that it is well worth the cost. One should also follow closely to the directions. I didn&#x27;t bother with the pump... don&#x27;t have time to count. Instead, I just poured a generous amount into my hand, and added more in areas that needed the cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I had hope for my processed hair.  I used the whole bottle and wished I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.  It smelled nice but it made my scalp look greasy.  It really didn&#x27;t make a difference with my hair.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with lots of hope that it would make my hair feel good. I was disappointed with the cost and the product. My hair did not feel clean and it definitely needed another conditioner so that I could comb my hair after washing. I have long hair and it left it feeling just O.K. It was way to expensive to leave it still feeling oily and really tangled. NOT impressed and will not order again.</li>
    <li> I love Wren products, I would not mind it being a little cheaper, but it&#x27;s great on my hair and feels good to</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and coarse and tends to get frizzy.  I had been going shampoo free using conditioners only but my hair never felt quite clean and the conditioners left it feeling coated.  This is my first bottle of Wen and I love the results.  My hair feels light and clean but has body and is manageable.  I would give this product 5 stars</li>
    <li> I have thin, natural dirty blonde, straight hair. I have been using Wen cleansing conditioners for about a year, and I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to normal shampoo. When I do use normal shampoo for whatever reason, those are my bad hair days.&lt;br /&gt;I used this version of wen cleansing conditioner for the first time this morning, and the scent is lovely! It smells sort of like chocolate to me. Or like the new trident vanilla mint gum. I put my hair up in a ponnytail afterwards but just let it down and I just can&#x27;t stop smelling my hair. The cleansing conditioner is just as good as all other original ones, but the smell is just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my old job to visit my coworkers yesterday, and they all gave me a big hug. I wish I received this conditioner one day earlier so that they would smell the hevenly smell of my hair instead of the tea tree one that I used yesterday.</li>
    <li> So, I know the fragrance is called Winter Vanilla Mint, but it smells like a Thin Mint cookie to me... although my friends think it has a vanilla fragrance rather than chocolate. Either way, it is refreshing and far better than the Vick&#x27;s Vapo rub smell some of the other scents have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the way it makes my hair feel! I am now able to brush it right out of the shower and let it air dry and there is little to no frizz! It also dries quicker and my hair feels like silk.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The TV ads sound promising but this product fails to perform.  As always to good to be true it normally is...</li>
    <li> I have always been aware of Wen products via the infomercials constantly aired on tv. For some reason I have a lack of trust in infomercials in general so I never considered trying the product, especially since it involved being committed to a tri-monthly shipment.  Just to give you background on my hair type, my hair is extremely frizzy/curly/thick and dark brown. Every 6 months I treat it with Japanese thermal straightening (Liscio). It does cause its share of damage but it also helps in relaxing the frizzies. The worst is in between treatments when my new hair grows out so it gets pretty curly at the roots and so with constant flat ironing I got tonssss of split ends which turns in a whole mess of hair, not to mention that I have to deal with the daily humidity in sunny Florida!  After reading so many positive reviews on Amazon and with the flexibility of not having to commit to a regular shipment, I decided to give it a try. I am in shock. After one use, I can see, feel and smell brand new hair!! It is a miracle how revived my hair feels. I am a true product junkie and have experimented a lot with all sorts of products, from high end stuff such as Kerastase to the lower end ones like Aphogee. Never have I felt this effect on my hair. I followed thee exact instructions that are on the back of the bottle. The tingling sensation as you work the conditioner through your hair is incredible. The fragrance is also delish. After the shower, I put one pump worth through the ends as a leave in. I barely needed to blow dry! It cut my drying time by 75%. Reduced the frizzies dramatically and the  moisture that pumped through my once lifeless hair is just surreal.  Ideally I would like to continue using this product to see if this amazing effect will persist, but so far I am quite impressed and can&#x27;t wait to try the fig conditioner too as I understand it also helps with damaged hair. I definitely recommend this product, especially since it eliminates the damaging effects that you normally get from regular shampoos!</li>
    <li> I tried the Wen cleansing conditioner after my hair was dried out from chlorine.  The directions suggested 16-30 pumps of conditioner.  For my hair, it suggests 30-40.  I was a little surprised at that.  I found if I used less than suggested, it didn&#x27;t work.  My hair actually had a stiff feeling, like I&#x27;d use too much gel, and it did not feel clean at all.  However, if I used all 30 pumps I was supposed to, it worked well and my hair felt amazingly soft.  It is a nice change from my everyday conditioner, but it is not something I use everyday.</li>
    <li> awesome seller and product. shipped quickly! thank you!</li>
    <li> This product made my daughter&#x27;s hair to fall out. We won&#x27;t be buying it again. I won&#x27;t even try the others</li>
    <li> This is my second attempt at using WEN, and it has same pros and cons. WEN really does what it says, my hair is shinier, stronger and silkier than it&#x27;s ever been. I am limited to the Gluten-free formulations due to allergies, but I tried the Pomegranate and I really disliked the scent- it was strong, synthetic and left my hair smelling dirtier somehow. So I was excited to try the Vanilla Mint, seasonal scent that is also free of gluten ingredients. Well, it still works, my hair feels and looks great, bowever, the fragrance is strongly- sickly sweet with somekind of synthetic vanilla-yuck and not enough mint to cancel it out. It would be best if WEN developed an unscented and GF version or just dialed back on their fragrances so that they didn&#x27;t overpower so much. I feel there would be no point in wearing perfume while using this because all I or anyone in a 10 ft. radius will be able to detect is this obnoxious fake yucky vanilla aroma oozing off my head. It really would not be good for anyone who has allergies or gets migraines like I do. I will use this, only because it really makes my hair healthier, but I will probably add some essential oil (not sure what) to mask/alter the smell. I pray that by the time the bottle is finished WEN has come out with a better/non-smelling option, because right now, I am literally and figuratively holding my breath.</li>
    <li> I know I kinda defeat the purpose...I start with really washing my head with regular shampoo...rinse &amp; then use the WEN product on my hair from the back top of my head down. I have below shoulder length hair. My hair can get too flat and limp, so a little volume on the top is welcome. I do like the feel of my hair after a WEN treatment...it shines nicely &amp; smells really delightful with the vanilla mint scent. The product produced better results than I had imagined. The mint also adds a cooling effect to my head when I do the rinsing. I did not want to get involved in any automatic deliveries, so coming to Amazon suited my desire to, at least, try this product. I will reorder some more \\&quot;WEN\\&quot; *giggling* the time comes. It&#x27;s been a nice treat for me. I did a treatment on my Mom&#x27;s hair; hers is very white and coarse. The product left her hair nicely shimmering in white with an easy manageability. Yes, it&#x27;s kinda pricey, however, like I said...it was a treat to myself VS a new piece of clothing or jewelry or shoes.</li>
    <li> One of Wen Hair Care&#x27;s best fragrances EVER! Wen products are great for my hair. Have been using them exclusively for over two years. However, some of the formulas leave my hair a little oily (my hair is neither excessively oily or dry), but this formula is just right for me!</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of one of those sample &#x27;tubes&#x27; and probably would not have tried it otherwise....a hair product that doesn&#x27;t lather - you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me!  However, as I had the product I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the directions that said to use 16 pumps...instead I used about half that on my should length, coarse, wavy hair.  I washed my hair first and then left the product in as I proceeded to finish my shower before washing the product out.  Afterwards I did my normal routine of applying a little argan oil before blow drying and flat ironing my hair.  I was absolutely amazed!  To have used so few products and achieved such an outcome was incredible.  I&#x27;ve continued to use this product for several months and today my stylist commented on how much my hair has changed...that says a lot!  As others have said, the smell is much more mint than vanilla but it is a wonderful scent.  Also, I get my hair colored once a month and before my shower used to look like a crime scene for about a week after I had my trip to the salon (I&#x27;m a redhead)...now, not at all.  The trip to the salon is because of new growth, not because the color has been stripped out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve thought about trying Wen for a long time, and made the decision to do so when I saw the Winter Vanilla Mint scent.  It sounded so nice.  I&#x27;ve seen the infomercials and read reviews about how great the product is.  Before I placed the order I saw a couple reviews about hair loss and didn&#x27;t think much of them, because I figured folks just weren&#x27;t used to combing their hair in the shower and didn&#x27;t realize how much hair they lose on a regular basis.  I wish I had paid more attention to those reviews!  I have long hair (halfway down my back) and I love it dearly.  And I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve made a horrible mistake using this product.  The first time I used it, my hair felt like straw after - not at all silky and smooth like the models on QVC or in the infomercials.  I figured it must just take time to work.  Then I started noticing I was shedding.  A LOT.  Again, I figured it was just because my hair was getting used to it.  I used it a second time and my hair got even dryer, and this time about 3 times as much came out in the shower and it just won&#x27;t stop.  I am HORRIFIED.  The second time I used it, I also wore a tank top, so my hair was touching the skin on my back and neck.  I am having a severe breakout everywhere it touched my skin.  As I type this a week after the last use, my scalp is bumpy and itchy and my hair continues to fall out.  I understand that some people may have reactions while most don&#x27;t, but there really needs to be a warning label on this stuff.  Like on hair color - you should test it before use.  Who would think that shampoo (or non-shampoo in this case) could be dangerous?  Be very careful if you decide to try Wen.  After further research, this seems to be a very common problem.  Some folks have contacted the FDA and I plan to do that tonight when I have the bottle in my hand.  Hair professionals have weighed in and stated that massaging conditioner into your roots can clog the follicles and cause the roots to die.  I can only hope this is not permanent.  Please, please use caution with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that my mother is having the same experience.  She only used it once and her baby fine, silky hair looks like it&#x27;s been fried and she&#x27;s shedding more than usual.</li>
    <li> I really love this product I am allergic to almost everything. My hair is amazing I get compliments on it all the time. I have read some negative reviews (which really are not that many) but, I really think that the people who do not get a good result are not using it like it&#x27;s supposed to (which is not that hard either) I have never had a problem with any of the Wen Products. I must say this is my Favorite sent out of the ones I have used I wish it was a more permanent one, rather than &amp;#34;seasonal&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My favorite Wen fragrance so far, and it leaves my hair feeling thick and very shiny. Of all the &amp;#34;flavors,&amp;#34; I think this one is the most compatible with my hair type, which is baby-fine and shoulder-length.</li>
    <li> Works great.  After the very first use my hair felt so much softer!</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ve tried Wen twice in the last 2 years. It does nothing for my hair. Which is thick, wavy and not chemically treated. It starts to look greasy the next day. And my hair is dry. I can normally go 3 days without washing it before it looks like this. The high point on this is the scent. If you love vanilla like me, you will be dissapointed. It smells of mint first and foremost then chocolate. So its not that its bad, its just not vanilla. I found the Almond Mint better. The scent lasted all day and even though I didn&#x27;t like it like shampoo it made a great leave in conditioner. Be wary.. a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine thin hair and usually I use the tea tree and sometimes the lavender WEN. My FAVORITE is 613 but this one seems to leave my hair dull and greasy. Maybe it&#x27;s just an aged product being that I bought it on amazon and it was last winter&#x27;s limited edition and here we are going into fall. But either way I get the other ones from amazon and so far I found that the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; ones leave my hair icky and flat... but don&#x27;t give up on WEN not all the formulas are the same and there will be one that may work better for you</li>
    <li> This product left my kinky and coily hair hard.  I would not buy this again.  Over prices and not worth the expense.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Wen so far! Love the fragrance and my hair has the amazing softness that Wen gives my long, color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between using Wen and regular shampoo/conditioner.  I&#x27;ve colored my hair regularly for the past ten years, and have been more recently staying blonde, because it doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as the deeper colors and reds do.  About two months ago I started using Wen again, and saw this scent for sale.  I had to buy it.  While regular Wen leaves my hair feeling soft and my color doesn&#x27;t fade, I&#x27;ve been using the Winter Vanilla for the past two weeks and I have never loved a hair product so much!  First of all, it smells absolutely fantastic.  Secondly, you know the feeling you get when you wash your hair in the bathtub and swish it around in the water and it feels so silky in the water, and you wish it would feel like that in real life?  That&#x27;s how my hair REALLY feels using this scent/product.  Also, I colored my hair a bright red with highlights 3 weeks ago and with ANY other hair product, it would have faded completely by now.  I have experienced absolutely NO fading when using Wen!  It&#x27;s amazing!  I do have to cleanse more frequently that when using shampoo, my hair has a tendency to get oily between washing, but it&#x27;s not a hassle at all with this great, wonderful product!  Love!  Five stars forever!</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery.  Love the product.  Contains no harsh chemicals equals happy, healthy hair!  I will definatly purchase again and am recommending to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> it works it really really work i love this product it leaves my hair so soft and smelling so great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to regular shampoo.....terrific product for my kind of frizzy, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair soft and hydrated. I wash my hair every other day. Along with Moroccan oil, Paul Mitchell skinny and Paul Mitchell taming spray This products produces the the best possible outcome. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and my hair is so soft after use it&#x27;s expensive bit worth it. Will get this product again.</li>
    <li> I have the ugliest, driest, most burnt  hair you can imagine.  I watched the TV commercials with nothing but skepticism. But, decided I would give this conditioner a try.  Well.......6 weeks, and one reorder later, the change in my hair is nothing but a miracle.  It is softer, shinier, more manageable....I just don&#x27;t have enough positive words to describe.  I am truly a convert.</li>
    <li> Bad news:  It made my hair fall out in chunks.  Good news: My hairs stopped falling out in chunks when I stopped using it and grew back.  It was recommended to me by a friend who did not have the same problem.  Just be careful!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!!!  Hair is in better condition that it has ever been!  I would highly recommend it for anyone trying to improve their hair.</li>
    <li> It was a substitute scent because sweet almond was not available. I didn&#x27;t care for it but my daughter loved it so I gave it to her and ordered my favorite as soon as I could. She started me on the Wen product in the first place so I guess it was karma. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it will make your hair more alive, look thicker, and you will lose less hair with every washing.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen cleansing Conditioners but the Winter Vanilla is my favorite !  Great products !  I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> Well it takes some getting used to, I have oily skin and an oily scalp and i will say that at first i was REALLY concerned using this that I&#x27;d be a mess after a few days.....boy was I wrong! This stuff REALLY does clean, as long as you follow the directions. I personally didn&#x27;t need nearly as much product as they recommend, I used 4 pumps for my scalp area and then 2 more for the rest of my hair and any spots I&#x27;d missed, after that combing your hair is a must. I then just clip my hair up and let it sit while I do the rest of my business, at the very end of the shower i let my hair down, put some water in it, and it really does sort of suds up (minus the suds) and then i scrub my scalp and rise through. I notice a HUGE difference with this product when i wear my hair curly, it curls up so pretty, I hardly need to do anything other than add some curl cream and use a diffuser for a few mins to start the process. I also can blow my hair out and straighten it and it stays straight and voluminous the whole day, it&#x27;s a wonder product. I usually will shampoo maybe every 15 days since i do use some styling products, just because i don&#x27;t want to have any build up....I&#x27;m not sure that its really needed. Also good to point out that i have allergies to a lot of products and this didn&#x27;t cause me to break out or have any bad side effects like some others mentioned.</li>
    <li> I love Wen products. This shampoo smells amazing (my favorite scent of theirs) and makes my hair look amazing. It&#x27;s different from other shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past in that it doesn&#x27;t lather; however it still leaves my hair soft, shiny, and almost weightless but still voluminous.</li>
    <li> This product may be wonderful for those that wear their hair long and straight.  Their problem with dead ends, etc. may be taken care of.  For me, (and me alone) I rate it very low.  I have shorter, natural curly hair... and it lost all of its \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; and felt heavy and greasy.  The shine was gone (what I did have) and it didn&#x27;t respond to hot rollers or hair dryer as before.  I don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;pan\\&quot; this for others, but if it comes in a smaller size - get that first and see how it works for you.  It is NOT FOR ME.</li>
    <li> My hair and senses just love this shampoo. I am glad that I found another source when Wen stops making this for a while.</li>
    <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.  THE SMELL IS INCREDIBLE AND THE PRODUCT ALWAYS PERFORMS.  NEXT TIME I WILL PURCHASE THE LARGER SIZE</li>
    <li> Great deep down conditiong and also on the go as well. When I want a little extra when it&#x27;s realy hot outside I just wet my hair and let it sit in and I&#x27;m very pleased how it keeps my hair during these extremely dry days. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for the past five months- i have also tried Fig, Lavender, Gardenia, and Pomegranate. This is my favorite so far.  The smell is really nice, and more mellow than other formulas.  Wen has been great at helping me preserve the color in my hair.  I went from ash blonde to dark brown, and Wen has really helped with maintaining the color, as well as the moisture and integrity of my hair.  I use about 10-12 pumps, much less than the bottle recommends.  I have straight hair that falls to my mid back.  I have used shampoo only 2-3 times in the past few months, otherwise it&#x27;s just me &amp; Wen!  I noticed that my hair looked a bit greasy a few times when I first started using Wen, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for some time. I guess my hair/scalp has &amp;#34;gotten used to&amp;#34; my new regime.  All in all, Wen is a great product... the price is getting a little old, though.  Fortunately one bottle lasts me about a month.</li>
    <li> WEN never disappoints.  Love the new seasonal scent.  Since I&#x27;ve been using WEN conditioning cleansers, there has been a big difference In the feel and looks of my hair.  Won&#x27;t go back to other products.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use in place of second shampoo.  My hair never looked so good. No more frizz, &amp; I have bounce &amp; shine for the first time in decades.</li>
    <li> Another great product put out by Chaz. I only wash my hair using shampoo once a week and use WEN  in between. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the buildup on my scalp that&#x27;s why I wash once a week. Otherwise  great product. My hair is soft and looks more healthy than it ever has.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t use this shampoo but my wife does and she loves it. She says \\&quot;it makes my hair soft and smooth\\&quot; Get this for that special someone guys, she will thank you!!</li>
    <li> This shipped really fast.. Didnt come with a pump tho which sucks but o well ill just wait for my other wen to come in the mail!! hope it works good for me i bought 3 sents this one, mango coconut and  fig. cant wait to try them all.. hope at least one comes with a pump tho haha :)</li>
    <li> Waste my money.Make my hair grezy. Good like shaving cream. I was hoping it would work for me but i cant stand the look of dirty hair</li>
    <li> The winter vanilla mint leaves your hair feeling cool and minty&lt;br /&gt;Great on a hot summer day. Very refreshing .I use it all year round.</li>
    <li> Was awful.  My hair looked &amp; felt dirty. Guess if you already have good hair don&#x27;t use. I followed direction.  Not good. Back to Redkin.</li>
    <li> I like Wen very much and for me this scent is the best.  Unlike others I smell predominately vanilla and don&#x27;t think it smells at all like a peppermint patty.  I have tried most of the Wen cleansing conditioners and have not experienced hair loss, burning itchy scalp, or greasy hair.  I have fine, short, naturally curly, dyed hair and all the Wen I&#x27;ve tried works well with my hair.  This is my favorite scent.  I do not use as many pumps as recommended and add water as directed to,spread it through my hair.  I leave it on while I shower, rinse, and style my hair as usual. Everyone has their preference of hair products and scents.  I don&#x27;t find that the scent interferes with my body lotion and/or perfume.</li>
    <li> I uses WEN products because they work for my hair.  I love the smell of the winter mint but that is about it.  After using it a few times I noticed my scalp itching and becoming dry.  I went back to my other WEN scents that work better for my hair.</li>
    <li> This WEN fragrance is very nice...wish they had more like this.  I stopped buying WEN from Guthy Renker because I hate the subscription payment and they don&#x27;t list a number to call and pain to cancel the account, which I had to to twice and still they sent and billed me. Anyway, that&#x27;s why I started buying WEN from Amazon.  My husband works outdoors and his hair gets fried from the elements and the WEN really makes a difference in his hair.  It&#x27;s really noticeable when his hair gets a little longer...told him he was starting to look like Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future and bought him some WEN!! LOL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude yeah so what I too want to have good looking hair!!!! Anyways I&#x27;ve always wanted to try this product and see if it would work for my scalp issues. Such as dandruff! First i really like the way it smells and the texture of the product. I know its not a dandruff shampoo and stuff like that but just to give it a try. I would recommend to watch the tutorial video first! before using this product, just search it up on the Internet. It will show you step by step in how to apply this product it really helps! The first day I used it I really noticed the difference in the way my hair felt and my scalp feeling  refreshed and clean without having to feel the bubblyness usually shampoos have!! Also my hair grew a lot faster than usual and I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks. I really thought this product would put my scalp at ease but it didn&#x27;t :(. My scalp well my dandruff wouldn&#x27;t go away and my scalp felt more eachy. Maybe next time I should get the tea trea mint cleansing moisturizer Wen has. I haven&#x27;t used the other moisturizers Wen has to offer!! But I do like this product. The price yes it&#x27;s pricey but hey just give it try! I know now that this particular moisturizer may have not be the right one for me, but I let my sister give a try! She has very thick long hair. She does not have dandruff lucky her!! She ended falling in love with the product. Her hear looked healthier! Softer and she too liked the way it smelled. So it does show that Wen really works!! I will be buying more of the Wen products next time the right one. Hope this rate kind of helped :)</li>
    <li> I Love this. My hair looks great with no blow drying, and smells good too!  I wish he would come out with more minty scents!</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is a complete necessity. A must have! This formula smells great and is super hydrating. Best Wen sent in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Tea Tree and Mango version of this product.  While mango is still my favorite, this one is quite nice.  I have very curly and frizzy hair.  It gets unruly as soon as their is a bit of moisture in the air.  Wen tames it better than anything I have tried, especially if a use a dime-size at the end as a leave in conditioner.  It is not sticky nor does it have the silicon feel that I do not like.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it.  Winter vanilla mint is perfect for my fine, straight, color treated hair.  My husband loves it, too!&lt;br /&gt;After a few washes, I use my other favorite, Pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner.  Alternating eliminates product build up and makes my hair feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews of Wen Cleansing Conditioner I gave it a try and ordered a bottle. I was really hoping that my hair would be transformed! But, I have to say that after using it for over a month now I am not really all that impressed. The vanilla mint that I bought is WAY too minty! Not good when its wintertime and you are already cold. I think it would be better in the summertime. So, I have tried to use the product exactly as it says on the bottle and its OKAY. Just OKAY, nothing great! I think I will be going back to a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner...No my hair did not fall out but my hair was not transformed! BTW, I color my hair and it tends to be dry and it&#x27;s LONG! This may work great for some hair types but not really for mine.....</li>
    <li> I love Wen, it makes my hair look healthier and more manageable.  I use it pretty regularly.  This was the first time to try the Winter Vanilla Mint, it smells lightly like thin mint cookies.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Absolute favorite smell and cleanse. Love love love love! No matter what the season.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the Wen Cleansing Conditioners. It is very gentle yet it cleans and conditions my hair the best. The vanilla mint smells wonderful and to me it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t a temporary or seasonal scent, it&#x27;s my favorite.  It has a very clean and minty smell.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is great, I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft. It smells great. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. Love the smell, too. Worth the price. I would recommend for anyone who wants shiny,  manageable hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite WEN product. It is my understanding that it was a seasonal product. It would be great if this was added to the regularly available list.</li>
    <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  I am disappointed in it&#x27;s quality.  I thought all chaz dean products were alcohol free but the label on this one has alcohol listed in it&#x27;s top ingredients.  I have very frizzy curly hair and alcohol is drying to hair.  The scent is very nice and it makes you scalp tingle from the menthol but it does not live up to its hype.</li>
    <li> All of the WEN Cleansing Conditioners are wonderful, however some of them don&#x27;t smell very well. The Fig is particularly bad. The special versions he puts out seasonly are a delight to the nose and this is one of the best. I have very thin fine hair and the WEN products make it very limp so I have to use lots and lots of products on my hair to get it to do anything. It is so healthy for hair I just have to use it. Most people don&#x27;t have this problem so if you have the typical wavy, curly, thick , uncontrollable hair that the majority of folks have, make the investement.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell.  The product is really great, BUT with my fine hair I cannot use this product daily or my hair looks greasy.  I found that using the product as a creme rinse or leave-in-conditioner works great for me.</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite Wen Conditioner. I have tried most of them and this one works best for me. I was very happy to find it since it is one the seasonal blends.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Great scent</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair wash. I really like the smell of the mint and chocolate. It is the best winter smell yet.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this.  I liked the way this cleansing conditioner removed all the build up on my hair and made it nice and shiny.  I did end up getting more from the company.  I am however going to cancel my membership as it was way more expensive than I thought.  It works really well but I can get the same results from a no sulfates, organic shampoo that I can get at Walgreens.  If you really want this though getting it on here is the best way.  Most cost effective, most of the time.</li>
    <li> My daughter was so excited to try this conditioner.  She used it once and had a rash from the tree nut oil.  Obviously, she is highly sensitive.  So, now I am using it and it works well.</li>
    <li> I read the pros and cons on this product and basically you just have to do some experiment to what is right for using this on your hair. When I used it for the first time my hair was shiny and soft it was awesome, I didn&#x27;t even have any tangles I just combed right through my hair. I plan on buying more of Chaz Dean&#x27;s products in the future.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and is the best shampoo for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> Love using this stuff.  It&#x27;s better than shampoo and conditioner.  Everyone in my house uses it. All of our hair is healthy and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Sent is great, gives the scalp a nice tingle.</li>
    <li> I work out every morning and this shampoo/conditioner combo is so gentle on my hair, that now I can wash it everyday and it looks and feels great.  Plus is has a added benefit of making my hair healthier and with the mint it gives my scalp a nice cool sensation and wonderful scent. I wish I would have purchased it years ago.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start this off by saying I have used Wen since April of this year.&lt;br /&gt;I used some of a friend&#x27;s I was visiting who had taken the plunge (with the price, it&#x27;s definitely a plunge), and had loved it so she let me try some. I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, it has alot of Silicone type products, so it feels as though your hair is coated in wax, but it&#x27;s cleaner than you&#x27;ll ever have it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it how it&#x27;s directed, but I still get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is roughly shoulder length. I use 4-5 pumps to begin, use a little water to spread a little more, finger comb, let sit a couple minutes while cleaning other anatomy, then repeat with 3-4 pumps. It lasts roughly a month or more.&lt;br /&gt;This wen does have Phenylalanine, which I&#x27;m not entirely sure why other than maybe with all those extracts and the menthol (which after a couple hours of being out in the heat during the summer, feels absolutely amazing....), it&#x27;s necessary? No Aspertame as noted by another person who gave it a try. Unless your genetic structure has issue with Phenylalanine, you really shouldn&#x27;t have an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using anything else, the price is worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing sulfate free cuts it anymore. I tried using the L&#x27;Oreal brand of sulfate free that I was using previously. My hair was a disaster after one rinse, so much hair broke... This some really great stuff.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the vanilla mint.  I have other wen products that I like better.  the Sweet almond and the pomergranite are my favorites.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars if the pump actually worked.  Everything else was perfect and would most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great smellll...price is high though</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift as my mom, and regret it, it was a waste of money, on account it hadn&#x27;t had treated her hair well. Then it slowly progressed to making it extreme thin, and she began to claim small bald spots began to appear. Nothing really noticeable, but it hadn&#x27;t been doing what expected. I don&#x27;t know if I feel worse for giving my mom this horrible present or wasting 50 dollars. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> great new  product--&lt;br /&gt;bought it  tried  it  love  it&lt;br /&gt;different  because it does not  suds  but  got  my hair  nice and clean  first use--&lt;br /&gt;would  recommend  and will buy again</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> Received on time. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love wen, especially this scent!  I used to need to leave conditioner in my hair, add &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; later and flat iron.  Now I wash, let dry and flat iron just a bit!</li>
    <li> Over priced.  But great sent.  Not happy at the raised pricing and won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better, felt better and I have no split ends.  I&#x27;m not sure if the no split ends is from being gluten free or from the Wen but either way it&#x27;s wonderful.  I love the smell.  This one and the ginger pumpkin are my favorite smells.  :)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product (the review is for the Winter Vanilla Mint scent), but it ended up not working out for me.  I remember the 1980s and all those combination shampoo/conditioner products -- they didn&#x27;t really work very well at either job.  I&#x27;d hoped such products would have improved over the past 20 or 30 years, but unfortunately, this cleansing conditioner is still not what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have straight, waist-length, color-treated hair.  It&#x27;s pretty dry and I do have to wash my hair every day (I work out and get a lot of sweat in my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have such long hair, it&#x27;s recommended that I use 20-30 pumps of this product.  That&#x27;s something like 2 ounces, which would mean I only got 8 uses out of a 16 ounce bottle if I went with the recommended amount.  At almost sixty dollars, that&#x27;s not a great value, in my opinion.  But, I bought the stuff and wanted to give it a chance, so I started pumping it out into my hand.  My palm was completely full after 15 pumps (I have small hands) so I decided to stop at that point.  I have a lot of experience using different hair products and I have *never* used this much of a hair product in all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the 15 pumps&#x27; worth into my hair and worked it through.  It was quite easy to work through (I used a detangling brush since I don&#x27;t have the WEN comb) and it coated my hair nicely and made my hair feel good.  I scrubbed at my scalp for awhile, as recommended.  I waited the recommended amount of time, then rinsed it out.  I did not use any additional treatment products.  I did not lose any extra hair in the shower; in fact, I may have lost less hair than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my hair was frizzy and puffy but also felt oddly weighed down (and not particularly clean).  I went back to my regular shampoo and decided to use this only as a leave-in conditioner.  On another occasion, I pumped out 2 pumps and distributed it through the length and ends of my hair.  Again, my hair felt nice.  This was a very good detangling aid.  I let my hair air dry as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, it&#x27;s not even humid outside, and my hair -- while soft -- is a frizzy mess.  So I think this is not going to work as a leave-in conditioner for me, either.  (By the way, this does smell very nice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be a great product for some people.  It smells great and is a great detangling aid; it is also very easy to distribute throughout my hair.  It does not cause my hair to come out as some people have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, considering my long hair -- which requires using extra product -- and hair type (color-treated and prone to frizz), this does not seem to be a good product for my own personal situation.  I have no doubt that it works for some people, but it is not for me, either as a cleansing agent or a conditioner.Again, my hair felt nice.  This was a very good detangling aid.

    <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel, and smell, would buy this again!!&lt;br /&gt;This is my fav scent of all time</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love this product. I have tried all of them and stick to Lavendar and   Fig but this one is a bonus!</li>
    <li> Best cleansing conditioner ever, used it for a long time. Expensive but last a long time, always hard to get the last out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice.  It stay with your hair  the next day you can still smell it.  I lije it and would but this one again.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo for drier, colored hair. Hair is soft and easy to style. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Best s*** ever I love this scent please don&#x27;t ever stop making winter vanilla mint I&#x27;ll be buying more soon</li>
    <li> filled with all kinds of junk...I use only dr bronners and an apple cider rinse now.  my hair has never been better in 30 years..and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! Did a great job at moisturizing my hair, and it came out shiny and silky. But I had more shedding with this than with the \\&quot;Summer Mango Coconut\\&quot;, but I also washed my hair a lot more than usual, just because of my daily activities, not because it made my hair oily. *I have relaxed shoulder length hair that doesn&#x27;t like a bunch of manipulation*</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite Wen blend! It works fabulously on my hair and smells like Girl Scout Thin Mints. I love using it in the winter. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey!</li>
    <li> I will say I was skeptical for many years on just how good WEN could possibly be, then Chaz came out with Winter Vanilla Mint and I had to try it. I am a lather girl but after several washings I no longer miss the lather. I use WVM as a second wash(I know it is not the conventional method)I first use Organix Moroccan Shampoo for my first wash, then rinse and apply WVM to my hair (which is med. shoulder length, fine and straight)I apply 3-4 pumps on each temple,at my ears and from my ears to bottom of my hair which converts to about 16 pumps total...I then add water to my head with the WEN and rub it thru my hair throughly. It sounds like a lot when I first read the instructions but it isn&#x27;t as much as it sounds. A 16 oz. bottle lasts me about 3 months using my method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then leave WEN in while I finish my shower from 3-5 minutes and rinse WEN out, wrap in a towel while I apply my make-up... then put a small amount of Macadamia Nut Oil or Moroccan Oil from my ears to the bottom of my hair(dime size amount) and blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used WVM(WEN) for 10 months before leaving this review. I am shocked at how much thicker my hair is. I no longer have breakage, my hair loss is very small and area&#x27;s where I was having breakage have now stop breaking and filled in. I have more hair on my head than I have ever had...it is very noticable enough that my husband has commented on it and wondered if it would help him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is awesome...like a Peppermint Patty. Hope Chaz keeps this in his line or I may lead a revolution and spam him until he relents and keeps this in his line-up! :)</li>
    <li> Since I used Wen a few months ago I haven&#x27;t used shampoo. I take my Wen to the beauty shop. My hair dresser said a lot of women bring their Wen  in with them.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite Wen scent. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on how great my hair looks, feels and smells.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells sooooo Heavenly &amp; WEN IS THE BEST!! My daughter &amp; I both love this ones fragrance &amp; its EVERYTHING WEN claims!! Thank You Wen &amp; Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with this product. There is no noticeable change or improvement in my hair since using.</li>
    <li> I love the wen line and it really works for my hair type I love how soft my hair is after and I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day a really plus and I love the smell of his products</li>
    <li> I have tried most of the WEN line of products. After using the Winter Vanilla Mint the first time I knew this was the perfect one for me. The scent is delicious, not over powering. The product leaves my coarse, wiry, frizzy, white hair smooth, tamed down, soft and easy to manage. If you are new to WEN follow the directions and  you will not be disappointed. I rinse out the product with water as cool as can be tolerated then wrap a towel around my head as soon as I step out of the shower, leaving it on as long as possible. By the time I take it off my hair is almost dry so that running a comb through it is about all that needs to be done. It leaves my hair in soft waves instead of uncontrolled frizzy, wiry waves. If this product had been available to me 50 years ago I would never have used shampoo on my hair. When people ask what I use I let them know WEN and where they can purchase it. WEN is the only product needed although there are some styling aids available if you desire.</li>
    <li> This scent is really great..still minty, but more vanilla and a really sweet combination.  I wish they sold it year round! One thing to mention though, if you have really fine hair (I do..) that needs washed every day or it will get oily, you might want to alternate this one with the cucumber aloe every other day.  The cucumber aloe is a little lighter and my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast when I use it.  Still wouldn&#x27;t be willing to give this one up though...love it!</li>
    <li> The one star is for the smell ONLY.  Wow, smells JUST like a Junior Mint! The bad review though I&#x27;m about to write is for everything else! (1) WEN weighs down the hair SO bad because of all the silicone in it (look at the ingredients and you will see all of them that end in &#x27;ane&#x27; or &#x27;one&#x27;). (2) I had to wash my hair every single day in order for it NOT to look weighed down. (3) My hair is color treated and my colorist even said that my hair has completely changed and wouldn&#x27;t take color as well as before.  If you have hair you wash ever single day, then this may be for you.</li>
    <li> This product did not come with a pump! So how can you use it without one! Make sure before you order it comes with one</li>
    <li> my  mom  brought  me  this  3 monthes  ago.  dont  like  the  way  it  drys  my  hair. iam  staying  with  the mango  one  because  it  smells  like mangos  and  my hair  stays  in  places.  and  it drys  alot  faster,  plus  i  can  use  it  like  shaving  cream.  i will  tell  you  do  not  buy  this  one  no  smell  to  it  goes  aways  real  quick  ikt  does  not  last.  the  only  2  is  the  mango,  and  sweet  almond  say  those  2  are  real  good.  plus  number  is  the  pumpin  for  the  month  of  october.  i  say  the  number  one  i  love  the  mango  is  the  best  one  out  there.  i  tryed  but  mango  is  the  number  one  #  2  is  sweet  almond,  #  3  is  the pumpkin  those  are  my  choice.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for 3.5 years, I will never go back to regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very manageable. Vanilla Winter Mint is one of my favorite Wen products.</li>
    <li> Really works on both straight and thin and thick and curly.  Plus it smells good.  Its an awesome product. :)</li>
    <li> Love love the Wen Products.  Save tons of money not having to do separate shampoo, conditioner and styling gels.  My hair has never looked better, softer, fuller, color is beautiful and if I have to color grey, it stays longer, doesn&#x27;t wash out.  Winter Mint is my favorite flavor.  Hard to come by, only available winter - who knows if it will ever come back again.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell. The conditioner is very thick. I have very very thin hair so when I use it per the directions every time no matter how long I rinse when I blow dry my hair it looks greasy. I really like the way the stuff smells and feels on my hair however it just makes it look greasy. Perhaps it just depends on the hair type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2 months now and wanted to be sure I gave the product enough time for me to decide if I liked it or not. After two months of using only WEN my hair feels much better, softer and healthier. I have mixed hair...my hair is fine and curly but I have a lot of it.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I don&#x27;t use as many products to control the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; after straightening.</li>
    <li> This Wen is delish!  The smell is soooooooo good, like Christmas &amp; candy canes &amp; sugar cookies all rolled up in to one.  The mint makes it a little tingly on the scalp, so if you don&#x27;t like that feeling, this Wen is not for you.  The only complaint I have with this product, and all Wen products in general, is the amount they tell you to use on the instructions.  Really, Chaz Dean...REALLY? If you used the directed amount of pumps of this product every time you cleanse your hair, you&#x27;d run out in a week.  (I guess that&#x27;s their marketing strategy, eh?)  Anyway, I have shoulder-length medium fine hair, &amp; I use about 6 pumps total, which is PLENTY to fully saturate all my hair.  The bottle lasted me just over a month, &amp; I washed my hair nearly every day.  I am now on my second bottle of Wen, the almond mint variety, &amp; I don&#x27;t like it as much as I liked the Winter Vanilla Mint scent.  I will order a different scent on my next bottle.    I also wanted to add that you really have to get in there &amp; SCRUB your scalp with your fingers.  Give it some real effort. If your hair feels greasy after washing with this product, you might need to use MORE product, not less.  I know that sounds counter-indicative...but that&#x27;s how it works. I used more product at first &amp; then was able to start using less as I figured out how my hair adjusted to it.</li>
    <li> Hair type: Fine strands but a LOT of it.&lt;br /&gt;Length: Very Long -middle of back.&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Slightly wavy with a tendency to frizz due to blonde chemical processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was more than pleased when I received Wen. I have heard people rave about it, but was a bit skeptical as to how it would be able to cleanse my hair AND not leave it greasy. I was pleasantly and completely surprised. Since I started using Wen, I have yet to notice any grease or build-up. My apartment complex also has hard water, so my chemically bleached hair often gets brassy and has a copper look to it, however, with Wen I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading or discoloration of my hair. The smell of the Winter Vanilla Mint is amazing and I have gotten so many compliments on how good my hair smells when I walk into a room. Also, my friends have noticed a change in the shine of my hair. Previously, when I washed and conditioned with normal shampoo, I would notice globs of hair coming out in the shower. That has almost completely stopped since I started using Wen. I&#x27;m addicted for life and can honestly say I won&#x27;t be using any other products for the rest of my hair&#x27;s life! I just ordered the SIXTHIRTEEN and can&#x27;t wait to see how that compares. Chaz Dean is a genius!!!</li>
    <li> Met and exceeded my expectations! Love the scent and as with all Wen products, love their results! Totally recommended buy this!</li>
    <li> Not one of my favorite wen conditioners. I have 3c natural hair and its not as moisturizing as I thought it would be. It actually leaves a film on my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and honey simmer peach is my fave.</li>
    <li> Good sh!t.  Girlfriend was super happy</li>
    <li> After being subjected to the infommercials for years (yes, I changed the channel), I decided to try Wen - buying it from Amazon. I did NOT want to start monthly shipments of a pricey product that I didn&#x27;t know if I would like. I had read reviews on Amazon, on Wen&#x27;s website, etc. . . The reviews are all over the place - which make sense - everyone is different. I have always had baby fine, snarly hair, and have required shampoo and a separate conditioner daily for as long as I have been washing my own hair. A long time, folks! Some of the reviews saying it made their hair greasy worried me. As a teenager, my hair was oily. As an adult, it was more the fact that it was so fine and fly away - I couldn&#x27;t go two days without it looking flat. My hair is also naturally wavy - especially if cut in layers. When I wore it relatively long - parted in the middle, all one length - the weight of it made it look straight. Back to the product and its bizarre (to me) instructions for use. In the shower, I rinse my hair with water. Comfortable, warm to hot water. Then I put a bit of wen in my hands and work it through from roots to end. My hair is relatively short now, and I used it as I would with a conditioner. I do NOT use anywhere near as much as the instructions say is required. I just leave it alone as I continue my shower, but I do keep my head out of the water. At some point I use a wide tooth comb through it, which is something that I always did with my conditioner before. I rinse it out - again with water that is comfortable for me - warm to hot, just before getting out. Yes, no lather is odd - but as with a conditioner, you can feel when the wen has been rinsed out. I don&#x27;t add any more as a leave in, and I don&#x27;t need any more products. I towel dry, comb through and allow my hair to dry naturally. I have been using it every other day, and simply rinsing my hair in the shower the second day. In two months, I still have more than 1/2 bottle. In this time I shampooed and conditioned with my old product once. Never again. It felt parched and I couldn&#x27;t get a comb through the snarls in the shower. Wen is working for me. Next up will be L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s similar products which I just purchased from Amazon.itioned with my old product once. Never again.

    <li> Great Product.  My daughter loves Winter Mint Vanilla and was so surprised because it has been discontinued.  She was one happy girl!</li>
    <li> I love Wen to begin with, this is the first time I have tried this particular scent, but I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Why isn&#x27;t this available all the time?  I can&#x27;t get over how amazing the smell is!  Part of me wants to use it all the time and the other doesn&#x27;t want to use it all up.</li>
    <li> I LOVE WEN! I started using it about three years ago. It&#x27;s now the only hair product I use. I&#x27;ve pretty much used all the various formulas of WEN--my favorite is Sweet Almond Mint--as I like the way my hair responds to the variety. Winter Vanilla Mint is my second favorite and is another of the formulas that is appropriate for all hair types.  And it smells oh so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using WEN, I noticed an immediate difference. My hair was softer, and less dry. As I continued to use it, I noticed that my hair got softer and felt more moisturized. Now, after three years of use, my curls are springy, non-frizzy, and soft. I am bi-racial, although I have what you would probably call \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair. Typically, daily washing makes my hair feel dry and course. With WEN I can wash my hair as often as I like--as a matter of fact, the more I wash it the better it feels. My routine is to wash my hair every two or three days (I wear my hair natural; It&#x27;s soft, but has really tight \\&quot;kinky\\&quot; curls, and is very thick.) On the days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just wet it and apply a little WEN as a leave in conditioner before combing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! It&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;ve saved so much money on other hair products--WEN Cleansing Conditioner replaces shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, detangler, leave-in conditioner, and even shaving cream--that from a financial perspective it&#x27;s pretty much worked out to be even, if not cheaper! Furthermore, it makes my hair feel so fantastic! I used to hate my hair, and have done all manner of things to it in the past; relaxing, curling, braiding, you name it. Now I just wash and go! There&#x27;s nothing like WEN! I love it and would highly recommend it! FYI Wen is appropriate for children too; although the recommended formula for that purpose is Sweet Almond Mint, as it is the mildest. Furthermore, WEN now also has a children&#x27;s like...WEN Kids, which includes three different scents; Strawberry Banana, Watermelon, and Green Apple.</li>
    <li> I was always curious about WEN and how it gave Chaz&#x27;s models such great results. So, I decided to try it. I bought the Winter Vanilla Mint in December 2011 from QVC and regretted it ever since. I loss SO MUCH hair it wasn&#x27;t funny (bald spots along the forehead/temporal areas and about 2-3 inches in length)! I noticed the hair loss immediately after washing my hair. It took well over a year just to grow back the hair I loss. However, I did read in one of QVC&#x27;s reviews about another WEN Product (Fig Cleansing Conditioner) that the writer suffered \\&quot;mild hair loss\\&quot; as well. I thought that since I bought the Vanilla Mint I would not have that problem. I thought wrong. The only explanation I could find from WEN is that I could be allergic to some of the ingredients in the shampoo. Also, that the hair I loss was not from the cleansing conditioner and just a part of normal hair shedding. All I can say is pay close attention to reviews and think before you buy.</li>
    <li> I finally did it and paid up for some Wen.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good. This Winter Vanilla Mint smells like a chocolate-mint head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty strong for the first day, especially while it is wet - Usually don&#x27;t blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium fine and Medium thickness and brunette with grey.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my hair completely not frizzy every time. But, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> It smells incredible and leaves my hair feeling great.  I definitely recommend it!  I&#x27;m new to Chaz&#x27;s products and will buy more.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and it makes my hair feel great too! I will definitely continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> Lot of hair loss with this product, used it one year ago, it does leave hair shiny but I lost a lot of hair while using it.</li>
    <li> My hair has been transformed by this product, it&#x27;s long and not frizzy. Feels really good when massaged into scalp.</li>
    <li> Great scent for a wonderful Wen product!</li>
    <li> The pump does not work, and the bottle is nearly impossible to squeeze, and the product is too thick to pour out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Despite these annoyances, I love the way my hair feels and looks. I have fine, thin hair, a sensitive dry scalp, and I hate to use styling products. Not only does this stuff work well for me, I find that I wash my hair less, because it seems to attract less dirt than before. My scalp does not secrete as much oil, because it is not being dried out by shampoo everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my hair is healthier, stronger, and prettier. I just ordered another bottle. If the pump works, I will upgrade this review to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Just fix the bottle, Wen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: so, I just received my bottle of wen pumpkin spice and I love it! The scent is very strong in the shower, but is subtle on dry hair. My hair looks better than ever and best of all, the pump works!&lt;br /&gt;Buyer&#x27;s tip: it seems the off- season scents are much, much cheaper than the other varieties. I recommend trying an off-season scent to a new user who is leery of trying such a pricy product with such wide-ranging reviews. Wen clearly isn&#x27;t for everyone, but I certainly love it! Upgrading to five stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I almost forgot to mention... I use about half the amount recommended with great results.</li>
    <li> I love this Wen Cleansing conditioner!!  I feel like it works better than any of the others I have tried!  I just wish it would be a regular product and not a seasonal item.  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not tried any WEN products... this would be a great place to start.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the thriftiest person and I don&#x27;t mind spending a bit of extra money to spoil my hair, so I figured trying Wen wouldn&#x27;t be so bad. It arrived promptly on time and smelled fantastic right off the bat. So naturally i was eager to try my new product out. This is wash two and I&#x27;m more than mildly dissatisfied. My hair after the first lashing wasn&#x27;t rich and soft, it started feeling dry and a little coarse. Now at the second washing, my hair that I could once finger comb and be done with for the ay needed a sty in conditioner and to use a good amount before my hair started to cooperate. I&#x27;m returning this immediately, I am sad to say.</li>
    <li> makes my Jewish frizzy hair very supple and moisturized.  I&#x27;ll never buy another hair product.  I&#x27;ve tried super expensive kinds and truly this one is the best.  I don&#x27;t have to use any products besides de-tangler (when I&#x27;m day twoing/threeing)  I totally recommend this to anyone with coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SCENT. IT SMELLS LIKE MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP ICE CREAM. hAIR IS SOFT. A COMB WILL GO RIGHT THRU UR HAIR</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  My hair is really clean and easy to brush out now.  I have Fine long hair that tends to knot with other shampoos.  You do have to get use to the idea that it doesn&#x27;t suds, but the results are amazing.  This is one of my favorite scents.  I also like the almond mint.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but it dries my hair out much more than fig or pumpkin spice.  (I&#x27;m a brunette and have been using WEN for a long time.)  I like sweet almond mint in the summertime because it does reduce the oil but winter time I need moisture.  I love pumpkin, bring it back, WEN!)</li>
    <li> I thought this product was a bit expensive, but it really did a great job on my hair.  If you follow the directions on the label carefully, you&#x27;ll have very good results.  My hair was very dry and it is much better now. It&#x27;s a bit awkward if you&#x27;re washing your hair in the shower because the product has to stay in the hair for a few minutes before rinsing.  Otherwise, I definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;m not sure I want that smell in my hair all the time. It works well, though. And it is good for hair growth, as you are not stripping the hair but keeping it clean and conditioned.</li>
    <li> Best Conditioner shampoo I been using Wen for 5 years and will never go back to shampoo, I have no more split ends and my hair is fuller with lots of volume and bounce, I LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Wen products even though expensive.  The only products that leave my hair soft and smooth and smelling great.  I especially love this Winter Vanilla Mint Cleansing Conditioner.  It is thick and rich and has the best smell of all their products.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen before and have always liked it. But this new Winter Vanilla Mint is amazing. Love the scent better than the almond mint one.</li>
    <li> works great for the hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different types of Wen and this one is my favorite.  I will be ordering more of this.</li>
    <li> OMG this is a wonderful product.  The smell is awesome and the tingling that you feel on your scalp is amazing.  I purchase it every year.  Its only available during Christmas time so you must bye more than one!!</li>
    <li> Smells like the Andes mints with the green on the outside and chocolate in the middle. I&#x27;m a guy with pretty short hair, I only use a pump or two each wash.</li>
    <li> I usually love Wen products, but this particular one didn&#x27;t work well for my thick, curly dry hair. The smell was good, it smells like chocolate covered mints.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Works ok smells great. Will not repurchase. Too expensive</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, minty without being an assault on your senses. Wen works great. I have long, fine, wavy hair that tends to look very dry when I use regular shampoo. Using WEN regularly eliminated the &#x27;straw look&#x27; and friziness. Hint - work a drop or two into your hands after towel drying to tame any fly aways or splits ends.</li>
    <li> I only paid $37 when I got it but i see the price increased, its honestly up to you its one of those products that you have to try yourself, it may not work but then again it might, if you have the money to try it I would say try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I first ordered this product my hair was damaged really badly and it did not work, but now its been almost a year and&lt;br /&gt;I have not dyed my hair so its so much better so i decided to try it, and it works wonderful my hair is so soft and has so much body to it, I had  curly hair when I was little and they so how faded to just hardly wavy, well now they are starting to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not like it to use just on its own use it as a leave in conditioner i did that for a while and my hair smelled great and felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so afraid it was going to work when i decided to use it a few nights ago because i had so much hair spray in my hair, but when my hair dried it was so soft and you couldn&#x27;t tell i had all that hair spray in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not make my hair greasy i wash my hair every other day, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy fast.</li>
    <li> Love love love this Wen!!  BEST scent, works perfect on my hair.  I&#x27;d use this all year around.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all, sent it back</li>
    <li> Hair is soft and frizz free the smell is lovely but its not to be used everyday.I use it maybe once or twice a week.It makes my hair oily if I use it to much.</li>
    <li> same great wen, great smell. I love it. smells kind of sweet (vanilla) and kind of fresh (mint). would recommend .</li>
    <li> Wen Cleansing Conditioner in Winter Vanilla Mint, Gardenia and Cucumber Mint are my favorite ones. They are gentle and wonderful for my hair and body. I live in a dry desert area and WEN protects from itchy dry skin and fly away hair.I finally have the beautiful hair I always wanted. Thanks Chaz, our whole family loves you and your products.</li>
    <li> I love WEN cleansing conditioner.  My only complaint is that this scent is only offered at the holidays, and I heard a rumor that it may be discontinued.  I hope not.  This stuff works great on my short fine hair and my daughters thick long hair, so I would recommend you try it on all hair types.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for myself but gave it to my niece instead. She adores it. It doesn&#x27;t strip all the moisture out of our hair. Fierce multi-purpose hair care product. It can be used as a cleanser, conditioner, deep conditioner, leave in, detangler. It literally is 6 products in one bottle.  You definitely can afford to cleanse your hair on a daily basis if you desire especially if you have natural black/ethnic hair textures like ourselves.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL SCENT ON THIS ONE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Same great results as the sweet alomond mint. This is a nice change. Heavenly sent!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> The first time I smelled this winter vanilla mint, it immediately reminded me of the thin mint girl scout cookies! It&#x27;s a pleasant mint scent along with the vanilla. Nice &amp; creamy consistency. I&#x27;m a wen girl, love all of their products!</li>
    <li> Wen&#x27;s winter vanilla is my favorite cleansing conditioner ! I love the scent and my hair feels so  soft and healthy . Love it !!!</li>
    <li> No results, not worth the price</li>
    <li> Brilliant. Amazing smell. Stop thinking just buy it.</li>
    <li> It seems like people are having different reactions to Wen Winter Vanilla. First of all, on a positive note the fragrance is freaking awesome. The best Wen smelling product. On the down side, my scalp was burning and itching like crazy. It felt good in the shower- cool and minty on my scalp. But afterwards I noticed itching. I figured maybe it was just me so I tried it for three washes. Each time was progressively worse, until the third wash where my scalp was burning and my hair looked and felt like straw. This stuff seems super drying. By the third use, my hair was falling out quite noticeably - hair was everywhere. I absolutely love the smell so it is really too bad! If you like burning, itchy scalp, hair loss, and fried hair, then Wen Winter Vanilla Mint is for you!</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for several weeks.  I am close to giving up on it.  The hair loss I have experienced is ridiculous.  I lose a handful of hair every time I wash my hair.  It came out in a big chunk one time. I will never buy it again. My hair is getting thinner every time I use it. I have thin hair anyway, &amp; can&#x27;t afford to lose any more than I  lose naturally.  The only thing good about it is that it does make my hair look &amp; feel nice. I can get that from other shampoos that I have used.</li>
    <li> Hair is sooo soft and less frizzy. I leave it on for my whole shower and rinse out( but not completely out) just to keep it soft</li>
    <li> This is the very new product scent Wen has out this year and I am loving washing my hair with this exciting fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Both the Vanilla and Mint come forth when cleansing my hair.  I am a Wen woman and will NOT go back to the old &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; hair shampoos.  Thank You Wen!!!  And, Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen products for the last three years.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I&#x27;m pleased with my recent purchase of Vanilla Mint Cleansing Conditioner. Wen products are fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is the best product!!  I had itchy, flaky scalp and now I hardly itch or flake  and this it just after 2 weeks of use!  I am telling everyone I know about this product.</li>
    <li> I rarely write a review but must do so for this product. The positive first is it smells lovely. Other than that, I&#x27;m having a very hard time seeing any value in this product at all. The ingredients are exactly as advertised on the Wen site so I know I got the real thing. It&#x27;s like using just straight conditioner, nothing cleansing about it, so I could use any conditioner off the shelf in the grocery and get the same affect. A single pump is large in that it&#x27;s how much conditioner I would normally use. The directions call for me to use many many more as my hair is down my back past my bra strap. I can&#x27;t imagine using that much! It&#x27;s so hard to rinse out and I used maybe 3 full pumps max. The first time I used it, I even used the leave in 1/2 pump but it weighted my hair down. So the 2nd time I didn&#x27;t use the leave in. I went 2 days before I washed again and my hair was heavy and greasy looking by the 2nd day. I washed yesterday and used even less, rinsed for a long while and today I&#x27;m about to scream it&#x27;s so bad, I&#x27;m going to wash my hair in the sink with shampoo before I go out tonight! I bought this product thinking I could wash less, it&#x27;s a magnet for airborn dirt! Hate it, complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I do love the smell, but I wish it was more moisturizing since it is a winter product. Guess I&#x27;ll just hold out for the Fig..</li>
    <li> Loved this bottle of winter vanilla mint.  Hair felt great and smelled awesome!  Each scent that I have tried has given me different results.  This one was one of the good ones.</li>
    <li> works well and leaves my hair tangle free. The smell is fabulous and gets the senses going in the morning.</li>
    <li> smells throw me off some, just not as enjoyable as if it were just scented with natural scents vs. &#x27;fragrance&#x27;.  I&#x27;m going to use it along with conditioning afterwards. It was more drying than the almond mint I&#x27;ve previously tried. think I might get that next time or completely switch to another line if that also creates too much dryness. I have a lot of fine curly hair and moisture is a must to avoid breakage. overall Wen seems to do an ok job.</li>
    <li> I like the almond mint better not a bad product, would buy the other wen products, but not this particular scent.</li>
    <li> I had been using the fig formula with Wen and was expecting the same hydration in this as well. Lesson: Stick with what works for you.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Wen cleansing conditioner. It smells like mint more than vanilla but it smells great.  It made my baby fine hair feel so great, shiny, bouncy, fresh.  Just love it.  I have tried other scents but they don&#x27;t compare with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why he quit making it when so many people love it.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t afford it now because people have marked it up so much but once in a while someone will have it at a&lt;br /&gt;good price.  I buy it then :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always love Wen products, you just shouldn&#x27;t everyday because using water on your hair everyday will defeat the pursue of helping you achieve healthy hair by drying it out!</li>
    <li> Ok, you all know how i love Wen products, but this one has let me down. It&#x27;s the Winter season and should have more moisturizing properties in it, it smells heavenly, but not worth it. Buy Fig for the Winter season because it is dry this time of year and your hair needs moisture. You can buy this, and mix it with Six Thirteen for added moisture, which is what I did. I also love this scent so much that I ordered four bottles of the replenishing mist in the same scent. Smells like peppermint and chocolate. More mint than chocolate. If your hair is soft already, buy this, and enjoy the aromatherapy of it. Mix two pumps of this with distilled water in a small spray bottle and mist your hair on the days you don&#x27;t cleanse. Spray it on your dog too! Your pooch will be a walking room freshener and have a soft coat too! Enjoy, just wish there were more moisture in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Nicole, Glamour Coutre</li>
    <li> Best cleanser by Wen!!! Sad to here it will not be offered next winter season....big mistake! So good it should be a permanent fixture!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and what it does to my curly hair</li>
    <li> Works great! Leaves your scalp smelling and feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to Wen products this is my second bottle the first one I bought was the coco mango which smells wonderful.  I decided to try this one because I like the feeling of the tingle in your hair when you use shampoos with mint.  It always makes me feel like my hair is getting really clean.  I was a little worried at first that Wen wouldn&#x27;t tingle like other shampoos because it&#x27;s a cleansing conditioner but it DOES! I&#x27;m currently transiting from relaxed hair to natural and Wen works really well on my hair.  I&#x27;ve always had problems combing through my hair after shampooing but with Wen combing through my hair is pretty easy and I don&#x27;t get a whole lot of shedding.  So Wen in general is really good for African American hair from my experience.  And Vanilla Mint is a really great fragrance.  It makes your hair smell like a peppermint patty!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT! leaves my hair so full and shiny!!</li>
    <li> Like the product - It tends to leave my hair a bit greasy - Can&#x27;t use it all the time.  Really like the fragrance. I think I will try some other products before I buy it again though. A little pricey.</li>
    <li> love it ...too expensive</li>
    <li> Smells great...didn&#x27;t notice anything dramatic in the condition of my hair like the infomercials promise...Used the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells GREAT.  I use it like a leave-in conditioner, and my curls don&#x27;t get frizzy.  I don&#x27;t use any sticky gel or mousse anymore.</li>
    <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different and I&#x27;ve seen drastically varying reviews, so I hope to explain who will love this product.  I have always had good luck with WEN.  I have fine, frizzy hair, and a lot of it - and it is color treated.  I really think there would be no such thing as a product to &#x27;heavy&#x27; for my hair.  I get even better results from the Fig (designed for &#x27;ethnic&#x27; hair) - and I&#x27;m a white Irish girl, yes, my hair is that dry and frizzy.  I do use slightly less than the extreme number of pumps suggested (though I gauge it on how my hair is feeling as I am using the product, I have mid-back length hair and use anywhere from 5 to 10 pumps).  I have on occasion, left a pump or 2 in as a &#x27;leave in&#x27; after the initial wash.  I have sensitive skin, and don&#x27;t have any kind of reaction to this product, in the 3-4 scents I&#x27;ve tried.  I just had a good friend use it (who has hair very different from mine, as hers tends to be oily) and she loved it.  THIS SCENT - is wonderful, it smells like York Peppermint Patties or Junior Mints.  Sort of smells like Christmas in a way, yet doesn&#x27;t leave an overpowering scent in the hair.  I&#x27;m buying my second bottle, and bought a bottle for my friend (mentioned above).  Borrow someone else&#x27;s if you can to try, or take the plunge (I did the latter after the infomercials, where the girls had hair like mine).</li>
    <li> This is so unlike any other product I have use for my hair.  I was up late one night and was watching an infomercial.  I thought if I could find the product on Amazon I would give it a try.  Unlike the models used, my hair is not long and thick, but thin and just about above shoulder length.  I was really giving myself a bad time after I ordered it.  Who was I fooling?  But I have to say, after using this product just two times, my hair is the best it has ever been.  Sometimes you do find a winner late at night.  For me, this was one of them.</li>
    <li> I love to try the new smells from Wen, but this one takes the cake, or maybe the cookie.  I swear this smells just like the Girl Scouts Thin Mint Cookies.  It is aromatherapy at it&#x27;s finest.  :)</li>
    <li> The product is great for my hair and the smell is crisp and fresh -- perfect for the winter.</li>
    <li> I love all this product hasdone for my hair. I have course,color treated hair that has responded very well to this treatment. I leave it on over the suggested 10 to 15 minutes and feel it gives me maximum benefits. It is a bit pricey, but well worth the money. Just a note, there is an ingredient that feels a bit tingly upon application. I like the sensation it emits, but may not be as invigorating for all. Wen has other scents that may not have the same sensory effect. I have received compliments on my hair after straightening AND have a few converts where I work. Go for it.</li>
    <li> I love this products.  Not only does it work well, but it smells wonderful.  I know that it&#x27;s a limited edition, so I try to purchase is whenever I find one.</li>
    <li> Love it, might buy again.  Very strong mint fragrance.  Very effective shampoo, has gotten rid of the flakes.  Lifelong user of Wen shampoos from now on.</li>
    <li> One of my Top 2 favorite flavors!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair slick and flat. It felt dirty and dry. I&#x27;ve heard some good reviews but I guess this product just isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
    <li> I love wen hair cleansing shampoo.  I use this everyday as a detangler/volume booster and it works really well to do both.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this cleaners. It smells like an Andes Mint! For me, it leaves my hair feeling the same as when I use the other mint conditioners in the line.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It works well on black hair!</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is comparible to taking a show with a giant Andes mint candy.  The product is amazing.  I have been using Wen for the past year and my has never been healthier or shinier.  This is the only product I use--no conditions, sprays, gels, mousse.  Nothing else.  For those new to this product, you have to use it for a week or two before your hair feels right.  I almost gave up, but apparently, your hair has to get rid of all the junk you&#x27;ve putting in it and it needs to get used to the Wen.  Also, I have collar length straight find hair.  You need to only use 5 pumps---forget the 16 pumps!  That&#x27;s just crazy!</li>
    <li> this winter vanilla mint feels wonderful on the scalp and smells great as well. I recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> My fave of them all I just received this literally a hr ago and I couldnt wait to use it and it smells sooooo good like a peppermint patty I could eat it!! lol ....as always on time and packaged well</li>
    <li> I just love Wen, all formulas that I have tried, but I LOVE the Winter Vanilla Mint the best.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; as the other ones that I have tried, and the smell is FANTASTIC!  I have lots of fine hair, and it leaves it tangle free, frizz free, and smelling wonderful!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this one. Works good. Even though it makes my hair soft, I occasionally still use a really conditioner for my processed hair.</li>
    <li> those of you whom wanted to be blonde and ended up with breakage and or meltdown.&lt;br /&gt;Buy Wen and watch the improvement almost overnight.... Thank  goodness,  what a blessing.....</li>
    <li> Started losing hair. Love the smell tho!</li>
    <li> wish was not going to be a discontinued fragrance -- this fragrance is the best one so far (others tried &#x3D; spring gardeina, summer mango, tea tree, pomogranate, sweet almond mint, (kid&#x27;s) watermelon, (kid&#x27;s) green apple)</li>
    <li> Although good in theory, I think that there are some glitches that make this product not really ready for mass market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Determining how many pumps you need for your specific hair is trial and error. While you&#x27;re figuring it out, your hair looks oily with no volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The last third of the bottle doesn&#x27;t pump well. A different delivery method needs to be in place so that either a good portion of the bottle isn&#x27;t wasted and/or you don&#x27;t have to guess if you&#x27;re using the right amount because you&#x27;re squeezing it out rather than pumping it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The 1/2 now, rinse, repeat with the other half always left my hair looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that this is a product that should be sold in salons only after a consultation and trial with a professional who understands your hair and this product thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Great scent, great deal for Wen if you&#x27;re not into reordering plan on QVC (I&#x27;m not!).  I do notice more hair loss with this scent, even though I love it - it smells like melted mint chocolate chip ice cream - maybe coincidental?  Not sure...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it won&#x27;t strip your hair like regular shampoos, I also like to apply an extra conditioner after I shampoo with wen shampoo for extra soft hair.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...aka makes your hair nice and greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling to cancel the remaining shipments through their automated answering service we were told our account was canceled and we wouldn&#x27;t be charged or sent anymore product...Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next month we received another shipment and were billed again :0 So we called and cancelled again using their automated answering service. (SPOILER: their automated answer service obviously doesn&#x27;t work because we got billed again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.) and I eventually had the pleasure of speaking with \\&quot;Darius\\&quot; who informed me if I returned the product I would get a refund.  I fedex&#x27;d them back their product and mistakenly assumed I was done with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund. (Never do business with a company that refuses to EMAIL you a confirmation the account is canceled...they would only send it by mail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know they&#x27;re lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story - Useless product, even worse customer service, it&#x27;s basically a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake we did...don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
    <li> love the product and the clean sent.</li>
    <li> like the product.  but a little pricey for the amount  compared to wns other 16 oz products.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair nice and shiny!!</li>
    <li> I gave it a a gift &amp; while I enjoyed giving ut she hasn&#x27;t told me if she likes it or not.&lt;br /&gt;But I tried it a few times and it really revitalized my hair. Speedy delivery &amp; good packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a nice scent for the winter season. I usually use the WEN six thirteen or the summer coconut mango, so I thought I would try something new. It smells like a piece of candy, like a vanilla filled chocolate truffle! Very christmas like! It tingles like the six thirteen, which you may or may not like. I actually like it, it wakes my scalp up! Overall this is a good product and makes my hair feel very soft!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used WEN before, give it a chance. I hated it the first time I used it (it was the sweet almond mint) and it dried my hair out. But once you find the right WEN for you, you will never want to use shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Not what I hoped for flat hair and rinsed multiple times</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! And this scent smells SOOOO good! Just make sure to rinse COMPLETELY and it&#x27;s perfect!!!!!  I wish they had this available all year round</li>
    <li> My hair was definitely softer after the first use. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the mixture of vanilla and mint scent but is was actually a very nice blend.</li>
    <li> I tried this for a couple of months and I actually loved it! I&#x27;ll buy my next Wen from amazon again! Although I can say that it&#x27;s not for all hair types. My hair is permed and dyed, so this product is great for my hair. On the other hand I asked my sister to try this and she has oily hair, it actually weighted her hair down and it also made her hair look greasy. So I definitely recommend this to people who have course, dry, damaged, stressed-out, curly, and wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Great for long, thick hair.  It&#x27;s the best my hair has behaved in years!  No frizzes and so soft :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like washing your hair with thin mint cookies from the Girl Scouts.  I love this shampoo, and hoard bottles and bottles of it. It is totally refreshing after working out, yet also comforting on a cold winter&#x27;s day.  I don&#x27;t like Guthy-Renker infomercial rip-offs, so I just spend extra $$$$ buying this product from Amazon.  WEN rocks!</li>
    <li> I used the Lavender or Cucucmber WEN and love them both so when I saw this I figured I&#x27;d try it out. It leaves my hair very oily and it never looks good at the end of the day. Don&#x27;t care for this particular one.</li>
    <li> The conditioner works fine, but it smells exactly like thin mints. And while I really like thin mints, I don&#x27;t particularly want my hair smelling like that..</li>
    <li> Yay Yay I love my shampoo I love it so much thank you it is the best ever I live it!!!!</li>
