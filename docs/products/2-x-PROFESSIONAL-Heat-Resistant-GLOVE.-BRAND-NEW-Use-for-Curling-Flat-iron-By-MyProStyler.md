<li> Not what I expected to be.</li>
<li> I usually wear medium gloves and these have a little extra space.</li>

<li> They have no special protection, you can still feel the heat on your finger tips.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no holding for a few seconds-</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> and I can keep my hand on my straightener/curler for a few seconds before the heat goes through to my hand.</li>
<li> Hardly heat resistant.</li>
<li> The gloves are very thin and no very &amp;#34;resistant&amp;#34; at all.  </li>
<li> I had one heat iron that I purchased at a beauty supply store quite a while ago that came with a small thumb and forefinger heat resistant piece, which needless to say soon became lost.  </li>
<li> Gloves do not work, the material is to thin!</li>
<li> Unable to use!</li>

    <li> The heat protection feature works perfectly. My only complaint is how large the gloves are. I would&#x27;ve liked to have them a little more fitted so it&#x27;s easier to handle my hair while styling.</li>
    <li> Really large, too big for the girl I bought them for so I&#x27;ll use them.</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied! Just as described.</li>
    <li> Fingers way too long! Unable to use!</li>
    <li> I use the to work on hot stage lights and they are actually very effective.. I was surprised because when I received them they just seemed like regular gloves but they are not.</li>
    <li> Hardly heat resistant. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am such a chicken when it comes to any kind of heat--these gloves work amazingly well.  Glad I bought them</li>
    <li> These gloves will protect your fingers and your hair. I can still feel heat through the glove. So if my fingers get too hot, that means my hair is already burning. it&#x27;s easy to know how long to leave the curling iron on your hair, because you can touch the iron, without getting burned. Genius invention.</li>
    <li> Tried these out a few days ago and they work great! I&#x27;m the kind of person who can&#x27;t seem to curl my hair with these new wands without burning myself so this was a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> These gloves where exactly what I was looking for to make sure I didn&#x27;t burn myself anymore. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> No better than the cheap winter gloves I tried to use to begin with.  I just started using the curling iron with no clip. I had bought cheap gloves but was burned right through them. I bought these thinking they&#x27;d work better. Nope! I can&#x27;t get the end of my hair wrapped around because I am burning right away. There&#x27;s no holding for a few seconds- the heat goes right through them. I am thinking I&#x27;ll have to find snug pot holder type gloves.</li>
    <li> The gloves were exactly what I expected and needed.  The gloves work perfectly added together which is what you usually need to do with any glove for holding a curling wand.</li>
    <li> they work well, as advertised. a little warm for my hands but very nice to protect the entire hand while curlong</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all! I could of used my winter gloves I bought frm Walmart!!! It&#x27;s jz like them...</li>
    <li> Gloves do not work, the material is to thin! They burned my fingers right through the material. Cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These work well. I like that they are longer than typical heat gloves. I wish they were a little more heat proof as I do feel the heat through them relatively quick. But I do not get burned.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely worth the money. I used to burn my fingers on my styling rod and waver, but now I can curl, straighten or wave my hair without fear!</li>
    <li> these are exactly what I needed for my hot utensils.  I am thrilled with how they work, which is Perfectly!</li>
    <li> They do what they are suppose to do</li>
    <li> I am notorious for burning my hands and face when ever I use my curling iron. Decided to buy extra gloves so I can wash them when need be and to always have one.</li>
    <li> High quality. Perfect for my daughter learning to use hot tools. Where were these when I was a kid!</li>
    <li> I bought these over the summer and just only realized that I hadn&#x27;t submitted a review.  The gloves are very thin and no very &amp;#34;resistant&amp;#34; at all.  To put it quite honestly, it was better wearing these than nothing at all when using my curling wand.</li>
    <li> It does the job. No more, no less.</li>
    <li> the gloves protect excellent the fingers to avoid burn them with the curler and the flat iron..perfect!!!!!..completely satisfied and happy..</li>
    <li> Nice gloves but a little larger than my hands. I usually wear medium gloves and these have a little extra space.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some in the store and I thought these would be same, but the material is different they are just like a regular glove. I could have just used my regular gloves. I Don&#x27;t recommend these &amp;#34;Hear Resistant Gloves&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, great condition.  I had one heat iron that I purchased at a beauty supply store quite a while ago that came with a small thumb and forefinger heat resistant piece, which needless to say soon became lost.  Since I really liked the heat iron but now couldn&#x27;t use without getting a burn, I was thrilled to find these and they work great. They aren&#x27;t so bulky as to interfere with styling. Worth it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t feel my hair when its being heated at all and I can keep my hand on my straightener/curler for a few seconds before the heat goes through to my hand. Love this product!</li>
    <li> These work really well. I have used them not only with my hot hair styles but also with my steamer!</li>
    <li> I saw no difference from winter gloves. Not what I expected to be. The heat went trough, I did not burned my hand but it was definitely hot. I rather put on my winter gloves than spending money on this.</li>
    <li> The gloves are very large.</li>
    <li> I returned to small thanks</li>
    <li> These gloves are nothing special.  I have several pair of regular gloves that I could have used, and would fit better.  They have no special protection, you can still feel the heat on your finger tips.</li>
    <li> this is great for using with my new curling wand. i am new to the curling wand, which means many burns. these gloves are thin and easy to work with.</li>
