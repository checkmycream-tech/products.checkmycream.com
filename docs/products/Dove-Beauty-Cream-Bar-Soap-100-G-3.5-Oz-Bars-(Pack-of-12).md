<li> And although it smells the same,  it doesn&#x27;t lather the same, it doesn&#x27;t last as long nor is it the same size bar.</li>

<li> Far less moisturizing.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice that the product size is 3.5 oz, and that&#x27;s my only complaint; it&#x27;s slightly smaller than a standard bar of soap, so I think I may have paid just a little too much...</li>
<li> So sad that Dove has discontinued this fabulous soap.  </li>
<li> We love this scent and it is impossible to find in a brick and mortar store.</li>
<li> Not much of a lemongrass scent to it.</li>

<li> I recommend this soap to anyone who has tried a million other products but nothing else has worked!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish they still sold this soap in the store.  I can only find it online, but it smells so great, it is worth the time and money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap ever since it came out several years ago.  Prior to that I used regular Dove for the last +30 years.  I love it!!!!!!!!  Please Unilever do not quit making this fragrance as it has such a clean smell and feel.</li>
    <li> Not much of a lemongrass scent to it. If any at all.</li>
    <li> smaller size than bath size</li>
    <li> These smell as good as they look and do great things for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap. Just the right amount of moisturizing and cleansing. Absolutely love the fragrance. The exfoliation is just a plus.</li>
    <li> This bar has a great scent for Spring/Summer.  I always like to have something different smelling for each season.  I couldn&#x27;t get this locally, so was pleased to have a chance to try it.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product. It is our favorite&lt;br /&gt;type of soap and I haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, VERY speedy delivery. The bars are a smaller&lt;br /&gt;size than I realized. But still worth it.</li>
    <li> I could not longer find this fragrance in my local store and it is my favorite of  the Dove soaps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this Dove scent for a long time. The product, though made for Greece, seems to be exactly like the one we used to have in the United States.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to like this soap but I have to say I&#x27;m not a fan. It doesn&#x27;t lather well and the smell is not overly pleasant. It&#x27;s useable but I definitely wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the twelve pack.  I am fine with the texture although I don&#x27;t find it invigorating.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells old.  Try Yardley London Lemon Verbena!  Much, much, much better quality!!!</li>
    <li> This is great soap. I recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin or just wants a good bar of soap.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this soap, it smells good on her so I like it too.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap. I am unsure why DOVE discontinued them, as it was my favorite smell. They also have exfoliating beads that are nice.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon.  I was buying it from dollar stores (w/Greek or Cyrillic writing on it) and they ran out!  These boxes/bars are definitely smaller than those originally sold in the US: the US box says 4.25 oz/120g and this one is 3.5 oz/100g.  Given that I can&#x27;t find this anywhere else, I&#x27;ll take it!  It smells great and though I haven&#x27;t tried the new bar yet, it looks like it has the little exfoliating scrubbies in it. Speedy delivery, too!</li>
    <li> Leaves you with best feeling after a shower ever!</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to purchase on line since no one sells this any longer.  Arrived quickly and would buy again.  JW3763</li>
    <li> Perfect size for guest room and the smell is so fresh but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and feels so fresh! My wife just loves it, and its has fine grained scrub like beads! Amazing! I am on subscribe and save for this one!</li>
    <li> Beware of this particular Dove product from this particular seller ...this soap is made in Unilever Indonesia and not the United States. Far less moisturizing. The formula is different too.  The soap is smaller...only 3.5oz (as compared to the US version, 4.25 oz)...so read the fine print !</li>
    <li> travel size bars!  I wish the ad would have stated that.  I would like the full size bars.  But in life there are more things to complain about that small soap :)</li>
    <li> This transaction went smoothly, so I am happy with the seller. I ordered the Dove grapefruit and lemongrass bar soap online because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. It&#x27;s my favorite scent, so bright and fresh! I especially like that there is a touch of exfoliating \\&quot;grit\\&quot; in the soap. I didn&#x27;t notice that the product size is 3.5 oz, and that&#x27;s my only complaint; it&#x27;s slightly smaller than a standard bar of soap, so I think I may have paid just a little too much... But if its the only way I can get it, I&#x27;ll deal with the price!</li>
    <li> I love the soap &amp; disappointed they are discontinued. In saying that the bars I got smell old but do the trick</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap and scent,  so of course I was disappointed that Dove discontinued it.  However,  I was pleased to find it online. And although it smells the same,  it doesn&#x27;t lather the same, it doesn&#x27;t last as long nor is it the same size bar. It does the job of cleaning,  as it should being that it&#x27;s soap, but this is not the original.</li>
    <li> I was and am still so disappointed that Dove stopped making it.  This soap clears up everything and keeps my face so smooth and pimple free.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do when I or amazon run out.  I recommend this soap to anyone who has tried a million other products but nothing else has worked!</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap mainly because I wanted the grapefruit fragrance.  Unfortunately the product was lacking in this aspect. Otherwise I have no complaints about the product.</li>
    <li> So sad that Dove has discontinued this fabulous soap.  The smell and feel is great!!!  I am so glad that I could still find this product thru Amazon!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT FAST DELIVERY</li>
    <li> My sister has been looking for this special soap for a couple of years. Thank you, Dove for another excellent product!  Please continue to produce this special energizing soap!!  It was very hard to find. Thank you Amazon for having this product! My sister thanks you too!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap and the texture of the little beads they put in it. It&#x27;s a nice gender neural scent. I liked it enough that when my local stores stopped carrying it I resorted to buying it online. The 3.5 oz size is smaller than your typical bar of soap, but I bought it because it was the best price per oz.</li>
    <li> Unless you are buying this for your kids, don&#x27;t bother with this size.  I like the soap, but this size is too small.</li>
    <li> not easy to find this product in any stores, supermarket or otherwise will be looking to purchase it again when more is in order</li>
    <li> i really like the natural and clean scent of this soap.  i have used Dove products for years but i am having difficulty finding them in the lemon scent.  i&#x27;m really glad that Amazon is carrying them!</li>
    <li> We love this scent and it is impossible to find in a brick and mortar store. I bought the 3.5oz. bars to save a few cents and we are pleased with our selection.</li>
    <li> I really like the fresh scent and clean feel to this bar soap. It&#x27;s a favorite. I love Dove products.</li>
    <li> I love this this is my favorite so it took me almost a year to find it and I finally found it online they i bought cases so if you like it grab a bunch that&#x27;s what I did</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. You can not find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> You can unwrap a bar of this and keep in your bathroom to keep it smelling fresh.  When you use as a bath bar the scent left on skin is awesome.  A great aroma.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to like this soap, but the perfume smell is cheap smelling and too overbearing for me at times.  Not bad but not my favorite Dove soap.  By the way, I have Psoriasis and the soap didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  I only used one bar from the package and sold the rest.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite dove soap and the only place I was ablt to find it was online at amazon. None of the stores carry the soap anymore, I think dove may have dicontinue it&#x27;s production of it.  Thank goodness for amazon, if you love the scent of lemon like I do you will love this soap.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. They should bring back the scent.</li>
    <li> Great Smell and lather price was fair gave one to a friend she liked it as well never had seen in stores. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> My skin looks more healthy after using this soap. This is a scrub kind of soap that helps to stay fresh for oily faces like mine.</li>
    <li> I love love love this scent. My all time favorite. I was disappointed when it left the shelves of the store.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like heavily scented, perfumed soaps and this scent is lovely for a fresh, clean feeling, especially in the summer months.</li>
    <li> I love this product, this is the only place I can find it.</li>
