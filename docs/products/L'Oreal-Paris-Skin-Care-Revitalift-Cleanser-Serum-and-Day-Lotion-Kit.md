      <li>The product comes in an attractive glass jar with a pump top.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 32 with fair, freckled skin.</li>
      <li>This is a good buy.</li>
      <li>SHE LOVED IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;---She</li>
      <li>, so I feel like it is good value for the money.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>It is a good moisturizer</li>
      <li>felt I owed it to my review readers to follow the instructions and get the best out of this, using it for the full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I am very pleased with this moisturizing serum.  </li>
      <li>I use this product in the morning and am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>honestly didn&#x27;t think that a product this good would be found in a drugstore product</li>
      <li>The cream feels nice on the skin and smells good</li>
      <li>After having used this for a month, I have not seen a great reduction in the fine lines I have on my forehead and around my mouth, but I have seen an improvement in my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>This serum is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>My makeup goes on smooth and looks great all day.</li>
      <li>I liked wearing it under my foundation</li>
      <li>It smells nice, too</li>
      <li>Yes, it has a nice texture and yes, it absorbs well.</li>
      <li>but it is good to know it is also available from Amazon!</li>
      <li>The nice bottle makes it seem like a department store product.  </li>
      <li>My Mom really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>My dermatologist friend recommended I try this instead of a retinol, saying it&#x27;s just as effective.  </li>
      <li>texture and tone of my skin is becoming more even, expression lines have been greatly diminished and my skin looks bright and healthy.</li>
      <li>well, they stated that the best way to get an idea of how it would perform for the user (me) would be most evident after a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This particular item is best for me.</li>
      <li>Is there some new thing at Saks that will best the performance of the L&#x27;Oreal?</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the product does have some good points that I&#x27;d like to share with anyone considering it: I have sensitive skin that is prone to break-outs, and this product did not cause me any problems, so that&#x27;s good!</li>
      <li>skin will thank you and do not be surprised if people start complimenting you on how flawless your complexion, face looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, it did feel nice on my skin and did make it more silky to the touch.</li>
      <li>Of course not, but thus far I am impressed on the delivery of the package promise.</li>
      <li>and my SO reluctantly allowed me to educate him on the importance of these products and he uses this also, and can tell his skin tone, complexion is already improving, and looks great.ot be surprised if people start complimenting you on how flawless your complexion, face looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I do think that this L&#x27;Oreal works just as well on my very fine lines and my pores.  </li>
      <li>Very fine lines seem diminished, but there isn&#x27;t a product out there that will get out the wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
      <li>While this gave me a nice overall glow, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  </li>
      <li>goes on very smoothly, like silk</li>
      <li>Both wife and daughter liked the texture and the fact that it went on easy and was not greasy.  </li>
      <li>, then the serum, it solved the stinging issue so I was able to finish the bottle.  </li>
      <li>This is more a cream than a \\&quot;serum.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also sticky and the smell could be better.</li>
      <li>love the cleanser btw.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>and I am an expert top TripAdvisor reviewer also.</li>
      <li>After a week of use I found my skin tone to be a bit more evened out with some of my freckles fading.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love, love love this product.</li>
      <li>I gave this the four weeks recommended and more.</li>
      <li>just okay.</li>
      <li>Absorbs well and does not pill as many</li>
      <li>and I am an expert top TripAdvisor reviewer also.</li>
      <li>What more could one ask?</li>
      <li>I love the way this serum feels and unlike others, it makes your makeup stay in place, and is the primer for all the rest of my cosmetics before I leave for</li>
      <li>/&gt;Claim 1: Complexion is more radiant immediately.</li>
      <li>While it improved with repeated usage, there was more radiance immediately.&lt;br</li>
      <li>: Skin tone is more even.</li>
      <li>The packaging is very attractive anhd at first impression, the product looks pretty high-quality.</li>
      <li>Love the smoothness of it</li>
      <li>Thought, since it is free, nothing to lose!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an outstanding product, and even better results than the Lancome serums I buy that exceed $100</li>
      <li>love this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wrinkles: I don&#x27;t have many</li>
      <li>the next morning my husband looked at me as if I was Emily Rose!!!</li>
      <li>All in all I&#x27;d give it a C+ like most OTC items.</li>
      <li>In fact I feel like my skin is retaining more moisture since I began using this.</li>
      <li>Does it take more than a month to notice any improvement?</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my face and the way it makes me look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary, while enjoyed the packaging and texture of the serum, I am reducing the star rating because the product:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>but I will continue my search for a better hyaluronic serum that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and doesn&#x27;t sprinkle glitter all over.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent price, excellent product tha bests out the others. Instant results with skin conditioning, very quick results for firming and reduction of wrinkles! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the way it sinks into my skin.  I see a noticeable difference in removing lines.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for my skin.  It glides on smoothly and leaves no greasy feeling.  The seller provided the item in a timely manner.  The item was priced just right and the item was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum, it moisturizes the face well and has subtle amount of shimmer which I love because it makes your face lighten up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products that promise to erase all signs of aging. They range from affordable to crazy expensive. I find the results to be about the same either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Revitalift serum with no real expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it as directed for 3 weeks now and there have been noticeable changes to my skin. I&#x27;m 48 with very few wrinkles, several darker age spots and dull skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most success I had was with the age spots. Like I said, I&#x27;ve tried several products (all price ranges) and never noticed a difference. With the Revitalift I am seeing noticeable fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles: I don&#x27;t have many so it&#x27;s hard to tell with that.&lt;br /&gt;Dull skin color: There was a difference but not really what I want. Instead a more natural, healthy glow my skin seems shiny. Not oily feeling but it does look greasy at first - it does fade to a natural look after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I would point out is the smell. Personally I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and this has a fairly strong, perfume odor. It fades quickly but I&#x27;m not sure why my face cream would need to smell like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think this product delivers on it&#x27;s claims and for a reasonable price. More so than other products I&#x27;ve tried despite a few drawbacks.</li>
    <li> As a reviewer, I sometimes receive products that don&#x27;t fit me, however, they perfectly match a family/friend member.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s exactly what happened with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...When I received this product, I was at my Mother&#x27;s house.  I tried it on and saw no difference than before.  My Mom really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I saw no results because you really have to use it for 2 weeks (although I did like it--I&#x27;m a guy and had haggard eyes after the last night&#x27;s fun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the month, I asked my Mom for a review.  SHE LOVED IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;---She put it on in the afternoon and a bit just before night time.  EVEN I saw a change in her skin--it gave her a better natural blush in her skin and using makeup didn&#x27;t seem to bother her at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;not so&#x27; popular serum is available at your local Walgreens, CVS, or Osco.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but, it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these little bottles should last you a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review helped you.&lt;br /&gt;If so, please click &#x27;YES&#x27; in the little box below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;Rl Miles</li>
    <li> feels nice going on, very strong perfume smell(this whole line does actually) esp for face products...hasn&#x27;t made a change in the appearance of my face at all. used it for about 1.5 months, have recently changed to another line that doesn&#x27;t smell so strong.</li>
    <li> I have neck lines and it greatly reduces the severity of the lines.</li>
    <li> This is more a cream than a \\&quot;serum.\\&quot; It has a light, pleasant scent and makes my dry skin feel healthy and moisturized. However, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any of the advertised effects so far. As is stands, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer for mature skin, even if it doesn&#x27;t make you look 21 again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, it was hard for me to give up my Olay Regenerist for a month, but I did and I&#x27;ve found that the L-Oreal Revitalift appears to be just as good for less money than the Olay line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel of it gliding over my skin and I love the way my skin feels afterwards.  It has definitely toned the skin and made my complexion appear brighter.  Very fine lines seem diminished, but there isn&#x27;t a product out there that will get out the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product so well, I plan to purchase a replacement bottle (along with the other products in the line) in the next few weeks.  I highly recommend this to us &#x27;older&#x27; folk.</li>
    <li> After having used this for a month, I have not seen a great reduction in the fine lines I have on my forehead and around my mouth, but I have seen an improvement in my skin tone.  It is more even with less redness.  It is a good moisturizer but it did leave my skin feeling a little greasy.  I have naturally oily skin though so all lotion-type products tend to leave my skin a bit greasy.  I found the fragrance pleasant and not overwhelming.  Overall, I like this product and am planning to continue using it as a moisturizer and to even out my skin tone.  I am also hoping with continued use, I may see an improvement in my fine lines.</li>
    <li> I am 49 Caucasian with red hair and blemish prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I don&#x27;t care to try to fade my freckles.  They are part of who I am.&lt;br /&gt;I see temporary dramatic effect on deep \\&quot;marionette lines\\&quot; on chin, but&lt;br /&gt;I still get a breakout most every time I use this.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased youth code serum and that does not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely not as bad as Olay...that was every time I used it...who wants a pimple in the middle of their wrinkle???&lt;br /&gt;I am really wondering if the BB is good and if it will break me out because I had gotten Garnier BB and that was a nightmare for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Sonia Kashuka(sp) tinted moisturizer with no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised none of the other reviews of this product mentioned break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I love the cleanser btw.&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to find an eyecream to go with the youthcode.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product . It works so well .It takes care of the fine lines . I will keep using it .......c</li>
    <li> This has a very easy to use push top that makes it easy to get just the right amount of product for your face onto fingertips. Two pushes is just right for the whole face. The product is no miracle face-lift product but does make my face feel somewhat smoother and very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles from L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment (heavy verbiage for a mere fluid ounce) but I expected SOMETHING after a month&#x27;s regular use. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all, despite using this twice per day, every day. Yes, it has a nice texture and yes, it absorbs well. It also slightly stings my somewhat sensitive skin but not so much that it causes any problems with its appearance. However, I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my own lack of positive results. Bottom line: a disappointment, no use belaboring the point. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Some reviews have complained about the fragrance on this item, and I have to say I didn&#x27;t notice it as that strong, and certainly quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;This none greasy, easily absorbed serum has yielded some definite results after just a week or two of daily, directed use.&lt;br /&gt;Fine lines look smoother, and there isn&#x27;t any problem applying makeup over this, at least light foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I gave it four stars, is it going to make you look 20 years younger overnight? Of course not, but thus far I am impressed on the delivery of the package promise.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind using a moisturizer to combat my wrinkles (like the [[ASIN:B008CT12G2 L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment]]), but this one was too scented and \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; for my tastes, so it got passed over to my wife for use and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks of diligently substituting this \\&quot;Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment\\&quot; for her regular routine, she gave it a pronounced \\&quot;meh\\&quot; and went back to using her usual products. There was nothing particularly terrible about it, she said, but nor was there anything to justify using this on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like lots of facial products, the \\&quot;Revitalift Triple Power\\&quot; promises miracles it can never deliver. At best it seems to be a stop-gap measure--it smooths out your face and gives you a shine, but only for the duration the product is active on your face.</li>
    <li> Not great, not bad...just okay. I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin. I did find it kind of sneaky marketing to talk about the skin brightening qualities when any shine I could see was from the little glitter beads in the serum.</li>
    <li> I generally approach the sorts of claims made by beauty product with a good deal of skepticism. L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Triple Power surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim 1: Complexion is more radiant immediately. True. While it improved with repeated usage, there was more radiance immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Claim 2: Skin texture appears smoother in 1 week. Yes &amp; no. It was better, but perhaps not as much as one might want.&lt;br /&gt;Claim 3: Skin tone is more even. in 1 week. Yes, definitely. I have rosacea, and this definitely helps.&lt;br /&gt;Claim 4: In 4 weeks, wrinkles are visibly reduced. Like number 2, this is a true claim, but it&#x27;s about a 6 out of ten for me.&lt;br /&gt;Claim 5: In 4 weeks, skin is revitalized and younger-looking. Overall, yes. I think that has a lot to do with the radiance and tone. Add in the others as far as they go, and you get a yes here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleasantly surprised by how well this product works and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After longer use, I&#x27;m a believer. Skin texture is smoother, and skin does look younger. If I fail to use it for a few days, I notice a distinct difference. This product has become a vital part of my face care routine.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get the Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment. I&#x27;ve read a lot of great things about it and since I am approaching 50-I want all the help I can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale, sensitive oily skin, which makes finding a good face product difficult.  Like some of the other reviewers, I was a bit disappointed with this product.  First: it does have a strong scent. I don&#x27;t mind the smell but for those who may be sensitive to smells and get migraines this will be a problem.  2: it felt heavy on my skin.  It was also a bit greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it a good review so used it daily as per the manufacturer directions for 2 wks.  My skin got dried out and I saw no noticeable difference in the beginning under eye bags, wrinkles and crows feet.  This may work for someone a bit older with drier/less sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Originally I said this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to review this, because after four weeks of use, I can&#x27;t honestly say that I see a difference in my skin. The product packaging claims smoother and more even skin after one week and visibly reduced wrinkles after four weeks. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see evidence of either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product does have some good points that I&#x27;d like to share with anyone considering it: I have sensitive skin that is prone to break-outs, and this product did not cause me any problems, so that&#x27;s good! It does go on smoothly and absorbs fairly quickly, and it does not leave any residue or shine behind, also good. On the negative side, it has more fragrance than I like in facial products, and it does have shimmer, and I&#x27;m not sure why since it is recommended for use day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t see any evidence that this product has helped my skin, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt it, either. I&#x27;ll keep using it till it runs out, and if continued use does create results, I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: After using up the bottle and following it up with two different products from different brands, I&#x27;m back to using Revitalift. Sometimes you don&#x27;t realize how much a product works until you stop using it. I still can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m noticing a reduction in wrinkles and fine lines, but my skin definitely has a healthy glow and improved texture with this product, and it may just be a coincidence, but I have less breakouts too. I&#x27;m a believer now! I just purchased my third bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the more-expensive department store and spa brands of serum, and NOTHING beats Revitalift for both performance and cost.  L&#x27;Oreal also owns Lancome, and I compared the ingredients with Lancome&#x27;s Genefique serum. They were virtually the same (Genefique had an extra moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift didn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin, didn&#x27;t leave a sticky film on my skin, and perked up my half-century-old skin within a week.  I&#x27;ve got skin allergies, but have not experienced rashes, stinging or burning from this produce.  I highly recommend it.  Don&#x27;t forget the skin and night cream, which are a blessing in the flip-flop humidity and dry climate where I live!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip the $85 pricetag for Genefique, pick up some Revitalift instead and spend your extra money on a fabulous pair of heels.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- goes on very smoothly, like silk&lt;br /&gt;- feels rich and emollient, but it soaks in after a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;- light enough to use another moisturizer on top of it - one with spf&lt;br /&gt;- beautiful, ruby red glass container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No necessarily cons, but Other considerations:&lt;br /&gt;- I generally don&#x27;t believe much of the anti-aging hype on any products I buy.  Moreover, if there were positive effects, I imagine they would be quite gradual and subtle, and difficult to determine objectively.  Since we see our faces every day, how would we know?  There may also be some \\&quot;wishful thinking\\&quot; involved, especially if you pay a lot for a product.  So I systematically took photos of my face after 15, 30, 60, and 90 days with a macro lens.  Guess what - after daily use, I could not see a visible difference in any of the photos after 90 days, with regards to wrinkles, lines, or spots.  I have several sun spots that darkened considerably with my pregnancy.  The photos do not indicate they have lightened while using this product. But then again, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, and my skin looks and feels great when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  I would buy this product again because I have enjoyed using it, and it feels like it is good for my skin even thought it doesn&#x27;t turn back time - I have yet to see any product that does, but I like to take good care of my skin anyway.  It seems like a high-quality product that is not overly greasy and is not way over-priced (like a lot of them are).  The nice bottle makes it seem like a department store product.  Also, a little goes a long way - I bought it 8 months ago and it is not gone yet (used about once per day), so I feel like it is good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because its the face cream, not the eye cream as advertised. Please change the wording on your ad!!</li>
    <li> We may not think about it as often as we should but all of us are born with our skin and we cannot go out and replace it, so must take care of it. I have always used high end, proven results skin care/ beauty creams, serums, and moisturizes with SPF. This costs 1/3 of what I have paid for other pricey serums and I am amazed at how remarkable this feels on my skin. My skin looks flawless, firmer, dewy, and radiant, with no annoying scent, awful taste, and a little goes a LONG way. I used this and within a week I noticed a significant improvement in my overall skin tone, even complexion and I can put it on at night and also, in the morning before my moisturizer, eye cream, and neck, body SPF moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the tech at my nail spa who I have visited for 8 years for eyebrow waxes, nails, spa pedis and we are great friends. Lena saw me for 3 treatments last week and she asked what are you using on your face? Your skin is really perfect!  I never deviate from my skin care ritual because you cannot go out and replace your skin, so must take care of it, be vigilant and enjoy looking 10 years younger than you actually are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an outstanding product, and even better results than the Lancome serums I buy that exceed $100+. I have very sensitive skin, and allergies, some products make me break out for two wretched weeks and so I am hesitant to try new skin care treatments because when I invest a lot of money on the \\&quot;latest, greatest, proven results facial treatments\\&quot; and it turns out they burn my sensitive skin, or make me break out. I read the reviews on this, and had to give it a try and it is official~ this is going to be part of my morning, and evening skin care rituals, as the results speak for themselves and I am saving a fortune! I love the way this serum feels and unlike others, it makes your makeup stay in place, and is the primer for all the rest of my cosmetics before I leave for my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will thank you and do not be surprised if people start complimenting you on how flawless your complexion, face looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks for reading my review~ I educate myself with online reviews prior to purchasing ANYTHING online and I am an expert top TripAdvisor reviewer also. I thank all of the consumers who take time to review their products, and convince me to buy (or not buy) a new product.

    <li> Great UV protection on this product. I live in New Mexico where melanoma is really common. Does such a great job if you are consistent.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received the Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Now, to give you some background, I have been trying to use it for seven days.&lt;br /&gt;I actually held off my review to see how it would perform for me until the seven days had passed. This is because of the instructions which I read. They  came with this L&#x27;Oreal serum. The instructions exlained how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;As well, they stated that the best way to get an idea of how it would perform for the user (me) would be most evident after a week.&lt;br /&gt;I felt I owed it to my review readers to follow the instructions and get the best out of this, using it for the full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I like L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed especially at how uncomfortable this made my sensitive skin feel. I could barely stand to use it. That is my major complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly if your skin is less sensitive, this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly it might \\&quot;rock your wrinkles\\&quot; and minimize them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, here I am however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 62 years old, and my wrinkles are seven days more obvious than they were when I started using the Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment by L&#x27;Oreal.  Additionally, my skin is sore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it if you have a different skin type than I do, or are a different age. Perhaps it will work for you! Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,  Jean</li>
    <li> I use moisturizer every day, twice a day. I&#x27;m 46 and avoid the sun, and I don&#x27;t smoke.  I have great skin.  Sooo, that being said, I didn&#x27;t notice any change when I switched from my Avene Ystheal+ to this one.  You could call that a big score for L&#x27;Oreal, because the Avene is over twice the price if you buy it in France - and is more like three times the price if you buy it in the US.  If I skip a morning or evening moisturizer application, I do notice pretty quickly.  So I do think that this L&#x27;Oreal works just as well on my very fine lines and my pores.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Very suitable for women over the age of forty. My facial wrinkles definitely decreased. My skin is soft and smooth.I recommend it strongly to all ladies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and I see nothing different. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my complexion or just me. It may not be for black people. But I would not buy this not do I care for it. It&#x27;s also sticky and the smell could be better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell how effective this product is, because everytime I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve gotten at least one pimple.  I&#x27;ve started using it on my neck and even got a pimple there!  Trying it on my arms now to see if I can give a better review for people who don&#x27;t break out, but I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s so anything labeled as a serum shouldn&#x27;t even have this issue.  It is a little richer than what I&#x27;ve typically seen as serums (almost lotion-like, with a pretty gold tint), so maybe that the problem, but not usable on the face for me.</li>
    <li> Serums for me are very hit and miss.  I have combination, mid-30s skin and some can make me look shiny and greasy and some just don&#x27;t do anything at all.  I have found a few really nice ones but I am always seeking out others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Revitalist Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment to be favorable for my skin.  I felt that the serum was lightly fragranced, it was light weight on my skin and my skin absorbed it fully so I was not shiny or greasy.  I liked wearing it under my foundation (I wear Make Up For Ever HD along with SmashBox Photofinish Primer) so it will go on evenly.  I will definitely consider making this a permanent fixture in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I have always used Olay, but decided to give the L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift line a chance and I love it. I have been using this serum along with the eye, day and night creams and see a great difference in as little as 2 weeks. My skin is definitely tighter and the ripples in my cheeks and chin have faded. All the products absorb in my skin very well without an oily effect. Everybody&#x27;s skin is different so maybe it won&#x27;t show the same results for you, but with the price it is worth the try.</li>
    <li> I gave this the four weeks recommended and more. I found that like many products that promise to revitalize older skin, my skin looked better immediately after application. However, this wore off pretty quickly, and I saw no long-term effects.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and love how it makes my skin feel. Would recommend this to anyone looking for that little extra for your skin!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but I have been using a week.. Love the smoothness of it and hopefully I will see some wrinkles diminish soon!!</li>
    <li> Read fabulous reviews on several websites so figured I give a try.  I&#x27;m not new to skin care (Early 40&amp;#34;s with typical wrinkles and sun spots.)  and have been looking to replace the Neutrogena products I&#x27;ve had to discontinue using (see my other review).  Sunk $43.00 into both this and the coordinating Revitalift Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first night I noticed the overpowering smell in both products but hoped it would fade over time. Nope, woke up just as strong smelling.  And worse, when I looked in the mirror my eye area was puffy/swollen like allergic reaction even though I specifically stayed away from applying around the eye area.  The other thing I noticed, the laugh lines around my nose and mouth were filled with blisters.  They looked like acne, but definitely fluid- filled blisters.  I did not have them before, it was a blistering reaction to something in the products.  I immediately washed my face and waited for the skin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the blistering agent made my skin sun sensitive, anytime I was in the sun it would trigger a new round of blisters. I am aware retinols can do this, I specifically avoid strong retinols for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks, I tried again with just the serum to validate the original reaction or see if it was a fluke with using both the serum and cream.  It happened again after one use. One month out and I continue to have sun sensitivity along the areas that blistered.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. makes me looks 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> while pregnant my face has gone through a rough transition. Once I added this into my daily face remedy WOW!! I can really tell my skin has firmed up, It looks full of life and helped even stop any more weird discolorments on my face. Ive always been a skeptical but I really love how light weight this is and how much more life my face has now.</li>
    <li> Perfect serum treatment.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs help with facial skin.  This is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This serum is AMAZING. Seriously. After using it for two days, I already noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin. The consistency is somewhere between a serum, a gel, and a cream. You only need about two pumps for your face and one for your neck. It has a very slight fragrance but nothing noticeable after it&#x27;s been absorbed into your skin, which it does rather quickly without leaving a greasy, heavy film. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or dried out my skin. In fact I feel like my skin is retaining more moisture since I began using this. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even feel the need to apply my moisturizer after this, but when I do it feels like it applies and absorbs better. It also does well under makeup. Some products can make foundation &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; up, become streaky, or lessen the staying power of your makeup. Not this serum though.&lt;br /&gt;The texture and tone of my skin is becoming more even, expression lines have been greatly diminished and my skin looks bright and healthy. I really noticed a great improvement in my neck as well. Those age lines are really starting to look so much better and less defined.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t think that a product this good would be found in a drugstore product, it&#x27;s definitely one of the best treatment products I have ever used and I will definitely be repurchasing. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, I say go for it! If you like it as much as I do, you won&#x27;t regret trying it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. It gives that soft silky feeling and I think the glow is back because the skin tone looks younger. I am 59 and I take care of my skin. I use this product in the morning and am very pleased with the results. It&#x27;s not magic or the fountain of youth, but it is a wonderful assist in aging gracefully.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is that is in this serum but I tend to break out less whenever I use it. Even after forgetting to wash off my makeup at night.</li>
    <li> Sadly you didn&#x27;t have this product when I reordered it.</li>
    <li> by mail but I am very pleased with this moisturizing serum.  I have now found it even more easily, at a nearby drugstore but it is good to know it is also available from Amazon!</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Concentrated Serum Treatment promises these benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Repair wrinkles (using Hyaluronic Acid).&lt;br /&gt;2. Redensify skin (plump/volumize skin to strengthen it).&lt;br /&gt;3. Resurface skin texture (smoothes skin and evens skin tone for a more refined texture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product page promises: \\&quot;Skin texture appears smoother and skin tone is more even in 1 week and wrinkles are visibly reduced in 4 weeks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 10 days of using Revitalift, I noticed that my skin felt smoother and softer to the touch. It didn&#x27;t LOOK any different, but it FELT different. I&#x27;m writing this review at about the 3-week mark, and I have not seen any further changes. Granted, it said it took FOUR weeks to visibly reduct wrinkles, but one would think I would have started to see a difference at THREE. I have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I HAVE seen is a lightening of my skin over the course of these three weeks. I had more of a tan than usual when I started the product and now my face has very little color. If I didn&#x27;t know better, I would say this product is BLEACHING my skin in order to \\&quot;even\\&quot; out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, I assumed that evening out skin tone meant that the product would have some impact on my sun/age spots, which are considerable on one side of my face. The only change I have seen--and this is only in the third week--is that the spots don&#x27;t seem to stand out as much. Given that my entire face is lighter, I don&#x27;t think this is any miracle...the spots are being lightened along with the rest of my face. I didn&#x27;t WANT my skin lightened. If I did, I would have bought a product that specifically promises skin lightening. This does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY do skin care companies continue to put fragrance in face lotions and creams when more and more women are fragrance sensitive than ever? I remember a time when I was the only fragrance sensitive person I knew. Now, quite a lot of women (some I know and some who comment on my reviews) tell me that they, too, cannot tolerate strong fragrances, especially on the face. The ONLY reason I was able to tolerate the fragrance in this serum is that I had been sent a night face cream to review last year and, while I was unable to use it on my face due to the fragrance, I continued to use it on my hands because I loved the texture. That product has de-sensitized me somewhat to the fragrance in skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other notes about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t recommend using it on your eyelids. It made my eyelids burn, but that is the only part of my face where I had sensitivity issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;2. This product does not contain sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;3. Revitalift is intended to be used under your regular daily moisturizer (or night cream) and is intended to be used twice a day, in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;4. I suggest waiting a minute or two between applying the serum to your face and neck, and appling your daily moisturizer or night cream.&lt;br /&gt;5. The product comes in an attractive glass jar with a pump top.&lt;br /&gt;6. The package size is 10 fluid ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, while enjoyed the packaging and texture of the serum, I am reducing the star rating because the product:&lt;br /&gt;1) did not deliver on the two of its three promises (the two I was most interested in--evening skin tone and repairing wrinkles);&lt;br /&gt;2) appears to be lightening my skin without telling me it would do so; and&lt;br /&gt;3) contains far too much fragrance for a face product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, when I get to the 4-week point where wrinkles are promised to be repaired (and beyond, if I continue to use the product), I see additional benefits from the serum, I will come back and edit my review (and rating, if applicable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, 3 stars.at they, too, cannot tolerate strong fragrances, especially on the face. The ONLY reason I was able to tolerate the fragrance in this serum is that I had been sent a night face cream to review last year and, while I was unable to use it on my face due to the fragrance, I continued to use it on my hands because I loved the texture.

    <li> A little bit goes a long way. It sinks in and makes the skin feel nice and soft, not sticky or tacky like some lotions do. I have not really noticed a really big difference in a change in lift in the skin or reduction of wrinkles. Does it take more than a month to notice any improvement? I know OTC items are not as strong as RX when it comes to wrinkle reduction. I will continue to take care of my skin. Sunblock and reduce my exposure to mid-day sun and lessen my chances of sunburn. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink so my skin is not in terrible shape. All in all I&#x27;d give it a C+ like most OTC items. If you want drastic results you need to see a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> What I like about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pump bottle that dispenses a navy bean sized blob on your fingers.  One or two blobs is about the right amount for face and neck and there is not any waste as you would have an open jar or tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is non-irritating.  There are very few products I can tolerate on my skin, but this has caused no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance - it does have some fragrance, but not very strong, and I can&#x27;t smell it by the time I got it applied.  I asked my family and they could not smell it.  I am very careful not to use fragrance as I work in the medical field, and this qualifies as something I could put on before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product disappears completely - no residue visible on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have droopy under eye skin and smoker&#x27;s kiss lines (not from smoking) that I have been attacking with this and I don&#x27;t see any difference, but of course I didn&#x27;t really expect that kind of a miracle.  I think thirty days is not long enough to know if this product is rejuvenating or even slows down aging, but I did receive a nice compliment to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable compared to similar products.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 4 weeks, and don&#x27;t really know if that&#x27;s enough time to accurately say whether it&#x27;s working or not. I&#x27;m 32 with fair, freckled skin. I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile. I&#x27;ve also been spending a lot of time outside and the sun has been drying me out(especially my forehead) so I&#x27;ve need a serious dose of moisture. I try to be proactive about taking care of my skin without going broke and was a fan of this price point. Sinks in nicely, not greasy. Seems to plump up the skin after application, though I haven&#x27;t noticed any lasting effects or improvements. The one thing I really don&#x27;t like is the fragrance. It&#x27;s a floral to my nose, and I honestly don&#x27;t like much scent in my facial creams unless they&#x27;re citrus. On the whole I do really like the serum and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I feel that its working but don&#x27;t know. Perhaps I could have compared the results by applying half of my face for the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I am a really \\&quot;hard-sell\\&quot; when it comes to cosmetics. Now, at fifty-six years old, having to rethink the moisturizer routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a full-sized bottle of this serum from the Amazon Vine Program. Thought, since it is free, nothing to lose! Well, there was everything to gain! This product goes on smoothly and does not feel sticky - unlike some serums I have tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it once in the morning and again at night; topping it with a light moisturizer; and, after only two weeks, there is a visible difference. Skin feels better, wrinkles are less noticeable, and I am thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to anyone who wants there skin to look and feel younger.</li>
    <li> The packaging is very attractive anhd at first impression, the product looks pretty high-quality. The cream feels nice on the skin and smells good (I don&#x27;t agree with the comments that say it doesn&#x27;t have a smell--it does have a rather noticeable smell, but I found it to be pleasant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my arm first, to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it. Afterwards, my skin felt softer and smoother. Then I tried using it several times. I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any reduction of wrinkles, though the product description notes it takes four weeks for that to happen. Nevertheless, it did feel nice on my skin and did make it more silky to the touch.</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin moist. It smells fine too. It&#x27;s affordable. However, I don&#x27;t see the lift. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> This is the only face serum the as it works as it says, light as air, skin silky smooth, and never a Breakout till o ran out. Love, love love this product. Strayed from loreal before, as  always i return to the best in skin and Hair cate products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a month, twice a day per the instructions. When I first apply it, my skin turns red for a few minutes. After I return to my normal color, my skin is smooth and soft for a few hours. The effects are nice, but they don&#x27;t last long. The texture of my face is the same as it was before I starting using this produce. No fine lines have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Well made pump dispenser&lt;br /&gt;Consistancy: Thin, creamy and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Scent:  The scent is pleasant, very light and not that noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Application: Very smooth, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Appearance when first applied: Skin reddens, then clears leaving skin soft and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Appearace after one month: Same as when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;Skin Texture: Smoother, but only for a few hours after product applied&lt;br /&gt;Skin Tone: Brighter, but only for a few hours after product applied&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkle Reduction: None</li>
    <li> Basically, I think you&#x27;re getting from L&#x27;Oreal what you would have been spending 10 times as much 5 years ago at Saks. After a week of use I found my skin tone to be a bit more evened out with some of my freckles fading. The skin under my jaw has firmed slightly as well. Is there some new thing at Saks that will best the performance of the L&#x27;Oreal? Probably. But it likely will cost you $300 and go off before you finish it. Short of seeing a dermatologist and getting a peel (after which you&#x27;d better not see the sun at all for a week) you simply aren&#x27;t going to do much better with an over the counter product. This one is well-prices and works.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my wife and daughter to use and then provide me with the info for a review.  My wife used this for three weeks.  She liked the mild fragrance which is important to her because she has a lot of allergies.  My daughter used it for a month and continues to use it off and on.  Both wife and daughter liked the texture and the fact that it went on easy and was not greasy.  They compared this product with much more expensive skin care products and said L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift serum&#x27;s low price is a definite plus.  Both are switching to the L&#x27;Oreal skin care line from Clinique and Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> Great eyecare for wrinkles - beats the $50.+ products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Why spend $100 when you can get the same quality and results with L&#x27;Oreal?  My dermatologist friend recommended I try this instead of a retinol, saying it&#x27;s just as effective.  This is a great alternative if you are not looking to go to a prescription retina supplement.</li>
    <li> This is not the eye treatment.  This is the Serum for face.  The heading on this item needs to be corrected!</li>
    <li> Feels and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product and would definitely buy again.  Goes on beautifully face - I use it in the evening (but it can be used during the day I guess).</li>
    <li> Like the product and how it goes on and stays on. It smells nice, too I enjoy L&#x27;Oreal face creams overall.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS VERY VERY MUCH  I TRIED USING  ANOTHER PRODUCT  AND WENT BACK TO THIS</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this.  I am 67, use it along with Clarins day cream and it keeps my face protected and smooth.  I don&#x27;t have over dry skin and this does not make it oily appearing as some creams do.  Haven&#x27;t had one bit of irritation with it and I can sometimes have that problem with other creams.  I will continue to use this as part of my daily and nightly face care routine..</li>
    <li> While this gave me a nice overall glow, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  It has a heavy perfume smell which I didn&#x27;t mind so much but after using it for a few days, my skin started stinging.  I have extremely sensitive skin so I&#x27;m sure that only made matters worse.  However I found if I put on my moisturizer first, then the serum, it solved the stinging issue so I was able to finish the bottle.  I had hoped for some sort of results (minimized age spots, softened lines, etc.) but was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not live up to the hype. Promised more plumping of the face by cell regeneration. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing so. Leaves skin soft. Long time Loreal user. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel amazing helps smooth away tiny wrinkles I&#x27;m 45 I have oily skin and it absorbs well.</li>
    <li> It works. I use this serum and the moisturizer twice a day. Within the first few days, I noticed a difference in my complexion. It seemed more hydrated and brighter. I&#x27;ve used these products for about a month, and there&#x27;s definitely a slight tightening around my jawline. Now, I don&#x27;t expect miracles at my age, but every little bit helps! I love the way it feels on my face and the way it makes me look. The price won&#x27;t break the bank, either. What more could one ask?</li>
    <li> This serum goes on so smoothly and without any residue left behind or sticky feeling like some of the most expensive creams i have tried,</li>
    <li> I use L&#x27;Oreal products all of the time. They have never disappointed .</li>
    <li> This product really feels good and refreshing in the morning. This is the forst time I have used this product and plan to keep on buying it.</li>
    <li> I wholeheartedly recommend all L&#x27;Oreal products for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin. If I run out, my skin immediately shows that it &#x27;misses&#x27; the product. This particular item is best for me. My skin is visibly &#x27;smoother,&#x27; i.e., the lines in my face are much less prominent. I look young for my age, but when I look in the mirror, I&#x27;m very aware of the tell tale indications of my actual age, the things others don&#x27;t notice as much as I. THE SERUM IS INDISPENSABLE TO ME. I&#x27;D RATHER GO WITHOUT FOOD OR GAS - ALMOST, OF COURSE.&lt;br /&gt;My local chain drugstore has an incomplete supply of L&#x27;Oreal products; I never know what I&#x27;ll need that they won&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;I also save money when I purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My only slight &#x27;complaint&#x27; would be that the Amazon products are in slightly smaller amounts than I&#x27;m used to, and that the packaging implies otherwise; the packaging is significantly &#x27;larger&#x27; than it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I last purchased from Amazon, the 3 items I selected came from 3 different suppliers, so I paid more for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;But these are minor considerations, given that I love/need L&#x27;Oreal and can&#x27;t afford the pricier brands. I know these things can be immensely more expensive. L&#x27;Oreal isn&#x27;t cheap, but I can manage, and I have complete confidence, especially with the &#x27;Revitalift&#x27; items. I&#x27;ll never change, even if my acting career propels me into another level of affordability.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Had used before and so I knew exactly what I was looking for.  This is the one for me.</li>
    <li> It contains fine glitter and I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to be a skincare product, not cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it, I planned to use it at night as a special treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t want to wear glitter on my face when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can’t use it as a night treatment. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> I use a couple different skin creams for different concerns but this is my everyday one. My makeup goes on smooth and looks great all day.</li>
    <li> I loved the texture of this serum . It goes on easy and has no offensive odor.  Absorbs well and does not pill as many serum s will when you put the moisturizer on. Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Makes my wrinkles look less pronounced. I&#x27;d get it again. It goes on soft and smooth and sinks in to your skin very fast. Delightful stuff and it&#x27;s great for my skin. Gives you a gentle glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, and I must admit, it feels really great when I apply it. It soaks in well and leaves my face feeling soft and not greasy. Not sure I am seeing any wrinkle diminishment but at least they aren&#x27;t getting worse, and I do think it&#x27;s lifting my jowl area a bit. Even after using it night and day, there is still more than half a bottle left, so it lasts as while too.</li>
    <li> this really works i love this stuff and just bought some for my mother ..she is 73....but i can see results and it was like over night..use it with hyaluronic acid serum,,perfect together</li>
    <li> The Triple Power Concentrated Serum works beautiful and does everything it claims.  After only a few weeks of use, my skin feels smoother and firmer.  I have noticed lines being less noticeable and it has even helped even out my completion, which was an added bonus.  It appplies smoothly and absorbs within moments without any greasy residue.  I&#x27;ve noticed my moisturizer gliding on much smoother over the serum.  There is a mild perfume scent, but it honestly is not that strong and fades after only a few minutes.  This is definitely one of the better products out there for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days but first impression is not great. It leaves fine glitter all over my face and the fragrance is a bit much for a face product. I will use it up but I will continue my search for a better hyaluronic serum that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and doesn&#x27;t sprinkle glitter all over.</li>
    <li> This L&#x27;Oreal product is reasonably priced and does help my skin</li>
    <li> This product does more than a comparable $50 Clinique product. Unbelievable for 60 year old skin....it feels like it&#x27;s very young skin! Wrinkles are diminishing after two weeks of nightly use.</li>
    <li> Used it accordingly. It goes on fine and doesn&#x27;t clog my t zone. I have adult acne so it didn&#x27;t clog my pores but it was useless. felt silky like but did not absorb as well. I&#x27;m 43 - look late 30&#x27;s. This did absolutely nothing. Don&#x27;t buy it and I try everything.</li>
    <li> my love has come along. I have been looking for this type of product for a very long time. Have to run, Mr. Demill is ready for my closeup</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter, who really likes it and says it works well. Great price</li>
    <li> I recently bought from Amazon.com Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and Revitalift Concentrared Serum. My first impression was that both have a strong smell. I used that night RTP Deep-Acting Moisturizer before going to sleep and the next morning my husband looked at me as if I was Emily Rose!!! I woke up with a rash on my face and puffy eyes. I decided not to judge and test the Revitalift Concentrared Serum one week after but the same thing happened. I don&#x27;t have a sensible skin but guess both creams have a strong component that it&#x27;s making me an allergic reaction. These product are not for everyone!</li>
    <li> Happy with results using this product</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a change. I don&#x27;t use it every day now but when I did there was no dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Not greasy and does not clog pores.</li>
    <li> Listen ... Anything that has the L&#x27;Oreal name is the BEST!  This cream is perfect for for revitalizing tired skin!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re all looking for that one product that will give us the fountain of youth and allow us to look better &amp; will make us look much younger than we are.  I am 71 and we seniors need to accept the fact that there is no product that will do this.  The only way to make our face younger is a total face lift or to use lots of botox &amp; other fillers that, unfortunately, is very expensive. No serums or creams will do this . We need to understand this &amp; not keep spending money on products that will never do this.&lt;br /&gt;However, this L&#x27;Oreal product and others I have tried will at least give us perhaps a smoother face ---but they will not leave us with a face that looks the way a face lift will do.&lt;br /&gt;THE YOUNGER  YOU ARE THEN THIS PRODUCT WILL DEFINITELY HELP TO KEEP YOUR FACE LOOKING MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading something online on Glo.  I do like it.  It does seem to make my skin feel and look smoother.  I am a hit or miss kind of gal though, so who knows how good it could be if I actually used it as directed!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product for my skin I bought two bottles!!  It truly does target what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and excellent packaging, wrapped neatly in bubble wrap to protect it for the rough ride to HI!!  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This product is part of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s skin texture improvement program. I thought it worked well for me especially for the moderate price.</li>
    <li> Great product line! Convenient for me. Lightning fast shipper! Will be back if you keep the deals coming ,-]</li>
    <li> I tried both the loreal triple eye treatment and the concentrated serum.  My initial thought was that I LOVED both and the results.  However after a week of use both products began to sting and cause a rash on my face. My eyes are puffy and burn with the slightest touch! Very disappointed and my question is NOW WHAT?!?</li>
    <li> It does perform much like it says it will, except I do not see the re-densifying or plumping, maybe I need more time</li>
</ol>
