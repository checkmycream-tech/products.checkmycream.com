      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>They are traceable to just this kind of cosmetic.  </li>
      <li>This is a very fine Vitamin C scrub.</li>
      <li>First of all, it smells great, and you can&#x27;t argue with that.</li>
      <li>I have since suggested to others who are now pleased with the products too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why its been discontinued, but am glad I can still find it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>My favorite scrub.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I was glad that I found it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Aside from the environmental impact, it is probably not a substance that is healthy for your skin.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years now and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love the consistencey, and the warmth it gives, and the G L O W.............2-3 times a week is plenty with this</li>
      <li>I have been spending way more for Epicuren scrubs, which are great, but I have a new staple now!</li>
      <li>In fact, it always feels like my medication is being absorbed much more effectively after I use this scrub.</li>
      <li>It actually is warm when you first apply it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable and has just the right consistency (very fine granules like sand).</li>
      <li>I wish it was still available in stores</li>
      <li>If you like a very instense scrub (which I personally do) than this is the best.</li>
      <li>Good for a weekly deep clean.</li>
      <li>LOVE the whole product line.</li>
      <li>and it really helps my skin appear more even and fresher .  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay pretty good money for really high quality stuff.</li>
      <li>Secondly, it&#x27;s a fairly fine scrub -- gentle in that it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive...</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin for most part as a point.</li>
      <li>Overall, one of the best scrubs on the market for half the price of brand name scrubs</li>
      <li>scrub has very tiny beads that is warm when first applied and then cools and as you gently scrub it in a circular motion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty snobby when it comes to face products.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this mircro facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>and it keeps my face clean and clear.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling extremely soft and clean.</li>
      <li>After suffering through about a year without it, it dawned on me to go to AMAZON to find my long lost love.</li>
      <li>I do like their apple facial scrub better than this particular product.  </li>
      <li>The exfoliating beads are TINY, which I love because it makes for a much more thorough exfoliation than you get with other scrubs (like St. Ives Apricot, etc.).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily as two to three times a week is fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really scrubby but not damaging.</li>
      <li>It makes my face soft (which makes my make-up look better) and it has helped to eliminate the red pigment scars I have.</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
      <li>and so your body continues to regenerate new skin !</li>
      <li>I used to be able to purchase it at my drugstore but am having trouble finding it anywhere but online.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, not too sensitive, but gets rough pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft, fresh and not dry.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling like new since it exfoliates so well.</li>
      <li>My face feels refreshed and rejuvinated with no harsh, abrasive redness.</li>
      <li>This scrub gives immediate results - my skin has never felt so soft.</li>
      <li>It seems to polish the skin leaving my skin feeling so soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scrub is slightly warming, and as you lightly rub, crystals dissolve, and as stated above, my senitive skin sings with delight after applying moisture cream directly after.</li>
      <li>sure,  you&#x27;ll be a little pink,  but you have to remove the dead skin so your other products work better</li>
      <li>and I alternate with my Sirius Sonic Sensitive Brush........LOVE,Love,love!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m guessing the polyethylene beads are partly responsible as I can&#x27;t see any other ingredients that would induce this reaction.</li>
      <li>Love this scrub, have used it for a long time, the beads are small enough to scrub the face and neck really thoroughly but not too small.</li>
      <li>That being said it can be harsh and make your face pretty red for a while.</li>

    <li> My mom gave me this scrub as a gift &amp; it is Amazing! I&#x27;m 32 and have very rough skin. This scrub gives immediate results - my skin has never felt so soft. My makeup goes on easier &amp; lasts longer. The only flaw is you&#x27;re not supposed to use it every day - it&#x27;s tough not to! Try this product out - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this scrub! If you like a very instense scrub (which I personally do) than this is the best. I have acne-prone skin as well as some hyper-pigmentation, and this scrub has improved my skin dramatically. It makes my face soft (which makes my make-up look better) and it has helped to eliminate the red pigment scars I have. I use it every other night before bed. When I wake up my skin is glowing.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub, have used it for a long time, the beads are small enough to scrub the face and neck really thoroughly but not too small. Overall, one of the best scrubs on the market for half the price of brand name scrubs</li>
    <li> Seam on tube split, wasting a lot of the product. I&#x27;d send it back for replacement but I threw away the box!</li>
    <li> Price of the product was awesome! This product is great to smooth your face. It helps with acne brake-outs. I use it three times a week. Along with other C. Booth Derma products.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this product for a while now and like it as much today as in the past. I don&#x27;t understand why its been discontinued, but am glad I can still find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Makes my skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily as two to three times a week is fine. Leaves my skin soft, fresh and not dry. LOVE the whole product line.</li>
    <li> I have used this scrub for over six years. I say it is a well- kept secret. I am 56 and for years had dry patches, periodic breakouts and other annoyances on my face. I use this 3 times a week and it keeps my face clean and clear. I used to be able to purchase it at my drugstore but am having trouble finding it anywhere but online. I hope they continue to make it as I would be lost without it. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is good for anyone who has acne prone skin. It fights acne and is loaded with vitamin c for the skin</li>
    <li> I used this before and the one I got from amazon smell different and is fake and it does not work. I will never buy it again. I will go to store and buy it. do not buy it online.</li>
    <li> Nice product but it contains plastic beads, very bad for our lakes and streams the fish eat it and they are dying off, starving thinking they are food, please change to organic exfoliation</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say this: my local pharmacy STOPPED carrying this go-to AMAZEBALLS dermabrasion scrub and I was at a loss. After suffering through about a year without it, it dawned on me to go to AMAZON to find my long lost love. My face is so so happy again.&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is slightly warming, and as you lightly rub, crystals dissolve, and as stated above, my senitive skin sings with delight after applying moisture cream directly after. No rashes, no acne, just plain and simple amazingness.</li>
    <li> I have been spending way more for Epicuren scrubs, which are great, but I have a new staple now! I love the consistencey, and the warmth it gives, and the G L O W.............2-3 times a week is plenty with this and I alternate with my Sirius Sonic Sensitive Brush........LOVE,Love,love!</li>
    <li> and end up in our rivers and lakes.  The Great Lakes have quantities of these resilient beads in the water and in the fish.  They are traceable to just this kind of cosmetic.  I did not read carefully when I purchased the tube!</li>
    <li> I have been using this face scrub for a few years. It&#x27;s affordable and has just the right consistency (very fine granules like sand). Knowing it has brightening vitamin C is a plus.</li>
    <li> I feel it&#x27;s the best scrub on the market. It&#x27;s a tough scrub and it really helps my skin appear more even and fresher .  I wish it was still available in stores but I guess it has been discontinued :(</li>
    <li> My favorite scrub. It has the really tiny beads. Like baking soda that doesn&#x27;t dissolve. Those are hard to find.</li>
    <li> The scrub particles dissolved which is weird considering I needed scrub to polish my face. The scrub itself was itchy and left my face red in patches. I do not have sensitive skin for most part as a point. Really disliked this!!</li>
    <li> I used to by this at Ulta but I can no longer find it anywhere.I was glad that I found it here on Amazon. This is a very fine Vitamin C scrub. I used to use an apricot scrub but it felt so coarse and rough on my face. This C.Booth scrub has very tiny beads that is warm when first applied and then cools and as you gently scrub it in a circular motion. It seems to polish the skin leaving my skin feeling so soft. My only complaint is that these beads used in the face scrub do not dissolve and are not biodegradable. I didn&#x27;t know this until a few months ago. Reports of these tiny beads are showing up in our waters and I&#x27;m not cool with that. I decided to invest in a clarisonic as an exfoliator and I&#x27;ve never been happier. Cuts down on a lot of facial products that I need/used .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty snobby when it comes to face products.  I&#x27;m willing to pay pretty good money for really high quality stuff. This scrub is amazing!!! I have combination skin, not too sensitive, but gets rough pretty quickly. I need to exfoliate a lot. This scrub made my face baby-soft and it smells great AND it&#x27;s a great price. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great scrub for me.  My face feels refreshed and rejuvinated with no harsh, abrasive redness.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now, and it&#x27;s one of my all-time favorites. My face is prone to dryness, peeling, and flaking, especially in the winter. I use this scrub 1-3 times per week at night, and it totally eliminates the problem. It leaves skin feeling extremely soft and clean. The exfoliating beads are TINY, which I love because it makes for a much more thorough exfoliation than you get with other scrubs (like St. Ives Apricot, etc.). That being said it can be harsh and make your face pretty red for a while. I don&#x27;t recommend using it immediately before going out in public. I use several prescription creams for acne. This product has never interacted with my acne or my other facial products. In fact, it always feels like my medication is being absorbed much more effectively after I use this scrub. I just wish this product was easier to find in stores - thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years now and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s feels like a dermabrasion because of the tiny micro beads&lt;br /&gt;and the vitamin c in it. It actually is warm when you first apply it. Leaves your skin feeling like new since it exfoliates so well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mircro facial scrub.  I use it 2 times a week, because it cleans so deep and I don&#x27;t want to wash off any of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; oils on my skin.  A little goes a long way.  My face feels like a babies bottom everytime after I use it.  Good for a weekly deep clean. My skin is pretty sensitive but I have not had a problem.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub! It&#x27;s really scrubby but not damaging. I am always on the search for scrubs that actually work and this one does.</li>
    <li> The problem I have with this scrub is that after rubbing it together, an exothermic chemical reaction takes place. I haven&#x27;t done enough research on this but I&#x27;m guessing the polyethylene beads are partly responsible as I can&#x27;t see any other ingredients that would induce this reaction. There is no mention of this in the product description, which I find puzzling. Maybe this is why it is discontinued??? Aside from the environmental impact, it is probably not a substance that is healthy for your skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff works,  just don&#x27;t use more than once a week,  wonderful on hands as well.  we all must exfoliate,  whether we like it or not,  this product is a good one to use.  sure,  you&#x27;ll be a little pink,  but you have to remove the dead skin so your other products work better and so your body continues to regenerate new skin !</li>
    <li> I like C Booth products.  I do like their apple facial scrub better than this particular product.  If you want to exfoliate try the other product.</li>
    <li> I stock up on this product. I have since suggested to others who are now pleased with the products too.</li>
    <li> I love this exfoliator-- First of all, it smells great, and you can&#x27;t argue with that. Secondly, it&#x27;s a fairly fine scrub -- gentle in that it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive... but I&#x27;d still recommend doing it at night as opposed to before going out!</li>
    <li> Best scrub for the money</li>
</ol>
