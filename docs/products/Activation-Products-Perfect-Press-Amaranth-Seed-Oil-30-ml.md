    <li> I have used Amaranth oil on my face and hands and have found it to be the best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> Although it is expensive, this is a must for me to use. My sister&#x27;s family who live in Japan use it regularly and find it helpful to control radiation problem. I use it reguraly and it has been a great help when I go to Japan. The first time I went after the Fukushima nuclear power plant erruption and came back, Hado machine checked out a lot of radiation in my digestive system. When I learned of the Amaranth oil, I took it with me for the following business trips and Hado machine checked me out fine following my return. I also found the oil to be useful to maintain my heath. I really appreciate the product. I wish I could get the monthly sign up of the oild.</li>
    <li> I have only been using for 1month so no valuable review yet.  Will continue to use to see if there is an improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> Really impressed with the product. Improved energy levels, and sleep was better.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as intended. Great for facial hydration when applied directly and clearing out the nasal passages when held under the tongue. A little goes a long way. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Amaranth Seed Oil is having a very pronounced effect on aging knees; much easier and pain free to use stairs. Will likely keep using permanently.</li>
    <li> Excellent  for women  who suffer  from  Bacteria  Vaginosis.This product is good  for  numerous  things.Also i use  it  for  a  Face  Moisturizer.EXCELLENT  PRODUCT MONEY 💰WELL  SPENT!!! 😀👍💖</li>
    <li> This oil is very anti-inflammatory.  It helps heal wounds and is good to put on your face after washing it.  A drop or two of this mixed with a drop or two of oceans alive rubbed on your face after washing is really good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Nice tasting and I feel that my immune system has improved.</li>
    <li> Tastes and smells great</li>
    <li> I am well pleased with this product,a might pricey.</li>
    <li> Too expensive will not buy again until it comes down in price.</li>
    <li> This oil helped heal my mouth pain, took the sting away from my sunburn, healed the deep razor cut on my ankle, removed a dark brown spot on my nose, took he itch away from a mosquito bite &amp; healed the beginning of a yeast infection in 24hrs. I also take 15 drops in my morning tea for Energy. It&#x27;s expensive but worth the purchase. It really works, honestly.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  I had heard about it on a Healthy Skin Summit so decided to order and give it a try.  I put it on my face after my toner and before my moisturizer. I also put a dropper in my mouth to ingest (it tastes great).  Any left on my fingers I put on any skin issue I have on my body. My acne has gone away on my face, and it seems to help any other skin issue I have as well.  I love the fact that I am putting something on  my skin that I can also eat - healthy and helpful!  I can&#x27;t imagine ever stopping using this magic elixir!</li>
    <li> Good for you the best very healthy</li>
    <li> I bought this Amaranth oil after a friend recommended it for my arthritis which was very painful. It could possibly be the best health investment I have ever made! I have been using it for a month now and the flexibility in my hands has returned and I am almost completely pain free! I  use it on the lines on my face and can tell a big difference, I also had a painful fever blister starting on my lip which never formed after using this oil on it. The  difference I have experience in my brain function is truly amazing, after about a week I noticed my memory was  a lot better and I no longer am having to take my ADHD medicine, I also have  more energy and a sense of well being that I have never had before. What a blessing this life changing oil has been to my health, I would give it 10 stars if I could-</li>
    <li> This product is easy to take, tastes good and appears to be improving skin texture--smoother and less sun spots.  Internally, too soon to know.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can see visible results: reduction in wrinkles and bags.</li>
    <li> Made my partner feel better....</li>
