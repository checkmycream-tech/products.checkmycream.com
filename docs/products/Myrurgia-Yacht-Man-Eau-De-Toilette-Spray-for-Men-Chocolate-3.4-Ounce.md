      <li>Dad loved it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my Purchase Myrurgia Yacht Man Toilette Spray for Men&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>The product is great love the smell but know that it doesnt work for everyone.</li>
      <li>Mist from the bottle is very fine</li>
      <li>Better than nothing :)</li>
      <li>and I love love love it.</li>
      <li>and you will surely have a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t the real thing when I ordered it, and I&#x27;m happy with what I got.</li>
      <li>Amazing scent, not overbearing yet very distinct</li>
      <li>is a lotion that smells very rich and one, highly recommended, very economical later I will be buying more, very good seller</li>
      <li>And since I don&#x27;t know what the original smell is, I am living my life wearing it.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume, not the original, and I advise you not to buy this..</li>
      <li>It smells nothing like chocolate but still smells nice,fresh,and clean.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product specially knowing that I did not get the original.</li>
      <li>Loved it my second bottle</li>
      <li>had no scent, the bottle was full and the trigger that pumps cologne up stop working.</li>
      <li>The size and the price is unbeatable and you should take advantage of the full line as I did.</li>
      <li>I buy on amazon mainly because of this and this makes me confident to shop online.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell even remotely like chocolate; but more of a bright floral over moss blend.&lt;br /&gt;The label doesn&#x27;t give anything away in regards to the mystery</li>
      <li>Not very long lasting, nevertheless very pleasant.</li>
      <li>It was what it said, it was on time, it was in an unopened package, it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>Normally, Amazon sells items that are original.</li>
      <li>the Price of this Toilette Spray was very much Affordable</li>
      <li>Very Well::!</li>
      <li>The cap was flimsy, the letters on the package cover did not match with the original ones (I have two more Yacht Man brand perfumes, one red &amp; the other blue) and the cap was made of some cheap material that made it way too easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t wear this one very often.</li>
      <li>I like it soo Much,</li>
      <li>Scent was nice though didn&#x27;t smell like chocolate and didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
      <li>Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
      <li>Upon first spray I detect some spice and cocoa notes which are not too sweet and a little on the powdery side.</li>
      <li>so you may need to spray more than usual.</li>
      <li>Normal and cheap serve for everyday.</li>
      <li>Not heavy overpowering.</li>
      <li>They stopped spraying and with even changing the tops, I was still not able to enjoy the cologne that was purchased</li>
      <li>I lack the expertise to explain the sense of smell using my limited vocabulary, but too much of it</li>
      <li>Not a very complex fragrance, but that&#x27;s expected for this price range.</li>

<li> /&gt;It does remind me of a scent from the past; but I can&#x27;t begin to guess what that scent was.&lt;br</li>
<li> i am opened the box i found broken cover and smell only a few seconds , and, unfortunately, I can not do a return to the company</li>
<li> it is too bad ,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t wear this one very often. but, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> It could have been stronger, but then I absorb cologne like a sponge.</li>
    <li> Were given as a gift for a family member.</li>
    <li> had no scent, the bottle was full and the trigger that pumps cologne up stop working.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of the Yacht Man products.  The last 4 that I purchased were defected.  They stopped spraying and with even changing the tops, I was still not able to enjoy the cologne that was purchased so I had no choice but to throw them away.</li>
    <li> For all you mystery fans out there, todays question is \\&quot;Why is this Product labeled CHOCOLATE???\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell even remotely like chocolate; but more of a bright floral over moss blend.&lt;br /&gt;The label doesn&#x27;t give anything away in regards to the mystery either.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is it&#x27;s called chocolate because the box is BROWN.&lt;br /&gt;It does remind me of a scent from the past; but I can&#x27;t begin to guess what that scent was.&lt;br /&gt;If you like bright floral, mossy cologne this one is not bad.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for Chocolate, this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, not overbearing yet very distinct</li>
    <li> Delicious fragrance for men.</li>
    <li> severely affecting my health&lt;br /&gt;Please contact the provider&lt;br /&gt;ASK&lt;br /&gt;at this moment that product I&lt;br /&gt;produced&lt;br /&gt;fever, shortness of breath&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>

    <li> It smells nothing like chocolate but still smells nice,fresh,and clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it</li>
    <li> Loved it my second bottle</li>

    <li> The product is great love the smell but know that it doesnt work for everyone. The size and the price is unbeatable and you should take advantage of the full line as I did. Great product.</li>
    <li> Normally, Amazon sells items that are original. I buy on amazon mainly because of this and this makes me confident to shop online. However, this perfume was a knockoff. The cap was flimsy, the letters on the package cover did not match with the original ones (I have two more Yacht Man brand perfumes, one red &amp; the other blue) and the cap was made of some cheap material that made it way too easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t return it. I am using it. And since I don&#x27;t know what the original smell is, I am living my life wearing it. The smell does last long. I lack the expertise to explain the sense of smell using my limited vocabulary, but too much of it and you will surely have a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product specially knowing that I did not get the original. I will post some pictures to convince you.</li>
    <li> This has nothing to do with chocolate except the color of the box!</li>
    <li> I like it soo Much, Smell Very Well::! Buy again</li>
    <li> it is too bad ,&lt;br /&gt;When i am opened the box i found broken cover and smell only a few seconds , and, unfortunately, I can not do a return to the company</li>
    <li> Upon first spray I detect some spice and cocoa notes which are not too sweet and a little on the powdery side. After a few minutes, it settles down to a musky scent. Ideal for fall/winter season. Not a very complex fragrance, but that&#x27;s expected for this price range. Mist from the bottle is very fine so you may need to spray more than usual.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume, not the original, and I advise you not to buy this..ya kupil etu eto ne orginal,zapax dermo!!!</li>
    <li> otimo product I recommend.</li>
    <li> A great collection of  cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the entire collection and must say it&#x27;s been a valuable addition to my travel kit!!</li>
    <li> Scent was nice though didn&#x27;t smell like chocolate and didn&#x27;t last long at all. Would not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Not very long lasting, nevertheless very pleasant. I can recommend it - especially at the price point that is offered</li>
