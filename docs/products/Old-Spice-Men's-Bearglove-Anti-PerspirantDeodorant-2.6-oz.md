### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Smells great!</li>
      <li>Keeps me smelling good!!</li>
      <li>This deo is freakin awesome.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a great antiperspirant/deodorant for my son, who is in marching band.</li>
      <li>The combination of sweet and musk scents are perfect, and the scent lasts all day.</li>
      <li>My favorite smell and deodorant!</li>
      <li>My boyfriend is out of state and purchased this deodorant and mentioned how much he liked it, so when hitting the store I found it to get an idea of what he smells like.</li>
      <li>Smells awesome, and as a person who sweats waterfalls under his pits, works very well to ease up the sweat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my nose would be glued to my boyfriend if he were here wearing it @_@ absolutely awesome smell!!</li>
      <li>I will say that my girlfriend has complimented on how good I smell, and since I don’t wear cologne, I owe it all to the sweet aroma being exuded from</li>
      <li>I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t break me out in a rash like some deodorants do.</li>
      <li>and I use it, love it</li>
      <li>but I lean more towards the wolfthorn.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and fresh.</li>
      <li>I approve of this one the most.</li>
      <li>the better is.  </li>
      <li>Great new smell...love it!</li>
      <li>far as how it performs—they work great.  </li>
      <li>Apply sparingly, as the scent might be too strong.</li>
      <li>The primary scent that comes to mind is honeydew melon.  </li>
      <li>Lol Can&#x27;t always find this scent in my local store</li>
      <li>Besides, I like to smell more fresh, relaxed, and clean vs. spicy or musky.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s undertones of fruit, sure, but there&#x27;s a bit of bite and crispness to the scent that makes it more masculine.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a rather clean bear that has been rolling around in the chokeberry patch, this is the antiperspirant for you.</li>
      <li>It does a good job like most Old Spice Wild collection AP.</li>
      <li>Super clean smell.</li>
      <li>I like this sweet smelling scent</li>
      <li>so once you find the kind you like, sit back and let Amazon deliver man-smelling-stuff right to your front door!</li>
      <li>I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I have noticed that they are not always available where I normally shop</li>
      <li>I successfully arm-wrestled a bear, I grew a foot taller, and my diet now consists purely of raw salmon and maple syrup.</li>
      <li>First of all.</li>
      <li>It will take getting used too after first time.  </li>
      <li>When I’m getting ready in the morning, I find myself asking myself (err, Austin Powers!), “What do I feel like today?  </li>
      <li>I love the new line of Old Spice antiperspirant/deodorants, and Hawkridge, Bearglove, and Wolfthorn are some of my favorites.  </li>
      <li>Kept me dry and smelling fly during a tradeshow in 106 degree Vegas, as well as a week long trip to 100 degree+humid Houston.</li>
      <li>Rubbed it on my wrist when I got home before going to bed and found that this was absolutely intoxicating.</li>
      <li>If you’re a dude like me, you probably never gave much thought to what you were smearing on your armpit—</li>
      <li>Its not strong, but if you want strong, I suggest either the new &amp;#34;Lionpride&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Fiji&amp;#34;, those are strong.</li>
      <li>This thing last almost 2 full days, even after a shower at night dont have to apply again.  </li>
      <li>Seemed most others did too as the Bearglove only had one left on the shelf!</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s particular about scents and his deo.</li>
      <li>Must smell to like it but be warned more then 1 application may give those few a headache.  </li>
      <li>They all have a distinct enough aroma that’ll make you pause and give thought to what sort of man-animal you want to smell like for the day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m making Bearglove my new scent.</li>
      <li>This is the only scent my son wants me to buy!</li>
      <li>(OK, I’m joking—I have socks on, too) and this Old Spice stuff keeps me dry and smelling un-offensive all day long.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s 18 years old</li>
      <li>Maybe it was the Old Spice commercials, maybe it was the Old Spice packaging, or maybe it was just the fact that these were stocked on the shelves at my eye-level</li>
      <li>If I have one minor quibble, the smell is maybe just a little strong; I can still smell it on myself at least a good hour after applying, but that quibble is too minor to make it lose any stars.  </li>
      <li>It is fruity smelling like Wolfthorn, but somewhat less sweet; more like fresh, natural fruit than the artificial candy smell of Wolfthorn.  </li>
      <li>I say that is on previous brand of old spice, it would get on pillow and turn it colorful.</li>
      <li>Can stand up to night sweats, really well for me and less I use at night</li>

<li> I’m not going to even try to explain what it smells like, because I would do a horrible job at it, but suffice to say it just smells good.  </li>

<li> let me say that, like with the Wolfthorn products, there is a really odd disconnect between the scent and the marketing.  </li>
<li> and I have a little sweat on my forehead</li>

<li> Heck, I’m sitting at Everest base camp right now wearing nothing but boxers in a chair made of snowballs</li>

    <li> This is the only scent my son wants me to buy! Plus, it&#x27;s a great antiperspirant/deodorant for my son, who is in marching band. No need for any body sprays or cologne. He&#x27;s 18 years old and he&#x27;s particular about scents and his deo. Lol Can&#x27;t always find this scent in my local store so I stock up here.</li>
    <li> Great new smell...love it!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, and as a person who sweats waterfalls under his pits, works very well to ease up the sweat. Definitely am buying again.</li>

Maybe it was the Old Spice commercials, maybe it was the Old Spice packaging, or maybe it was just the fact that these were stocked on the shelves at my eye-level and I didn’t have to bend over to read the label, but I picked up one of these and gave it a smell—wow.  I’m not going to even try to explain what it smells like, because I would do a horrible job at it, but suffice to say it just smells good.  It’s one of those things that you just have to smell for yourself.  I will say that my girlfriend has complimented on how good I smell, and since I don’t wear cologne, I owe it all to the sweet aroma being exuded from my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy yourself one of each.  When I’m getting ready in the morning, I find myself asking myself (err, Austin Powers!), “What do I feel like today?  Bearglove?  Wolfthorn? Hawkridge?”  They all have a distinct enough aroma that’ll make you pause and give thought to what sort of man-animal you want to smell like for the day.  Although, I imagine if I bumped into a bear in the woods he probably wouldn’t smell anything like my deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it performs—they work great.  I “perspire” a lot.  Heck, I’m sitting at Everest base camp right now wearing nothing but boxers in a chair made of snowballs and I have a little sweat on my forehead (OK, I’m joking—I have socks on, too) and this Old Spice stuff keeps me dry and smelling un-offensive all day long.  I always use the antiperspirant/deodorant combo, the ones with the silver-colored caps—the red colored caps are just deodorant.  I have noticed the deodorant-only type doesn’t have quite the same smell (and doesn’t smell as nice) as the antiperspirant/deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you’re shopping, give these a try.

    <li> Just bought and daddy likes. Kept me dry and smelling fly during a tradeshow in 106 degree Vegas, as well as a week long trip to 100 degree+humid Houston.</li>
    <li> My favorite smell and deodorant!</li>
    <li> Smells great! I bought these for my husband and ended up using it too!</li>
    <li> First of all. let me say that, like with the Wolfthorn products, there is a really odd disconnect between the scent and the marketing.  Nothing about this smell puts me in mind of a fearsome grizzly bear.  Getting past this, however, I really like this product.  It is fruity smelling like Wolfthorn, but somewhat less sweet; more like fresh, natural fruit than the artificial candy smell of Wolfthorn.  The primary scent that comes to mind is honeydew melon.  It may not be an overtly manly smell, but I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments wearing this and women seem to like it.  Besides, I like to smell more fresh, relaxed, and clean vs. spicy or musky.  As an antiperspirant and deodorant, this one does the job.  If I have one minor quibble, the smell is maybe just a little strong; I can still smell it on myself at least a good hour after applying, but that quibble is too minor to make it lose any stars.  I&#x27;m making Bearglove my new scent.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, it smells fruity with a touch of sharpness. Its not strong, but if you want strong, I suggest either the new &amp;#34;Lionpride&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Fiji&amp;#34;, those are strong.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is out of state and purchased this deodorant and mentioned how much he liked it, so when hitting the store I found it to get an idea of what he smells like. I tested all of the scents in the line, save for Lionspride, and out of all of them.. I approve of this one the most. Seemed most others did too as the Bearglove only had one left on the shelf! After realizing that my nose was glued to the deodorant for over two minutes I decided to buy it. Rubbed it on my wrist when I got home before going to bed and found that this was absolutely intoxicating. To me, the scent transported me into a lodge overlooking a mountain lake. There&#x27;s undertones of fruit, sure, but there&#x27;s a bit of bite and crispness to the scent that makes it more masculine. I&#x27;m pretty sure my nose would be glued to my boyfriend if he were here wearing it @_@ absolutely awesome smell!!</li>
    <li> Great...perfect smell....long lasting...</li>
    <li> Got this for hubby and kids, and it&#x27;s SO much better than the axe crap they were wearing before.  Actually smells a bit girly (but don&#x27;t tell THEM that!)</li>
    <li> This is mostly personal, I did not like the smell of this antiperspirant at all. It does a good job like most Old Spice Wild collection AP.</li>
    <li> I like these scents and last a very long time and through a tough day of sweat.  I like this sweet smelling scent but I lean more towards the wolfthorn.  Not knocking this but taste is all subjective.</li>
    <li> Super clean smell. This deo is freakin awesome.</li>
    <li> Must smell to like it but be warned more then 1 application may give those few a headache.  It will take getting used too after first time.

    <li> I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t break me out in a rash like some deodorants do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I use it, love it</li>
    <li> I successfully arm-wrestled a bear, I grew a foot taller, and my diet now consists purely of raw salmon and maple syrup.</li>
    <li> Keeps me smelling good!!</li>
    <li> Smells good and fresh. Apply sparingly, as the scent might be too strong.</li>
