<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My 4 year-old Conair died a couple of weeks ago, and I purchased a Conair replacement shortly after.  It was a cheap piece of garbage and made my hair fuzzy.  I decided maybe I needed to buy something a little &amp;#34;meatier,&amp;#34; and this dryer is the ticket.  I did a lot of research - looked up the dryers that are rated well both on Amazon and other sources (Allure).  While I was willing to spend a bit more, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to go over the $100 mark for another dryer that I hadn&#x27;t tried in the past. The Elchim fit the bill - rated well (Allure top pick two years in a year), well-rated on Amazon, and $80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect!  My hair is short, so not making my hair fuzzy is a bigger concern than drying my hair quickly (although I&#x27;m very happy with the dry time).  I also wanted something that would be HOT, even on a low speed setting (although the two settings are supposed to be independent, my Conair is lukewarm on low speed).  I love this dryer, and my hair is back to having body, and not just looking like a fuzzy mess.  I will recommend to friends, and I would buy again in a minute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh!  And it&#x27;s also relatively quiet.  Even my 14-year-old son commented on how quiet it was compared to my Conairs.</li>
    <li> best dryer ever! time saver, and eliminates frizz, and changed my hair from &amp;#34;drab to fab&amp;#34; :)!</li>
    <li> Jet engine-like. Dries your hair quickly and has held up for 4 months now with daily use. I would never look at another hair dryer, especially given the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> If you want it to de-frizz and smooth your hair and straighten it then it is a 5 star purchase.</li>
    <li> I had owned the same Elchim hair dryer for 13 years.  It made blow-drying fast and easy.  So when my old Elchim finally died, I purchased this Elchim.  This one is even better.  Drying my medium length hair is very quick, and this newer model is relatively quiet for the power that is behind it. I believe it even weighs less than my previous model. I highly recommend this brand of hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not everything that it promised but is quiet and not heavy.</li>
    <li> Dryer does not put out the heat as compared to the dryer it is replacing.  Blows strong but not hot enough.  The $20 Conair at Costco puts out more heat than this product.</li>
    <li> Just received The Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer and am very pleased with product. Dryer is quiet and hair dried much quicker than before.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this dryer for past 6 years almost everyday and it never had any problems, better yet, still going strong!</li>
    <li> I have short hair and love the Elchim hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve used it continuously for over a month now and really like the way it handles and dries my hair.  I can create styles from soft waves to spikes because the dryer sends such an even blast of hot air, concentrating at the roots.  Slower dryers cause over-working of the hair because by the time the hair is dry there is simply no style left... it&#x27;s been pushed, turned and brushed so much it&#x27;s just limp and lifeless.  Not so with the Elchim.  I can just use my fingers, a styling brush or no brush at all to achieve a great look.  It cuts the time I spend getting ready for work in half.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but a little extra time in the morning is a nice thing.  The Elchim is a bit expensive, but worth it.  Based on other reviewers&#x27; comments, I never wrap the cord around the unit, just snake it back into the drawer bending the cord in the same way it was shipped.  If I had the space, I would probably hang the dryer by the hook that is part of the unit.  I like it.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever bought.  It has cut my drying time in half and it is so much quieter than any other dryer I have ever used.  It was worth every penny!!!!!</li>
    <li> Despite the hype on this product, do not expect less frizz-- it is not one of those specifically ionic ones.  My sister who has used this product and some cheap ionic one, said that she had better results with other blow-dryers.  Ionic blow-dryers give my thick hair a smoother, healthier result, but this blow-dryer does no wonders.      Blow-drying time is also not very short (I have long, semi-thick hair and it takes FOREVER to blow-dry...  air dry only takes slightly more than double the blow dry time.   Can you blame me for not liking to use this blow-dryer?).  I like the cool setting, but other than that, nothing cool.  I can&#x27;t believe I invested into this blow-dryer!      On the other hand, it seems to be reliable and may last a while.... but all of my cheaper blow-dryers did last a while also (in fact, I still have them but I wanted an upgrade).    I like the separate vent cleaner.  No more clogged vents!  That feature and the easy to use cool feature make this product better than my previous cheap one.  I feel that this was a poor investment.      I have no idea how the other reviewers got great results, but my great results came with great products.</li>
    <li> Great Hair Dryer.  I bought this for my wife after her hair dresser said she just bought her replacement that lasted 7 years at the salon.  Easy to use and alot of power.</li>
    <li> So far, I have been pleased with the purchase.  If that changes, I will come back and adjust my review.</li>
    <li> Love this. I am a hairdresser and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I would prefer it to be all black...but red / black is fun too. :) kicks butt on long hair with no damage, no frizz. !</li>
    <li> Product good but horrible seller</li>
    <li> This is the best blowdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned! It&#x27;s super powerful and it gets really hot, which is perfect for my type of hair.  My hair looks great when the weather&#x27;s dry, but as soon as there&#x27;s humidity, my hair gets spongy and wavy frizzy.  This dryer straightens my hair no matter what the weather is like. I love it so far. I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, so  hoping it lasts a long time. It also came sooner than I expected, in just 2 days! The price is good too. It sells for at least  $40 more in the salons or beauty supply stores. (I checked!)</li>
    <li> My first \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; hair dryer. It really does dry faster, leaves my hair in better shape, and is amazingly quiet.</li>
    <li> My nickname for this hairdryer is \\&quot;Old Sparky.\\&quot; More on that later. I purchased this dryer because I have extremely thick hair. It is fine in texture, but there is a LOT of it and it always took me literally hours to dry it. Add to that a tendency to wave and frizz at the slightest hint of humidity, and you get the picture. I have tried all sorts of dryers from the very cheap to the very expensive, and none seemed to make an appreciable difference in drying time. Then, I moved to a new city and found a wonderful stylist who recommended Elchim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I love about the dryer: it dries my hair quickly! Yup, I never thought I&#x27;d find one that could but this baby sizzles. It gets VERY hot, so hot that my husband calls it the \\&quot;Heat Gun\\&quot; and threatens to carry it off and put it to some kind of industrial use in his workshop. It is actually a very simple machine: two buttons only (one controls heat, one controls force) but has a cool, sports-car kind of design (it IS from Italy, after all). This dryer is substantial, even heavy, and the cord is smooth &amp; thick and will resist getting twisted up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why did I give this hairdryer 4 instead of 5 stars? Let us revisit the nickname: every time I change the setting on one of the buttons (say, if I want to go from gale-force drying to gentle breeze) a spark lights up INSIDE the casing. I was naturally alarmed the first few times this happened, but then it didn&#x27;t seem to be affecting performance and it hasn&#x27;t proven to be dangerous (the dryer is now about a year old) so I accepted it as a quirk -- again, it is from Italy, not Germany. But still, it is a bit disconcerting when Old Sparky lights up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the designer in his or her infinite wisdom placed the buttons on the part of the handle where your fingers grip (you can see this in the photo), so occasionally I inadvertently change the setting. This is mildly irritating, but it bears mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have great fondness for this dryer since it has helped me to get ready a LOT faster in the morning, and it seems to be pretty durable (I travel a lot and even though it is large, I honestly would not go on a trip without it). Perhaps mine is the only one that sparks, and I should have probably contacted the manufacturer about it, but I just couldn&#x27;t be bothered. Even with its flaws, the bottom line is: it works!lped me to get ready a LOT faster in the morning, and it seems to be pretty durable (I travel a lot and even though it is large, I honestly would not go on a trip without it). Perhaps mine is the only one that sparks, and I should have probably contacted the manufacturer about it, but I just couldn&#x27;t be bothered. Even with its flaws, the bottom line is: it works!</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the money.  It&#x27;s very heavy, very very loud and doesn&#x27;t make a noticable difference in the drying time of my hair.  It&#x27;s no better or worse than the typical $20 conair or revlon dryer.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, coarse hair that frizzes horrendously.  I have to completely and forcefully dry it in order to tame it down.  I&#x27;ve bought dozens of blow dryers in my lifetime to battle my hair, most from the drugstore.  Despite having consistently mediocre-to-poor experiences with these cheapies, I stupidly found myself continuing to buy them.  I have no fewer than 4 unused Conairs relegated to the hall closet because they don&#x27;t perform acceptably.  And that&#x27;s in addition to the countless ones that I&#x27;ve thrown away when they broke.      So I finally decided to change tactics and buy a higher end model.  My hair stylist recommended the Elchim brand, as that&#x27;s what they use in the salon I go to (Vidal Sassoon salon).  It&#x27;s definitely a step up from the Conair, but there are some things I don&#x27;t love about it.    Things I Like:  -Good, strong air flow  -Feels Solid - plastic feels strong and not flimsy.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so it remains to be seen how durable it is compared to the drugstore cheapies, but it feels like it won&#x27;t break as quickly.  -Long cord so you can move around as needed  -3 settings each for air flow and heat    Things I Don&#x27;t Like:  -Hottest setting is extremely hot.  I burned my finger by touching MY HAIR after drying a lock on the hottest setting!  Unfortunately, the medium setting isn&#x27;t quite hot enough.  So I&#x27;ve been using the hottest setting and moving it around fast so it doesn&#x27;t heat up one area long enough to fry my hair or my fingers.  It&#x27;s tiring and I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair long term.  -No cool shot.    Overall, seems like a step up from the cheap drugstore dryers because the air flow is much better and it feels more durable (we&#x27;ll see if that proves true over time), but for some people it might not be worth paying twice as much.</li>
    <li> Dries hair quickly.  Has three levels of force and three heat settings- one setting is no heat which is great.  Good for long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser reccommended this dryer to me and it is good.  I have thick, coarse hair and it gets the job done a bit quicker than my old wall mounted Conair, which rocked because of it&#x27;s light weight and convenient location.  On the downside it is a bit heavy and the switches are right where your fingers go on the handle.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hair dryer. Its light weight. poweful, but doesn&#x27;t burn the hair. a great buy for any professional.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer on the market from what I can tell.  The first one of these died on me after 5 years of daily use.  I did not hesitate to buy another one.  My thick hair is lustrous and bouncy.</li>
    <li> Worth evey single penny. does not burn hair. Would order another one in a minute if it broke. I will never buy another cheap blow dryer again.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Purchased this for my wife. Dries it quick, makes it soft and not frizzy</li>
    <li> I purchased an Elchim blow dryer since all the hairdressers use them.  I have extremely fine and fragile hair and my last dryer was burning my hair and it was spewing sparks.  My siters had also purchased Elchim blow dryers so I thought I&#x27;d join in, especially since this was about half the price through Amazon.  But I guess like all products, there are top of the line items from companies as well as standard products.  This  is definitely not top of the line, not bottom of the barrel either, just average.  Pros- doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, is much quiter, the power is lower but more efficient and it has a loop that makes it easy to hang up.  Cons- doesn&#x27;t have a quick shot bottom for a shot of cold air.  Also, it takes a little getting use to the handle. (I&#x27;m contstantly changing the settings by mistake due to the placement of the nobs).  Overall, its better than what I had, but next time I&#x27;d upgrade to a more deluxe model.</li>
    <li> Hairdryer is heavier than I&#x27;m used to.  Controls are on handle and in the way.  Otherwise, it is just a hairdryer, no better or worse than others.  Could&#x27;ve spent less with same results.  Was disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Will keep it until it stops working.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s quiet and it makes my hair shiny.  It was a little bit expensive for a hair dryer but right now I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Elchim hair dryer.  I had my previous one for over 2 years.  I have really curly, frizzy hair and it straightens beautifully with the Elchim and a round brush.  It also cuts the time in half that it takes for me to blow it out.</li>
    <li> For the last couple of months I have researched and read reviews of every hair dryer imaginable on every website imaginable and finally settled on this hair dryer.  And I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25\\&quot; round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?  I love this hair dryer and I would give it 10 stars!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned and anyone who has come over and used it has remarked on how great the air stream is and how fast it dries.</li>
    <li> While my wife was using the Elchim Professional Type 2001 1500/1800W hair dryer to dry her hair, FLAMES - yes that&#x27;s right flames, not sparks - shot out of the base of the handle at the point where the power cord enters.    This was totally unexpected since the wire and handle showed no visible signs of damage.  Thankfully, my wife was not injured.  However, please be aware that this may occur with this dryer and could cause serious injury to someone.  My wife has had the dryer for 3 or 4 years and has not abused it.    I emailed Elchim to advise them of the problem and asked if they would like to test the dryer to see what may have caused it.  I told them I would be happy to send it to them if they sent me a prepaid shipping label.  After receiving no response, I sent a follow up email.  Still no response.    My only intention is to alert buyers/users of this potential danger so that no one gets hurt.</li>
    <li> Got the Elchim a few weeks ago and love it so far! Blows my curly hair out quickly and nice and smoothly. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife for her birthday and she loves it.  She said it dries her hair in 4 minutes</li>
    <li> I ordered the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer (Color May Vary) expecting a product somewhat looking as described--perhaps in different shades of red and black. The hair dryer came in black which I did not like. It was returned and the return hair dryer was also black. Since color coordination is an important factor in our tiny bathroom I was really disappointed with the product. I returned both packages and will purchase another red hair dryer. I thought the color description was misleading. I have not tried the product so I do not know about its quality.</li>
    <li> The one good thing about this hair dryer is that it is quiet.  Other than that, it is no better than my $15, ten year-old Conair.  The Elchim did not dry my hair any faster and my hair is less frizzy when I let my hair air dry.  I wanted a high-end hair dryer and was disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t find the Elchim to be worth the price.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this hair dryer and I asked her about it since it always leaves my hair so impeccably styled.  I went ahead and ordered it here and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Elchim is solid, yet lightweight, dries hair extremely fast, is surprisingly quiet,  and it leaves my hair smooth and glossy.  Super long cord is convenient, plus its beautiful!  It looks like a high-performance sports car.</li>
    <li> best blowdryer! Love it! Recommended by my hair stylist and its amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Elchim blow dryer for about 10 years now.  This is by far the best of the best.  I am very surprised that people have had issues with the cord breaking.  I have NEVER had that issue.  But, I think like everything you buy, maybe you/they weren&#x27;t so lucky.  I have hair so thick and long.  I do not think that their is anyone that has as much hair as I do.  This blow dryer dries my hair so fast and leaves it so shiny! I recommend this blow dryer to anyone.  Worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Very short drying time with no frizz.</li>
    <li> My wife has tried many hairdryers and I couldn&#x27;t believe how satisfied she was with this hair dryer...  Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer is only okay. I will say that the cord is very sturdy, which was a concern from other reviewers. My previous hairdryer was the Chi Turbo Professional, and it lasted about 5 years. I don&#x27;t like this hairdryer as much as my Chi, and I&#x27;ve had it long enough (3 months) to get used to it. It isn&#x27;t super quiet like some reviews said, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster than my Chi. Also, the front of the nose (before the black attachment) gets VERY hot and you can&#x27;t hold it. I like to hold my hairdryers at the nose when I am drying the front of my hair, but now I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll definitely keep this hairdryer until it&#x27;s time to get a new one, but it didn&#x27;t impress me. It still gets 3 stars because it isn&#x27;t a BAD hairdryer, but also it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
    <li> This was for my wife. She is a heavy user and we go through to commercial dryer a year. We get this one after recommendation from friends as it lasts so far with this dryer it takes less time to dry the hair than others. The price on Amazon it very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Overall, a good dryer, but it is a bit heavier than the dryer that I replaced.  The controls are positioned well and the heat settings are exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great dryer!  Have had it for quite some time and have not had any issues</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is so good that I ordered another one just In case the one I bought 4 years ago dies!, I have not had to use the new one yet, just have it for back up. I can not be without this hair dryer for making my curly hair straight.Use it with ceramic hairbrush (can order together) for sleek straight, non frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality hair dryer.  It is the same one the professionals use in salons. What a bargain!</li>
    <li> Light weight, dry&#x27;s hair FAST!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a professional hair dryer. After using this hair dryer, I will never go back to a consumer level hair dryer. I have shoulder length hair, and it has a medium thickness. Before the Elchim, I spent 17-20 minutes drying my hair. When I was done, my hair would be frizzy and need further styling w/ a hot round brush and straight iron. With the Elchim, my dry time has literally been cut in half, and it&#x27;s smooth when done. I take a couple minutes to run the straight iron through my ends, and I am done. It has revolutionized my \\&quot;getting ready\\&quot; routine. I don&#x27;t spend nearly the time I used to fixing my hair and it looks the best it ever has (full of volume and smooth).     This hairdryer came upon recommendation of my hairdresser, and I couldn&#x27;t agree with her more. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  My dryer was priced as well or less than others and they practically shipped it to me as I hung up the phone!  I bought another one for my daughter after it&#x27;s arrival (which was on the third day from my ordering it).</li>
    <li> I have used the Elchim Professional 2001 for several years.  My son&#x27;s girlfriend needed a hair dryer and tried mine.  She was amazed as to how quickly the Elcim dried her long thick hair.  She had to have this hair dryer for Christmas and is loving the ease of use.</li>
    <li> This is worth every penny.  It&#x27;s quiet, easy to use and hold, works well and isn&#x27;t made in China!  I love this hair dryer and would recommend it to any and all.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer.  It dries my hair fast and smooth. Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of $20 hair dryers - I used to burn them out within 6 months. I finally got fed up and splashed out for the Elchim, and it is really worth it. I&#x27;ve had it for almost three years and it still works really well - and, I can get an almost a salon-grade blow out that lasts for days. Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Worth it! I&#x27;m so glad I listened to my hairdresser when he recommended this hair dryer. Obviously, he uses his multiple times each day and his lasts for years. It really did cut down my drying time. Only negative is the weight. I don&#x27;t mind it as I&#x27;m using it - it&#x27;s an other arm workout :) it&#x27;s when I travel with it that makes me wish it was lighter. I&#x27;m always to the weight limit on my checked bags so this goes into my carry on and it&#x27;s another workout! Still love it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the advice of my hair stylist because she and the entire salon use it.  My T-3 that I loved had gone out after 3 years and I needed to replace it.  The Elchim is considerably cheaper so I decided to try.  It is a nice dryer and it does dry really fast.  The drawback is that it is really heavy and has a commercial electrical cord on it.  I was used to the T-3 being really light and I miss that.  I would say to go ahead and try this dryer.  It&#x27;s growing on me but I can&#x27;t say that I love it.</li>
    <li> I  bought this two weeks ago and was rather surprised to find it has completely stopped working within that time.  I will update this to let you know how they handle the return process.      Update:  Replacement promptly sent and it is working fine!</li>
    <li> This dryer gets extremely hot very quickly.  It is also very heavy.  I was hoping that I could save $100 and that this dryer would perform nearly as well as the T3. IT DOES NOT!!!</li>
    <li> Received the red and black dryer. Didn&#x27;t prefer it in the photo but cute in person.  What I wanted in a dryer is all it has in the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; list:      pros:     -dries hair quickly without overdrying; not wimpy  -cord is thick and sturdy  -gives good power outflow of air  -lint catcher easy to clean with a q-tip    cons:    -it takes a little getting used to holding the handle without accidentally changing the switches  -cord leaves an impression if you wrap it on the dryer  -sometimes sparks right by the switch when I change the setting while on      I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this dryer, worrying about the negatives aspects I&#x27;ve read, but it&#x27;s been very good to me with no problems so far.  The exception is the spark issue, which, as I noticed, happened only a handful of times, but that is a deduction of one star since none of my past dryers have done that and it makes me wonder if there might have been an issue for some people. I&#x27;ve tried a few dryers including the famous T3 tourmaline dryer, which has half the power of this dryer. Which made sense on their claim for it being good for your hair due to their power difference.  For my hair, because this dries my hair quickly without overdrying, it gives my hair body without it becoming a static-y flyaway.     I will be happy to purchase this again in the future, but hopefully this won&#x27;t break for a few years.</li>
    <li> I chose to get an elchim because I know of so many people who were ecstatic with this product. Overall, I&#x27;m really enjoying. The power of the blow is really strong and the heat is amazing too. It takes me half the time that it usually does to blow my hair with this dryer, as opposed to others. This blow dryer is amazing!</li>
    <li> My curly hair, somewhat thick, used to take at least 30 min to dry (sectioning off and drying with a round brush). After that it would take me another 15 min to straighten and smooth it to get frizz out. This dryer dries my hair STRAIGHT without having to section it off. I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron it afterwards!!!  It is smooth, straight, and frizz-less in under 10 min!  Amazing!  Will NEVER buy any other dryer!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer because my hair salon uses this one. It&#x27;s great because its about half the weight of my old hair dyer, and less noisy. I have long, thick, and wavy hair and this dries my hair very quickly! I noticed my hair is more smooth and shiney now too. I didn&#x27;t notice the \\&quot;colors may vary\\&quot; though. I kinda wanted the red/black one, but they sent me a black one. Oh well! It still works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this as much as the T3 I had, simply because it seems to dry my hair out more (I need more product).  However, if it lasts longer than six months than I guess that makes up for it.  I&#x27;m still undecided.  I do have to use the attachment or my hair comes out a wild mess with this dryer.  And as at least one other reviewer mentioned, the switches seem backwards.  I constantly press the wrong one.  But that is just a nuisance, not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This is my second of this particular hair dryer.  But the first one lasted 10 years which is amazing.  Since I couldn&#x27;t be without a hairdryer, I bought another one.  However, I sent in the old one to Elchim for repair.  On their website it said the repair was $20.  That was correct and for $20 I now have a 2nd hairdryer ... not that I need it since this product lives up to the hype.  This is the hairdryer my hairdresser uses and swears by.  I highly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It dries my hair in 5 minutes compared to the 20+ minutes it use to take me (I have very long hair). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the location of the settings button on the handle. When holding the hair dryer it is easy to acidentally change the settings but you get use to it.  Overall great hair dryer!!!!</li>
    <li> I never realized how much a blow dryer can impact your hair style. I love this dryer.  It&#x27;s quiet and dries my hair in half the time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer by a recommendation from my hair stylist.  He suggested it would work perfectly for my naturally curly hair when I decide to blow it out straight.  This dryer works extremely well and helps cut down the drying time without frying my hair.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Finally a blow dryer that leaves my hair frizz free. I&#x27;ve tried Babyliss pro cermaix (not impressed!) and other drug store blow dryers with the ion feature. I have frizzy, thick, coarse hair and a LOT of it. Before blow drying I put garnier leave in, chi silk infusion, and a heat protectant in my hair. My hair is left smooth and for once NOT poofy and frizzy. I love it! BUT I don&#x27;t think this cuts out on my dry that much.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist suggested this brand because this is what she has found to be the best. She&#x27;s been a stylist for a long time. She&#x27;s been my stylist for over 15 years so I trust her judgement.</li>
    <li> This is my second of this model. The first one I had for 10 years and it was running strong until it was damaged by hotel staff when I was on a trip. Highly recommended. I have a ton of thick hair and this dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything outstanding.  It does a good job, but my last $40 dryer worked just as good.  If I needed a new dryer I would look elsewhere until I&#x27;m wowed.  This isn&#x27;t wow, but it does do the job.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 of these hair dryers and the last 2 have not been satisfactory!  My daughter has the original one and it&#x27;s still going.  I however, purchased one the same time she did and it just wasn&#x27;t putting out the amount of air it did in the past.  So I replaced it with another one and it&#x27;s only been months and it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to.  Very frustrating to pay so much for a dryer and not have it perform.</li>
    <li> it used to take for ever to dry my hair (2hrs) and literally this drier has cut the time by half! loves it! the best...will never buy another drier again!</li>
    <li> The Elchim dryer is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is loud, controls are not easy to use, heavy and  no filters.  My current dryer is 10 years old and IS a professional model, much nicer.  I gave this one to our Abused Women&#x27;s Center.  In asking beauty salons about it I did not find one hair stylist that was familiar with the name or had used it.  DON&#x27;T WASTE your money on this one, it is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries my hair quickly, leaving it smooth and shiny.  And my hair requires less touching up on the second day.</li>
    <li> Let me address the title of the review. From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that&#x27;s worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the \\&quot;new look\\&quot;, but my wife is still raving about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers&#x27; lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven&#x27;t ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ionic dryers are supposed to \\&quot;trap\\&quot; moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture &#x3D; weight. Weight &#x3D; flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? \\&quot;Ionic dryers don&#x27;t heat the air, they heat the hair from within.\\&quot; Isn&#x27;t that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the \\&quot;$29.95 delivered!\\&quot; versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about \\&quot;trapping\\&quot; moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; \\&quot;pack-ability\\&quot;, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife&#x27;s arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don&#x27;t expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife&#x27;s hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the guys out there saying \\&quot;no biggy, I can fix a cord,\\&quot; beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I&#x27;m sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all those that I doubted: \\&quot;I&#x27;m stupid. You&#x27;re smart. I was wrong. You were right. You&#x27;re the best. I&#x27;m the worst. You&#x27;re very good looking. I&#x27;m not attractive.\\&quot; (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what&#x27;s the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update - December 2013 ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn&#x27;t replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it&#x27;s so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She&#x27;ll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn&#x27;t want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone&#x27;s happier...and I&#x27;m sure we hear a little better too.</li>
    <li> Actually, I really loved this dryer. It made my hair look super sleek and shiny, dried fast and was very convenient to use. Unfortunately, it broke 2 months and one week after I received it. Basically, I&#x27;d used it just shy of two months and I don&#x27;t dry my hair every day, so we&#x27;re not talking two months of daily use. The heating element stopped working and now it only blows cold air. Of course, in order to get it repaired I now have to ship it to Florida and also pay them $10 to repair it and ship it back. Seriously, just skip this item and save yourself the trouble. Would be fine if it worked, but a product that doesn&#x27;t make it even two months just isn&#x27;t worth the time or money.</li>
    <li> It s powerful, but is heavy in weight.  I did not feel comfortable with the location of the on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;I did not return it but bought a lighter hair dryer with a more comfortable on/off switch location.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve had the Elchim 2001 for almost 7 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong and is problem-free. It is easy to hold, buttons are nicely placed, and the weight is good and well balanced.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered an elchim hairdryer from Amazon.com. Each of the two purchases were listed as distinct and different hairdryers/items, even though they both ended up being the same item, and not as advertised and described on Amazon. Upon receipt, the first hairdryer did not have the specifications that were listed , so I ordered a different hairdryer that I was told was the one I was looking for. Lo and behold, again, this hair dryer did not have the specifications that were listed. Both dryers ended up being the same, even though they are listed as separate items, and both are advertised incorrectly. THIS PARTICULAR HAIRDRYER IS NOT 1800 WATTS (which is the dryer I thought I was ordering because it was listed as such, and that was the product I wanted); IT IS 2000 WATTS. For the life of me I do not understand why Amazon doesn&#x27;t correct these mistakes. At least six months passed between my first and second purchase of the hair dryers. This has simply been a hassle.</li>
    <li> Great hair-dryer. Fast, hot and strong. The cord is a bit too long for home use, otherwise it&#x27;s perfect. My hair feels soft and not frizzy at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I have purchased. I own about 4, and this one dries my hair the quickest without frying it. Some dryers use very high heat, but not enough power.   This dryer is also not as heavy as other ones I have used. The price is good for the quality.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on professional blow dryers before I purchased this one and I am not disappointed!  Hair dries much faster than with my old Conair and has a little more body.  Worth the money if you have it to spend.</li>
    <li> I thought I could never replace my Baby Bliss Professional; however, this product has taken the lead.</li>
    <li> It is replacing a twenty year old dryer.  I hadn&#x27;t realized the improvements over the years would be so significant.  It feels and works great.</li>
    <li> What a powerful hair dryer!  It&#x27;s a little heavy, but it blows so hard I can dry my hair in 3-4 minutes, so I don&#x27;t mind.  Supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  If that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;ll be dead before this hair dryer dies!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous blowdryer. I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 2 years and it is still going strong (versus the two straighteners that I&#x27;ve had in that period)  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be so damaging and I love how the nose is a bit smaller than other blowdryers and also comes with an attachment. The filters do pop off sometimes but that is the only problem I&#x27;ve had.  The only complaint really is that when I got this, it only came in one color. Now it comes in five!! (red, white, pink, black, &amp; the original black/red) Would&#x27;ve loved it in pink :(</li>
    <li> But I have terrible upper body strength. The cord and plastic are very high salon quality. I have hair past my lower back, though so unless it&#x27;s a double barrel it doesn&#x27;t make much of a drying difference to me.</li>
    <li> I never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful. I should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that I bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers. Now I know.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before making a decision.  The one negative review was wires shorting out..but I know you shouldn&#x27;t wrap cord tightly around the dryer.  It&#x27;s powerful and it works!</li>
    <li> About 50% more powerful than a purple Conair.  Would recommend to anyone trying to dry their hair faster.</li>
    <li> I reallyyyyyy love this trust me I would not lie at all this! Is the best blow dryer every especially for curly hair jts cut my time by 3/4</li>
    <li> Died after about two years of personal use. Would have expected it to last longer. It is heavy.</li>
    <li> this blower is great. although its making some weird noises, the power and heat is at its best. just what i have expected.</li>
    <li> This product seems fine but I was a little concerned when I received it.  I bought it \\&quot;new&#x27; not used and paid the \\&quot;new\\&quot; price, however it looked like it had clearly been opened and some of the packaging was missing.  There were no instructions to explain the different settings and I don&#x27;t know if there are any additional attachments.  I have a little concern about Discount Jungle.</li>
    <li> very light weight blow dryer and doesnt damage your hair like other blow driers. I work at an upscale hairsalon and we use this brand so you should get it!!!! you wont regret it its great!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer probably 3 years ago and never got around to posting a review. This hair dryer is fantastic- I have had it for 3 years or so and I have never had a problem or malfunction. It drys my hair fast and reduces frizz. I will always buy Elchim.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the recipient wished the higher temps had a bit more oomph, though she said it definitely gets the job done. Has an excellent variety of settings, minus the hotter ones the recipient is accustomed to.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the most amazing hair dryer EVER! I purchased mine about 7 years ago and I use it every day. I love the \\&quot;gail force\\&quot; wind that it sends out to dry my curly thick hair in no time at all. It is a bit heavy, but I do not leave home without it when I travel. My girlfriends love it when I bring it, too! Well, after 7 long years together, I am sad to report that it died. Ugh! Thanks to amazon.com I&#x27;ll have another in just a few days at a fraction of the cost of my original. I hope to have another fabulous 7 years with this one!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair dryers since 1975, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. It reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed: moderate heat but high air flow. That&#x27;s the correct way to do it. (The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don&#x27;t know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can&#x27;t vouch for the cord&#x27;s durability, but I see no reason it wouldn&#x27;t hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I&#x27;d still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I&#x27;ve put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul. It is far, far above anything I&#x27;ve seen in the stores since squirrel-cage motors disappeared some years ago.</li>
    <li> When my Elchim dryer finally died after something like six years of daily service, I researched what to get.  Pretty much every beauty magazine and website was touting the benefits of the new generation of nano tourmaline ionic dryers, which were supposed to dry your hair more quickly and with less damage than dryers like my old Elchim.    Don&#x27;t believe it.    I&#x27;ve tried two of the new-fangled dryers since then. It took my super fine hair forever to dry with them whereas this dryer dries my hair in one-tenth of the time.  Literally.  And my hair comes out much smoother.  I have a ceramic flat iron that I used to use for special occasions.  With those nano tourmaline dryers I was using my flat iron every day.  When I dry my hair with my Elchim, I don&#x27;t need to iron it, maybe because my hair dries so quickly, it doesn&#x27;t have time to frizz, wave or otherwise go crazy.    And finally there&#x27;s the noise factor.  You might be fooled into thinking this dryer isn&#x27;t very powerful because it&#x27;s so relatively quiet.  My ionic tourmaline dryers sounded like a 747 revving up and one of them vibrated like crazy.  This one feels very low key, and yet it actually dries my hair really quickly and makes my hair feel soft.  All that flat ironing was damaging it.    I am so happy to have another Elchim I&#x27;m kicking myself for having waited this long to get another one.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  As for whether this one will last six years, only time will tell, but I&#x27;m betting it will last longer than my first nano tourmaline dryer, which conked out after about half a year.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is fantastic!!  I can dry my hair in half the time it used to take me with my old dryer.  I have very thick long hair and it&#x27;s so annoying to have to dry it but when I do this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer and also top service if something goes wrong with it.  I personally own 2 and I bought one for my daughter.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! This is the hair dryer for you. It straightens your hair especially if you have very very curly twisted hair, you&#x27;ll get it pin straight with this dryer. The Hot setting is \\&quot;hot\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t dry out or burn your hair. It is just soooo worth the money. I&#x27;ve had mine since 2008 and it still runs like the first day I bought it. I&#x27;ve taken it traveling with me (yes it is big - i just don&#x27;t care because I can&#x27;t live without it) and any of those cheap hotel dryers, burn my hair so much. No matter what, my hair comes out looking awesome from it. Just buy it.. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The Elchim 1800 R/B hairdryer performs great. I should know because I&#x27;ve had 4 of them.  I keep buying them on average 1/18mos.  This IS NOT good.  The systemic problem with them is that the cord breaks a wire internally right near the top just below the rubber protector. I&#x27;m thinking the rubber protector may just be the problem. This has happened to me on all 4 Elchims I have purchased. My hair stylist confirms what I have found. He said that he constantly has to repair the cords on Elchims. The cord is NOT round as stated in some other reviews.  It is the flat type. Wish the manufacturer would fix this regretable situation.</li>
    <li> Dries really fast. I have to use a brush and brush my hair while using this dryer or else it is just an odd mess. I live in area with high humidity off the Gulf coast and my hair stays flat all day! Even straighter than my straight haired friends. I do have to use another dryer when I want to wear my curls because this dryer takes them out.</li>
    <li> I used the same brand hair dryer for 2 decades before buying this dryer.  I was very satisfied with it from the moment I turned it on.  It dries my hair fast and well.  Nobody knows I really have curly hair.  I was apprehensive to try a new dryer but this was a good choice.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hairdryer fried out when I was on vacation after a few months.  I replaced it with a 30$ revlon hairdryer that has lasted four years. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this!</li>
    <li> It came loose in a Elchim box.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer by far.  It dries my hair perfect without it burning my hair or getting too hot.  The vendor delivered the product in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.  I am definitely going to buy a second one for my mother as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> This dryer was recommended by my hairstylists. It really does make drying time fast. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer exceeds expectations.  Dries hair fast, is quiet and light weight (big plus) and no frizzies!  In fact, sometimes it makes my hair too silky so I have to use more harsh shampoo or only a teenie weenie bit of conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product with one exception:  I do not like where the on/off and temp control buttons are placed.  When drying my hair, my hand presses on the buttons and changes the temp and drying force.</li>
    <li> I go through a lot of driers, I had a T3, loved it but it died after a year.  Then I bought a Sedu, loved it also...both made my hair very straight and silky, and I no longer needed a straightening iron.  After about 6 months the Sedu died and I bought this drier.  I thought it was pretty good, it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the others, but it seemed to still dry very fast.  After a few months of using this dryer I have massive split ends, I am not a professional, but I have read that the hotter driers are actually better for your hair.  I tend to agree.</li>
    <li> Let me first explain two things-&lt;br /&gt;One being that I work the nightly re-stock shift at Sephora and have my pick of any high end professional hair dryer at 30-50% off sale costs and I still chose this for many reasons. Secondly, I have used the same Revlon Ionic $15-20 blowdryer since I was about 16years old and never had any problems with it. I always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so.&lt;br /&gt; My hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave. My hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when I blew it dry but I just figured that was part of the drying process. One day while at work I was looking at a T3 and discussing how my hair frizzes, i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer. I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general. I wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it. After ONE use I could tell a huge difference. It doesnt dry my hair any faster though. I dont have any frizz and it is smoother, smells better, not to hot to touch, and a lot more shine! I really do recommend this to any woman (or man) who is considering buying a new expensive blowdryer and cant make up their mind...go with this one first!</li>
    <li> There is not much I can add to what has already been written about this blow dryer. I made my  purchase based on what others had said. My experience mirrors theirs. It is a very powerful dryer, relatively quiet, and fairly lightweight. As mentioned, the buttons are surprisingly awkward given the quality of the dryer. Once you accept you&#x27;ll constantly be knocking them off your desired speed and heat, you&#x27;ll find this a first rate hair dryer. Wet hair is no match for this dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer!  I found it on a Top 10 list of blow dryers by a fashion blog.  It came though.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my Chi broke and I read the amazon reviews that recommended this dryer as very reliable.  Yes, it is reliable and it works well but I really prefer the ionic dryers as opposed to the high pressure for drying hair.  It dries quickly (like ionic)but does not leave my hair and smooth, soft and shiny as the Chi (did I mention that it broke after 6 months???).  So, I am keeping this for awhile but next time I get a gift card or am feeling like I want to treat myself, I might get an ionic dryer and give this one to my sister.</li>
    <li> Size, color, features are great. I have been purchasing Conair for 15 years and didn&#x27;t realized what I have been missing since I got this. I researched for the best blow dryer and this happen to be rated #1 so I ordered it and I&#x27;m very happy with my decision to do so. It leaves my hair shiny and not frizzy. My old ones left my hair dry and frizzy so I have to use a hair straightener after.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be more powerful, is it really 2000 watts?</li>
    <li> Very powerful hairdryer, quieter than my old T3, love the way it makes my hair shine after a few minutes of blow drying. Just great! Fast delivery as well. glad it&#x27;s not from China!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair &amp; am used to blow drying it straight (have been doing it for &gt;10 years) and using a flat iron to get it frizz free.  This hairdryer is not as good as most of the reviews made it seem: the nozzle only covers a small area, and I still need to use a flat iron.      However, the hairdryer is powerful--it cut 5 minutes off my hair drying time (20 min down to 15).  Another plus is that it is quieter than most.</li>
    <li> The dryer is heavier than I would like and I would prefer that the switches were not positioned where they can accidentally get flipped, but overall, I&#x27;ve been really happy with the way it dries my hair.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE FOR FREEZY/CURLY /UNRULY HAIR ,MAKES BLOW DRYING A BREEZE,I PURCHASED ONE ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO...STILL GOING STRONG!I USE IT EVERY DAY,ALSO FOR TOUCH UPS, SO I&#x27;VE DECIDED TO GET A NEW ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER THAT WILL GRADUATE COLLEGE(JUST IN CASE SHE DECIDES TO MOVE OUT...:)),FAIRLY LIGHT,RIGHT PRICE,AND COMBINED WITH AMAZON SERVICE AND RELIABILITY.........PRICELESS ,GO FOR IT ,YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> I found out about this dryer after borrowing it from my mother-in-law.  She got hers through her stylist.  It dried my hair in half the time of my Conair dryer I bought at Target, and it&#x27;s much quieter.  It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and it gives me smooth results. The only complaint I have is that the temperature and power buttons are on the grip of the dryer and I sometimes turn the dryer off on accident.  It&#x27;s not really that big of a deal though.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this hair dryer out. First time out of the box, within 5 minutes of use, it began to smoke and spark. My entire house smelled like burnt rubber for a week. Needless to say, I shipped it back immediately. Very unpleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Dries my hair very quickly, and dries it straight. I have wavy hair and this hairdryer gets the wave out if I want to.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer ..... its one of the best around ...... drying time is so much less and it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair as many others have.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever!  Quite heavy if that is an issue.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected</li>
    <li> This was an excellent buy and a great product.  I saved around $20.00 as compared to discount stores in my area.  The shipping was supposed to be 5-7 business days and I received it in 2 days!  I am always very satisfied with amazon.com purchases.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It is powerful and really does reduce drying time.  The price I paid was less than retail and a great value.</li>
    <li> I really got a lot from the previous reviews on here, and they go into so much detail that I don&#x27;t have much to add. Just that this dryer does what everyone says it does and I received compliments on my hair the very first day I used it. I was using an Ion hair dryer, and have discovered that this is much better. Yay!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hairdresser told me to buy it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I was sick of buying cheaper dryers and having them break after a year, so I decided to spend more on something professional. This hair dryer is quieter than any other I&#x27;ve used and dries my hair in half the time! It is definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It is now 3 and a half years since my initial review and I am still extremely pleased with this hair dryer... It was definitely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who liked it, until it stopped working 2 monthes after we got it.  We&#x27;ll see how well they honor the warranty.  It was a little heavier than her past cheap versions, but dried faster and I liked that it was much quiter.</li>
    <li> My wife got to try this product out at a friend&#x27;s house and feel in love with it after 1 use. The price seemed a little steep but after the purchase it was well worth it. It takes her a fraction of the time to blow dry her hair. This thing gets hot fast without heating up the bathroom too much. The massive output of heat really dries her hair quickly and keeps her from being in a hot room and getting sweaty just to dry her hair like the last hair dryer did. I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of a better hair dryer, a definite buy!  *\\&quot;Colors may vary\\&quot;-it seems there is either red on black, or black on black*</li>
    <li> After my wife had yet another hair dryer die on her, we decided to do a bit of research and found this hair dryer had received very good reviews from Consumer Reports and others. We bought one and my wife has been very happy with it. She claims it dries faster than any other dryer she has used and is also very quiet. My daughter tried it and liked it so much we bought her one for Christmas. She loves it. We would give it five stars but the power and heat switches are located in such a way as to sometimes inadvertently get switched to different setting when holding the device.</li>
    <li> The elchim professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer arived on time and works great, perfectly satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer EVER!  I would never owe any other brand.  Drys my very thick curly head of hair in less than 10 mins.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hairdresser.  It works perfectly and i like all the different controls.  Light weight too.</li>
    <li> This is my second Elchim Pro 2001 dryer.  It is fast, reasonably quiet operation, long cord, and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for just over a year - 379 days to be exact and this morning when I went to turn it on, no dice. Dead. I have had ConAir hair dryers that have cost $20 last longer than this one,so to say I&#x27;m unhappy is an understatement! I don&#x27;t even use it everyday- maybe 3 times per week AND last summer, I left it while I traveled for over 2 months, so the life of this this thing was seriously short. BEWARE~</li>
    <li> I have A LOT of thick, wavy hair, and blow drying it has always been a pain. This dryer makes it so much easier and leaves my hair silky. This is my first &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryer, so technically I can&#x27;t compare it to any others, but I can guarantee that it does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after my 1st elchim fell into the toilet. I had that one for over 8 years and it was great. I bought this one b/c I liked my old one so much. I like this dryer but wish it was hotter.  My hair comes out great</li>
    <li> I have used many many less expensive hair dryers over the course of 30+ years and they often break within a year.  I have had this dryer about two years now and it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Got this for my gf for Christmas and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.  She likes how quiet it is and the extra piece on the end of it.  Not sure what that&#x27;s called or what it&#x27;s used for but all that matters is that she&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer for many years.  I have  curly and very thick hair tand this  dryer works well.  I just bought a replacement after my original dryer, after 10 years finally was wearing out</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Very good product!!!!  Costs a bit more than most others but well worth the money period</li>
    <li> So the fan worked well for two years (I&#x27;ve even bought it as gifts for others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, it started smoking and sparking when turned on, making for a potential fire hazard. 3 stars for working sufficiently for two years, before turning into a smoking piece of plastic.</li>
    <li> Fast drying powerful hair dryer.  I brought my daughter this dryer about 6-7 years ago and paid over $100.  She dropped on the floor several time and put in the check in bag when she flew.  It finally quite working and I had to purchase one for her two months ago.</li>
    <li> I was happy to buy another Elchim dryer.  My first one died after about five years of using it regularly.  I used my T2000 as a spare until I found a good deal on a new Elchim.  Elchim is far better than the T2000.  I have mid to long blond (colored) hair and it dries my colored hair quickly and smoothly.  My hair color covers gray hair which is wirey and dry.  This dryer gives me the look I want for my hair -- long and smooth.  Amazon had the best price on it.  The price was comparable to what my stylist would have paid at a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> i would have given this dryer 5 stars but the controls are on the handle. i find that as i&#x27;m holding and drying i keep hitting the speed and temp buttons and changing both the speed &amp; temp. if they would have just moved the buttons up a bit, i wouldn&#x27;t have to keep changing them back as i dry. otherwise, i have curly hair that i dry straight and this has enough speed to do it quickly.</li>
    <li> I have two of these Elchim hair dryers. One I use daily and an extra for a backup. I just love the airflow, ease of use and how great my hair looks. Thank You Elchim!</li>
    <li> Great dryer works fast and has a long cord so you can move around.</li>
    <li> Works great and has been very durable over the past few months of use. Really stronger than my old fan and saves a bunch of time in the morning.</li>
    <li> I got tired of cheaper hair dryers burning out on me, so I bought this hair dryer in February 2009 - over 5 years ago.  I use it every day and it&#x27;s still working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switches for off/low/high and low/medium/high heat are on the handle of the hair dryer, and yet luckily I don&#x27;t accidentally hit the switches when I&#x27;m holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t lightweight and it takes up room when traveling, but I still insist on bringing this with me on trips.  Very happy I spent the extra money for it because it&#x27;s saved me money - I don&#x27;t have to replace a burned out hair dryer every year.</li>
    <li> At first I was concerned that the hair dryer wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair very quickly as I have a lot of it. The heat temperature is great and dried my hair fast while leaving a smooth look and feel to it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it needs to do. Solid and durable. Gets so hot makes you wanna smack yo mama. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected , a very good product , for the price this is a very good purchase and I give it a good rating</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love.  I almost dropped $200 bucks on a blow dryer from the Dry Bar, but opted to save some $ instead when my hair dresser told me about this one.  I love the temp functions and it really does the job without totally damaging my hair!  Also, I seem to be able to blow dry my hair faster since the end of the blow dryer is smaller and air is really more concentrated.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love this blow dryer. Had to kiss many frogs to find this one. It&#x27;s fast, easy to use and has a lot of power so hair gets straight and it stays that way. It also doesn&#x27;t burn and give you split ends. Haven&#x27;t use any other product after I found this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer at the suggestion of my hairdresser. I have always used the cheap, drug store dryers. I like the performance of the dryer; however it&#x27;s heavy and hard for me to maneuver when I&#x27;m trying to dry and use the round brush in the back.. Another annoying thing is that when I am trying to dry/round brush the back of my hair, the way the button is placed, I invariably hit it with my thumb/hand and turn it off..  I am able to dry my hair straighter with it, though. So, I use my cheap old dryer most days and use this one when I really want to work and make my hair look its best.</li>
    <li> Having baby fine hair and not a lot of it, I find my hair feels more dry and brittle after using this dryer for the last month.  There are 3 speeds and 3 heat settings, the 1st heat setting being \\&quot;cool\\&quot;. The 1st speed setting is too low even for my hair. The highest speed and heat settings are way to strong and burning hot for my head. The switch placement is a pain as you have to be careful not to accidently hit them when holding the handle. I don&#x27;t think this dryer is worth its higher price.</li>
    <li> I really liked this hair dryer, but it went out in a year.  Since hair dryers are so throwaway anymore, I would not waste my money on it.</li>
    <li> This is the best dyer I have ever used!!!! I have frizzy curly hair and when I use this dyer my hair comes out smooth and straight...</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this brand so I bought this. Barely more than a typical Target carried brand, the higher heat and durability are well worth it. You have to have high heat to straighten hair, even if magazine tell you heat is damaging. Without a good dryer, you have to make up for it with another step of, like an iron. This reduced additional steps. Use it exclusively.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe the hair dryer is worth the price. All I can say is that it did not out perform my 5-year old, $30 CONAIR that I purchased from Target.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last ten years.  I have tried other blow dryers but nothing makes my hair as smooth and dries as quickly as this product. I highly recommend it. The price is right, also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an Elchim 2001 which lasted 10 years. It finally died and I ordered this one....it didn&#x27;t last more than 7 months! No reason whatsoever....the air just started coming out very slowly. I don&#x27;t know if this is a real or fake to be honest, as my last one lasted over 10 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer because I got hair extensions put in so I needed a little more power than what I was getting from my other blowdryer. This hairdryer is amazing! I love that it has so many settings for speed and heat, and it isn&#x27;t very heavy to hold up. It drys my hair very quickly, and isn&#x27;t super loud like a lot of other hairdryers out there. I just got this dryer about 2 weeks ago and so far it has been smooth sailing (pun intended). I would definitely recommend this hairdryer!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer in July and it is now September and it does not work!! I have purchased hair dryers and they have lasted me over 14 years!  I am very disappointed! I cannot even get a refund OR exchange!</li>
    <li> My elchim hair dryer is a very powerful product that helps me style my hair with ease. It has many settings and temperatures. I highly recommend this item to laymen and professional stylists.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is powerful, quiet and dries my hair in less time than previous dryers.&lt;br /&gt;I have the Elchim for European current and thought it worked so well that I decided to buy one that uses US current.&lt;br /&gt;I  highly recommend this Elchim product!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this hairdryer.  I have thick, relatively straight hair that takes a long time to dry.  This hairdryer has a lot less power than my 1800 $20 Conair dryer did.  It now takes a lot longer to dry my hair with this blowdryer, and the end result is FRIZZY!  I never had frizzy hair in my life. It is also very heavy!  I am very disappointed in this blowdryer and frankly, I wish I had my $20 Conair back!</li>
    <li> The Elchim Hair Dryer works as advertized, however, within four months of use the wiring short circuited and my wife was ready to throw it into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;  Somehow I remembered that we had purchased it on Amazon and so I looked it up and called Elchim and they told me that this product has a lifetime warranty, but we have to provide either $12 with supporting purchase documents, or $22 if we don&#x27;t have the paperwork or if it is beyond 12 months from the purchase date.&lt;br /&gt;  Because I had the paperwork showing the purchases using Amazon I mailed it with the Elchim Hair Dryer along with a check for $12, and the electrical adapter plug that had short circuited was replaced, and the repaired Elchim Hair Dryer was sent back to us in about a two weeks time.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my stylist and I hate it.  The hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp, the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; is too strong and makes my hair completely flat and yet, doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it unless it&#x27;s on these higher settings.  Also, it is a very heavy hair dryer.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Wish I had kept the box to return.  This is not worth the splurge.</li>
    <li> I being using the same blow dryer for 8 years n I lake it.</li>
    <li> Expensive, yes, but very much worth it! After my last hair dryer croaked I read many reviews and ordered the highly-rated Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer. That one actually took curl and body OUT of my hair and left it limp and hard to style. So I went hunting for a non-ionic dryer and chose this one, not at all sure I was happy paying $75 for a hair dryer. But I am indeed happy and would gladly buy it again. Styles my hair nicely with no frizz. I&#x27;ve used it for more than 3 years and it still works perfectly. The only flaw is some bare spots where the color scratched off in putting the dryer in and out of a drawer--not that I care one whit about the paint job on my hair dryer. I&#x27;ve rated it four stars rather than five simply because it&#x27;s large.</li>
    <li> I actually had the same brand for years and it finally died. This is a great hairdryer. Dries hair very fast.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!  I have harder water so my hair doesnt dry fast when I am at home so I need the power of this hair dryer to help make my situation better and my dry time quicker.  I have used it in other locations with better water and it cuts dry time almost in half.  Its light weight and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This really could be almost the perfect hairdryer if for only 2 things.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it&#x27;s missing a cold shot button.  The air flow is perfect, I love the different speeds and heat settings, how it feels, the lenth of the cord, etc... It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten/smooth the hair like my CHI did, even at its hottest setting.  I need to flat iron afterwards (my hair has a medium natural wave).  I love the way the Elchim is made, so I&#x27;m going to try different models to see if they have what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s why when my old dryer burn out, I found it on Amazon and i was very happy. It took me two days to get it deliver amazing!</li>
    <li> I was always a wash and wear kinda gal. But recently I had my hair straightened and the beautician suggested to blow dry out after washing.  She told me the Elchim Professional 2001 was the best and they last for a long time.  She had many years on her dryer and it is used lots everyday.  That sounded like the best option for me.  If I was going to invest, I wanted it to be good and have a long happy life.  It seems to be well balanced and has lots of power.  My thick hair is dry in 10 minutes.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and no regrets.  The product was delivered quickly.  I was suprised that the dryer was in a box with no packing to secure it inside.  I thought that was odd.  I am sure that it was bounced around from the wearhouse and across the nation by all who touched it.  That part did concern.  I hope it did not affect the life of my product.  Time will tell. But so far so good.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer lives up to the hype that it is faster than other dryers. And it is very quiet if that is important to you. Overall I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer!!! I don&#x27;t have very long hair( shoulder length  and it takes me around 7 min to dry my whole head and just 2 min if im doing my bangs and sides only. Color is great too!! A really good brand. My moother in law who has extremely thick hair loved it and I ordered one for her as well!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is fantastic. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. The dryer is faster and quieter than any dryer she had ever used before, leaves her hair looking healthier, and reduces her need to straighten her hair. She loves the product.</li>
    <li> I desperately needed a dryer which would cut my drying time in half. My hair is thin, shoulder length.  My daughter&#x27;s is thick and practically down her back (too long in my opinion ). Previous dryer took me about 10 minutes for my hair, and a good 30 minutes for my daughters. This dryer didn&#x27;t do a whole lot better. Maybe I am missing something. ..  I wasn&#x27;t that impressed. And, as for reviewer who said he could hold a conversation with his spouse while she dried her hair (bbc dryer supposedly so quiet)....I disagree. Maybe if you had the dryer on low.  One thing I really didn&#x27;t like was the position of the buttons. Very difficult to get accustomed to. I will be keeping the dryer, but I wish I had bought another instead.. maybe the T3. I always spend quite a bit of time reading product reviews before actually purchasing the item. This dryer has great reviews, not sure why...but like I said, I&#x27;m not a professional hairdresser, so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> I wasted so much money on a few hair dryers, I wish I would have ordered this one first, its a really great hair dryer</li>
    <li> Good product, quick delivery</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  Previously had a Conair Infinity which was by far not as powerful as this Elchim.  The air is hot and it dries my hair quickly.  It is also half as loud as the previous Conair which my husband really appreciates.  You can still carry on a conversation without having to shout.  The hair dryer is pricier than the Conair was but to me it&#x27;s worth the price.  Hope it will last 2 years and I&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after researching for more than probably 20 hours to figure out which one would fit my needs, etc. It has been well worth it! My hair dries more quickly and I&#x27;m getting awesome results with my round brush like I usually get at the salon. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I would recommend this product, I am highly disappointed to find out that buying through Amazon and a 3rd party I am not covered by the warranty because neither of the companies are authorized resellers of the product. I found this out as I was completing the warranty form that has to be sent in. Had I known this ahead of time I would have gone to one of the authorized seller sites and paid $2 more to have a 1 year warranty. I am returning to Amazon as one of the authorized sellers has 20% off and no tax.</li>
    <li> Best dryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, and love the three temp settings.  You don&#x27;t have to hold down a button for cool air.  My hair dries fast with smooth results.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the one I had 10 years ago. The old one was a better quality and this make hair a little frizzy</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews online I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. (She asks for a new blowdryer every year)&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. It has easily shaved 5 to7 minutes off of her dry time. The build quality is amazing and the power cord is very rugged. This product was worth every dollar plus some. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and works wonderfully. Nice hot dryer to get the job done in no time. You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> Handle would spark when turning on and off</li>
    <li> Great dryer. Works much faster than my old Conair did, and does not leave my wavy hair frizzy. I noticed that I did not need to use my flat iron following use of this dryer unless I just wanted to, which is great (less heat damage). Having only had the product for about a month or so, I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of this product, of course, but it seems quite durable in comparison to drug store brands. The shipping was incredibly fast, I must add.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, which were almost all five stars, the one that made me decide to give it a try was David Chapman \\&quot;magikamos\\&quot;.  Thank you David!  You were right....this is a GREAT dryer.  Superb air flow, great ability to control temp/air with the multiple settings.  It takes so much less time to dry my shoulder length THICK wavy hair.  Before I could never get my hair to look the way it does at the salon; I thought the problem must be with me.  With this dryer, I get professional looking results.  At work I keep getting asked, \\&quot;Your hair looks great.  What are you doing different?\\&quot;  The only difference is a professional styling tool at a really reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer after watching a series of blow drying tutorials. I researched a lot about hair dryers since this was my first purchase. I wanted to invest in a decent blow dryer which would last me for atleast an year. I have wavy hair and I have recently got a layer cut done with a scoop. I understood the need of a good blow dryer to get that wow look that you get after a salon visit. I must say the elchim professional 2001 truly met all my expectations. The dryer is quite light and easily manageable by blow dry virgins. If you are planning to buy a blow dryer for the first time, then i would suggest you to go for this one. This 2000 Watt dryer is very powerful and straightens your hair instantly. All you need a Ceramic Jumbo round brush ( from Brush lab) and this powerful device to create the look you have always craved for. I am really happy with the results.My husband always admires my hair now and I simply can&#x27;t stop blushing...:) I  wanted a red and black combi dryer, but they sent me a black one instead. Thats Ok. When this breaks, I&#x27;m gonna simply make another purchase of the same product.</li>
    <li> I had always purchased the cheap-ish hair dryers at Target and found myself going through them every 6 months or so.  I blow dry my hair every day and it would typically take about 25 minutes, followed by a bit of touch up with a flat iron.  I finally decided to invest in a professional hair dryer so that I wouldn&#x27;t get stuck with a dead hair dryer every 6 months, which would always seem to die right in the middle of blow drying my hair.  After reading the reviews for this hair dryer, I thought it seemed like a good balance of price and good reviews.  I received this product in January and was pleased.  It was a bit heavier than I thought it would be but it cut my drying time down to about 15 minutes instead of 25, so I didn&#x27;t mind the extra weight.  It provided a great blow out consistently and I didn&#x27;t have to touch my hair up with the flat iron to get the smooth finish I wanted.  This hair dryer is VERY powerful and I had to put it on a towel on the counter or it would go flying off.  I was happy with this until about 8 months after I had started using it and....it stopped working.  I had to rush out to get a dryer at Target and have been using that for the last few months.  I decided to invest in another professional hair dryer because I have again gotten tired of spending almost a half hour each morning on my hair but given how long my last Elchim lasted, I have decided to try another brand.</li>
    <li> the product is great but it looked like it was just thrown in the box for mailing.  No registration information and no product information was included.  Maybe shouln&#x27;t have ordered it around Xmas time.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was in college as a huge splurge, and I still can&#x27;t get over the fact that it&#x27;s still going strong. It still dries my hair super quickly and I&#x27;ve been using it since 2000!!  I dont think I have anything else in my apt that has lasted this long.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair fast...overall good hair dryer...I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth the price..but I like it.</li>
    <li> I like the hair dryer it dries my hair pretty quickly but never burns. The concentrator works well which is very important to me as this attachment is the key to straight and smooth hair. The only negative is the placement of the control buttons. The on/off button and temperate button are in opposite order of all my previous hair dryers so it takes getting use to.</li>
    <li> Not noisy, great heat differences to choose from.  Wish that the airstream on the cool setting was more gentle.  It was expensive, I guess I paid for the good review and if it lasts a long time, I will be happier!</li>
    <li> This product is very weak and when I tried to return it, the company refused.&lt;br /&gt;It is different from the website description. the power is very weak to have a good hair. This item doesn&#x27;t deserve to pay money on it.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love it; they think it&#x27;s light enough and provide enough hot air for their thick hairs.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair very fast but is a little on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> Purchased for fast and efficient drying capability.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife less than 6 months ago and yesterday it started blowing only cold air. She liked it while it was working (hence, 2 stars instead of 1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only repair center in the US is in FL and you need to enclose $10 check for shipment. I&#x27;m not sure if we decide to send it across the country for repair but I&#x27;m certain that&#x27;s the last elchim product we purchased.</li>
    <li> I got a product that was loose in the box. It seemed like a return even thought it said new on the box needless to say I returned it. For the price I&#x27;m paying, it should be a new product. There was just an instruction pamphlet but no other packaging which I found weird hence the 1 star. Not sure how long it will last so I am returning it - just FYI. Mine also does not say turbo on it either.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this. It does make my hair look much better than my cheaper hairdryer. It is a little heavy (but not so much it&#x27;s a problem). The settings are good. I wish it dried my hair faster (I&#x27;ve heard about other ones that dry your hair faster). But again, my hair looks noticeably better, so I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and demand high performance from my tools. This dryer is quiet, light weight and gets the job done fast. The only downfall is there is no cool shot button.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer because my friend had one and loved it. Well, I love mine too! This dryer will dry your hair quickly without causing damage. It also reduces frizz really well, especially when used with a round brush. They sell this exact same hair dryer at the salon where I get my hair cut... at three times the price!!! I would highly recommend! This is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 7 months now. It is Well worth the money. My professional dryer broke that I had for 15 yrs. and I bought a cheap con air dryer to use temporarily until I could figure out what dryer was best. I could not get my hair straight enough with the conair. Decided on this Elchim brand which I am extremely happy with. I have naturally curly hair and this dryer makes my hair silky straight, just like my old blow dryer. I believe it will last for many years. Toggle switches just need a little time to get use too. My neighbor is a hairdresser and he told me to buy this brand. Ulta has it for much more money.</li>
    <li> This improved the way my hair looked after the first use, I highly recommend it!  My fine hair looks fuller and more like my stylist did it than me....</li>
    <li> Best blow dry ever, I have been buying these for years ..</li>
    <li> My wife was trying different brands of blow dryers for years. She was not impressed at all. Till our hair stylist receommended Elchim professional and my wife noticed the difference right away. She is very pleased.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the real thing,  I believe it is a fake elchim product.  The quality is no where near the same as the original one I purchased through Elchim a few years ago.  It does not even get hot on the high setting.  Wish I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in half the time. Love this dryer!</li>
    <li> Excellent, powerful motor and it leaves my hair very shiny</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this blowdryer. It makes my hair so shiny and nice. It also blowdries it in less than 10 minutes (and I have pretty long hair) I have already had 3 friends test this out and buy it.</li>
    <li> Worth the money.  My hair dries faster and is less tangled when done. I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom.</li>
    <li> Worked great while it lasted - which was less than a year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely hot, so it just takes 15-20 minutes for me blow dry my wet hair as if I have ironed it :)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great!!  Works like all the reviews say.&lt;br /&gt;Has lots of power and makes hair shine and full of body.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy another hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for our daughter, and she tells us it is fantastic!  What more could we ask for?</li>
    <li> As its a lot stronger than Conair&#x27;s hair dryer and can get your hair dry in 15 mins (I have waist length thick wavy hair). Not very heavy (I am a small person and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy in my hand). Like all other hair dryers it does dry out your hair and damage it. If you use it on the highest setting and for longer duration like 25 mins, you will not need to straighten your hair too much as this itself would do the job. However, unlike the straightener, this will keep the volume of your hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dryer. Drying time is less and manageability of hair is so much better! I don&#x27;t have to iron my hair anymore!</li>
    <li> I had owned an Elchim dryer before and loved it.  When my daughter moved out of my house she took it with her.  I needed another dryer and decided to purchase the same one as it works great in drying my thick hair quickly.  Would recommend this product.  Long lasting with out any problems.</li>
    <li> The motor blew out after a year and a half</li>
    <li> Received this hair dryer in red/black. It&#x27;s supposed to have writing on the top that says &#x27;Turbo high pressure&#x27; in gold but mine doesn&#x27;t! Does this mean its a fake!?</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair looking healthier, shinier and virtually no breakage at all! My old dryer was frying my hair. I could tell the very first use that it was not damaging my hair and causing it to break. I love this dryer! It also dries SUPER-FAST! It used to take me about 15 to 20 minutes to dry my hair. Now it takes only about 8 minutes in all.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this dryer is really quiet!</li>
    <li> This blowdryer has great wind power and delivers a lot of heat - both make it great at styling my very curly hair.  It is a reasonable weight and fits comfortably in my small hands, which makes maneuvering it easy.  I only wish it came with a diffuser attachment.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It blows your hair out in less time then most hair dryers. I love it, its a must have if you blow your hair out a lot.</li>
    <li> It was an OK hair dryer....but not worth the money spent on it. I ended up returning it to buy a less expensive one.</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer for almost 3 years now. My daughter liked it so much that I bought this for her this Christmas. She now is as happy as I am.  It is fairly light weight but has the power of a professional.</li>
    <li> I would recomend this hair dryer to anyone especially those with thick hair.  It does wonders for my hair and straightens my hair in no time.  I have thik hair and a busy life style, so I need a dryer that will dry my hair fast.  Ordinary dryers take 2 hours to dry my hair while this one take half hour.  It would work on fine hair as well.  It&#x27;s a great product which I have bought before at a salon years ago for much more.  I decided to buy in on Amazon for in the salon they are charging $200.00.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  I have short, really thick hair and with my old hair dryer it was taking 15 minutes to dry it.  This dryer gets it done in 5 minutes and it looks great.  The on/off and temp switches seem backward to me, but I&#x27;ll get used to that.  This is a life saver if you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser I have try different brands this the best so far. The price is right n the brand is good.</li>
    <li> All in all a good dryer. However, when you are styling your hair, the control settings are where your hand holds the dryer and they shift...very annoying.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer! I tried a different one that a friend had and fell in love with the company. I purchased this one as soon as my other one bit the dust! love it!!</li>
    <li> its a great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> high quality product.</li>
    <li> For the price, this has been a good hairdryer.  I was considering much more expensive dryers when I saw reviews for this one.  It has great heat control, very cool/warm/very hot.  I accidentally change the setting with my fingers like other reviewers, but not a big deal.  So far, I like it.</li>
    <li> This one is simply not as powerful as my old Elchim (which lasted many years) and I am not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Well I had to put a 1 star on this because of the seller.  I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Drys hair quickly!</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for more than 5 years, and it&#x27;s still going strong. My hair can be a challenge to style. This is the only dryer that does not leave my hair frizzy. Hair is smooth and styled exactly the way you want, given you use the proper technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this because my stylist used it, so I knew it had to be a work horse. I will continue to buy Elchim for all future styling tools.</li>
    <li> Had a good experience with this order, it took about 7 business days to arrive.  And have been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> This is a great product....it dries my thick hair so quickly...and all of our three daughters have hair that is super thick and super long....Unfortunately I ordered on for our daughter&#x27;s birthday and her birthday has come and gone and still no hair dryer....contacted seller...waiting for reply....Now daughter went back to college without her birthday gift from Mom and Dad. :(</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this hairdryer first and I kept borrowing hers. Finially decided to buy my own and I am very happy with the dryer. It is a light weight and packs a lot of pwer. Goes from hot to cold in seconds. I am very happy with the hairdryer and hope it lasts for years.</li>
    <li> Very good dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> When I decided to purchase this..my mind was made up..I was going professional.  The price for a professional hair dryer could be very expensive considering I am not a hairstylist; so I brought this..it was priced in the middle.  I totally love this Elchim!!! I have curly hair and I could straighten it or wear it curly with no frizz.  I would recommend this product.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an 1800 watt Elchim Pro dryer.  The dryer looked identical in every way (name too) to the blower I was replacing, with the only difference being enhanced by 200 watts.  As soon as it was removed from the box, it was immediately noted that it was lighter in weight compared to my 1800 watt unit.  The difference in weight is due to flimsy plastic, which will not be as durable as it&#x27;s older predecessor.</li>
    <li> This brand was recommended by my hair stylist.  It is perfect to straighten hair; however, for soft curly hair such as mine, the heat is too strong even at &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; level.  I have to use the old hair drying when diffusing my hair.  My daughters, who happened to have &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; hair, love this hair drying because it straightens it fast and without drying it.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping. This blow dryer is amazing because it makes the hair very soft and dries it very quickly. I would definitely invest in another one.</li>
    <li> This is my third favorite. First is the Sedu and second is the Parlux. This is great for the price however.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve normally loved my elchim blowdryers. this one did not make the cut. i felt like it was smaller and less powerful than my usual blowdryers. if i could return it, i would.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair so fast and sleek.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved this dryer...except for the fact that the motor died after a year...super annoyed</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky and drys fast. It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I&#x27;d recommend for how much nicer it leaves your hair than an average dryer</li>
    <li> Bought this in 2013.  Loved it, worked great.  All of a sudden stopped working.  Contacted seller and they said because it was 2 years ago, they wouldn&#x27;t replace it.  Not sure I would spend the money again, considering it broke after 2 years.</li>
    <li> As prescribed it Works well sofar will see how long it last. I use it on a daily basis handle pretty good</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. I did a lot of research as to what people where saying was the best hair dryer nowdays and it consistenly showed this one! I love the high pressure and the different settings. My hair is silky and definitely not frizzy by the end of a hair drying session. :)</li>
    <li> After several cheap hair dryers died on me, I realized that this is an appliance worth investing in. I use it every day! So after reading many reviews, I bit the bullet and paid the big dollars for this Elchim. BEST DECISION I EVER MADE. My hair is smoother and dries faster. I&#x27;ve had zero issues with sparking or wear and tear. As far as I can tell, a year later, it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
    <li> Very happy, and it performs as stated</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer. I bought the corresponding diffuser and they are both great products. I love the power and the heat levels... it works really fast. I use it on my dog as well... the medium heat is great for her.</li>
    <li> After reading the rave reviews, I had expectations.  They were not met. First, this blow dryer does not dry my hair&lt;br /&gt;1% faster than my $15 Conair. Secondly, it takes the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; about 15 seconds to cool off which I&#x27;ve never encountered&lt;br /&gt;on any drier before.  Third, if I hold the dryer with my hand wrapped around the handle like normal, I accidentally press both the temperature and speed buttons which stick out (they are the rocking kind, they don&#x27;t slide which would have been much better).&lt;br /&gt;It was not worth the splurge.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! Uses it ALL THE TIME! Thank you</li>
    <li> I USUALLY NEVER write reviews for anything, but this hair dryer impressed me so much I had to.  After all, I read reviews before purchasing stuff!  Used it this morning for the first time  I usually use a T3 hairdryer.  My new Elchim 2001 dried my hair is HALF the time!  I couldnt believe it.  My hair was so soft, silky, manageable!  The dryer even seemed to style it some, believe it or not!  I LOVE this product!  Well worth the money, and it wasnt even really expensive, in my opinion!  Well worth it!  LOVE mine!</li>
    <li> Very good works welll</li>
    <li> best blowdryer I&#x27;ve owned, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years and still works as good as new.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer! Had it for a couple of years and it&#x27;s still going strong. Powerful and HOT!</li>
    <li> My first one lasted 20 years. I ordered this to replace it.</li>
    <li> gets the job done, lightweight and powerful</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, but when it arrived it looked like someone had previously returned this product.  It was loose in the manufacturers box, the cord was not even tied together.  I returned this product.</li>
    <li> This is the second blower I&#x27;ve owned! I almost went for the newer style...so glad I didn&#x27;t! I just love this model and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever look to change! It&#x27;s a great, reliable blower and the power behind this puppy is awesome! I tend to have frizzy hair, so I need a good blower to smooth it out! This is the perfect choice to remedy this hair type! :-)</li>
    <li> Quality hair dryer, this really moves some air.</li>
    <li> really disappointing ... this is my third one and other two are great but this one it worked fine and after a few using started to blow cold air .. i return it</li>
    <li> I love using this hair dryer. It&#x27;s simple to use and has a clean design. If you google the reviews for this product, you will see that many people recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought the original one about 12 years ago and it broke about three months ago.  I found this one and bought it and I was very disappointed.  The box it comes in looks legit, but the actual dryer is very CHEAP.  Don&#x27;t buy this dryer if you think your going to get the same dryer from 12 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Hair Dryer for the money. Actually, I&#x27;ve bought two for our home. Great Price!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! I have long, thick, wavy/almost curly hair, and for years I have been going through hair product after product, trying to find one that would tame my hair smooth when blowing it dry - it turns out that I should have been looking for this hair dryer! It dries my hair quickly, and I can dry it to a straight and smooth style that lasts all day WITHOUT ANY HAIR PRODUCT! No gels, or straighteners, or finishers, just great, smooth hair. This dryer will save me all of the money I have been throwing away on hair products with only so-so results, and is more than worth the price.</li>
    <li> Came in a beat up box, clearly used even though listed as new. Different watt then listed. Then exploded while I was using it within the first month, luckily I didn&#x27;t get hurt. Worst hair dryer I have ever bought. Absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> My Elchim from the 90s finally died and it was like a death in the family.  My hair, while I used a temporary hair dryer was atrocious with frizz and stray hairs everywhere.  This Elchim showed up and it was like a miracle.  The hair dryer is just amazing.  I read some of the reviews and there was a burning smell for the 1st and maybe 2nd time I used it, but never again.  It leaves your hair silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and regarding the heaviness...don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.  It is heavy until you use it.  Then magically the weight is distributed nicely.  Don&#x27;t ask me how...some kudos go to the designers!</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer and continue to buy them as they get beat up by my frequent travel.</li>
    <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as the previous one I owned but it is just as well - my previous one would sometimes burn my scalp it was so hot! Great product.</li>
    <li> I love love love this hair dryer. I have had it for quite a while, and it has been amazing. Great for blowing my hair straight, never burns, and dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because my daughter hated the loud hair dryer we had. This one is quite a bit quieter and well made.</li>
    <li> This is the second Elchim Pro 2001 that&#x27;s been ordered from Amazon. It&#x27;s a model that was recommended by my wife&#x27;s hairdresser. The previous Elchim lasted a good 4 years of daily use by my wife and and often by our daughters who have shoulder length and longer hair. The dryer has the &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; to get the job done with a variety of heat and speed settings which I&#x27;m told is important for hair that may be colored and thick etc.. For under a $100, I&#x27;d recommend it based on the happy ladies here at home. The one that was replaced still heats but isn&#x27;t blowing as hard. I may try to take it apart just to see if it&#x27;s something that may have come loose from the occasional drops.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but A LOT of it and normally takes me over an hour to blow dry my hair.  My hairstylist uses this on my hair and it cuts the drying time in half, so I purchased one to use at home. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
