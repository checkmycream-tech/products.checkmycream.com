      <li>Fine lines under eyes are reduced.</li>
      <li>This stuff helps my fine line and pigmentation and did not clog my pores.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one stands out far above the rest.</li>
      <li>I believe this is a good product but should be introduced to your skin slowly.  </li>
      <li>The real deal, brand new out of the sealed box.</li>
      <li>I go through tubes of it at a rather, high rate.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>

      <li>Most importantly for me, it did not cause any rash like some other anti-aging products I used in past.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eye area</li>
      <li>it keeps my very sensitive eye area well hydrated.</li>
      <li>Women show their age around the eyes in particular so it is extremely important to care for that very delicate skin right under your eyes.  </li>
      <li>This eye cream isn&#x27;t too light or too heavy.</li>
      <li>I have day cream that I often use that has some natural ingredients that can sting the slightest bit after using the night cream</li>
      <li>i am 43 years old</li>
      <li>I started using this a few months ago and have received many compliments recently about how young I look...</li>
      <li>and I can tell this product although little in amount will last me easily 8-12 months.</li>
      <li>Regular moisturizers will not penetrate this sensitive skin...</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a real dermalogica product. It smells weird, and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. I believe the product sold to me was a fake or out dated and spoiled. I will buy from an authorized dealer next time.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this is a standby I keep coming back to.  It is expensive but lasts a long time.  The only downfall is making sure you don&#x27;t rub your eyes or place too close because it will irritate eye.</li>
    <li> I have used many different kinds of eye cream but find I am allergic to most. I have been using this eye cream for several years now and have not had a problem with allergies. It makes my under eyes very soft and honestly I miss it when I forget to use it! I highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I will order this again</li>
    <li> Initial application was smooth, soothing, and softening, but I have seen no change in fine lines by using the Age Smart Reversal Eye Complex.  I will not be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> Love love this product</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> At the beginning this cream looked nice. And I have no complains about its consistency or smell, it is good product, but! there&#x27;s is one big issue - it can cause allergy and irritation. My skin reacted weirdly on this cream, at first everything looked nice, but then I noticed that my skin started paining and burning after application of  any other product including makeup remover, and creams that never caused any bad sensation before. And there were no reaction (but redness) after dermatololigica cream application.  After 2 weeks waiting for miracle to happen I gave up! My skin under eyes looked worse than ever, red, in wrinkles, paining. I stopped using it. My skin could tolerate only olive oil for 5 days, after healing, I bought another cream with no retinol. Now my eyes look much healthier and better.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream ever!!!</li>
    <li> Thr formula must have changed.  I have used this before and this time it was awful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;I received the package earlier as requested!&lt;br /&gt;Very good customer service!!!</li>
    <li> Quality is very good.That I like.I would recommend to my friends.I trust the amazon</li>
    <li> Has an awful smell. And do not seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> Really does help to eliminate the under eye issues.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say that my light lines are noticeably decreased but I can tell the cream is working. I have day cream that I often use that has some natural ingredients that can sting the slightest bit after using the night cream but I don&#x27;t mind because it lets me know the night cream is doing what it says. And the tingle isn&#x27;t painful.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few months ago and have received many compliments recently about how young I look...IDK if its this or not but I will keep using it!!</li>
    <li> tap a little around the eye,this works!!! no kidding! do this morning and night,works well enough to buy again and again! i am 43 years old and i&#x27;ve been carded at stores!!!! this rocks. get some,feel better,be happy</li>
    <li> Authentic product from Dermalogica. This stuff helps my fine line and pigmentation and did not clog my pores. Fast shipping from this seller. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but somewhat my skin around my eyes becomes redish. Fine lines under eyes are reduced. So I gave it a four star.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, even in delicate skin. No irritation. Tried many others, but always return to this eye cream for night time use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. expensive but seems to last a while. I have very sensitive eye area and this has not caused redness like most eye teams I have tried. Overall very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I had tried a lot of eye cream and they are either no effect or too greasy for me. Had been using this product for quite some time and it works great for me. Not too oily and help to reduce fine lines. Definitely will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Love it. Arrived on time. No problems.</li>
    <li> This eye cream isn&#x27;t too light or too heavy. It instantly moisturizes the area. It reduces the appearance of fine lines.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best I have tried. I have spent a lot of money on face products and I finally found something I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The real deal, brand new out of the sealed box. a tiny dab spreads evenly along my eyes and I can tell this product although little in amount will last me easily 8-12 months. Will see how the resulst of longer use are but this is the real stuff.</li>
    <li> I think this product is over rated.</li>
    <li> The seller shipped it out of it&#x27;s security-sealed Dermalogica box! So that it would fit into a shipping envelope!  The product seems different then the it should be.  I&#x27;m a long time Dermalogica user and of this product.  I don&#x27;t trust what I was just sold.  Other sellers sell me their Dermalogica items in the box with the security seal intact.  Always have to worry about fraud.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines.  I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.  I can&#x27;t justify the price without noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I love all Dermalogica products but the Age Smart line is truly outstanding.  I will be 64 in October and most people think I am in my 40&#x27;s.  Women show their age around the eyes in particular so it is extremely important to care for that very delicate skin right under your eyes.  Regular moisturizers will not penetrate this sensitive skin...you must use an EYE cream...so why not use the best!</li>
    <li> I s drying on the eyes</li>
    <li> I typically love Demologica products. However, my eyes are hyper sensative and this product makes them red and can only use about once a week.  When I do use, see no change.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams but this one gives the best moisture without being too greasy.  I go through tubes of it at a rather, high rate. Dermalogica Products are excellent.</li>
    <li> I am in the older age group and a good quality eye cream makes such a difference. I do not look my age and this eye cream is one of the reasons why. It is one beauty area where I won&#x27;t skimp on price or quality.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years to help with wrinkles and puffy eyes. It never fails to please me.</li>
    <li> This is a rich and smooth cream and smells good. It is good product and very reasonable price. Most importantly for me, it did not cause any rash like some other anti-aging products I used in past.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for nice price with visible effect. I use it for several years and not going to change it.</li>
    <li> I am a devoted fan; works just as it should.  Arrived in no time.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> This is not your everyday under eye cream and can cause irritation. I used for 3 days and my under eye area dried out and became very wrinkled and inflamed.  The retinal content is 1% and I didn&#x27;t think that was much but, for some it might be.  I believe this is a good product but should be introduced to your skin slowly.  if you notice any stinging, dryness, redness you should stop using until it clears up.  I love Dermalogica but think they should have provided better instruction on how to use this if you&#x27;re new to retinal products.  Use this product carefully.</li>
    <li> The product is the best. Great to diminish those fine lines at eye corners.  Use everyday to smooth the lines and you will love the results</li>
    <li> This is an amazing buy, started seeing results after 3 days! I am happy i invested in this product ... Will definitely recommend this to others. I&#x27;ve tried many products and this one stands out far above the rest.</li>
    <li> I like the product. We&#x27;ll see how it works over time.</li>
    <li> I like the non-greasy feel. it keeps my very sensitive eye area well hydrated. i like all the dermatologic products I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to get a sample of this in a facial I won. I am in my late 50&#x27;s and find this is just a superb product. It goes on without being oily and really lasts. Big plus, you only need a little. I will also buy the three sample pack again that includes the night repair serum and the Super Rich Repair because that size is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is very good. It works very well. My only critcism I have is that it&#x27;s such a waste to package it in a small tube.</li>
    <li> I am 61 and I just love this.I have been using this since was 58. A very little goes a long way. I can notice fewer lines around my eyes. This is an improvement.</li>
