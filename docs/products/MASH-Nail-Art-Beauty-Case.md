<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this box. Absolutely perfect for my nail polishes and other nail supplies. Huge upgrade from what I was using for storage. Nice to have it all organized and compact.</li>
    <li> key does not work.( fake)</li>
    <li> This is a nice case for the price.  Something like this would probably cost $20-$25 at Target or Ulta.  It&#x27;s a decent size and deep enough to store plenty of items.  I bought it for all of my nail art supplies, however, it could work as a makeup case also.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot.  Only reason for 4 stars is that it&#x27;s walls are rather thin but I expected that for the price.  If you&#x27;re gentle with it and don&#x27;t overfill it, it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Quality case, I will be back to purchase  another. Larger than expected, even better than photo a great deal well worth the price</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my growing collection of OPI &#x3D;) It opens smoothly and has plenty of space up top for all my nail needs! I have recommended this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> The box is nice and cute. My husband likes it. I put all my nail tools in there and it fits nicely. It would have been nice to have more compartments on it. But I still like it.</li>
    <li> I love the cases! They fit both my crowns no problems! They are big and for the price they are a great bargain! I will be buying more cases.</li>
    <li> This item broke too easily used. The handle is weak but I like to see inside it so handle it carefully.</li>
    <li> Oh, I so love this case! I use it as a supplemental case for my nail polishes (I have so many, I need two cases). It&#x27;s very well made, I like that it&#x27;s transparent and I can see everything. The black hanging shelf is very convenient. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Well, for what the price is, don&#x27;t expect a whole lot. It is a nice and tidy little case for nail polishes, which is what my intended usage for it was. And I do like the black shelf on top, which holds my nail dremel, tweezers, a compact mirror, and a few other tid-bits. However, it does feel a bit cheap, sort of like CD cases. Also, even though it has a lock on it and it comes with two little keys, the lock on mine doesn&#x27;t work. I guess I was expecting it to work like Caboodles do, but it&#x27;s fine with me. I don&#x27;t really have to lock nail supplies up. If you don&#x27;t intended on moving it around a lot or using it for any other use besides make-up and nail polish, grab a few. I know I&#x27;ll be getting more of them.</li>
    <li> Originally thought it would be a bit bigger, also the keys do not work!&lt;br /&gt;But overall Its okay I guess.</li>
    <li> I do nails for my friends and family and this is the perfect case to bring my go-to top 20 polishes and smaller decorative polishes and brushes. Looking to get a second one. They are really sturdy, I use the heck out of mine and it has really held up</li>
    <li> This is a perfect case for pageant crowns!  The top tray can hold bobby pins or whatever else&lt;br /&gt;is needed.  The Sash fits inside with the crown.  Crown cases can cost up to 80.00 so this is&lt;br /&gt;a great purchase.</li>
    <li> this mash nail art beauty box case was a great gift for my sister. she use it for her nail polish and it very roomy for brushes also</li>
    <li> I love the case, but I thought it was going to be bigger! I use the case all uf the time!</li>
    <li> I certainly liked the look of this box when I saw it online, I liked the fact it had the separte compartment to house all my nail brushes; however, it&#x27;s not as durable as I thought it would be and it doesn&#x27;t hold all my polishes.  I would have given a more stars but the box had two scratches on it.  One is quite long the other is longer than I expected and the rim of the box where the lock is was bent in, I was able to pull it out.  In all fairness, I emailed the company regarding the issues and the lady asked me to send a photo of the scratches.  My house was torn apart, things were everywhere because the installers had removed all the carpet in my entire house to replace with hardwood flooring, dust everyone, therefore, when I got home, I totally forgot to take a picture(s), not to mention, I&#x27;m a 57 yr old, I&#x27;m not savvy when it comes to taking pics and sending them to others if the person&#x27;s information is not already programmed in my phone. The box &amp;#34;WAS NOT&amp;#34; accompanied with any type of return form(s), had that been the case I would have &amp;#34;immediately&amp;#34; returned it.  I&#x27;ve never received a package that did not contain a return form or some type of contact information. I believe a customer should always be happy, in this case I&#x27;m not, the company should have immediately offered that I return the box for a new one.  She didn&#x27;t say that, she want to see pics, as if I&#x27;m not being truthful, at least that&#x27;s the way I took it.  If they are reading this review, I&#x27;m hoping they send me another box and I&#x27;ll gladly return the other.</li>
    <li> I love the product itself, I was looking for a clear case that was big enough to store all my makeup. This works perfectly. However, this vendor shipped it USPS which I HATE because they won&#x27;t leave it at your door if you&#x27;re not home, you have to go pick it up at the post office. Had it been delivered UPS, I would have been much happier. It&#x27;s something small and petty, but that&#x27;s the only complaint I had.</li>
    <li> Holds a lot of bottles.  Have bought others and didn&#x27;t hold up as well.</li>
    <li> This case is great for organizing your nail polish as well as your nail tools in the little velvet box in the top.  The box hasn&#x27;t gotten scratched, even with continued opening and use.  Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a nail case for quite awhile &amp;&amp; i came across this one.! I love it.! It holds many polishes.! I would recommend this case to anyone thats looking for one.! Order fast because they go out of stock very quickly.!</li>
    <li> The case did arrive before scheduled.  I bought it for my Daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She needed a place to put her nail polish and accessories.  She got it Sunday and has carried it everywhere with her for the past week.  She can&#x27;t wait to fill it up with more nail stuff.  It is a cheap case but for beginners or youth it is great.  No need in spending a lot of money one an expensive case when this one works.  I will buy her a better case some day.  But this one works for what we needed it for, now.  My daughter was happy to get it.  She has been asked by my co-workers if she would do their nails.  (Since the case is clear, everyone knows what you are doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to keep all your stuff in one place and also take it with you to do someone&#x27;s nails or such, this is a great cheap product.</li>
    <li> This case is the perfect size for storing nail polish and tools. I can fit everything I need to do my nails very nicely.  It can hold 28 bottles of nail polish and the top shelf is great for nail tools.  It is made of pretty thin acrylic but if you&#x27;re not tossing it around it is fine and lets face it you get what you pay for at $19.99 I really didn&#x27;t expect something heavy duty. I&#x27;m not sure what good the lock is if anyone wanted anything inside they could easily break it open.</li>
    <li> I received it broken and it&#x27;s still sitting in my garage in the box still broken. I&#x27;ve never gotten the chance to use it, therefore, it&#x27;s no good to me.</li>
    <li> Just love this case &amp; how organize my nail stuff inside the case. I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My slightly problem about this was the steel was was unglue but that isn&#x27;t a big deal to solve, just going to get a glue to fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;all in all, its a great product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product and it suits my needs perfectly :) great for someone who is looking for that little something extra!</li>
    <li> everything is great with this case but size is smaller than what it seems like on pic.</li>
    <li> This is just perfect to get my wife&#x27;s nailpolish collection from overrunning our bathroom!  I gave it to her for the holidays and she loved it. ^_^.</li>
    <li> I was looking at this product to store my nail polishes in, I looked through the comments to see if anyone said anything about how many it holds and there was no mention. So here I am in case anyone else wants to know the same thing! It holds about 24, 12 seems to take up ½ the case.  Now, for the product review; it is glass I think. Honestly I didn&#x27;t investigate what material it is. It&#x27;s on the heavy side, and seems fragile but I&#x27;m sure it only feels that way because I know its glass or glass-like (the sides are reasonably thick). However, you&#x27;re not going to play baseball with it so it isn&#x27;t something I would be concerned with.  It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected. My one and only concern with this product is the key and lock. If you&#x27;re looking to lock it, I&#x27;d look elsewhere. The lock is that cheap diary lock with the thin metal key. It does not lock/unlock nicely and it almost feels that if you continuously use it, it might break. The lock is not needed though because it has a clip so it won&#x27;t affect the use. Over all, it fits my needs perfectly and will fit my nail polish, my tools and then some. It&#x27;s big &amp; sturdy. Great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, its not glass. Its a plastic material. But none the less, its still perfect!</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful gift for my daughter since she likes doing design nails to her friends. It&#x27;s a great storage. Easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> The product was packed and shipped really good (one thing I was really worried about)without any sort of damages. I think the quality is really good for the price. I use it to store my nail art supplies like rhinestones, fimo canes, nail art pens, nail art polishes etc. In the little black drawer, I keep my dotting tools, rhinestone tweezer and some nail art brushes. Serves the purpose really good. Highly recommend it. It&#x27;s sturdy and not small to store all the stuff for nail art. Glad I purchased it since it keeps my stuff organised.</li>
    <li> I bought some for myself and as a gift.  Good construction and I use it for my nail polish.  I put the nail polish wipe removes on the top and the nail polish on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m recently started DIY manicures and wanted a case to contain the products so far acquired. This case is a nice fit for what I have. It does seem a little flimsy (the case walls are quite thin), and the handle is plastic. I&#x27;m concerned about the handle breaking while case is being carried, so I tend to carry it by holding it from below. At some point, I may remove the current handle and replace it with something similarly sized, but made from something less likely to break, but will wait to see if the case itself hold up before making any modifications.</li>
    <li> I was so afraid that this would be cracked by the time it got to me....nope!  Arrived early and in perfect condition.  I literally purchased every nail do-dad from Mash for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and, yes, everything fits!  The plastic walls are thick, the hinges are sturdy, latches nicely, there is space between the black shelf and the lid when closed so every file, exacto knife, tweezer and dotting pen fit EVEN IN THIER OWN PACKAGING!  This is a gift so I want everything unopened.  I have every size/color rhinestones, flowers, glitters, polishes, top coat, stampers, scraper &amp; holder, stamping discs, 15 pc brush set in a case, brush cleaner and cup, confetti, fimo canes and I swear there is room for more.  Especially when she gets rid of all the plastic and blister packaging.  I want one for myself soon.</li>
    <li> This box is great for the price!!  It sturdy and holds a lot of nail art supplies.  Good looking box too.  Looking to order more of them!</li>
    <li> I like it ,very practical .nice look ,good price .I use it for nail art accessories and brushes ,also my sister got one for her</li>
    <li> Looks cheap for the $$. It&#x27;s really the only thing like it so not much of a choice but will probably break soon.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 of these.  The first one&#x27;s latch did not work so I returned it and got another.  My nail art supplies are growing so quickly that I&#x27;ve had to buy two  more.  LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> Yes it arrived on time, looks just like the picture just very small and very thin and cheaply made. I thought it was going to be a lil bigger then what it was n better quality but i was wrong i was better off going to walmart, would have paid less and it would have been bigger in better quality. Be very careful if u purchase this product it is very delicate dont forget where you set it down cause if you accidently bump it your thru!</li>
    <li> I use this for a makeup case. I put my bushes on the top shelf and cosmetics below.&lt;br /&gt;I can find everything easily.</li>
    <li> I USE IT FOR MAKEUP AND JUST LOVE IT.  A NICE TRAVEL CASE AS WELL, YOU CAN SEE INSIDE WITHOUT OPENING IT.&lt;br /&gt;KAT</li>
    <li> I love this box. It was the perfect size for my first aid kit! I&#x27;m moving to college and wanted to bring my own and decided to make one instead of buying one. I only gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of cracks at the back left corner but nothing that seriously threatened the box&#x27;s structural integrity. Bottom line, I&#x27;d definitely buy it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely perfect for what needed it for and it actually turned out to be bigger then I expected! The shipping was fast and I just love the product!</li>
    <li> Considering the huge nail polish collection my mom has, this case is great. It was a little smaller than I had expected, but it seems very sturdy and will definitely hold all of the nail polish she has, for now at least.</li>
    <li> This case is the perfect size to organize everything and it has a lock.  Now how smart is that?  Just perfectly a good fit.</li>
    <li> I keep all my gel nail polishes in this. I like it because I can see through it and it holds enough.</li>
    <li> Nice showcase for your jewelry or anything you want to keep safe but show off - makes a nice gift</li>
    <li> I  liked the box because there&#x27;s plenty of room for all my nail polishes, decals, nail cutter, nail polish remover, nail files, and electric manicure set. and everything else. It fits about 25 nail polishes in the bottom section and on top its long enough for nail files. its about 3 or 4 inches wide and about 1 inch deep. The only thing that i didn&#x27;t really like was that plastic looks a little cheap and its not completely glued to the metal edges so it looks weak but if you take care of the case it looks like it should last a while. I bought one for myself and i showed it to my mom and she asked to order one for her. Hopefully it is a durable case.</li>
    <li> It cracked in a week. A week after that the handle came off. The look is great. The size is perfect, but it&#x27;s a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Case cracked ... gift ... contacted vendor ... NO REPLY ... repaired adequately myself ... THIS VENDOR DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR MONEY.</li>
