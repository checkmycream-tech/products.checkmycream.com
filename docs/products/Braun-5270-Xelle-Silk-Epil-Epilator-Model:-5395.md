<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it every week since I bought it and it was a very good (and cheap) investment! It&#x27;s too bad I broke the plastic protection (that you put on top) but it was just an accessory. The best electric epilator I had so far :)</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator back in February 2011 and I STILL use it. I use it to remove my underarm hair and it works like a charm. I don&#x27;t experience any hair breakage, it pulls the hair right out. I read some reviews of people complaining about ingrown hairs. I took care of that by exfoliating my underarms 2-3 times a week with a rough cloth while showering. It took care of the problem immediately, no more ingrown hairs! The little bag that it came in is now ripped down the middle, but I don&#x27;t really care about that as long as the epilator works like it should! I honestly could not believe I bought it 4 years ago. I will definitely buy it again once my current one stops working, which I can&#x27;t see happening any time soon. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best epilator I ever had! I really like it!  It&#x27;s fast, light, easy to clean. I never thought that i needed the light on the front but i  do! It&#x27;s so helpful. It helps to see the finest hairs.  Trimmer works  good.  I has all necessary functions. I definitely recommend it to everybody!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;My Wife&#x27;s Review to this product.\\&quot;  I highly recommend this product.   I am a regular waxer. I was incredulous to buy this product at first. But then after I read all of the reveiws, I decided to go ahead and order this epilator. The reveiws were correct, the pain is incredible. You&#x27;ll get use to it though &amp; each time you use it the pain diminishes. It removes the hair &amp; makes your skin feel amazing!</li>
    <li> After using a little cheapsy one from Walmart to see if I liked it, I decided to upgrade to this one.  I LOVE it!  It is fast and efficient.  One warning however.... I have never had a problem doing my underarms, but the \\&quot;super-strong\\&quot; head on this one is a bit too much.  It did make me bleed a little, but it didn&#x27;t hurt any more than normal.  Also, don&#x27;t even get close to a mole.   OUCH!  I still use that head on my legs, but have gone to the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head with rollers for underarms with no problems.  I love the light on this.  I am blonde, so it&#x27;s hard to see hair sometimes until I get out in the sun.  By then, it&#x27;s too late.  The light just shines on everything as I am using it.  This is a great product and I think it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used an epilator before, nor had I ever waxed my legs or underarms. But I really got sick of shaving constantly and dealing with stubble and cutting my ankles, etc etc etc, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I listened to the advice of other reviewers and it helped a lot! So I&#x27;m passing on their advice and a few tips of my own:    1) Use Veet or Nair for a good two or three weeks before your first epi use. I found it softened my hair and made it easier. I still use Veet every now and again to wipe away lighter thigh hair and thinner leg hairs. Can&#x27;t believe how great it works after using the epi for two years! (Veet works much better if you first dampen your legs with a hot washcloth to open the hair follicles and soften the hair.)    2) Enjoy a glass of wine (or two) for the first epi. It does hurt, but just remember it will never hurt as bad again on your legs.     3) After two years, I barely even feel it on my legs. And the hair is WAY finer, comes in slower and lighter. Even with longish hair on my legs, you can barely see it or feel it...and I&#x27;m a brunette. I often do epi touch ups while watching tv. Remember, hair grows in cycles...a touchup every few days works great and goes faster than leaving it all for one hairy removal.    4) I use the epi on my underarms...it&#x27;s a little less painful after two years, but it still hurts (especially near my period). For underarms, make sure you stay dry or you&#x27;ll get a skin irritation! So apply deodorant or powder before using the epi on underarms. Much less irritation than shaving and hair comes in finer.    5) I tried to epi my bikini line and it was just too dang painful. Better luck to you!    6) For ingrown hairs on leg, I use a disinfected pin to lightly pop them out before using the epi.    7) I tried in grown hair serums and tea tree oil, etc., but eventually just stopped using them because they didn&#x27;t work for me. After two years of using the epi, I barely get irritation anymore anyway. But a helpful hint to avoid exacerbating any irritation, avoid putting on lotions or cremes for a while after you epi.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...I use it as a supplement to waxing, for places that are harder to wax, and also for the little hairs that waxing sometimes misses.  The first time I used it was pretty painful, as other reviewers have also said.  After a couple times though, it is much more tolerable, less painful, less noticeable.  I use it every few days to clean up little hairs that are growing in at different rates, and my legs are nice and smooth now most of the time with little effort!    The only thing I would say against it is it is VERY noisy, so if you have housemates they will all know (or wonder) what you are doing.  HArd to be private with it.    Mostly I love it!</li>
    <li> 767 reviews and 4.5 stars. you automatically think it&#x27;s an awesome product and put aside those reviews with one star or two star rating thinking those negatives happen to few unfortunate people. But then that unfortunate things happens to you and then you realize the importance of those bad reviews.    This products is amazing. I have been shaving my legs for almost 10 years now and few weeks ago I thought \\&quot;why not go for epilation which will leave me hairless for few weeks?\\&quot; I googled the best epilator and read dozens of articles and zeroed in on braun silk epil x&#x27;elle. I tried the product. It was amazing. The pain which I dreaded so much after reading many reviews turned out to be bearable.I felt I truly loved this amazing product. It left my legs so smooth and hairless that I just loved it and thought I finally found the ultimate method of hair removal. For the next week and half I ended up admiring my \\&quot;new\\&quot; legs a whole bunch of times in a day. After a week and half, it all began...    one red bump (with an ingrown hair in it) after the other erupted until in a few days my legs were covered with red bumps. I panicked and researched like crazy about remedies to ingrown hairs. After trying like crazy to tweeze the ingrown hair out with tweezers, I bought B &amp; C skin tight ingrown hair solution and tried it for two days and ordered prince reigns solution online. I stopped using prince reigns (very expensive) as after two applications there was only 3/4 remaining in the bottle.Its been a week. Now although the red bumps have decreased in number, my legs have tiny hairs all growing right under the skin making it look like I haven&#x27;t shaved. So it pretty much looks like I have some rash on my legs covered with hair. In my ten  years of shaving I never had ingrown hairs. I just hope the hair frees out of the skin so I can happily go back to shaving. Am never using this epilator again!    If anyone knows what to do about these ingrown hairs, please help me out.</li>
    <li> This epilator has a lot of features I like. Its sleek and comfortable to use with a light that shinning on the spot that you&#x27;re removing hair. Also, the epilator has a powerful motor which its more powerful than the one I used before. But I found the cover for the head is very flimsy. It comes off very easily when the epilator is in use. I feel this shouldn&#x27;t happen. therefor, I give the epilator 3 stars.</li>
    <li> i used to have an old braun epilator which i loved. this one is great too, but comparing it to the first one i don&#x27;t find it as durable. it works great and it has useful attachments but i use it often and it feels it gets \\&quot;tired\\&quot; fast. other than that i am pleased with my purchase.   anka</li>
    <li> This product is great.  In the long run cheaper than waxxing and it last very long.  I have built up an ability to use on my stomach, calves, and knees.  Working myself up to thighs, bikini line and underarms.  The good thing is that until I do --- there are various attachments that can be used so you can use as an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Epilator in the past 10 years.  They are very reliable, and a great product.  The one issue I have with this model is that the attachment you place over the blades will scratch your skin as it is pulling the hair.  My skin is very sensitive, so I found this particularly irratating.</li>
    <li> It appears this product works extremely well for SOME hair/skin types.  BUT, if you&#x27;ve never epilated before I strongly urge you to begin with a small test patch first.  Thoroughly epilate one patch of one leg, perhaps just to the outside of the shin bone or wherever the hair grows thick.   Then shave everywhere else.  WAIT several weeks until you get re-growth on the test patch.  I didn&#x27;t think of doing this when I bought the Braun epilator.  I followed the package instructions and other reviewers&#x27; recommendations carefully to epilate both legs completely.  I did not find it at all painful, by the way.  I exfoliated often, and waited.  I encountered two problems.  1st, the machine did not successfully pull all the hair from the root.  Some hairs were broken at or near the surface, so I had a fair bit of &#x27;stubble&#x27; immediately.  I kept epilating until eventually all the hairs were &#x27;pulled&#x27;.  But that wasn&#x27;t the deal breaker.  After a couple of weeks I noticed a strange, mildly unpleasant tingling sensation on my legs.  After a few days of this I noticed that my legs were covered with hair.  The re-growth had come in.  The problem was that most of the hair was growing JUST UNDER a very thin layer of skin.  The hairs were completely visible but impossible to shave OR epilate, protected as they were under that thin layer.  I had to tweeze each hair (and there were many)  out from under the skin.  Once the hair was growing normally again, I decided to give the epilator another try.  I thought the problem might improve over time.  It didn&#x27;t.  After 3 full rounds with the same results,I stopped using the epilator several weeks ago and my legs still haven&#x27;t recovered. I&#x27;m still struggling to get rid of the cycle of ingrowns, and the unsightly red bumps some of them caused.  I think this problem probably occurs only for certain hair/skin types.  I strongly caution all new users to test a small patch to see how the epilator works for your hair/skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman with very coarse leg hair and have never been able to get a smooth shave to last more than a few hours. I&#x27;m pleased to say that this epilator has done something no other device has been able to accomplish! I took the advice of others and shaved first, then I used the epilator. There were some areas around my ankles that I did not shave very well and OUCH! Take my advice and please get the hair as short as possible prior to epilating or it will hurt like hell! What really impresses me is that after four days, my legs are still soft and smooth. With shaving I would have to shave every day to keep the stubble away! I am prone to ingrown hairs, so I don&#x27;t know how the new growth will be, but so far I have not had any problems. My very sensitive skin has not even turned red or hand one bump! I wish I had purchased this eplilator years ago! Bye bye stubble....Hello smooth legs!  P.s. The underarm area is tricky. I attempted to epilate it, but the head kept falling off! I must be doing something wrong :(</li>
    <li> Good product!  I have been use it for 2 years... and no problems!  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> mildly painful, results last longer than shaving, cost effective, user-friendly, well designed, compact, low maintenance, plug-in feature is great no hassling with batteries.  I bought one for my personal use and as a gift for a friend.. and have recommended this to many friends who also enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Epilating is RIDICULOUSLY painful.  While I&#x27;m sure this might be a good product, I used it once with the epilation tip and that was it.  I could barely do a square inch, let alone an entire leg.  Has worked great though with the shaving head.  That&#x27;s about all I&#x27;m gonna be using it for.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;d used epilady products for years and when the last one died, i decided to get this braun.  it is the best ever, much faster and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much and very easy to clean.  i would give it more stars if i could.</li>
    <li> I had long discontinued shaving in favor of epilation so when my last model bit the dust I went online to find another. I chose wisely. This model is painless and effective. I use it once per week, remain silky smooth, works great on all body areas. built in light and optional shaver is also a plus. It also cost $30 less than my previous model! Go for it!</li>
    <li> I had been thinking about buying an epilator for about 10 years but figured it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the cost.  Boy was I wrong. The money I spent on waxing was such a waste!  I have used it on my legs and underarms so far, not sure I&#x27;d use it on my bikini line.  I have been waxing for years so the pain that other reviewers mention didn&#x27;t effect me.  The underarms were sore but the legs were fine.  I highly recommend this product and only wish I had made the investment sooner.</li>
    <li> It scratches my skin, and it is not as fast/powerful as others.  I do not recommend it.  It took me over 1hr to do both legs!!!  When others epilators can do it in 20 or less minutes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for my legs. I have very thick, coarse hair. It&#x27;s not very painful, easy to use and is well worth the little bit of time it takes compared to shaving every other day. I also use it on my upper lip without much pain. But, I can&#x27;t use it in the bikini area or underarms. Not only is it more painful but it produces redness - almost like scratches or a rash - from pulling at the skin or getting the skin caught in it. I have tried using it at different angles, etc, but haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it without leaving marks. (If anyone has any solutions - I&#x27;d love to know)! Even so, I&#x27;m still happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty handy epilator. It is easy to hold, removes hair well, and has a few heads that can be used. It is easy to clean. I&#x27;ve used it many times &amp; have found it a worthwhile buy.</li>
    <li> Well as a guy I needed a way to remove hair, so I got this epilator; who really cares that this is marketed to women, as long as it works!    I mostly needed this to remove my neck hair and a couple other places where I had unwanted hair.    Worked VERY well. Just wish that the tweezers had a stronger grip, because having thick hair on my neck that&#x27;s never been pulled out really hurts to have tugged over and over again until it finally gives.     Was extremely painful and the tipple or quadruple tugs per hair didn&#x27;t help much, but hey it works! and now my neck is hair free. Other areas were less painful and I imagine it to go much easier next time around.    For a cheap product not marketed for men&#x27;s hair it worked great.    The clipper/razor attachment is pretty neat. The clippers work flawlessly for the most part, and the razor gets nice and close but leaves a lot of patching.    Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price, get it!</li>
    <li> This epilator is just amazing. After hours of research, it is the answer to my prayers. My legs have very dense, very coarse blonde hair.  When I shave, it only lasts for a few hours before it is rough and awful to touch. My British boyfriend started politely complaining about it. He said that European women seem to have the problem solved.  So I did some research.  I started with waxing.  After letting my leg hair grow for two weeks, which I found almost unbearably itchy and annoying, I entered the nail salon, paid $35 and asked for a leg wax. Boy, was that painful!  I have a really high tolerance for pain. I had a drug-free natural childbirth and I have been an avid bikini waxer for years. Still, leg waxing brought involuntary tears to my eyes. My two year old daughter was with me and she kept saying, \\&quot;momma ouch.\\&quot; Furthermore, my legs were not even smooth like I had hoped for in exchange for all of that pain.  I decided there had to be a better way and I was determined to find it.  I came across the epilator.  Now, I am not saying it wasn&#x27;t painful.  But it was considerably better than waxing. I looked at several models before I bought the Braun Silk-Epil.  Ultimately, because my hair is blonde, the built in light was key in my decision to buy that model. I have been very happy with my decision.  The light is such an awesome part of the design.  I took a hot shower, drank a glass of wine and then started epilating.  It was fairly painful in areas with dense hair so I broke it down in to little steps and took my time.  I changed areas if one became too sensitive.  My very first use I was able to do both legs and part of my bikini line.  That was three days ago and my legs are still way more smooth than they have ever been.  My legs were slightly red the day after and it stung a bit when I took a shower but it was no worse than waxing. I plan on doing a touch-up in a few days. I seriously never ever want to use a razor again. The epilator is a bit expensive but notwhen you factor in the money that you save from not getting waxes and buying those stupid blades for disposable razors (which are bad for the environment). Three cheers for the Braun Silk Epil X&#x27;elle. There is no way I am letting those European girls have smoother legs than this American girl!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item awhile back because I was tired of shaving and waxing all the time so I research and looked at reviews for good epilators to put my money in since epilators don&#x27;t come cheap. I ended up buying this one and I was planning on it to be painful because it is pulling from the hair but I am disappointed at the results I received from this product. It didn&#x27;t take long before my hair grew back, within a week and I understand that there&#x27;s different cycles that hair grows but this product is not efficient and wastes my time. It works well in the underarms better than my legs but to do my underarms, it takes five minutes each because I have to go over and over the same area for this epilator to pull my unwanted hair. On legs, I take up at least 45 minutes and I&#x27;m a very small girl and even when I go over and over making sure I get every part of my leg, the next day, I would notice a couple of hairs that the epilator did not get. Epilating in my opinion is the most painful thing I have ever done on my body, even getting a tattoo doesn&#x27;t surpass. I bought this product expecting good results and less time spent on removing unwanted hair but it&#x27;s only decent for my underarms and another thing is that it leaves ingrowns on my legs and underarms where I never had before epilating. This is the first epilator that I bought and I&#x27;m not sure if I plan on getting another epilator from another brand because this product let me down.</li>
    <li> its a great product    i used it for the first time y&#x27;day, it was a lil painful yes, but the end result is awesome.   I usually wax and shave too but this is so much more convenient.  I&#x27;ll tell you why  Shaving - hair grows back really fast  usually stand up   is harder   and darker  Waxing- tme consuming/ get an appointment  have to wait for a certain length  expensive - 1 waxing session is one epilator    this - do it at ur convenience, in your privacy  free for sometime after doing it  yes, i did have red patches but with some regular lotion they were gone.  def recommend the product.    The only reason i take one star off is becos of the lousy pouch  i&#x27;ve got better</li>
    <li> Review from the woman in the house that uses it: I&#x27;ve had a few of these silk-epil&#x27;s over the years. What an improvement! Yes it does hurt the first time you use it, but after that it&#x27;s pretty painless and there are no stubs and the hair grows back slowly and thinly. The light feature is an extra bonus. It&#x27;s way better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I had an anniversary coming up, to avoid paying for what most salons refer to as a \\&quot;pseudo-Brazilian\\&quot; or \\&quot;partial Brazilian\\&quot; wax.  It is not suitable for that kind of hair removal.  But, I do still use it regularly.    I use the epilator about twice a week, on my legs, underarms, and the part of the bikini area that actually shows when wearing a bikini.  I do legs with the non-massaging epilator attachment, and underarms and bikini outskirts with the massaging head.  It takes about half an hour.    The epilator attachment cannot be used on the more sensitive areas of the bikini area.  It&#x27;s not a matter of pain--I have a high pain tolerance.  It actually damages the skin, breaking blood vessels and leaving red marks.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t effectively remove hair on such soft skin.  The trimming/shaving attachment is better for this area, but for hairless skin it needs to be followed by a traditional shave with a razor.    The epilator is great for legs and underarms, though.  It&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about whether I&#x27;ve shaved in the past day or two when wearing skirts and sleeveless tops.  Just be sure you exfoliate regularly.  You&#x27;ll get a few ingrown hairs anyway, but not nearly as many as if you neglect to regularly exfoliate the areas you&#x27;ve epilated.</li>
    <li> This works like charm, its good product to buy. Most important its not made in China.  Its a product made in Germany.</li>
    <li> Last time I tried epilating was ten years ago and it was a frightful experience with the EpiLady brand. I remember trying my underarms and the pain was unbearable, then to the legs and it wasn&#x27;t any better.  This year I decided to try again in hopes of some improvement with epilation through the years.  The loud noise of the Braun Epilator is intimidating at first. I turned it on and placed the epilator on the palm of my hand just to get used to the sensation and amount of pressure needed. Then I started with my legs on the low setting. It was the same sensation of plucking your eyebrows. The rollers seem to stimulate your skin to make the sensation of hair plucking less intense.  After doing my legs I had more confidence to go to my underarms. I used a little bit of baby powder to make sure the skin was dry.  Now this was not a comfortable feeling but do-able.  I did little sections at a time going different directions to catch every single hair possible.  I spent about 30 mins. on each underarm taking little breaks to look at my work and telling myself the fear is all in your head.  The underarm sensation is like the first time you pluck your eyebrows but just like your eyebrows the more you epilate the easier it gets.  Since my first experience with Braun, I only epilate once a week to get stray hairs and use the higher setting, maybe like 5-7 under each arm.  My mind is not scaring me anymore with the fear of the noise.  I am even starting to do my bikini line! Oh and I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t need to use underarm deodorant. I&#x27;m only using it when I go out somewhere important just in case it&#x27;s too good to be true but so far I&#x27;ve worked around the house put up a sweat and there is no underarm odor.  I guess since the hair gets pulled out at the root it doesn&#x27;t give any bacteria a chance to grow. hahaha!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t shave because my skin is super sensitive. Because of this, I&#x27;ve been a waxer since 16 (23, now).  I was looking for a product to remove the hair on my legs when they&#x27;re too short to wax, but necessary to remove because of summer time activities. I live in Southern CA- no time to wait for hair to grow to a waxable length! Because of the mess of waxing, gradually over summer I started using this epilator for everything- my legs, arms, back. I can&#x27;t use it on my bikini line because it hurts too badly, but I just use the shaver attachment. I find that I have to epilate once a week. It takes me about an hour to do all of those areas. I dare not use this on my pubic area. Wax is what I swear by for that    Also, my sister has thick hair growth on her face and neck that is so stubborn that sometimes it isn&#x27;t fully removed for her. I told her about this epilator and it works well for her!     This is a great buy! I can&#x27;t compare it to shaving since I&#x27;m basically allergic to rasors, but compared to waxing it&#x27;s definitely less of a mess.     And pain factor? NONE for me. Then again, I&#x27;ve been waxing for 7 years.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went forever without this amazing product. The need for me to shave every other day was getting me down. (Seems like the older I get the hairier I am!) I read all the reviews I could find and was a little apprehensive about hearing that it would hurt the first few times and it is very mildly uncomfortable at first. After that it&#x27;s a breeze-even underarms and bikini area. The shaver option makes it possible to get longer hair to the length it needs to be and then the epilator works well. After using it a couple of times the first week, I was good to go for over two weeks! Silky smooth legs! Incredible![[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews of this item before purchasing this product from Amazon.  After I received it, I was nervous to try it, but I was so disgusted at the electric shavers that I took a deep breath and started working on my legs.  I learned that it&#x27;s not bad if you take short strokes.  It&#x27;s now a week later and no stubble!  I never want to go back to electric shavers or messy blades and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading through lots of reviews on Amazon of this and similar devices.  This is the first epilator I have ever used.  I made the decision to switch after years of razor burn and because the hair on my legs grows so quickly that if I shave in the morning, I often would have stubble before bedtime.      Anyway, the first 2 times I used this it hurt A LOT, but as soon as I was finished I was fine and didnt have to do it again for almost a week.  I also bought some after epilation cream that is supposed to help with soothing and prevention of ingrown hair.  I have yet to decide it that or normal lotion is better.  Then the pain got progressively better each time    I used it for a few weeks then went on vacation and decided to shave normally for a week.  The next time I used the Epilator it was almost as bad as the first time, so needless to say I will continue with the epilator vacation or not.     I have been using it regularly for a couple of months now and love it.  Pain in tolerable and mainly around sensitive areas like ankles, bikini area, and back of knee. My legs are very smooth, I do not have daily stubble, and best of all no painful razor burn.  To prevent ingrown hairs, I have started using pumice stone lightly on legs in the shower every week or so. Sometimes I do find that I have missed spots or that hair grows more rapidly in one spot, so sometimes I just touch up with the epilator more often, but usually just use it every 4-7 days.      Overall, I think the product is great, but have not used other epilators to compare it to.  I would recommend it to anyone with fast hair growth or problems with traditional shaving.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and tried it right away because my old epilator broke.  I still feel a little pain although I have been using them for a long time.  It is not really bad, just a little pain.  What I liked the most was the ease of use on my underarms.  Even though the hair was small, it took all of the hair off.  I also used it lightly on my legs and worked really good.  Keep in mind I was just trying it so I did not do the whole job on my legs.  I will finish tomorrow.  I really like the light because it points to the hair that I would not otherwise seen.  This is also not as noisy as my old epilator so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to like it very much.  It has a great grip and I like the plug because is not too big and I can have something else plugged in the bathroom.  I have not used the shaver yet but I will update this review as time goes by.  I thought the price was reasonable since I had paid about the same amount for my last epilator about 4 years ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this product many years ago.  When I neeeded a new one I went for a different brand that was cheaper.  Didn&#x27;t last as long and didn&#x27;t proform as well.  I&#x27;m back now with this product and will not change again!</li>
    <li> Love this epilator!  I have used epilators for about fifteen years, most of them Epiladys, but this one seems to be even better.  It&#x27;s very helpful that it has a light to target stray hair.  It might be nice if it could be used cordless, but that isn&#x27;t an essential feature for me.  If you don&#x27;t like to shave your legs with a razor every day or two, this is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is faster than other previews Braun products. and the light really helps. I love it.</li>
    <li> I really really wanted to like this product, and thought it would be the answer getting the smooth skin I would like to have...I was wrong.  I am a MALE amateur bodybuilder, and I am fairly hairy which I try to keep under control.. usually with electric clippers and a razor shave.  I saw this product, and after reading all the good reviews, it sounded great, no razor burn, no itchy re-growth, ect...  I am not at all squeamish and I feel that I have a high tolerance for pain, but this device was epic in the amount of pain it causes.  I literally almost vomited at one point from the pain, no I am not kidding, I also felt at one point that I might pass out. I am sure this device works very well on a womans fine and sparse body hair, but for guys with thick dense body hair like me, forget it. No amount of gritting your teeth will help.  I want to stress that I am NOT exaggerating here, it hurts worse than any pain I have ever felt.  I managed to do one full thigh and half of my abdomen before having to give up out of shear horrific agony.  Now my skin feels rough and very sore like a bruise and a bad sunburn mixed together, it hurts to the touch.  Awful.</li>
    <li> I never epilated before. I shaved, plucked and recently tried home waxing.  Waxing caused a bad outbreak and it was very painful.  So, I decided to check out the Braun epilator and all I can say is, \\&quot;Where have you been all my life????!!!!\\&quot;  Did it hurt?  Not if the hair was very short and I can&#x27;t believe how it still removes super short hair!  The trick is to do it on clean, dry skin.  Also, do it in a circular motion since most hair (at least mine) grows in differently.  Don&#x27;t use it on the face (trust me, I tried and ended up buying a smaller one meant for more sensitive areas).  Also, make sure your bikini area is very short and that you have no moisturizer or deodorant on when you do the underarm.  Seriously, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much... waxing is a killer but epilating is just tweezing (and I&#x27;ve been tweezing all of my life so no biggee)!  Sensitive areas are a bit more sensitive; legs are easy (just like shaving).  I can&#x27;t recommend this epilator enough.  But one thing, Braun, WHERE IS THE BRUSH TO CLEAN IT WITH?????  Even my little epilator came with one!!!!  For the price, Braun should have included the brush!!!!</li>
    <li> this is the first Brown I got &amp; have been using Epilators for 9 years... when the plastic frames is on the roller, there is a cavity between the roller &amp; the frame that once in a while is dragging my skin in and causing the machine to stop &amp; my skin to be red and sometimes bleeding a little! when I use the machine without plastic farms, it leaves light visible scratches on my skin as it moves.</li>
    <li> Good product... But if you expect tooo much you will be disappointed.. It DOES NOT work as fast or effective as wax BECAUSE it is an epilator. Expect less and you will be very satisfied with this product..   Noisy but not as other reviewers have exaggerated it  Does leave stubble, so you do need to give more time to get perfect results  it has universal voltage that is a BIG + for foreign travelers  Lovely color, blue  Timely delivery by amazon  a bit pricey $$$ but worth it  Nice trimmer    I am a satisfied customer hope you enjoy it too ...   thanks</li>
    <li> Great product!Love it! This is my second machine.I used the first one for about 3 years.The only thing is it was difficult to buy its epilator head once it needs replacement. The older machine still works but left with no option got the second one.</li>
    <li> I have used the epilator a few times now and the overall impression is very positive. I do not regret my purchase at all. If you are fed up with waxing, then this epilator is a very nice alternative. This epilator is better than my previous one (which was a good one, although I forgot which one it was). Are listed below my pros and cons. The pros definitively beat the cons.     Pros:   - It is fast (sooooo much faster and more convenient than wax). It is fast because it removes almost everything from the first run, you don&#x27;t need to go through the same spot ten times.   - It is efficient: it removes even small hair.  - it is not particularly painful compared to other epilators. Note that if you have never used an epilator before, then it will hurt (not the device&#x27;s fault, though).  - The little bag that comes with the epilator is handy.    Cons:  - A little expensive (still much cheaper than wax)  - I got maybe slightly more ingrowns than with my previous epilator. Nothing dramatic (5 or 6 per leg). But because of it, I did not give the epilator 5 stars.  - It is a little noisy.    Neutral:  - I found the light useless.</li>
    <li> I have a high pain tolerance but this epilator is far from painless.  Very time consuming to use!  Use disposables it&#x27;s much faster &amp; easier.</li>
    <li> Works great!  The first time using is the hardest since reading the reviews about the pain involved.  I would suggest using the highest setting all the time since that causes the least amount of discomfort.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I am very satisfied with it. Pain was my biggest concern but I was pleasantly surprised the it was not as painful as I had anticipated it to be(owing to the high speed of the rollers). The performance is very good and the light is definitely helpful.</li>
    <li> I recommend this epilator. it hurts but the effect is outstanding. legs are smooth with no hair for 2 weeks. it leaves no scars or redness. those side rolls are very helpful. the pain is then not that bad. the light is very helpful too. u can see hair better. i don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with how well this thing works! I did feel some stubbliness after the first run, but I didn&#x27;t follow directions and SLOWLY glide the epilator up my leg. I went kind of quickly. Plus my skin is on the dry side, and I did not exfoliate my legs first. After the second run a week later, and after exfoliating in the shower first, my skin is much smoother, much less stubbly. I am so happy. Brazilian bikini wax is a thing of the past for anyone who has this little tool! Some discomfort on first go round, and I learned I have to keep skin pulled flat to allow this to work well. Now the \\&quot;hair-pulling\\&quot; is very easy and painless. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I purchased an epilator from a popular shopping network which hurt, did not work well and stopped working within a few short months.  After reading reviews for the Braun 5270 I purchased it and am very glad I did.  It works really well and is virtually painless.  A great product!  My legs are as smooth as a close shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best product in the world.     Looks like a torture device? Yes.     Feels like one the first time you use it? Absolutely.     Continues to feel like one forever? NO WAY.     I&#x27;ve been using this now for a couple of months and do not even FEEL it on my legs. I have to remind myself that it actually DID hurt the first time I used it. My legs are SO smooth. They stay smooth for so much longer, and the hairs are teeny and soft now. Also, I have fewer hairs growing back. My husband told me yesterday morning that my legs were \\&quot;SO smooth!\\&quot; (and he rarely comments on such things either way). The funny thing was that the hairs that WERE there had been allowed to grow out to 1/4 inch!     I have the kind of hair that is SO DARK and THICK that even when my legs were freshly shaved and perfectly smooth you could see the dark little hairs through the skin. No longer! They are GONE!    Follow the other reviewer&#x27;s instructions pertaining to how to start epilating and you&#x27;ll be golden.     Also, it is possible to do you bikini area. Pop some Ibuprofen, give it an hour to settle in, and use Gigi&#x27;s Numbing Spray (Amazon or Sally&#x27;s) and give THAT a good three-five minutes to settle in. It will still hurt a lot, but be bearable. And it&#x27;s WORTH IT! Best bikini line hair removal out of all the products I&#x27;ve tried (wax, shave, Nair, Magic Powder). LONG lasting. Same goes for my underarms (you could REALLY still see the hairs even on smooth skin there before the Epilator), but less painful than bikini lines.    Yes, you will get ingrown hairs. As long as you use a strong exfoliating sponge (I found a great super-rough cloth one at Wal-Mart for cheap) you&#x27;ll be fine. If you still have trouble do what I do and use an Acne Cleanser on the exfoliating scrubber. The medicine in the Acne Cleanser helps to remove dead skin cells. Keep your skin well moisturized too. Dry skin &#x3D; dead skin which &#x3D; ingrown hairs.    Cost an issue? Just imagine how much you spend on razors, shaving cream,depilatory cream, waxing... and then think of spending sixty something dollars once and never having to buy that stuff again. This is the best model I&#x27;ve ever used. No need to spend more money.    I recommended this product on my blog and got two of my friends using it regularly, and they got two of THEIR friends using it regularly. Stick with it and you will NEVER be sorry.</li>
    <li> I am a veteran user of epilators (over 15 years) and have a high pain threshold, or so I thought. I had 5 different epilators and this is one is the worst. This product is a torture device. It works okay on legs, but when I tried it on armpits and bikini area, I ended up with ugly and very painful scars. The only nice feature that earned the 2nd star is the small light that illuminates the area being worked.</li>
    <li> This epliator is fantastic - pulls even the shortest hairs.   I have used epilators for years - on my legs are armpits, I find it too painful for my bikini line. I have read so many reviews stating that it is too painful on the sensitive armpit area, so I have a tip to share! Put talcum powder on your clean armpits before epilating - it stops the rotating part pulling on your skin, massively reducing pain (though not completely, it is ripping hairs out!).</li>
    <li> I fell in love with my epilator and have used it a LOT since I got it 2 years ago. It gives great results and features such as the light and cleaning tools that come with it. However, one day recently, it just kind of stopped working at the same level. Now, even though it is plugged in, it barely works and is just going slow motion. I took very good care of it so this is too bad. However, it has been almost 2 years, so I think it still a great product. I will probably purchase another Braun epilator in an upgraded model (hopefully wireless this time!) unless i can figure out if I can get a repair or replacement somehow from Braun.</li>
    <li> This epilator is great because it is also a shaver and a trimmer. Besides the light helps me to see if there is any hair left. The only problem is that it hurts too much to use it on the armpits, but for the legs and bikini line is fine.</li>
    <li> i ordered that 1 month ago..something went wrong with the shipment and they refun me teling me to purchase the item again and that they would have refund me the shipment fee.so i did and this time they charged me twice, like if i bought the item twice..once again i never recived anything and  isended email to the customer service asking fr a refound but nobod replyed ...and now the ask me for a review????</li>
    <li> Based on opinions from others, I purchased this Braun Silk epilator 5270. The pain is tolerable but the problem is, is like when I tried getting waxed, my hair breaks instead of being pulled out. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the fault of the product but I won&#x27;t be using it anymore. If my hair didn&#x27;t break, I think it would be a fine product.</li>
    <li> I used to be a regular shaver, but had waxed a few times before, and clearly liked the benefits of waxing but I just can&#x27;t afford the price tag.    I bought this epilator after looking for tons of products and reviews online.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, when I first tried it, it hurt.  It really hurt.  But after very few uses, it got a lot better.  Now I do my entire legs, bikini line, and armpits in about 30 minutes, without a need for breaks in between.  Here&#x27;s what I found out that helped a lot:    1) For the first time, shave your legs first (or wax, if that&#x27;s what you do).  This will result in a lot fewer hairs, and will let you get used to the pain without actually hurting too much.  In the beginning, I used the epilator every three days or so, so there never were too many hairs at one time to be epilated. This was the only time I shaved since getting the epilator.  It just made things more bearable, and now I can deal with the number of hairs that grow, since your hairs just never grow all at once.    2) For your underarms, it&#x27;ll really hurt if you just try with all the hairs grown.  What I did was let the hair grow for a bit, a few days, then I actually tweezed them!  Yes, I spent quite a bit of time on that.  But then, the few hairs that I had left were much more bearable to epilate,and now I do my underarms really, really fast, and almost pain free, since there are never too many hairs at once.    3) I do my bikini line the same way I do my legs, but I haven&#x27;t got up to doing a Brazilian yet. A normal bikini line is a no brainer though.    4) It&#x27;s really important to pull the skin that is being epilated, that helps with the pain a lot.       And, just so you can actually believe me, I am a very hairy, latina woman.  I have black, thick hair EVERYWHERE.  This is a lifesaver.  It will hurt at first, but I promise that if you stick to it, it&#x27;ll keep getting better and better.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this epilator and she said i should try it. okay, i admit i was terrified. I had only shaved for years, never waxed in my life because i don&#x27;t know if i could tolerate the pain. But, i was tired of shaving my underarms and legs every other day and thought i needed to suck it up and go for it. I&#x27;m not going to lie, this this is so painful, i did my underarms and legs. After i did my legs, i got all red dots from where the hairs were removed, ( it looked like a rash), but eventually it all went away and i was left with smooth legs and underarms. I would recommend doing this in the evening when you don&#x27;t plan on going out or on a day that you know you will be wearing pants the next day or so.     I love it for the underarms because it last so much longer and grows less and less. it hurts soooo much, but it is completely worth it at least for the underarms alone and saving time and money on razors, shaving cream, and the cuts that come along with it. It hurts less and less as you do it more, and i&#x27;m so glad that i bought it and used it. i haven&#x27;t gotten the courage to try bikini area, but I think i will eventually get there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine now for about 3 weeks.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the hairs and, so far, I&#x27;m still having to use it every day, so right now I don&#x27;t see that it is any better than shaving and it certainly takes a lot longer because you have to go over and over the area.  It may be OK if you have really straight hair, but if there is any variation in the way your hair grows, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.  I&#x27;m also having a problem with ingrown hairs, even with exfoliating.</li>
    <li> This product was my first experience using an epilator.  And it did hurt. I don&#x27;t even pluck my eyebrows, but I could handle this.  I did drink a glass of wine a few minutes before I started, just to deaden some of the pain.  I also kept my mind off of what I was doing to myself by watching a dvd.  As far as bumps, I had a little redness for a while, but I started at night (as directed) and by the next morning, they were gone.  This is an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing..I wish I would have bought it long ago!!  It only hurt the first time or so, and now it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I guess everyone&#x27;s pain tolerance is different.  I use it on my legs, bikini area, and underarms.  When the hair grows back it is so fine..not like the old razor stubble you get from shaving.  I&#x27;ve recommended this epilator to everyone in my family.</li>
    <li> Not really. It is a very good product for me. This is my first epilator, and I&#x27;ve never waxed before. Again, I said \\&quot;for me.\\&quot; I did get some red bumps, but not a lot. It was painful at first, but I attacked by only doing patches every few seconds. I did try the armpit. That was more painful, but again, I stopped for a day and started again. As for ingrown hair, exfoilate and I&#x27;ve already had ingrown hair, so it didn&#x27;t matter much to me. When I first started it, which was about a week ago, I thought the worst of the pain, which helped.  The trimmer and the shaver are only ok. Haven&#x27;t thoroughly used the shaver, but both don&#x27;t cut very close. Massage cap really does work by putting more distance from the skin, so less pain with the tweezers. Some places are harder to get the hairs like bumpy knees.  Tips:  *start with short and quick patches  *if too painful, try again the next day, and the next  *When you first start, think the worst of it  *shower before  *exfoilate</li>
    <li> I had used a Braun epilator for many years but had to buy a new epilator when I moved to a different country.  I thought I would try something different so I bought an Epilady - this was a big mistake.  It was so bad that I went straight out and bought this Braun one and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It is fantastic, just like my old one.  For some reason, the Epilady actually hurt, whereas this one doesn&#x27;t, just like my old one didn&#x27;t.  The basic Braun model ([[ASIN:B00006592X Braun Soft Perfection SE3170 Epilator, Pink]]) would also be as good if you didn&#x27;t want all the extra fittings this one comes with.  The light is good but I still prefer to use it in natural light anyway.  Highly recommended.  It is not clear from the product instructions if it will work in 240V countries.  If not, I&#x27;ll simply go back to my old one.</li>
    <li> Ok, it does pain a lot but only for the first time. Beacuse there is too much hair at the first time it will hurt a lot. But if you survive the first you will love it. Now once a week watching TV I use it and done, perfect without pain. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> works pretty well except won&#x27;t get fine hairs on legs, still causes ingrown hairs and red bumps</li>
    <li> Starting in 6th grade I got teased for having very thick, dark hair on my arms and legs and have been self conscious about it ever since and I am now in my mid-40&#x27;s.  For years I bleached the hair on my arms and two years ago I \\&quot;splurged\\&quot; on laser hair removal as I was standing up in a wedding.  This epilator does as good of a job as the laser treatments and is MUCH less expensive. I am so sold on this product!!  The first time you use it I would recommend using the shaving head that comes with it to get hair to the appropriate length.  Yes, it&#x27;s going to hurt (it&#x27;s pulling your hair out by the root for heaven&#x27;s sake, what do you expect?), but it is so worth it.  I would also recommend applying some aloe after the first few uses to cool the skin.  I have a pretty low tolerance for pain and didn&#x27;t find it that unbearable especially after a few uses.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and am having to use it less and less frequently because the hair isn&#x27;t growing back and when it does it is much finer and lighter.  The light is very helpful but if you can do it in the daylight or under flourescent lighting, that will help as well.  You will be shocked to see how many hair follicles you really have -- I never knew there were so many on your kneecap!  There is no way shaving can do justice to removing hair decently (or semi-permanently like the epilator does).  Your skin will also feel amazingly soft as also gets rid of dead, dry skin cells as you&#x27;re using it.  I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try the underarm area and would be VERY hesitant to try it on facial hair.  I have had a few ingrown hairs but knew to watch for them so was able to take care of them right away before they got too bad.  I don&#x27;t find the noise obnoxious -- when I used it the first time my family asked what I was doing and I just said \\&quot;shaving my legs\\&quot;.  They are used to hearing my husband&#x27;s electric shaver and this is only slightly louder than that -- not a big deal.  I only wish I would havefound this product years ago; would&#x27;ve saved a lot of aggravation, knicks and cuts and razor burn.  Love this product and HIGHLY recommend it!  Ladies, do yourself a favor and get this -- you deserve it!!</li>
    <li> It does what is made for. I&#x27;m a first time user of any kind of epilator and i have to say that Braun 5270 does e great job. It does hurt, but from what i know, the pain goes away after few uses.</li>
    <li> I love epilators and I can&#x27;t stand shaving. Braun is very good. My previous epilator is Braun and I have been using it more than 7 years. This one  does great job and I love it as well as the old one. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it. Once you get used to epilating you won&#x27;t look at the shaver again.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after years of shaving and several months of waxing. I absolutely think this is the way to go, never have razor burn, or sticky wax residue! The first few times you use it, it will hurt about the same as waxing but w/a bonus if it hurts to bad you can stop, unlike w/waxing which if you stop your going to regret it! Also you will save a lot of money in razors, wax and strips cause you won&#x27;t have to spend money on them again! Just like when I made the switch from pc to mac... I&#x27;ll never go back!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I had an earlier version which was good, but this is even better. Initially I thought the light function was over the top, but actually it&#x27;s useful to see short/fine hairs. It&#x27;s pretty efficient, and hurts no more than any other epilator I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator purely based on the reviews here.   It works really well, it&#x27;s fast and clean. It&#x27;s easy to take apart and clean it afterward.   The LED light feature did not really help me since I shaved with lights on.  HOWEVER, it definitely hurts! I got few bleeding spots each time I used it. If it is not this painful, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> No my wife is shaving her unwanted hair, specially on sensitive aria with no pain</li>
    <li> I got this because I was tired of paying all of that money for razor blades.  So, my mom and I did a little research and chose this product.  It hurt a little at first, but after a little time, it was no big deal.  However, this cut my hair instead of pulling it out.  I ended up with stubble all over the place and had to shave anyway.  I also had a horrible time using this on my knees as it literally ate up and cut the skin on them.  After using it for 4 months, I gave it to my mom and told her she was more than welcome to use it.  And of course she does, with perfect results.  (PARENTS!!!)  So, I guess it really depends what you &#x27;hair type&#x27; is.  Mine grows back fast and is really thick.  My moms grows back slower and is really fine.  But for me, this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Rather than write a book here...  click \\&quot;see all my reviews\\&quot; to get my reivew on the 20 tweezer model of Braun epilator.  Everything there...  applies here, except this one has 40 tweezers.    Then...  First of all, order this from Drugstore dot com, where the price is less.    Second of all...  the accessories that supposedly come with this, don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know why, this is not the first place I have seen the accessories wrong, Drugstore has it wrong, too.  You will get the epilator with the massaging head...  the EfficiencyPro clip (which I think is useless)...  and a shaver head with the attachment to cut your hair to the best length for epilation (which I haven&#x27;t used yet, so can&#x27;t comment on...)  You won&#x27;t get the cooling glove or the gentle start head.    Now...  assuming you were a good girl (or boy) and followed my directions to go to my review on the other epilator...  here is a continuation of that.  Pretty short and sweet.    This thing works GREAT, for pulling hair.  It does in fact have twice the tweezers of the other Brauns so yes, it does work faster, and IMO does a more thorough job.    The casing is a pretty sparkly blue which, while irrelevant to the performance of the product, is quite pleasing to the eye.    But that&#x27;s about all I can say that is good.    The tweezers, rather than being two metal thingies that clamp together (as with the 20 tweezer silk epil), are actually just one metal hicky that clamps against the plastic of the epilator head.  It works fine, but I have to wonder about the long term reliability of such a design and wonder why Braun would make it like this.    Then, the epilator head is designed so that, if you don&#x27;t have the massaging head on it (an attachment I find useless and cumbersome) the gears of the head are exposed, which is,of course, an aesthetic matter, but makes the quality of this product seem less than that of the other silk epils.    The light, which seems like a good idea, is really just kind of...  blinding.It does illuminate the area being epilated, but it does so at the cost of seeing anything else clearly.  It has that effect where, you know, if you look at just a little bit of a picture, you can&#x27;t figure out what the whole picture is?  It would be easier to see all your legs in good light than try to see a small portion at a time in great light.  Plus if you are moving the epilator in such a fashion that the light is on the other side...  IE you are doing the back of your left calve, from the inside, sitting on the floor and moving the epilator sort of down and around to the back...  you really can&#x27;t figure out what you are looking at.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but the light makes things harder to figure out, not easier - and there is no way to disable the light.    I have actually taken the 40 tweezer head and use it on my other silk epil, because I really don&#x27;t like the light.  I use it in the broadest diaylight I can, finding early morning light as the sun comes in our patio door to be especially helpful/horrifying (you are always hairier than you think you are).  I think if I had to use the light, if I didn&#x27;t have the option to use the lightless unit, I would be a lot more unhappy with this product.    Anyway it&#x27;s great in ways but...  I am left somehow thinking \\&quot;Wow, Braun had a great idea here!\\&quot; and \\&quot;What the $@%! was Braun thinking here??\\&quot; which is kind of odd.  They should really just take the 20 tweezer unit and make it have 40 double-metal-thingied tweezers, don&#x27;t change anything else.      OK, the blue sparklies are nice.    This is actually sort of a Eurpopean product - if you go to Braun&#x27;s website, they only have the X&#x27;Elle on the European site.  I wonder if this model of the X&#x27;Elle (there are several other models with various attachments) is a US - only model and is of lesser quality than the others.  No way to know for sure but I find it odd that this is the only one for sale in the US (at this time) and the quality is so not in keeping with the other Silk Epils.    I am really not sure of giving this 3 or 4 stars...  so I will err on the side of generous here.  It&#x27;s not a bad product, but bear in mind its flaws.</li>
    <li> I started waxing a long time ago.  After some time, when my hair growth was so much less, I switched to an epilator.  At first I used the Epilady, which I liked.  But recently I got a new Epilady, which was horrible.  I decided to take a chance on the Braun, and I am thrilled with it.  It&#x27;s very fast and does a fabulous job.  I don&#x27;t find it painful to use; another reviewer indicated she had significant pain with it, but this was difinitely not my experience.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a year its a better time for a review.    First, let me say how GD painful this thing is.  I have a large tattoo on my ribs and this thing is painful. I get painkillers from my doctor to use it.   Secondly, it does remove the dark hairs efficiently but the little blonder ones will break off and turn into ingrown hairs which I can squeeze like a pimple to which a hair half an inch long will come out.  I wear pants to work made of a synthetic materials so that doesn&#x27;t help.  It seems that before I get through both of my legs, that it doesnt work as well; grabbing less hairs when I go over them. That also leads to broken hairs causing them to be ingrown. Maybe its that it hurts soo bad I try to hurry.  This machine is literally pulling your hairs out one by one.  It does great for bikini line but it can cause you to bleed as those hairs are coarser.  OH. and it will snag skin there so be careful.  The good thing was once those dark hairs are pulled they do take longer to come back and the little ones left behind weren&#x27;t noticeable to the touch.  Do NOt shave in between.  Use a cream specifically for this to make the hairs grow back finer and slower.  Emjoi makes a good one.    The goal is for your hair to be less thick eventually or stop coming in all together.  I touched it to my boyfriends  arm so he could appreciate what it takes for soft legs every night and he screamed like a little girl.</li>
    <li> I owned an older version for a few years, was happy with it, and didn&#x27;t really think the improvements to this new one could be major. I bought it only because it was time to replace the other. I love everyhting about it, but mainly the much higher speed (takes me about 25-30 min to do both legs) and the light (which makes life easier for my eyes). The design and travel bags are also very nice. I highly recommend the product for anyone who needs time efficiency &amp; flexibility and does not have an unusually high pain threshold (if you ever waxed, you can certainely be friends with this one). Cheers</li>
    <li> This model is painful even compared to Philips epilators and Brown used to be better.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of this product, which I used for years, but the new one blows the old one away! Less pain, the light gives better visibility to the area I&#x27;m epilating, and it pulls even the tiniest hairs out. I did remove the outer piece which acts as a comfort guard, but I only recommend doing so if you have very short hairs or if you&#x27;ve used epilators for a long time. It&#x27;s so easy to use that I just leave the X&#x27;elle plugged in all the time and when needed,  I just whisk off the small hairs that have started to grow back.  I&#x27;ve found that if I use a good exfoliating soap in the shower, I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs or bumps, which are very common when epilating. With my old epilator, I always had nasty bumps that would leave marks. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this product!</li>
    <li> i have been using epilators for quite a few years and this is very different than any i have ever used. it really is alot gentler than what i have used. the best part of all is the light. i have found myself in some very uncomfortable positions trying not to miss any hairs anywhere and this simple switch for instant light lets me see every hair in the darkest room. i recommend this epilator for everyone who has ever used a depillatory and whomever is contemplating using one.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product at first, but once I used it, I loved it. It does hurt a little when you first use it, but after that it&#x27;s painless. I like the two speed settings and the light.</li>
    <li> Recently I had a foot injury and I knew that for many months to come I would not be able to do my own waxing as I could not stand nor twist my body around. So I bought myself this epilator after reading many reviews about this product and many similar ones.  I have to say that I did not have high hopes that it would work for me. I have a lot of dark and strong hair even after more than 30 years of waxing.   The first time I used my new epilator, the hair on my legs were quite long ( almost 8 weeks worth !)and I did not shave them to a shorter length. It was a bit uncomfortable, but certainly not what I would call \\&quot;painful\\&quot;. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised when my skin felt smooth afterward and stayed that way. After a week or so I did some touch-ups over parts that I had probably missed the first time.   Now after a period of 3 weeks, I had to epilate again. Not all hair had grown. There was definitely no pain or discomfort at all, The skin remains soft as soft as when I wax. I have used the epilator only on the legs as I&#x27;m hesitant to use it for facial hair.  As a first time user, I would definitely recommend it. It convenient and practical. Will I go back to waxing? At the moment I would say no. I will continue waxing the underarms though, as hair seem ingrown there.  The reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5, is the fact that in certain areas you have to go over the hair several times from different directions. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out if maybe I&#x27;m not holding it at the right angle, hence this problem. Last but not least, for the legs, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best epilator I have ever tried. Although it is not rechargeable (you have to stay plugged in) it works like a dream, missing very few hairs on the first pass and getting them on the second.    Ladies, I will not lie. The first couple of times you use this it is rather unpleasant. However, after the third time, it becomes much less painful, more like running a boar-bristle hairbrush over your skin. The results are so worth the initial pain. If you are like me and have dark hair, even with shaving you can still see dark spots, especially on the ankles (the most painful area, by the way). This, though, takes care of that and leaves your skin soft, smooth, and hair-free.    I would recommend 4 things: do not use this the day you need to be hair-free - do it two days before. Then the day before, use it again to catch any remaining hairs; the first couple of times you use this, take a couple of Advil or something a half hour before you use it - this will help take the edge off; and remain calm - don&#x27;t tense up because that will make it hurt worse; and lastly, I find it better to start at the knee and work my way down - the rollers soothe the skin and it makes it less unpleasant than starting at the ankle and working your way up.    Since hair grows in cycles, you will need to use this every couple of days for a couple of weeks to get all the hair. After that, though, you will just need to use it when necessary, which then makes the hair finer, and thus less painful.    Overall, this is great - cheaper overall than waxing, lasts longer and gets skin smoother than shaving, and doesn&#x27;t leave chemical burns like creams can. You are tough, ladies, and this is worth some discomfort if you want smooth legs.</li>
    <li> I quite like this product. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and I think the investment was worth it. The first time you use it it is a bit painful, but after it is a breeze. I actually don&#x27;t allow the hair to grow too long, as they start to show I use the epilator again and it is almost pain free. It is so convenient, the little light is a must because it allows you too see the very tiny hairs even in the back of the legs, so I would highly recommend the epilator that comes with light. Pain wise I think that for women with medium to fine hair this is a great option, but if you have really thick hair I heard that this can be very painful. Hair grows after about 10 days, but that changes depending on the person. Overall I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for a few months and I can&#x27;t say it is anything special. I only use it for my legs, and the hair grows back in 2 to 3 days, not 2 to 3 weeks. Prior to this, I used an Epilady coil epilator for several years (it finally wore out) and it did a better job, with about 2 weeks between uses. Maybe the Braun breaks most of the hairs instead of getting it down to the root. I don&#x27;t know, but for my dark hair the Braun doen&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> When I first got the epilator I was very scared to use it. I tried it out and for the very first use it felt like I was being zap by electricity. I then took out the razor attachment that comes with this epilator, shaved my legs and tried again. Once the hair on my legs was relatively short there was very minimal pain. I epilate now evert 2-3 weeks with little pain. I find this product to be one of the best investments that I have made. I have not yet tried it any where else on my body but I also don&#x27;t mind shaving other areas that are more tender everyday (especially my arm pits). I would recommend this product to a friend and I think if you are tired of shaving every other day like I was, then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best way of getting rid of all that unwanted hair. I&#x27;ve been using a similar product on my whole body for about 7 years and I&#x27;m almost hair free, I don&#x27;t have to do it as offten as I used to anymore and it&#x27;s almost pain free, you just have to get used to it, and it doesn&#x27;t take that long...  &lt;br /&gt;Braun Silk-epil elle it&#x27;s a great product, I love the little built in light.  &lt;br /&gt;You can use it in any body area you want and since it has two speeds, it&#x27;s great to use on the face (in the slower setting)...  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I totally recomend it...</li>
    <li> Not very good, but good enough! fast delivery and in great condition! &lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl friend.She has been using it for over a month now.It&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> The last time I owned an Epilator was in the late 80&#x27;s.  It was one of those coiled spring deals that would catch your hair and pull, but not yank out the hair.  I reverted back to waxing for years!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I find this epilator to be virtually pain free.  It feels the same to me as shaving does-you feel it THERE but I dont really feel anything going on.  Now I think its from years and years of waxing-having hair ripped out on my legs doesnt bother me one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, and so far I have only needed to use it no more than 1-2times a week.  I have stayed primarily hair free.  I have only used it on my legs-so for leg epilating...its great!  Seems to grab every hair, and do its job quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so I dont have to worry about a waxing appointment-and when I did shave I usually missed a hair or 2.  I love this product, I think its absolutely fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for solutions for my excessive hair issues for quite a while now. Shaving, waxing, bleaching, tweezing. It&#x27;s just getting old.     Waxing has been my favorite, and I totally don&#x27;t mind the pain...it hardly even gets to me. But waxing does get pricey, and that does get to me. So I when I heard about epilators, I thought it would be awesome to get one! Solve my all my hairy situations.    Well, I just bought one the other day from Amazon and used it for the first time. Owie, owie, owie! I think of myself who can just take pain pretty easily, a pretty tough chick, but HOLY CRAP, my eyes were watering while I used it on my calf...and yes that&#x27;s singular. After epilating one, I couldn&#x27;t manage to do the other. Half a leg was enough pain for the day. So I just ended up shaving the other, with the epilator, go figure. Which is awesome though! It also has a shaving feature. So that&#x27;s good if you can&#x27;t handle the pain of the epilator - just swich heads to the shaving one! Pretty sweet.     But despite the cruel, cruel pain I was in doing to my leg, it works SOOOOOOOO well!!! If you&#x27;re looking for something to just take the hair away, this does it for you!     And I am planning on using it in the future, but next time I will definitely better prepare myself! Maybe some numbing lotion and Tylenol and hey, we&#x27;re all good!     5 stars for product&#x27;s ability, but for my excessive pain, I&#x27;m taking one star away.</li>
    <li> The first session hurt! A couple times later, I really can&#x27;t feel it!!! Every women should have one!!!</li>
    <li> Yay.. I pretend I&#x27;m shaving and I have none of those even little fuzzy things on my face or neck.  UNTIL  they grow back ... and usually they don&#x27;t.  cool machine  Hurts but that is why God invented gin and red wine.</li>
    <li> Yay!! this really works!&lt;br /&gt;yes it does hurt when you first start, but not that bad, and after you use it a few times it hardly hurts at all, in fact I dont find it painful at all. I use it all over (not bikini area) and it keeps me smooth and hair free for at least 10 days. I got bumps the first time I used it, reccomend a wet cool cloth over the pulled area for a few mins, but after a few times I dont get the bumps any more. TRY it!!</li>
    <li> I recommend doing your underarms first...(make sure you&#x27;re sitting on the floor when you do this)...when you regain consciousness and go after the hair on your legs, the pain won&#x27;t seem NEARLY as bad!! My armpits were swollen for two days! OUCH!     Seriously, the jury is still out as to whether I&#x27;m going to keep on doing my underarm areas with this thing as I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever get used to the blinding pain. Not even with a glass of wine on board! But my legs are doing okay. Yes, the first time was a real ordeal, but subsequent maintenance (once a week) has been very quick and relatively painless.    Overall, I don&#x27;t think my legs are quite as smooth as they were with shaving...but, then again, I don&#x27;t have stubble two days later, either so the pro outweighs the con. I suspect that some of my finer leg hairs are actually being broken off as opposed to pulled out as mentioned by an earlier reviewer. This is probably why my legs aren&#x27;t quite as smooth as I wish. I do get bumps from ingrown hairs now and have to regularly exfoliate with a BufPuf sponge, but still, not a bad product.    UPDATE - 8 June 2008 - I&#x27;ve been using this torture device for nearly a year now.  I never did gather the courage to attempt to tackle my underarms again, but I did continue doing my legs on a regular basis.  I was always plagued with ingrown hair bumps, especially around my ankles and knees and could never completely eliminate the problem even with exfoliation and regular sluffing with a BufPuf sponge.  Also, I always had kind of a rough, stubbly feeling the entire length of my legs and I&#x27;m positive it was because my hairs were being broken off at skin level as opposed to being pulled out.      So . . . I began to ask myself why on earth I was putting up with the pain of having my leg hairs pulled when I wasn&#x27;t gaining the benefit of smooth, silky skin.  I quit using the Silk-epil about six weeks ago and have resumed my regular shower dates with my razor.  My ingrown hair bumps havedisappeared and my legs couldn&#x27;t be smoother and silkier.  I use the Gillette Venus razor two to three times a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Oh . . . the Silk-epil?  I sold it on an online auction site!</li>
    <li> I bought this after the tweezer head on my Emjoi started \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; my skin after a couple of years.      I have used an epilator for a few years, but stopped for about a year after my Emjoi went out.    So, keep in mind I used the Braun after just shaving for a year.  It worked great on my arms, but I used this to do a \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; wax too and it was horrible for the bikini area.  I tried leaving the hair longer, I tried trimming it a bit, and the darn thing would just grab hair, pull it enough to be painful and then either break the hair off or leave it there.      I breezed through my arms in about five minutes if that.  The \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; wax if you will, took, no joke, four hours, and the area still felt stubbly!    I&#x27;m either going to buy a replacement head for my Emjoi and just know I need to replace this part every couple of years, or upgrade to the latest Emjoi.    I am going to use this unit on my arms, arm pits, and legs.  It&#x27;s tweezers are half metal and half plastic while the Emjoi&#x27;s are metal, so I don&#x27;t think this unit has the pulling power to &#x27;pull&#x27; out strong willed hairs.</li>
    <li> The light is great and the power/strength is fine, but the placement of the two rollers is a problem and will not effectively epilate in some places (forced to go at certain angles sometimes to fit) --- only an almost direct/flat application on the face of the rollers will work.  Trying to use an edge or one side will not work.  Also, the interchangeable cover would not stay in place after a few months and I just ended up using it open top with the rollers fully exposed.  Recommend the 1) Emjoi Optima or 2) Emjoi Emagine instead.</li>
    <li> Way back in the dark ages otherwise known as the 1980&#x27;s, I tried the original epi-lady (not sure what it was called exactly) and found it to be a horrid device that was surely created for nothing more than torture.  After 20 seconds, I gave up and vowed \\&quot;never again!\\&quot;.  Luckily, I changed my mind and decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The X&#x27;elle really does work and the feeling is tolerable, if not exactly comfortable.  In fact, in some areas it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and the only sensation is that of a pulling.  I know, that doesn&#x27;t sound good but I find it quite satisfying because it lets me know that the thing is working. And as others have said, it does get easier to tolerate the more you do it.  The first time was definatly the most difficult.  Of course, after you do it a time or two, the amount of hair that you have that needs to be removed is actually less and therefore, the process takes far less time and is less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting tidbit for those who really want something by which to judge the pain.  I suffer from a condition called Fibromyalgia.  The symptoms are numerous but one thing FMS causes is extreme hypersensitivity of the skin.  There are days that even a slight touch feels like a blow torch on my skin. Granted, I avoid epilating on those days. ;)  But even on \\&quot;good\\&quot; days, my skin is very sensitive.  Because of this, I was even more hesitant to try this device but I hated shaving enough to give it a go.  Surprisingly, I am able to tolerate the feeling.  Now, if a person with FMS can use it....;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;d like to refer to something another poster said.  She claimed that all of the advertised accessories don&#x27;t really come with the X&#x27;elle.  I have to disagree with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that the \\&quot;gentle start head\\&quot; is not included. Well, it is included.  In fact, it&#x27;s the only head for epilating included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Gentle start\\&quot; refers to a feature, not an entirely separate head as that reviewer apparently believes. There are two speeds on the X&#x27;elle.  The first and slower one is what Braun calls the \\&quot;gentle start mode\\&quot;. They claim that this mode is less painful and easier to start with until a person has grown accustomed to the sensation.  Personally, I don&#x27;t agree and find the slower speed to actually be harder to take the faster one.  But it&#x27;s there if you prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The X&#x27;elle does come with a second head but that head is a shaving and trimming head.  I have found the shaver to be quite effective as well.  Obviously, there are parts that a woman just can&#x27;t bring herself to use an epilator on.  The shaver/trimmer takes care of these parts quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the other reviewer says that the advertised \\&quot;cooling glove\\&quot; is absent.  I don&#x27;t see anything mentioned about a cooling glove.  Perhaps the description has changed since she purchased it. (?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the X&#x27;elle for at least a year and have had no problem with function at all.  The cord could be a little longer but besides that, I&#x27;ve loved using this.  The results are well worth the small amount of pain involved.n the X&#x27;elle.

    <li> This is my first epilator and I&#x27;m so far loving it. it hurts when it scratches the skin, but it does pull out the hair with the roots and the hair is thinning. recommended.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday and have already used it, I love it! It&#x27;s really amazing! My more than 10 years old Braun model finally gave out and I ordered this as a replacement. Let me just say it&#x27;s a great upgrade. It&#x27;s really fast, removes hair almost painlessly, for me who&#x27;s used to epilating that is. I love the smart light too! Great innovation, it really does well at illuminating hair. Even used it on my bikini line, almost no pain, amazing again! I also never got bad rashes/razor bumps after like I did with my old model. Just be sure you use a good epilating cream right after to minimize redness and some soreness of course, you did pluck hair out you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A huge plus: enjoy smoother hair-free legs/underarms/bikini line for almost 2 weeks. The big plus I like with epilating is the finer regrowth of hair so even if you grow it out it&#x27;s not coarse or obviously visible. While waiting for this to arrive I had to shave. I really hated my black hairs coarse regrowth, found it itchy and ugly to look at. Now that I have this, I&#x27;m a happy, hair-free camper again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Do not hesitate to get this model or any of Braun&#x27;s other epilators. I&#x27;ve used no other, quality-wise it&#x27;s the best. As I&#x27;ve seen on the box, it&#x27;s still made in Germany too, so I suppose that explains it lasting so well. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have STRUGGLED finding a hair-removal product/system/anything that will remove hair from my legs &amp; bikini line (and keep hair from growing back instantly)until now.  I am extremely happy with the way this product removes hair, and the hair does not grow back for quite some time after removal.  It hurt during the first use (I read the reviews about it hurting if new to epilating but thought I would be fine)...it did hurt, but after the first time it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore and it really removes hair WELL.  I have already recommended this product to several of my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this product! At first it felt like little pinpricks on your skin but then you get used to it. I started with the (1b head) which is the one you use to till your used to it. I can&#x27;t believe I am saying this but it can become really addicting!</li>
    <li> Its very gud.Light is an extra feature which is helpful to remove all hair.Not too painful..pain is much less than the regular waxing.</li>
    <li> This product is really powerful and uproots all the hair quickly.  It gets all the hairs in a section in only one pass.  The light makes it easy to see which hairs remain on the skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product long but I feel that it works well. I am happy that I got it and have not had to shave my legs since I got this epilator last month.  It hurt pretty bad the first time but after that its not so bad.  In addition, I use this once maybe twice a week and have far less hair on my legs than when I was shaving when I was shaving 3 times a week.  The hair seems thinner already.  Overall, I am happy with this product and think that it is worth the money.  One more note - the underarms hurt far worse than any other body part so if you plan on using it there, be prepared!  I only gave it 4 stars because this product is not painless.</li>
    <li> So after seeing the hundreds of positive reviews on this, I decided to order it yesterday and received it this afternoon.  I used it right away.  Like all the other reviews said, it is noisy.  But lets get down to business:    I was really nervous about the pain, so I started it on my arm with the rollers.  It didn&#x27;t hurt.  So I moved to my left leg.  Not bad at all. There is a little bit of pain when you first move it on your leg, but I started with a quick short stroke and then took longer slower strokes and it was not bad at all.  After a couple of minutes I took the roller attachment off and went full speed.  It really was no big deal.  And I have very dark coarse hair.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to do.  I&#x27;m half way done and will finish tomorrow night.  I&#x27;m looking forward to never shaving again!</li>
    <li> Braun 5270 Silk epil X&#x27;elle is the first epilator that i purchased and is one of the best hair removal strategies that i have ever used apart from waxing since it takes your hair out from the root. Through epilation it usually takes 2-4 weeks for the hair to grow again. This product arrived exactly in time as per the Amazon 2 day prime shipping.</li>
    <li> First I thought that this thing is great because of the good reviews, but it was not (for me). Maybe it is good for the technology not for the \\&quot;performance\\&quot;, that&#x27;s why I gave it a 2. This thing hurts! a lot! A lot more than waxing. You can feel your hairs being tweezzed one by one, not like waxing. WHen I first used this on my legs, the hairs got cut instead of pulled off. I thought I did something wrong, so I did it on my other leg and still the same result. Maybe for the other people who rated this with a 4-5 stars, maybe they are just comfortable with it. I have been waxing since I can remember having my first armpit hair, and using this product is not like that. For those who have been waxing, I suggest that you try this first or other cheap products like this epilator, so that you would know if this one is right for you. For me, I will stick with waxing because it is less painful and I&#x27;m not scared to use it. I will be sending this back. I hope this review would help anyone who would want to shift from waxing to an electronic epilator. The pain factor for this is very high, maybe higher than that of waxing for those who have not yet tried it. Ouch! really.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and I still have a lot of hair. It seems to break off a lot of the hair instead of pulling it. I know it pulls some though because I feel it.  I am squeamish and I don&#x27;t think this hurts. I actually kind of like the sensation. I hear that if you keep using it it work better and better....I shaved after the last use because I had stubble after using it.</li>
    <li> I use to have to shave everyday and i would still have prickly hair. I&#x27;m blessed with dark hair that never leaves. I&#x27;ve tried waxing but it is way to messy and i believe the pain is about the same! I&#x27;ve used it EVERYWHERE, my bikini line, underarms and a little on my chest and arms. Again i&#x27;m super hairy! Well the pain is pretty intense at first, but i just keep thinking about how nice my legs are going to be afterward. For me they still aren&#x27;t SILKY smooth, but i&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks, but you can&#x27;t see the black hairs under the skin anymore which is a plus. I used it on my underarms and it was AMAZING! i did have to stop every few seconds to breathe off the pain but it feels the same as waxing with better results. My underarms are now really soft and there are no signs of Black forest hair anymore. My husband loves it, i used to have to wait a couple days to shave my underarms so they would be really smooth, now i can actually wear tank tops anytime i want. I recommend epilating while watching tv, something to take your mind off of it.     Negatives- My skin was a little splotchy after my first time using it, so i put on a lot of lotion and they were gone afterawhile, my underarms were a little tender after using it, but i didn&#x27;t break out. I recommend holding your skin really tight. My bikini line had a lot of pain and i broke out a little but it also went away and is soft now. Also my legs and arms get a lot of dry skin afterwards, so i recommend putting on a nice bit of lotion, and exfoliating, which is good for you anyway! I love this product and i&#x27;ll probably be buying it for friends. It&#x27;s great, if your worried about the pain atleast try it. you can buy it at target and a few other places, and they have a nice return policy. you will get ingrown hairs, but you got them when you were shaving also, just not as bad.     TIPS: If you can&#x27;t stand the pain wax first, it makes the hair thinner. Second I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my face, my hair is already thin so i use a shaver, not a razor or an electric razor but a trimmer, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back black and it&#x27;s easier then going to get waxed all of the time.    UPDATE: So i&#x27;ve had this thing for a couple months now. I still like it but i have to shave after i epilate, except under the arms, which i must say my underarms have never looked better. No more five oclock shadow, and they are baby butt smooth. I waxed the other day and it actually tickled. my underarm hair is sooo thin now, if anything i will just keep it for my underarms. Or my bikini line, but everytime i go to try it there again, i quit breathing. lol. Just like waxing before the \\&quot;big pull\\&quot;. But if you are a brave soldier and a mild alchoholic, i totally recommend it for the bikini line also. I could count the hair&#x27;s on my legs now, because they are spread out, which is better, but i&#x27;m sad that i still have to shave. I&#x27;ll just wait until they come out with a wonder product, that gets rid of hair to the root.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if its because of my skin, but it cause lots of ingrown hairs which appear as ugly red bumps everywhere. it&#x27;s really a pity because expectation was high. though the pain is bearable.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for 20 years and used an epilady in the 90&#x27;s.  This is by far the best option.  I have not tried it on my bikini but on my legs it is a dream.  It hurts about as much as waxing maybe even a little less on the lower legs.  Plus the great thing is you can control when you wax.  I got really sick of going to expensive waxing salons etc.  I am a little worried about trying this on my bikini but who knows maybe after a few drinks it will not hurt as much.</li>
    <li> For 15-years I have used the Epilady and have been happy NOT to shave my legs four times a week.  I decided to check out the reviews for the Braun, the reviews were good and the Braun has absolutely over performed!  The Braun takes off more hair faster, it is quieter by far and alot easier to use.  Yes, initally there is pain pulling your hair out by the root.  But the pain is worth it.  After a few tearfull experiences you will throw away your razor and have the smoothest legs on the block!  For me - I Can&#x27;t live without it.  Seattle-</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I tried epilating years ago when it was very painful and hard to endure.  I hate waxing and shaving as well!  In any event, I got curious about the updated technology on epilators so I came to my favorite shopping spot here, Amazon, and found this epilator.  I read the reviews and was impressed.  The bottom line is this.  I performed my first epilation last week.  It did sting slightly and was uncomfortable at times, but not painful or unbearable.  Plus, keep in mind I had gone almost a week without shaving.  I did my underarms too.  Well, I&#x27;m beyond pleased!  What an awesome product!  It&#x27;s everything everyone says PLUS SOME.  I cannot wait until it gets to the point where I can go longer and longer without epilating.  I just did my second epilation today and it was pretty much pain free!!  HIGHLY, HIGHLY, recommend this product.  And the light is especially helpful.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this product. And the price is UNBEATABLE.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions in the box and when that didn&#x27;t work I followed another reviewers advice. Either way, the hair just broke off and left stubble. It also took too long and was slightly painful.    I returned it and got a Panasonic ES2207P electric shaver and that ended giving me a shave comparable to using a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> I really like this product; I like that it has 2 speeds, to ease you into things, and that it has a shaver head attachment which you can use to get your hair to the optimum epilating height (perfect for the first shave of the spring! ;-) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, don&#x27;t expect it to be painless.  Don&#x27;t expect ANY epilator to be painless, and if it claims to be, it&#x27;s lying.  The thing pulls your hair out by its root, for goodness sake!  It will hurt.  So don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re the kind who tears up while plucking your eyebrows.  Epilators won&#x27;t be for you.  On the other hand, if you detest shaving every day, can&#x27;t afford to have laser hair removal, and are frustrated by waxing or don&#x27;t feel comfy having a stranger view your shaggy legs, then this may be for you.  I trade the pain for the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day (I use it 2-3 times per month), cuz let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m lazy, and I won&#x27;t shave every day, and I also won&#x27;t go through the summer in long pants.  So, either show my devil-may-care fuzzy legs, or use an epilator.  I chose the epilator (and my husband is thankful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this particular epilator is very nice.  The light is a nice touch, although the blue cast it throws can allow some hairs to go unnoticed (I hate thinking I&#x27;m good and then going out in the sunlight to see a stripe of fuzz running up my leg), it is certainly more helpful in the task than not helpful, especially if you, like me, have to shave at night after the kids have gone to bed, when there&#x27;s no natural sunlight to be had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you think the pain is worth it (and really, it isn&#x27;t that bad, especially if you follow the instructions and move the epilator s-l-o-w-l-y), then this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> My wife and I had another epilator that we liked over the last 4 years. When our current epilator began to show signs of failing I researched a new one and based on the reviews bought this one. Despite being $20 less than our last one this one is far superior. We can use on the bikini and lower abdomen area without the pain being unbearable. And yes depending on the area there will be more of less discomfort as you pull hair out of your skin. Though I haven&#x27;t gone through childbirth I find it hard to believe having been there delivering babies that it can be a fraction of that discomfort despite one of the reviews. As a guy with minimal pain tolerance for injections and blood drawing according to my wife I don&#x27;t find the discomfort all that bad and it is worth it for the smooth skin that lasts. My wife who typically shaves way more body parts than me and only used the epilator for certain body parts used it on her legs the other day and I can feel the difference several days later even using the less aggressive head. Buy this if you are hoping to get results similar to waxing without the mess or inconvenience. Great product and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread! Very easy to use, a little painful as expected with epilation, but very fast and awesome. No more razor burns and itchyness afterwards. Will recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this epilator. I am glad some of the reviews had tips on how to use it and that the pain would decrease after a while. The tips were very helpful since the product didn&#x27;t really have much.</li>
    <li> I got this product on Thursday and immediately plugged it in to try. I used it on my chin hairs, upper lip, and a spot test on my leg just above my ankle and OMG it was awesome!! So awesome in fact, that I had to show my mom. I used it on her chin and her day old shaved legs, she couldn&#x27;t believe it either!!! Our chins, her legs, my spot test were so smooth. I couldn&#x27;t really get into my upper lip because it hurt too much, but I have a plan for that which I&#x27;ll explain at the end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a regular waxer, which is why I only did a spot test on my legs. I decided not to skip my last regular wax because of Mark Twain&#x27;s advice below. And I would recommend everyone follow it to a T!!!! It is better if you get use to the device on raw skin before using it on actual hair growth. If you are tolerant to pain then you can probably start as my mom did with day old shaved skin with slight stubble. But the rest of you, shave/wax/pluck for your final time and then use this product immediately after. You&#x27;ll get use to the pulling of the machine without very much pain (because this thing WILL pick up what you missed and didn&#x27;t even realize) and get the feel of how to glide it over your skin to get all the areas you need to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to my story. My last wax appointment was on the following Saturday. My regular package consists of full legs, full bikini, underarms and ... my backside nether region. When I got home I set this thing to work. The light was amazing; I could immediately see all the blonde hairs my waxer missed!!! I glided over them and pulled them out. I cleaned the head a few times and let the hairs lay in the sink just to get an idea of how many were really missed, but even I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the results. By the time I was done the sink looked like my brother had just shaved his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and left me the mess to clean up. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I was able to reach every crevasse of the waxed portions of my body without a problem. The only time I had pain was when I attempted to epilate my not so well waxed female gouch area. I think the hairs that were there were just too long and well rooted since they&#x27;ve probably never been touched before in their existence. So when they were caught by the machine it pulled hard, hurt like a b**** and made me bleed. But I think that it will be better the next time, I&#x27;ll give it time to heal and make sure I not neglect that area again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about my upper lip, this is the most sensitive part of the body and I&#x27;m sure somewhere in the manual, that I didn&#x27;t read, it says to not use this on your face. But, if you do, then here&#x27;s some advice. Wax it before you use it for the first time and then practice up and down strokes, straight down from the nose to the lip to remove the hairs. If you go side to side it will hurt more because you are pulling the hairs out in an unnatural direction. I believe this was the main cause of my pain because I was trying to go straight across my lip, side to side, as is done when the wax is applied to the area. I was pulling real hairs (I had not waxed as I have recommended) and had not used to the machine prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would recommend that if you have ingrown hair problems you get this product and use it every day, hair or no. I have ingrown hair problems and this is a really good exfoliator with the massaging rollers attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped someone. And if you still aren&#x27;t convinced to buy this product let me put it in perspective: 700+ reviews and STILL 4+ stars!!! Come on! The ones that are 1 stars are either complaining about pain and were too early to read Mark Twain&#x27;s advice or got a DOA product that you can RMA for a working one (I didn&#x27;t read any 1 star articles, just Mark Twain and W. Tong. Then I saw 700+ reviews and still 4+ stars and said \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;). This is well worth the money because (if you are a regular waxer) you will get back your money the first time you use it AND NEVER LOOK BACK!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 out of 5 because it did miss more short hairs than I had hoped it would. I agree with several other reviewers that it hurts MORE with the beginner&#x27;s attachment and slow speed... imagine waxing sloooowly. Same idea. I&#x27;ve used Benzocaine spray (yeah, I&#x27;m a wimp) and it helped some. Try:[[ASIN:B0012QK29K SURGI Gentle Touch Numbing Solution 2oz/50ml (Model:82591)]]</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before, and I read a lot of reviews before deciding.  I am pleased with my purchase.  I read mixed reviews on this one, but I have found all features to be useful.    The light, some reviews said useless, I feel it&#x27;s very helpful.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my lighting, but I love it!    The massage rollers, helpful the first few times on the legs, and still very helpful on the bikini!    One stroke removal, not so much with me.  I have fine blond hairs on my legs, I have to go over it a few times to get them all.  (That&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars) But it could just be my hair, hard to tell as I don&#x27;t have a comparison.    I must confess, I tried the underarms, but it was much too painful for me.  So I will continue to shave them.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This epilator is great. I&#x27;ve tried epilators before and gave up on them because it was so painful to remove hair using them. But then a friend suggested this new Braun model and I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m hooked! It removes the tiniest hair and the little light attached to the roller does a great job of helping you see every pore and follicle on your skin. It is light, has a long enough cord and comes with a handy pouch that is easy to travel with.  The epilator is great for arms and legs - basically for all areas that aren&#x27;t sensitive. The skin has to be pulled tight for smooth hair removal. I cannot use it on the under arm, bikini or facial areas.  I also wish the motor wouldn&#x27;t make so much noise - it is over whelming but you get used to it after a while.  Overall, i&#x27;m very satisfied with this investment and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This got to be one of my best purchases. I just got it today and tried it. Love it! It works great, save time for busy woman like myself. No more dealing with shaving and waxing. It&#x27;s quite painful for the underarm area though, guess because it&#x27;s the first time, I&#x27;m expecting pain to go down over time. Takes time to clean it though, I&#x27;m thinking to get a can of compressed air. But overall, this is something I&#x27;ve been looking for for a while, if you need to run out of door and want to make sure you look gorgeous and not to worry about hairy legs, you have found the answer :)</li>
    <li> this epilator works great on course hair, but not so great for thinner, finer hair.  it worked great in my calf/shin area where the hair is slightly more coarse, but as it got up around my thighs where my hair is thinner the tweezers have difficulty grabbing at the hair.  works GREAT on underarms but it is a wee bit painful the first few times.  you get used to it tho.  have not tried it anywhere else but legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this device for about a week and a half and I love it. I have to say, it hurt at first, but the more I&#x27;ve used it the less it hurts. That&#x27;s saying a lot, as I have pretty much NO pain tolerance whatsoever. The one issue I have is that it&#x27;s annoying to clean all of the little hairs out. They give you a little brush, but I usually end up using toothpicks. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s way cheaper than waxing.</li>
    <li> This is really an awsome epilator. I bought this to replace my Emjoi AP-9T Tweeze Tweezer. Comparing to the EMjoi tweezer which is mainly for removing facial hair, this is a epilator for the entire body. It works much more effectively and faster. Two power settings, I used the higher setting and here are the results.    Underarm: slightly painful than the Emjoi tweezer -- make sense because it has 40 tweezer heads. The pain is very minimum to me, but keep in mind that I regularly used the Emjoi Tweezer for underarm. It took me about 2 minutes for each side.     Facial: Remove even the tiny hair on my face.     Bikini Area: The shaving head comes handy. I have not yet tried the tweezer    I read a review complaining the epilator creating scars after use. I suspect it was because the epilator was not cleaned properly therefore the skin got infected. The epilator needs to be cleaned regularly since hairs are trapped at the head every time you use. If it is not cleaned properly, I could imagine germs and bacteria would grow. The tweezer/shaving head could be removed easily by pressing the side buttons for cleaning.      Have fun!</li>
    <li> I am rating the epilator a three because it is cute, worked well to remove hair and there was no pain with stubble hair. You will feel snatching prickles if your hair is above a stubble length, not painful but uncomfortable. The longer the hair, the more uncomfortable the feel when the hair is removed. My skin had absolutely no silky or soft feel what so ever. I also had little dark holes when the hair was removed. I returned the epilator because I have better results with creams hair removers.</li>
    <li> I thought about getting a waxing kit before summer comes around and I thought how was I going to battle summer with my hair problem.  I hate to shave because I get these ugly black dot on my legs.  It&#x27;s a smooth shave but i could still see the hair under my skin.  And I hate the fact the I have to shave the next day.  I own a machine similar to this one.  I got it over 10yrs ago.  I do do the occasional waxing, but it is too messy.  So after reading all these postitive reviews about it, what the heck.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be spending that money on getting my legs and underarms wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got this machine and can I say that is thing is awesome.  I read the little instruction manual and I gave it a try.  It is now of new favorite thing along with summer.  If you have never wax before I can say it can hurt.  You are plucking your hair out from the root.  But it is not unbearable.  You just have to get use to it.  The best part of this thing is the little LED light.  No matter how bright the room is, sometime it is still hard to see.  But because of this light you don&#x27;t have to worry about missing a spot.  You do have to glide the tip over your skin SLOW, otherwise you just have to repeat that area again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already told one of my friend about this product and she can&#x27;t wait till she gets hers.  Get this machine, it is the best thing since self-tanner for the summer.</li>
    <li> As an ethic woman, I have a lot of thick hair that grows FAST.  I&#x27;ve tried depilatories and they burn.  Waxing is expensive and it requires you to grow your hair pretty long (what&#x27;s the point?).  Shaving is easy, but it creates ingrown hair and itchy skin.  This is the first time I ever tried epilating.  If anyone has ever had their eyebrows threaded, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know all these women that have \\&quot;had 4 children\\&quot; claim that this pain is unbearable, but come on!  Obviously it&#x27;s going to hurt a little...hair is being plucked out of your skin!  Man up a little, it&#x27;s not that bad.  If it doesn&#x27;t hurt, the hair is only being cut--which is also a good way to tell if you&#x27;ve missed any hairs.  The only places it can be a bit difficult to use is your bikini area and armpits.  I managed to deal with the armpit pain, but I&#x27;d stick to waxing the bikini area because all the hair is removed in one swoop rather than one at a time (making pain more bearable, and it&#x27;s probably better for hair that thick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive skin so there was some rash/irritation the first few times.  But it went away after 12-24 hours.  Hair doesn&#x27;t need to that long to tweeze...only about 2mm.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m a bit impatient.  I waited a few days after shaving to try it, so some hairs were too small.  It pulled most of the hairs out, but the ones that were too short simply got cut.  So if this product is \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; your hair, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.  Grow your hair a bit more and you shouldn&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs.  The spots that I got feel SO SMOOTH though!  And as the hair grows back it&#x27;s not the thick pokey stubble that you get from shaving.  The hair that grew back is fairly soft, so it&#x27;s not even that noticeable that it&#x27;s there (which helps with the waiting period).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, you only need to do this once or twice a month.  It is definitely worth it if you can stand a bit of pain and are patient enough to grow the hair out to 2mm.</li>
    <li> I have thin blond hairs on my legs. I tried this and it hurt quite a lot and it didn&#x27;t remove very well at all.(I had to run it over the same area on my leg several times and even then it was not completely smooth). On top of that, i got the most horrid red bumps on the areas i used this product on, which was thankfully remedied with severe globs of jergens lotion. I think this works best on people with thicker hair maybe? because then the device can really grab the hairs. Anyway, you will be pleased to know that I returned it and got a refund (at least i was). Hope this review was helpful; Happy hair removing!</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator I have ever purchased and used and I have been extremely impressed! The first time I used it was pretty painful and I spent 2 1/2 hours epilating my legs but was ecstatic about the way they looked when I was finished. I have very dark leg hair and even after freshly shaving with a razor the hair was visible under the skin. I am about 1 month into using my epilator at this time and it is minimally painful or uncomfortable when using but totally worth the discomfort! If you&#x27;re debating this product, I would encourage you to try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two Emjoys and love the idea of epilation, but I&#x27;ve had mixed feelings about Emjoys.  They  didn&#x27;t really do that great of a job on finer hair, and usually stopped working after a couple of years of moderate use (I&#x27;m not all that hairy, so it&#x27;s basically just lower legs and underarms).  So this time I bought a Braun because that is the only razor brand that my husband will use.  Well, I have not been disappointed!  It&#x27;s well designed, truly gets even the fine hairs, and the \\&quot;search light\\&quot; is nothing short of genius.  Sure, epilation itches a bit right afterwards, but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems with ingrown hairs from this product (unlike with the Emjoys)and I truly do stay de-fuzzed longer. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator and I love this one. The first one was an emjoi-basic. It did its job well but accendently i used it for a 220 volt and it burnt off. So i searched for a 110 -220V epilator and found this. The price was alright and it had many option. It was comparetivly painful the first time i used it and the second time ownwards it was fine. It does its job neatly (for neat removal of hair u should hold it 90 degrees) and the under-light is defintly helpful to remove the almost invisible hairs. Bikini line hair removal using this was painful and so i dropped it. For hands and legs this is perfect. It has a shaver head also which was helpful to remove hair when i&#x27;m lazy for epilating. :D. The only thing i would want more was a codeless epilator. Unfortunatly the 110-220V didn&#x27;t have that option. If u don&#x27;t care about 110-220v then there is a different version which is codeless too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with delivery time and product was greatly improved over previous versions.  Definite Buy!</li>
    <li> As the other reviews have mentioned... The first time is the COMPLETE worst feeling you will ever experience in your life!  I have 3 children and 2 tattoos and the feeling was definitely somewhere in the middle (no lie)!  I began by shaving my legs and under arms.  Since I was only a shaver and am African American with medium coarse hair, I typically shave every 2-3 days.  I therefore waited 2 days and began using my new Braun instead.  I continued the same process for about 1 month and have been doing so about 2 times weekly since May.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a ethnic thing or not, but I don&#x27;t think I will every be every to go long than 1 week or brave enough to go beyond my legs and under arms.  The shaver attachments are excellent everything else.  OVERALL, the was a great investment!!! GO FOR IT...</li>
    <li> It seems to shave and not pull the hair out. I have the right head on it.Braun 5270 Silk-Ã©pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare this epilator to any other since I have never used one before.  I was always afraid of the pain that I had read epilators cause.  This one is relatively painless and the results are awesome.  My legs have never felt so smooth.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got tired of waxing my underarms so I thought I&#x27;d try this little machine.  It works pretty well.  At first it was intensely painful and I considered giving it up.  At least with waxing it&#x27;s all at once, right?  If you use it every few days instead of waiting until your underarm hair can be braided, you can barely feel it!  I did try it on my legs but I just don&#x27;t have time for that.  I don&#x27;t have a problem shaving my legs, so no big deal.  As for the people who say it ripped their skin out?  Well, it certainly felt that way at first, but no skin actually came off.    The cons:  it&#x27;s loud, you have to go over the same area several times to get all the hair and it just won&#x27;t grab some of the finer hairs.  Also, be sure to use it the night before you want lovely smooth underarms (or whatever else you use it on) - it&#x27;s not something to use at the last minute.    All in all, way better than waxing.  No muss, no fuss.</li>
    <li> If u don&#x27;t want to wax then u can go for this. This is my first epilator so i can&#x27;t say this is best or not. But obviously waxing results are best although it is messy/expensive. (Reviewer- Anu)</li>
    <li> I bought it as a birthday gift for my daughter, and, after a couple of initially painful sessions, she is happy with it. She says it is good for the legs and the bikini area but too painful to use on the armpits though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Braun Epilator for the first time.I was reluctant to buy it first but after reading so many good reviews about the product i bought it 2 weeks back.Its a wonderful product. It has a shaving attachment also along with it.I trimmed my hair with the shaving attachment first which just shortens the hair a bit.After that the epliator can be used to remove the hair from the roots.It was painful a bit a t the beginning but i have used it twice since then.I use it after every week now so that i do not have hair long enough to be  painful. I have used this product on legs and arms till now and found it really used. Much better than the messy waxing and shavers.Legs are smooth for long.  Great product,i would recommend this to everyone!! Real value for money</li>
    <li> About two years ago, I used a hair remover cream.  It was my sister&#x27;s wedding day and unforunately, it did not work.  I was forced to shave shortly thereafter.  After that experience, my hair was extremely coarse.  Stubble would grow back within hours.  I ordered this product a few months ago.  Now my legs are amazingly smooth.  The hair grows in softer, finer, and less noticeable every time I epilate.  I use my epilator and then I use the hair off mitten to smooth any roughness away.  This is the perfect combination.  I now have legs that are super soft and smooth.  I have no hesitation wearing shorts or skirts now.  Before, I would have been too self-conscious to do so.  I have not used it in over a week and my legs are still smooth.  There are very few hairs growing in on my legs.  This also works for arm pits.  I use the shaver attachment with great success as well.  I cannot express how pleased I am with this product.  The hair removal is painful the first few times.  After about the third time, the pain is quite minimal.  I am so thankful for this product!</li>
    <li> The epilator is good. I did this for the first time and it works well! The hairs doesnt come back upto 2-3 weeks.  One small issue is that it hurts when using on the legs, but probably because I was a first time user. Overall a great product. I am going to buy another piece for my sister.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator because of the features it had and the price was decent. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive and I didn&#x27;t want a toy either. I wanted something that was going to do the job. And this one does it. Besides epilating you also have a shaver head. You need to make sure the hairs aren&#x27;t too long for the epilating head. It doesn&#x27;t hurt so much if the hairs are shorter. Also do this after getting a bath. It&#x27;s much easier to epilate. With epilating, your legs stay hair free for a longer period than regular shaving would. The shaver head works great too for shaving in between if need be. I won&#x27;t say this doesn&#x27;t hurt because it does in sensitive areas like the inner thighs. But once you get used to using this it&#x27;s a breeze to use and hurts less the more you use it. Haven&#x27;t shaved once this summer! The light makes it easier to see too. I recommend this if you&#x27;re new to epilating as I was. It works great!</li>
    <li> The Braun 5270 Silk-e&#x27;pil X&#x27;elle is a very effective way to remove unwanted hair. It is so much better than another brand I used before. The \\&quot;headlight\\&quot; makes it so much easier to search and destroy :^D      I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used to wax regularly, but gave it up when I moved to America as it is expensive here. Been shaving for the past 2 years, and my hair growth has increased in that time.    I purchased this epilator a month ago and so far am very happy with it! It doesn&#x27;t give me the smooth shaven feel, but that only lasted for a few hours anyway! I like the fact that my hair is taking so much longer to grow back now now.    It&#x27;s a great alternative to waxing, and this product has come a long way since I first used it in high school in the 90&#x27;s! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I had mine for over 1 month now, and I have used this epilator a few times. It did not always pull the hair from root, sometimes it break the hair. It did not either pull all hair or break all hair. I always have to do it again and again. My daughter tried to use this epilator, but it was not working at all for her. Either it was too painful, or it did not even shave the hair. I gave it 3 stars since it is working somewhat for me.</li>
    <li> OK, We&#x27;re talking hair removal here; there&#x27;s no painless carefree way to rip out hair by the roots. The epilator is more effective than the Moom as it gets the coarse and fine hairs on legs. The more I use it, the less hair grows back, and I use it everywhere. Lower Legs, underarms and down there.&lt;br /&gt;I can go a week and nothing but the softer blondish hairs come back. No big. I can&#x27;t stand the nubbies one day after shaving and I will never go back. My legs still feel way smoother than one day shaving, even after a week.&lt;br /&gt;Painwise, it&#x27;s like not exactly pleasant, but it won&#x27;t go any farther than you take it, either. Go slowly &amp; get used to the feeling esp in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with ingrowns; I do epilate after a hot bath and exfoliate between.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator! I was a consistent waxer before, and I love being able to get the shorter, sparser hairs as they grow in, instead of waiting for \\&quot;enough\\&quot; long hair to make waxing again worthwhile. This is my first epilator, and I&#x27;m SO glad I got it! I don&#x27;t think the pain is as bad as waxing- I use it on my legs and underarms. It will pay itself off shortly as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator one month ago and have to say that it is no where near as painful as some would let on, and it has been an effective hair removal method. I HATE shaving my legs due to chronic razor burn. I tried everything for years to reduce the irritation after shaving, however nothing ever worked. I read the reviews on many epilators as well as tips for the best use before deciding on this particular model. Overall I am very pleased with the results, I no longer have to look down at red bumpy shins and when the hair does begin to grow back it&#x27;s not prickly and irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient, it took me what seemed like an eternity (45 minutes) to complete my legs the first time, however now that I am just maintaining them it takes less time and effort than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think epilating before bed is a good idea, by the time you wake up the redness will subside and your skin will look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly changed out the massaging roller for the efficiency and cranked it up to the fastest setting. I really didn&#x27;t find the process painful on my legs, my bikini area is still sensitive and I&#x27;m sure that will become easier over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the tips of exfoliating to heart and have not suffered from ingrown hairs. I began my new exfoli</li>
    <li> I found this product because I was desperately looking for an alternative to shaving because noticed I am getting a lot of ingrown hairs. Yuck! I&#x27;ve used it for about a month or two. Although, it hurts like heck the first time, the pain doesn&#x27;t bother you at all after a few times. So far all my unwanted hair is either lighter, or practically gone. I love my skin so much because it looks so clean! Personally, I will never go back to shaving after this product, especially knowing after a year or two my hair will get tired and stop growing. Also, for the ingrown hair, I keep it above the skin by epilating and exfoliating.</li>
    <li> My order was processed same day (althogh it was a Sunday), and my epilator came within three days after the purchase. The Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Epilator works great. It has exceeded my expectations. It is worth its money.</li>
    <li> This epilator removes hair very well and the pain is not horrible like some have stated.  It actually feels kinda cool!  The problem starts a week or so after hair removal.  INGROWN HAIRS like crazy.  I exfoliated every day and still had major ingrown hair trouble!  My legs look horrible now.  Wasted $.  Am going back to shaving.  Too bad, because this would have been really convenient.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Silk-epil a couple of weeks ago. The first time I used it was very painful, but you get used to it and after a couple of times it get less painful.  The result is ok. Some of the hair is only cut off instead of removed by the root. I have to use the silk-epil at least once a week to have smooth legs. I tried but can&#x27;t use the epilator other than for my legs.  The usage is super easy and it is a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing, sugaring, and products that promised slow hair growth over the years to reduce and/or get rid of unwanted leg hair. I first got the $19.95 &#x27;touch up&#x27; epilator from Target to see if I could handle the epilator pain.  Seeing as it wasn&#x27;t too bad I decided to try this one and I absolutely love it.  For minimum pain, first let your hair grow for a few days and then try this epilator with the roller attachment. It has a way of vibrating against your skin so you don&#x27;t feel the hair removal as much.  Then use the attachment that is bare on one side to get a closer shave.  After, take an epsom salt bath to reduce the ingrown hair possibility.  I used the epilator for a couple of days in a row, then waited a few days and did it again.  Doing it a few times within a week was the way to get most of the hairs since they grow at different rates.  I have to honestly say I haven&#x27;t worked up to doing underarms yet- don&#x27;t know if I could handle that pain.</li>
    <li> I really like the Braun. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years now and it still works great. I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and have used it several times since. It hurt my legs at first but it gets a little better every time I use it. The bikini and underarm areas hurt a lot more but I just try to use it for a few seconds every few days with the hope that the pain will lessen as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indicator light works great and really helps you see the hairs your removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not cordless. It can be a little awkward dealing with the cord and trying to get the hard to reach spots behind your legs.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;ve owned a bunch, starting with the very first Epilady.  This is gentle, gets the job done (I had very thick hair on my legs ... have been using an epilator since 1988 and it has since thinned.) The smart light really makes the job a breeze. I hope Braun never discontinues this model.  You will not find a better epilator ... of the reviewers who love this and give it lots of stars, they&#x27;ve written all the details you&#x27;ll need.  Just casting my vote for the absolute best.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd. type of eliplator. Over the years I have owned other styles and brands and the Braun 5270 is by far the best. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars due to it not being cordless and rechargable. Otherwise it is perfect. Compared to my older epilady it is virtually a painfree shave and also shaves faster than my old one and it has a light to guide the way. With the guide attached it is pinch free behind knees. I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I really want to use this epilator, but find it impossible because I can&#x27;t stand the pain!  Is there any way to maybe numb myself or just any way to make it less uncomfortable?  Does anyone else have this problem or am I just overly sensitive?</li>
    <li> First I have to say is OUCH! I suggest shaving first your legs, wait till it&#x27;s long enough to epilate then epilate the area on your body. Since hair grows in different stages you take less at a time, so it hurts less. I bought this about one month ago and i use it once to twice a week on my underarms, legs and bikin area. I am now at the point where I will be able to go 2+ weeks w/o it. Also, exfoliate exfoliate exfoliate! Feels so much better! You get used to the pinching after awhile, even on your bikini and I don&#x27;t tolerate pain well. My underarms, bikini and legs look amazing! Great for the summer time, so much less expensive then waxing and much better than shaving.</li>
    <li> We had an older model that was used for several years. This newer model is nicer (I&#x27;ve been told).  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reveiws before I decided to go ahead and order this epilator.  The reveiws were correct, the pain is increadable.  You get use to it though. Each time you use it the pain gets better. It removes the hair wonderfully. I used to wax my bikini area and this works just as good. I am very glad that I made this purchase. It is going to save me the cost of waxing every other week.</li>
    <li> Very little pain compared to other epilators.  Works great.  I use it on my face too.</li>
    <li> This has been the best thing I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve been using wax for the longest time, and this does the same thing, without having to do wax (danger of getting burned). I definately recommend this for people that prefer wax over razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Epilady for years so I was looking for something to travel with.  This is just the right size to fit your hand.  The light is helpful.  I didn&#x27;t need to use the comfort attachment.  I love that it has the shaving attachment.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks before going on vacation to Hawaii in October and I didn&#x27;t want to bother with having to shave.  Because of this product, I threw out my razors and vow to never shave again!!    My mom had one of those old school epliators when I was little and it was pure torture, but it worked.  I figured I would try a newer model in the hopes that modern technology would come to my rescue.  It did!      Does it hurt?  Of course, it&#x27;s pulling your hair out at the root!  Is it unbearable pain? Absoultely not, thanks to the attachments that come with it.  There is a gaurd that you need to make sure you use.  The guard has rollers on it which go over the skin first.  The eplitor then pulls the hair out, but then another roller goes over the skin to sooth it!  The first couple of strokes hurt, but the part of the body you are epilating gets used to it.      I would give it 5 stars, but for some reason, it won&#x27;t get some of the finest hairs on the back of my leg, no matter which direction I go.  I also do my armpits, which hurt like no other the first time, but not so much the second.  It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair with that either, only the courser ones. It may just be the weird angle though!      The only other comment that I have is to watch if you are in an area where you have any type of stretch marks.  The first time I was doing my arm pits, it chewed up the outer skin on my arm in the crease.  It grabbed the skin like it would the hair.  I also have some raised stretch marks on my inner thigh, what girl doesn&#x27;t!!  It also got it a little bit there.  I haven&#x27;t had problems since, but I have to be extremely careful in these areas.</li>
    <li> I have used Emjoi epilators until now and I also tried a Panasonc model and returned it immediately as it was too weak and slow.  This Braun is the best epilator I have used - it is strong and fast compared to the ones I have usedin the past.  The faster it works, the less pain there is.  The light is very helpful (if it shines in your eyes, just cover it with your thumb).  It is a \\&quot;2 for 1\\&quot; deal as it also includes a shaving head that works nicely for areas that you do not want to use the epilator.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Silk epilator at the beginning of the summer after reading the rave reviews. It was definitely painful the first time, and I was shocked by the mess and quantity of all the little hairs it pulled out! I figured out that it was best to either sit on a towel or stand in the shower (water off, of course!!!) I guess with shaving I never noticed how much hair was coming off. It is noisy, my husband had to turn up the TV when I tried it in the living room... And it takes a while, um, ages. The light is really helpful in seeing all the hairs, but for me it took multiple passes to get them. Afterwards my legs were red and patchy, so I&#x27;d usually use the epilator at night. I really wanted to like this product and use it forever... But unfortunately it&#x27;s just not compatible with my skin/hair type: sensitive skin and thick, dark hair. After hair removal I used Price Reigns ingrown hair serum, exfoliated with a loofah, everything people had recommended. However, I still got ingrown hairs. Over time, they got worse and worse, and I just kept getting more and more. I loved not having to shave every other day, but I think the turning point came when my husband asked me why my legs were so spotty. After trying it for about 6 months, I have stopped using the epilator and my legs are &#x27;going into remission...&#x27; I actually purchased the Conair Hair Removal system (which is supposed to exfoliate away hairs.) Not sure about the hair removal aspect of that product, but it exfoliates well and will help me get all the ingrown hairs out. Sadly, it&#x27;s back to shaving for me. If the epilator works with your skin/hair type, this would be a great product. But for me, and I&#x27;d guess anyone else with sensitive skin and thick hair...good luck trying. It&#x27;s probably been 2 months now since I stopped using the epilator, my legs are looking better but I still have some deep ingrown hairs, I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ll ever come out.</li>
    <li> My dream come true. Since it is an epilator and not a shaver it is obviously going to hurt. But it does not even hurt a fraction of waxing. It has other attachments like shaver and trimmer which is of great use. My skin is so smooth now and it stays like that for atleast 2 weeks. It is very easy to use and clean. No need of shaving or waxing now and I do not miss that anymore. It takes only an hour to epilate complete body and thats so fast. I definately recommend this epilator.</li>
    <li> UPDATE ~ ~ 2 YEARS LATER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product and used it all the time (no shaving ever again) for an entire year. It hurt the first few times and I really had to get used to it... The pain DOES go away after a while I promise. What they don&#x27;t tell you though is that you will suffer from ingrown hairs forever to come. At least that is what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;After stopping the use of the epilator all together for a whole year + I am STILL suffering and can&#x27;t seem to get the hairs to grow the right way again. They grown down deep into my skin and will only emerge as a small comedone. When that comedone is extracted a 1/2\\&quot; - 1\\&quot; hair comes out with it. It is so disturbing to see it happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a sensitive person and my hairs are not extremely thick so WE (my dermatologists and I) can&#x27;t figure out what went wrong. I have been to several different doctors who all agreed that they will NEVER let their patients use an epilator ...EVER. They were impressed that it was SO difficult to battle this bout of MAJOR ingrown hairs. They tried everything and finally my team of doctors told me that at this point with all of the scarring and suffering the ONLY solution is Laser hair removal. My once beautiful legs are so scarred from such HORRIBLE ingrown hairs from using the epilator that I am ashamed to wear shorts or cute short dresses anymore :( ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE think twice before putting yourself through this. We all want silky smooth legs etc... BUT laser hair removal will save you in the long run... I can promise you that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST POST ~ ~ 2 YEARS PRIOR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I read the seven-hundred-some odd reviews on this product and decided to take the plunge.  I bought it yesterday and tried it out for myself.  All I can say is OUUUCCCH!  SO it DOES REALLY hurt and you almost have to hold your breath when you run it over your legs. After I was done my legs were SO red and even a bit bumpy but also VERY smooth. The bumps settled down after a few hours and the redness went away. Needless to say the product does work just leaves you a bit sore. I am praying that what everyone else says will eventually become the truth for me.  \\&quot;It gets less painful after each use\\&quot;.  I can only hope for that ;)ave to hold your breath when you run it over your legs. After I was done my legs were SO red and even a bit bumpy but also VERY smooth. The bumps settled down after a few hours and the redness went away. Needless to say the product does work just leaves you a bit sore.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years, starting with the original coil model from Epilday that started it all.   As one device wears out I&#x27;ll replace it with a new model or brand, always looking for something better.   This one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.   The vibrating heads keep the tweezer part comfortably aligned perfectly on the legs.  The light is a great idea and really helps.   Some models break off more hairs than they pull, making for rapid regrowth.   This one actually pulls the hairs out as intended.   I love it.    Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I used to shave, but my hair grows back very quickly.  I briefly had a go at waxing.....but that was awful.  Especially armpit hair, as it tends to have different growth directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at all the other reviews, I decided on this, and I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about the epilator is that you are free to turn it in the appropriate direction to catch hair growing this way or that---compare to waxing, where you will only get the hair that is going one way.  It is also quick......well...as quick as you can stand.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, and it&#x27;s still a bit painful to do, especially for the armpits (depending on the thickness of the hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There *IS* an attachment that has small rollers on it so that it helps lessen the intensity of the experience, and it does help to some extent.  It also has a \\&quot;close\\&quot; attachment that speeds through the process but then is more painful.  Additionally, there is one for trimming the southern foliage, along with the product having a slow and fast speed.  It all comes in a nice silver carrying case, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that, for epilation, the hairs tend to get thinner and smaller, so you need to exfoliate regularly to help let the hairs grow out.  What I end up doing is throwing in shaving now and again so that it encourages the hair to grow out again.  This will often cause the hair to thicken again, but I&#x27;d rather see the hairs grow out than get them all stuck in lil ingrown skin bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for a few years now, and it&#x27;s still doing great, so I decided to come back and rate it so others can know that it&#x27;s a product worth investing in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other epilators for my legs and this one is amazing! It really gets the short hairs that others miss. The light lets you see exactly where the hairs are. Very fast, too. I did my underarms for the first time (was pretty sensitive!) but I was so impressed! I will NEVER shave my under arms again! As for my legs, this really is the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I am a woman that can deal with pain. If I could give this a -1 rating, I would. At first, I thought this epilator was amazing. It was the first time I had ever used one and even though slightly painful at first, you can get used to it. The pain seemed worth it for amazingly smooth legs. (The red bumps did go away after 2 days...) Of course not all of the hairs were pulled because of the whole hair growth cycle, but after using it a few times during the week, I thought I was good to go. Really loved the product until about 1.5 weeks later.....DISASTER! I began to notice that EVERY SINGLE HAIR ON MY LEG WAS BECOMING INGROWN!! Yes, I have read that this tends to happen more when using an epilator and to really exfoliate, which I did...every day...but to have this happen to every hair was a nightmare. Nothing worked except to go through each hair on my leg and kind of scratch the skin off so the hair could come through. This epilator ruined my legs for quite some time. I am sorry but shaving never leaves me with any ingrown hairs and I&#x27;d rather shave everyday than ever deal with the nightmare of having smooth legs, but having ingrown hairs that you can see all over....!!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st Epilator. Read a lot of reviews and researched through plenty on Net, and i should say i was a bit scared to use the epilator de very first time. But i was pleasantly suprised. There was very little to no pain, when i used it on my legs and hands. The bikini line and under arms wer a bit painful. But then they are sensitive area&#x27;s and my hair growth had  thicken&#x27;d there due to shavin.Another gr8 feature is the shaver head. For those places where you think you&#x27;d rather shave, you&#x27;ve got an amazing shaver head. I have given the product 4 stars , not cause i wasnt satisfied but would have loved it 100% if it was cordless.     To Summarize : Great product ! Economical ! Bearable (to no) Pain !</li>
    <li> I received my braun in just a few days, and I love how it works!</li>
    <li> After many years of not shaving my legs, a planned job change made shaving my legs a requirement. I used to hate the raw tenderness of my skin after shaving, and the cuts. Not to mention the nasty stubble!    So I went to Consumer Reports and found that they give epilators a much high rating than shavers.    I bought this Braun Epilator, and it is great. Yes, it hurt a little while pulling out those hairs, but no more than shaving did. My legs were goose-bumpy for a couple of hours afterward, but now they are smooth and silky. Plus no cuts! Hooray!</li>
    <li> I love this little gizmo and as long as you use it once a week or more it remains pretty painless. Don&#x27;t let it go then dig into the sensitive parts like the back of thighs or its hurts. I never shave my legs anymore and use this everywhere but my armpits.</li>
    <li> First, I am a man, with medium-coarse (by mens standards) body hair, on about half of the surface of my body (not on my back).  I got this because of the previous reviews.  I was intrigued by the light, and the different attachments.  This unit does not get jammed into sensitive areas like the Emjoi, and it plucks the hairs with greater ease.  It is significantly louder, but it plucks the hairs with fewer passes.  I&#x27;ve only had it a short time, and I do have a concern that the attachments feel a bit flimsy, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with them.  Maybe it is the time of year (cold and dry), but I notice that dead skin comes off more abundantly with this, compared to the Emjoi, which I think is good.  I&#x27;ve also had fewer ingrown hairs.  The one drawback I have with the light is that it shows me the hairs that are too fine and short to be removed by this epilator.  But believe me, my legs, arms, chest, shoulders, armpits, and unmentionables look very smooth, and they feel very good and healthy.  I would recommend this to any other man or woman.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried at first about getting this item.  Waxing hurts to high heaven and I tried laser hair removal and couldn&#x27;t continue because of the pain.  But, still I ordered this thinking that 1. it has a razor attachment so even if the epilitor part was unbearable atleast I could shave.  When it came I was so excited, I read the directions and closed my eyes and tried it.  While there is some pain it was no where near the pain I was expecting.  I would imagine a hot bath/shower and some Tylenol PM would reduce the pain completely, but even with out that I will have no problems with this wonderful item.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> At the time I put this on my wishlist there were maybe 400 some odd reviews. I am not a sadist. Nor am I a regular wax user. I had tried the 80&#x27;s coil torture device. After reading the reviews I decided to try this again. The massaging beginners head made this a much more painful experience then it had to be. Halfway through the first time using it-I put on the advanced head and found it to be less painful and quicker. On the second use I could not even feel it. Remember hair grows at different rates. The only reason this did not get a 5 from me. Is that my legs are really sensitive so I got razor bumps which take about a day to go away. THAT I can live with since I did not have to epil for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> i love this it does everything its advertised the only con i could mention is that in some areas it leaves red bumps and/or ingrown hairs....however the shaver head that its accommodated with is a great alternative for those days when your not in the mood for pain..also the light is very helpful to...after using this i could never go back to a standard razor....this takes care of all my body hair removal needs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for many years, this is a good model, I like the light. Last one lasted about 3 years, the one before about 4. Clean the head after every use with soap and water.</li>
    <li> This is the best item I have ever purchased for hair removal purposes. No more waxing and shaving. Was delivered quickly and in a perfect condition. Do not hesitate to start saving on waxing and tips at the salon!   Thank you!</li>
    <li> My wife and I were both skeptical about this epilator but since owning it my wife loves it.  It was painful at first and it is painful again if you don&#x27;t use it often enough (like if you have to go back to shaving for a while) but once my wife keeps using it it works just fine.  I can attest to how smooth her legs are after she uses it!</li>
    <li> All the good feedback is true.  Only wish would be that it came cordless.  i love this one it takes the most amount of hair.</li>
    <li> I find this epilator totally amazing. It works great on my skin. Sure the first time is a little painful but you get used to it after a while. Works great.    To Use:    1. Take a shower and dry completely.  2. Then use the epilator and completely remove all the hair. I&#x27;d say take atleast ten seconds per run.   3. Moisturize, moisturize and moisturize. (The redness goes away in like 30 minutes to an hour)    Enjoy absolutely smooth and silky skin.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator ever, and I&#x27;m so glad I was brave enough to try it out!  I was looking for a better alternative to shaving, and my skin is much too sensitive for waxing - the epilator gets the same results as waxing without burning off the top layer of my skin. It&#x27;s not painless, but this epilator gets even the smallest hairs, and gives really smooth results, without leaving dark hairs visible under the skin. My skin didn&#x27;t flare up the way it does with waxing, although it is red for about half an hour, but no more. The bright light feature is great, and it&#x27;s easy to learn how to use. The shorter the hair, the easier it and less painful it is to epilate. If you&#x27;re dissatisfied with shaving/waxing, epilator is the way to go. I heard about epilators from two of my friends, and theirs (also Braun brand) have lasted at least five years so far.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Perhaps a bit painful at first (not going to lie!) but overall, a very good epilator. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several epilators over the years. This one is by far the best--it actually removes the hair that others seem to miss. A big help is the little light that lets you see exactly what you are doing. It&#x27;s a thoughtful touch.    While the various heads and interchagable bits might be a little daunting at first, if that&#x27;s what it takes for a really smooth epilation, it&#x27;s well worth it to me. And the shaver is a bonus, though I didn&#x27;t think I wanted or needed it. It does actually come in handy because you can first shave rather long hair, then finish with epilation.    It&#x27;s a pity there are so many models out there (why?). It makes shopping for epilators really confusing. But I am totally happy with this one despite the endless other choices out there.</li>
    <li> As a life-long athlete, I shave regularly. Tried creams in the 70s but never epilators. What a surprise: did a great job, only painful the first time and tolerable. Even tried brazilian and tolerable. No ingrown hairs and only slight redness which went away quickly. Great product and will probably look for smaller, portable one for travel. Time saver but smooth outcome is the best!</li>
    <li> I had a different brand of Epilator than the Braun and thought it was pretty good. The Braun Eilator puts that old one to shame. It works much better. With the old one I had to keep going over and over an area to remove hairs. The Braun removes them the first or second pass.  I love it. Also, it&#x27;s a shaver if you happen to need that feature. I would recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have to say congratualations to all you ladies out there.  Many of you go to the extreme to remove body hair and I applaud you for your bravery and pain accomplishing it.  I&#x27;m a man and I find body hair in the bikini area and armpits unattractive so I&#x27;ve been shaving it for years.  I finally got tired of shaving every other day so I was looking for an alternative.  I thought about doing lazer hair removal, but it&#x27;s very expensive.  I came across hair removal by using an epilator and had to try it based upon all the great reviews of this product.  I used this epilator for the first time yesterday in my bikini area and my underarms.  It hurt pretty good, but it became bearable as I became used to the product.  I was pleased with the results of my underarms.  They are smooth and comfortable.  My bikini area has some red bumps and soreness, but I expect that to subside.  I am very pleased with how smooth my skin is after using an epilator.  I am going to try following the schedule suggested by some of the reviews to use it every day for a week, every other day the second week, and gradually get to once a week.  The light is a great idea for this epilator.  It was easy to find all the stray hairs I had missed.  I decided to go straight to using the advanced head and skipped the beginner head.  I figured I might as well dive in.  The pain was tough at first, but once the hairs were gone, getting the last few strays was mostly pain free.  I expect to continue using an epilator and not have to go back to shaving.  What a great product for unwanted body hair removal!</li>
    <li> After I first used my Braun Silk-epil epilator two questions crossed my mind. #1 - Why is everyone not using an epilator? and #2 - Is everyone else using an epilator and they&#x27;re keeping it a secret from me? I can go a good 2 to 3 weeks between sessions with my epilator and the regrowth is soft, not prickly like after shaving with a razor. I epilate above and below the knee, so it does take about an hour. I am concerned about the epilator&#x27;s motor being on for this length of time, but after 3 uses the device is still going strong. I was also concerned after some reviewers mentioned problems with ingrown hairs. I purchased a gritty body scrub and use that to wash my legs daily, continually exfoliating and reducing the chances of ingrown hairs. I recommend that you join our secret society!</li>
    <li> I have been longing for laser hair removal for years now but it is too expensive. My cousin gave me the Epilator and it worked great. It hurts like a beast but it is bearable and worth the results. All the dark hair gets plucked out and it lasts for weeks. I am so happy with this product, I no longer care for the laser hair removal. I will be Epilating for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent epilator.  I&#x27;ve used epilators for several years and the Braun 5270 is a dependable one.</li>
    <li> My epilator was about 10 years old and needed to be replaced. Needless to say bought a much cheaper model but that was a mistake. Then purchased this one and have to say overall pretty satisfied. The light was a feature I didn&#x27;t think I would like and or use that much but it actually is a very nice addition, epilator works very well. The only downside I found was the noise level, it is a bit loud, but my last one was as well. So I think that is pretty common because of the motors they use, so it gets 4 stars, would give a 5 if they ever make a model that makes less noise.</li>
    <li> This is really an amazing product. To be honest I didn&#x27;t buy this because I hated shaving, but I stumbled upon this product when looking for other things in Amazon.com and saw the reviews and thought why not give it a try. I am so glad that I purchased this. I have waxed only once in my entire life, and never did it again because of the pain. I have always shaved - as a result, hair especially under arms grow very fast. And they are thick too and the shaving doesn&#x27;t even last for 2 days. I already felt the hair the next day. I tried this product as soon as I received it.     Honestly it hurts - but really worth it. I tried doing it the way many suggested - down-to-up in a single stroke, but found it really hurts a lot. I tried down-to-up (opposite the hair growth) and in little short movements like 1cm at a time, and then I ran over it again and covered a little more hairy area (1cm again). This really is time consuming (took 2 hours for me for full legs, hands and underarms), but the pain is very bearable even for first timers. Got red bumps, but went away in 5 minutes. I showered after and hot water hurts, so I used luke-warm. Applied lotion and I&#x27;d never felt my skin like that in like forever. I discovered another thing - thicker the hair, more pain. It did hurt a little more at underarms, but I did from outer to inside just like 1cm at a time, so I could recover from the stinging sensation. But by the end of my session I got adjusted to the pain and it seemed normal.     I absolutely love this, it&#x27;s like an investment. I&#x27;ve seen some people say that the cord is short, but it&#x27;s 7.5 feet, longer than many hair dryers, I think it&#x27;s the perfect length.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator after reading the reviews. Never had one before and I like it. It is paifull first 2-3 times and after that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I thought the light was a stupid gimmick but it&#x27;s actually really useful because no matter what lighting you&#x27;re in, you clearly see the hair.. the machine works well and the different heads that come with it are useful also.. definitely worth the money.  Shipping (I got the slowest/free shipping) was also faster than advertised!! :-)</li>
    <li> The Braun 5260 Silk-epil is a great product.  The first series of uses are uncomfortable and can be painful but over time less hair grows and the discomfort is slight.  You have to allow yourself lots of time in the beginning because it is pretty time consuming.   I&#x27;ve used it for a month already and its great to go a week without shaving.  Tried it on my underarms but it was too painful to keep up.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin and experiences irritation from waxing.  However, if you have low-pain tolerance this product may not be for you.</li>
    <li> I used to shave, but now I think these days are gone! I used the Braun Epilator for the first time last night on my legs, and I really like it. The pain is not as bad as if you have a waxing, and the little device really gets the job done. It took a while (about 20 minutes), and it is loud, but that didn&#x27;t bother me too much. I think next time I am going to be brave and try it under my arms! The only downside that I can see is the fact that it is not cordless. I wish they would make it in a cordless version! But other than that: highly recommended!</li>
    <li> JEEESUS H CHRIST! This thing is LOUD! It works ok but I am afraid to use it when my boyfriend or neighbors are home because they might think I&#x27;m weed-whacking or something. UGH.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a long while ago and it works like it says it does great! No complaints at all. I baught it to epilate my legs but my leg hair is so thick I could not take it. I tried advil half hour before I started, ice area before and after epilating and I did epilate my entire leg(s) a few times but the pain was just too intence for me but, I discovered epilating my air hair is quick and easy! I also use it to get rid of the fuzzy hair below my belly button. I do used the shaver attachment for my legs now because I find my legs are just as smooth but I have less in-grown hairs with this compared to a razor.</li>
    <li> The more I use it the more I love it! This is a great way to depilate with minimal pain,initially is painful but the longer you use it the less painful.Now I use it once a week and m legs are super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I will definatly recommend it for the price,and the light is soooo helpful.</li>
    <li> After one of my children brushed up against my leg and screamed in pain, \\&quot;Ouchy mommy your legs feel like the cactus in the front yard!\\&quot;I felt i had to change up the shaving routine that is time consuming and ineffective.  Going to get waxed was out of my budget so the search for alternatives was on. Sugaring was next on my list because it could be made at home cheaply and it looked easy. At 11 pm with smoke filling my house and a fire burning on the stove, sugaring was looking less viable. The next day I was off to my local beauty supply store to buy wax, well lets just say waxing is better left to the professionals!    At the point of giving up, I discovered epilators and decided to purchase one. I bought a $40 Emoji and let it rip! Holly hell the pain was unbearable, it missed most of the hairs and I had to make several painful passes to get most of the hairs, but it still missed some and refused to grab my finer blond hairs on my thighs. So I packed that puppy up and took it back to the store pronto!     After doing quite a bit of research online I decided to give an epilator one more try because of the great reviews I had heard about the Braun. It was the choice I should have made in the the first place! It quickly and almost painlessly picked up all the hairs that my failed waxing session and the Emoji missed. I got all those baby fine hairs on my thighs. Perfection! Don&#x27;t waste your time with other models, home waxing, or sugaring, this epilator is what you need! You&#x27;ll be glad you bought it and it will pay for its self in the long run and no waiting for your hair to grow out for waxing. LOVE IT!!!!!!!! Now what are you waiting for? Buy it!</li>
    <li> This was pretty good when I got it. It didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I thought it would (at least, on the calves) but that may be because I&#x27;m younger.  The attachments started popping off so I just stopped using them.  It&#x27;s also gotten really dirty after a year and I don&#x27;t know how to clean it. Even cotton swabs can&#x27;t fit under the spinner. Also, I know a bonus of epilating is that your hairs will start to grow in lighter and thinner. Well, it took a few months before I noticed this and I have to say, they aren&#x27;t so much getting lighter, but definitely thinner! It can&#x27;t pluck the thinner ones! This means that, you have to keep razors on hand.  Not that you shouldn&#x27;t even if your hairs aren&#x27;t getting thinner, because it hurts like *hell* on the underarms/thighs. Also, many hairs won&#x27;t peak through the skin but will cause your legs to feel bumpy, a razor can fix that as well or if you have like a loofah I think that&#x27;d work.</li>
    <li> Works great, smooth legs.  Pain is minimal and the attachment really helps in that department! Wish it were the kind that you could use in the shower, but otherwise it is great.  Gave it a four just because of the missing feature mentioned above.</li>
    <li> I never thought \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; or in this case \\&quot;epilating\\&quot; could ever be done out of the shower. It is great to just whip this out and epilate whenever I want wherever I want (granted you have an outlet to plug it in). It hurts the first time, but after finding the tricks (holding your skin very taut) the pain is easily erased. Now I don&#x27;t mind it at all and enjoy it quite a bit. You need to exfoliate well, and I am only in the first month using mine, but do it each day or every other in the beginning. It only take a few minutes after the initial epilating. Far better then sudsing up and spending an hour in the shower wasting water! Try it! I bet you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> It´s excelent product!.  Practice and quick!    Thanks for all!  Alejandra</li>
    <li> I have replaced my older epilator with this new Braun 5270.  Its great , much faster than one I used to have. It was also Braun silk-epil . I had this epilator for eight years and power wasn&#x27;t that good anymore so I replaced it. The mini light is also a good idea I haven&#x27;t that feature before.  Overall it&#x27;s great product.</li>
    <li> Having tried an Epilady back in the 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s, I was pretty leary of this little gizmo.  That first experience with the Epilady was painful in the extreme-and it was trashed after one try.  So when I pulled this out and got ready to use it, I was pretty nervous.  But there was no need, it was great, and the pain was extremely manageable, and it actually ends up feeling nice once you get used to it.  There were little red dots all over my legs for about an hour, but they subsided, leaving me with soft, silky legs.  I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled.  This is perfect.  The great reviews on this thing are well deserved.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on previous reviews.  It does work well and I agree with others that it is painful especially the first time you use it.  You do get use to it!  I used it only on my lower legs and underarms. The only problem I had was from the ingrown hairs that popped up on my legs.   I eventually stopped using the product. I give it three stars due to the price and not being able to use it any longer. :(   I suggest seeing if a friend has one and will let you try it out prior to your investment.</li>
    <li> It works great at the first speed I didn&#x27;t use or needed the second. The light is great I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to needed but you really find all the hair. The rollers are great, they really reduce the pain. I have very sensitive skin already plus I have chronic urticaria wish is a rash due to allergies and it didn&#x27;t bother me. It gets the short hairs and leaves your skin smooth. If you have never used one try it, for me is better than waxing because I don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to grow. I have been using an epilator ever since I can remember for my underarm hair, the one I had died so I was desperate to get another one, this one is better and less painfull too. With this one I can do my legs and with the other I couldn&#x27;t because it was too painfull. Really great product. ***Recomendation when dealing with epilators: clean them after each use(really)and don&#x27;t drop them.</li>
    <li> It is very smooth and does the job very well.. the light is a great addition to the original version.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I used this on my legs and underarms and the first time really hurt.  After that though, no problem.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s very effective on the underarms.  It&#x27;s taking a little longer to get to a smooth surface on the legs; however, I have noticed the leg hair is growing in much finer and there&#x27;s not as much growth.  I still wouldn&#x27;t say my legs are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Definitely exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> As a first time epilator user I was very scared about using it. I have thought about getting one for years, but was scared of the pain. My step-mom has one and I always thought it looked like torture! But, I HATE shaving. If I shave in the morning, I have stubble by nightfall. So, I read a lot of reviews of different ones, and decided on this one. I used it for the first time last night. I really like it! Sure it hurt a little, but nothing unbearable. I&#x27;ve gotten my legs waxed one time and it hurt really bad (much worse than this) and it was just too expensive because with as fast as my hair grows back I&#x27;d have to do it so often. I took peoples advice and took a hot shower, took 2 tylenol and it did take a long time. More than 2 hours! But, I&#x27;m sure that was just because it was the first time and I was getting used to it and going over spots many times to make sure I got it all. I have pretty course hair. My legs came out pretty smooth and I&#x27;m stubble-free this morning so that&#x27;s a great sign! I used the beginner blade at first but found that it did not get enough hair so go over with the beginner blade and then go over with the experienced one and it&#x27;ll hurt less and get more hair. Also, I did experience a lot of redness and irratation (little bumps) but that went away over night, I just put some lotion on it right after I was done. I will def. continue using this...it&#x27;s a great product!! Hope this review was helpful...if it&#x27;s too painful, go slow and don&#x27;t give up. It&#x27;s really not that bad!! Good luck!</li>
    <li> Yes, this item does work to pull the hairs out at the root and hurts like nobody&#x27;s business...but I found I had to use the darn thing almost every day for a month!  The hairs kept coming and coming.  I&#x27;d rather spend a lot less time shaving in the shower a couple times per week, than sit on the floor in agony doing this every day.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks now but so far so good. It is taking a little getting use to but each use seems better. I purchase this because of all the good reviews</li>
    <li> does the job, comes with bag and accessories to shave and pluck, doesn&#x27;t hurt that much unless you have much of hair to pull at a time, 4/5 because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out but good product</li>
    <li> Yes, this does hurt. This is my first time using an Epilator, so i did expect some pain. It took me awhile to complete one leg, maybe 20min. It does leave a rash like affect after, but I do understand that it is pulling the hair out. It does go away over night. The second attachment that came with it (pro clip) does a better job than the one that is already in place, but the directions do state that, and it hurts slightly more. I used it yesterday, so im not sure how long it will last. The skin is smooth though. I just cant stand having to shave everyday, which i need to, to avoid stuble. I will update on how long it lasted for me. I have course dark hair, being half french and german.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;The results for me lasted about week until I needed to do it again. Alot better than having to shave every other day. I did notice that not all the hair grew back, about %50 of it did, which is a good sign that it will be much slower at growth as time goes by, hopefully. I also noticed that it picks up a little bit of dry/dead skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product to get rid of my fine hairs after my No No device died.  And let me tell you, I was scared from the minute I turned it on.  The noise, the pain; this thing is a monster.  Please someone suggest something that will work on fine hairs on the body as well as the face.</li>
    <li> Certainly what i expected. It works, but will make you wince while you use it - though it beats a razor.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not a review writer, but wanted to say that this epilator is awful.  i&#x27;ve been epilating for years and years... it is much better than shaving, hair grows back much slower and much thinner over time.  HOWEVER, this machine is awful.  it definitely gets rid of the hairs, but mostly be breaking them at the base, and not by pulling them out from the root as it should.  i might as well be shaving since the hair grows back right away.  definitely would not waste your money with this machine.</li>
    <li> My local store has this but I wasn&#x27;t sure so I checked Amazon for reviews. The reviews were great so I bought mine here because it costs less. I am pretty happy with it, although not overly impressed. I have used emjoi for years until one day it juts quit working. The Braun is lighter, but from noise and use aspect, I think both are the same. The light is ok and helps to catch some errant hairs, otherwise, it bothers my eyes. It&#x27;s so bright it takes some adjusting. I know some reviews rave about it, but frankly it bothers my eyes and sometimes I put my finger over it to block it until my eyes get used to it. I use this on my legs and underarms. Pain level is the same as the emjoi, I really don&#x27;t see how it is less painful, these epilators pretty much work on the same way. Length of the cord is ok. I think it depends on floor plan of your bathroom and where the electrical outlets are.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun to replace an older model Braun.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand.  I&#x27;ve never found it to be too painful but maybe that&#x27;s just me.  The attachments also work well.  I would never go back to the blade.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how much hair it left behind.  Really it&#x27;s just a torture device.  I endured a lot of pain and kept going but it left behind a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> Yes, there is minimal pain in hair removal, with this method. The preceding hot bath to open the follicles, helps. If you do it every 3 days, you will have pretty bare legs. I wouldn&#x27;t personally use this for the bikini area, as that is a sensitive spot, and can probably do very bad things down there! And it is very harsh for the face, as well. Underarms? I can go either way, but my underarms are too sensitive for it as well, and tend to have a lot of ingrown hairs after. I&#x27;ve been using this epilator over a year now, and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied as I am fairly hairless for a good two or three days. Even the handful of hairs that I do those two or three days later, aren&#x27;t that noticeable, but I&#x27;m a perfectionist like that, haha. Still, this is better than shaving, which my hair grows basically the very same evening--that stubble is NOT cute!    The light on the top of it, really really helps you get the hair that you missed! I haven&#x27;t seen that on too many other epilators, but it is such a big plus, since I run over my legs while I&#x27;m multitasking (watching TV or something), glance down and the light shows me the hairs that I missed in those areas. Yaaay!    It&#x27;s very cost-efficient. No need to buy shaving creams, disposable razors, waxing expenses, etc. BUT it does roughen up your skin a bit. A few ingrown hairs here and there, but with any kind of epilating, that&#x27;s expected. ALSO, it is SO important for you to pull the skin taut, in any area you are epilating. If not, your skin WILL catch in the razors, and possibly bleed. Maybe the super bad reviews, people might&#x27;ve missed that tip.     I haven&#x27;t found that this is permanent hair removal method, but like I said, still the most efficient way. I hope this review has helped you. These reviews helped me when I made my purchase, so I got all the great tips as well &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I normally alter between waxing and shaving and it sucks. I have thought and thought and thought about just getting a loan to get laser hair removal for at least my pits and legs but now i don&#x27;t have to.  Yeah I still have to use this sucker but I don&#x27;t mind a little pain for fresh legs. It does sting at first but after awhile, at least for me, it starts to feel kinda good.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to getting/trying this thing.  I had myself convinced that I was going to replace my razor with it.  This epilator has gotten some really good reviews so I figured I HAD to love it.    Not so much..  Actually, I have used it maybe 10 times and it sits in the box in a cupboard.  In its defense, I had never used an epilator before but I have experienced childbirth and am no stranger to waxing.  It was packaged nicely and the light was pretty cool.  Now, maybe I just didn&#x27;t know what to expect but this thing missed quite a bit of hair and required several passes.    I also expected pain because the point here is to pull the hair out and, no matter how you spin it, that is never a good time.  HOLY CRAP did this hurt.  I would take waxing any day over this.  I guess that I am just not built for epilating.  :o/    Overall, I am giving this a 3.  Not because I am a weenie and couldn&#x27;t handle the pain but because I don&#x27;t really think something should take 10 passes over a section to get MOST of the hair.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything on Amazon before but this epilator is a great tool. I&#x27;ve been waxing for a while and hated that I&#x27;d have to wait  several weeks before going back. With this I can just use it whenever I want and as soon as I notice new hair growth I give it a few days then run this over my legs and I&#x27;m good to go.     PROS:  * It is very easy to use.   * It works perfectly to remove the hair on my lower legs and bikini line.  * For me it is not painful and feels like my legs are being scratched.    CONS:  * The plug is not long enough.  * I was not thrilled with the results of shaving with it under my arms (not brave enough to use it as intended under my arms yet).    I do recommend exfoliating before you use it and moisturizing after. I just scrub my legs with one of those nylon puffy things in the shower.    If you are a waxer looking to save some money, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this epilator for years now, mainly because its the only thing that really works, other than tweezing, which  just takes too long. It usually takes me about 10 mins, and I use it about every 4-6 weeks.   However, the downside is that it&#x27;s extremely painful! I cringe every time I have to use it, because i know how much it&#x27;s going to hurt. Then after using it, I get red bumps on the sensitive skin of my neck/ jaw line, which lasts about a week! It sucks breaking out in a rash, but it&#x27;s better than having facial hair!   Overall, I would recommend it just because it works so good, but beware of the pain, and don&#x27;t buy if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating my review. I haven&#x27;t even had this epilator a year and it&#x27;s broken. My previous emjoi last 4 years.    I&#x27;ve always used dual-head emjoi products, but thought I&#x27;d try to save a few bucks. This Braun is so much better! The hairs don&#x27;t break, and take longer to grow back. I thought the light was a little silly. But it&#x27;s wonderful! Helps me see the little hairs I missed. The cord is plenty long.</li>
    <li> I was very excited as well as nervous as I turned it on and the blades started whirring. But, the Silk Epil was very effective. I used it on my arms and legs to start with. It tingled a little bit but nothing bad. On my legs, I had little pimples the next day..even those disappeared after two days. Next I used it on my under-arms...oh gosh! the pain..little by little over two days, I epillated my under arms and they are baby smooth now! I even tried it on my bikini area, where the pain was worse...but the end result is great! My legs look smooth and shiny..I am thrilled...all those years wasted in razors..yukk!!</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie, it&#x27;s a bit painful but I believe every girl should own this epilator.  I have told all my girlfriends about it.  My bikini line is finally smooth and bump free.  So glad I discovered this product through Amazon and bought based on the good reviews.</li>
    <li> I love my epilator (bought in 8/08).  This was my first one and I bought this one on a recommendation from another mom.  I HATED shaving and that every time I would within 12 hours I would be all prickly again.  So someone suggested the Bruan Silk-epil for all its perks.    Pros:  The light is the best thing!  It helps me find the hair and even the ones that are ingrown so I can get them out first.  Even with the 3 lights on in my LR, I can&#x27;t get enough light to match what the light gives me.    The multiple heads.  There is the roller one for the newbies.  It does help with the lessening the pain in the beginning (especially if you pull the skin taut).  But after the first few uses (6 or so) I graduated to the other one.  I still use it for underarms &amp; bikini.  The \\&quot;scraping\\&quot; one I use now to help pick up the hair so it can be pulled.  I only have to do it once a week (when I get around to it).    Pain.  IT DOES GET BETTER!!!  It does hurt if you don&#x27;t use it correctly.  But I found with the roller head and the lower setting, it helps.  I never waxed my legs but did pull my hair out with tweezers.  It does sting a bit (like getting the eyebrows waxed) but gets better over time.  The more you use it, the less it hurts.  The back of the legs around the knees and upper thigh do hurt the worst.  But not as much as it did before.  Also I burned my legs when I was younger and still have some residual scarring that gives me a bit more pain.    Shaving?  I don&#x27;t shave anymore.  I can&#x27;t stand what happens after I shave and it makes the hair coarser for the next time I do epilate.  I stopped doing it for awhile on the underarms &amp; bikini but I think I am going to get back into it.  Just make sure you pull the skin taut!        Cons:  Noise.  It is a bit noisy but as I have nothing to compare it to, I am not sure how it compares to others.  I just use it at night when everyone is asleep.    Over-heat?  I do feel that if I use it too long (been awhile for me using it) that it gets hot.  So I found that if I watch TV &amp; turn it off during the commercials, it cools down enough so that it will last through the entire session.      Must dos!  -Put a towel under you.  It is the best way to catch the hair  -Switch legs if the pain gets too much  -Do it over several days if need be so that there isn&#x27;t too much pain all at once  -About 4-5 days after finishing the legs, use a scrubbie on your legs depending on when new hair starts to grow back).  It helps to stop the ingrown hairs.  -Distract yourself with something; TV, movie, music.  It will make the pain lessen as you mind is focused on the TV than on the pain.    I did buy this in the summer of 2008 (2 years ago) but I have not used it on a regular basis (every 1-2 weeks).  So I cannot tell you how long it lasts.  I am hoping I can get at least one more year out of it.  Even if I used it every 2 weeks for 1 year, it still pays for itself with the cost of razors nowadays.</li>
    <li> I love this little gizmo. I don&#x27;t even call it an epilator- I call it my waxing machine. I&#x27;ll be honest here, I bought this for weekly brazilian bikini waxes at a much much more reasonable price than the salon can offer. Be careful! This thing is powerful! If you&#x27;re gonna use it down there make sure you&#x27;ve already been to the salon two or three times so the roots won&#x27;t be so thick. I&#x27;ve started using it on my legs and it works really well. It&#x27;s great having nice waxed underarms all the time too. Remember to be patient! All these women are right- first time is the worst. This is the only epilator I own and I look forward to never having to buy another. If your unsure of which model to get- go with this! Only con is this thing is a little loud but whatever. Doesn&#x27;t bother me especially with the amazing results!     NOTE:: Buy rubbing alcohol and clean as directed! Sometimes when a hair gets yanked out the pore will bleed a tiny bit and that&#x27;s going to get on the tweezer head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with this product. I&#x27;ve been waxing most of my life, and this is so much cheaper and less mess and hassle. Also, if you&#x27;ve waxed a lot, the pain isn&#x27;t that bad (though it&#x27;s probably quite bad if you&#x27;ve never done this kind of hair removal before). You do have to be careful to exfoliate your legs regularly to avoid ingrown hairs, but that&#x27;s true of waxing, too.</li>
    <li> I am REALLY afraid of this device.. REALLY! It has 40 spinning tweezers and not much protection between them and your skin, I am scared it is going to pinch me and from the awful redness after use I&#x27;m pretty sure it has. I am pretty sure that long term use of this device will cause skin damage/scaring. As for the pain it is really painful, I usually shave or wax but am sick of how time consuming they are... I thought waxing was painful, it is nothing compared to using this device. You can go over and over an area forever and it just doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs , the redness and rashyness is by far worse then waxing. After waxing you usually have clear skin in around 12 hours, with this I still have little red dots on my legs and its been over 2 weeks since last use. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. Maybe it works better with real long hair but even if it does... who wants to wait that long for it to grow out? Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again in the future.... if I get sick with a bad cold and don&#x27;t plan on leaving the house for weeks. :/</li>
    <li> Ok so normally with shaving, I would have to shave daily...And even that wouldn&#x27;t keep my legs smooth. My leg hair would grow in so fast and so dark.     The epilator KILLED to use the first few times just to get all of the hair off (and I only used it below the knee down to my ankles). I found it helped a lot to take a hot bath before, and maybe an advil an hour before starting to ease the pain. Sometimes I replaced the advil with a glass of wine. I had to use the epilator about every other day for a week and now I only use it every other week. My legs would be super irritated with tons of red bumps. Even though lotion burned, it seemed to help minimize the bumps.    When I do use it, I use the massager beads cap first because it isn&#x27;t as painful. Then I go back and use the closer-cap to get all of the little hairs the other cap missed.    Honestly, going through that pain for a week was WELL worth it for barely having any leg hair at all now.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those of you who hate to shave except that it hurt REALLY bad. The first time is the worst...but it gets better after a few tries. Unfortunately, my leg hair is thick and dark and this epilator always leaves some hair behind. This is worth the money if you&#x27;re willing to spend some time making your legs perfectly hair free.</li>
    <li> worth the money. its not so great on my legs cause I have eczema and some scars, but it still beats shaving cause my legs, bikini area and underarms stay smoother and softer for longer than with shaving. i do sometimes get some little ingrown hairs, but i ust a good body exfoliator and they come right out after a few showers. I love it and will never go back to shaving! To be honest i sometimes think that it might be less painful, but then I remember how quickly my hair grows back and I suck it up and use the epilator...in all honesty, i think the sound it makes is kinda scary and psyched me out a little bit at first. Now its better...Like other reviews, the stinging is never going to go away but it does get better.</li>
    <li> Am using this product in last 3 month, its really good bit painful for the first time &amp; other than that it&#x27;s too good &amp; wroth for money    I&#x27;ll recommend for my friends...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Epilator.  I was a little nervous when I first started researching them, but I would never go back to shaving my legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is a series of tweezers that rotate, pulling each hair out by the root.  Yes, it hurts.  But it&#x27;s not an unbearable hurt.  It&#x27;s more uncomfortable than anything else, but the results are well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tackled my legs with the epilator, it took me 45min to an hour, and I thought I&#x27;d never do it again!  You have to get used to it, and accept that you have to go SLOWLY! If you go too fast, you&#x27;re just ripping the surface of the hair off, and the hairs grow back faster.  If you&#x27;re patient, it&#x27;s weeks before you have to do it again!  And the hairs grow back smaller and &#x27;sparse-er!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a clipper attachment which is fabulous for trimming in other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people who use the epilator for all body hair, but I find on my underarms it&#x27;s so unbearably painful it&#x27;s not worth it!  I use it on my legs and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a little light that comes on when you turn it on, which can be helpful to be sure you don&#x27;t miss any rogue hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest doing this after a hot  shower, or use Icy Hot before starting, it helps with the ouch factor.&lt;br /&gt;Also, put down a towel or plan to vacuum when you&#x27;re done, as all those little hairs will be on the floor when you&#x27;re done.  :/</li>
    <li> Less painful and Better than waxing ur legs and arms,leaves the skin so smooth for days.i couldnt even feel anything while epilating my legs and arms ,but epilating my armpits was painful might be bcoz the skin is loose in there,so cannot use in the bikini area,but this is the best solution for the hair in legs and arm ,its quick it took only 30 min for legs and arm.</li>
    <li> I was initially confused on which model to buy - one with trimmer option or one without. I finally went for the former. The trimmer is very smooth and esp good for overgrown hairs but can be done without if you epilate regularly. This product is an excellent purchase for those who don&#x27;t wish to spend bucks, getting rid of unwanted hair. It takes out even smallest of hair and actually leaves your skin  smooth and silky - true to its name. Regrowth is definitely less as compared to other hair removal methods like veet cream. You have to have patience, as this does take long time - say around 45 minutes to cleanly epilate your full legs and arms. The light feature is particularly good. You can see clearly, even smallest if your hair. And, it&#x27;s very painful on sensitive areas. You will get used to it with usage. As a one time investment product, it perform its job well.</li>
    <li> This product works better than other epilators that I tried because it actually pulls out all the hairs instead of missing some of them.  I&#x27;ve had other epilators that worked the first time only and then never seemed to work as well after that time to get everything, this one actually works every time.    Warning - be very careful.  If you aren&#x27;t paying enough attention it may catch parts of your skin just below the hair and leave you with an area of red spots which will take a few days to go away, this happened to me on my underarm and back of leg, and because you are already expecting pain from just the hair pulling it may take you a few seconds to realize what is going on.  I&#x27;d probably only use this on my legs and not on my underarms though - due to this problem.      I use a different one on my underarms and it works great there but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my legs (the Emjoi Epi slim).    Other than that, in general I seem to have to use epilators at least weekly still - I never get the 4-6 week results that they claim you can get.  But it still beats having to shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a semi-regular waxer for years, but it just takes so much time! Plus, you have to wait for the hair to grow out before you can wax again.     As a mixed Asian-American, my hair/skin type is dark hair/fair skin. Sadly, I&#x27;m like the fuzziest Asian I can think of, inheriting dark hair that gets THICK and icky when I shave. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to manage the hair and regrowth, but even when I was a teenager, I would have to shave just about everyday if I wanted to be smooth in the summer. But, once in the habit of shaving, the hair got thicker, and is visible under the skin as it&#x27;s growing back!    I actually bought an epilator in the early 90&#x27;s, but it was a nightmare. The pain was SO bad, and the skin irritation afterwards was awful. I learned how to wax on my own, but still the regrowth time for me is only about 2 weeks, if I&#x27;m lucky.    I purchased this epilator in hopes that the technology&#x27;s improved - and I&#x27;m delighted to say, YES IT HAS!!! I waxed when I made my order online, and just got the epilator today. Since a few hairs had already started to come back in, I decided to try it out, and I was totally *amazed*! No pinching like the old model, and at worst (on sensitive areas) it&#x27;s has a pins&amp;needles sensation. Again, I understand hair/skin/pain tolerance is different, but if you&#x27;re used to waxing - this is the answer!!! Hope this review helps and gives others with hair-struggles like mine hope!</li>
    <li> Generally pretty happy with it, it definitelly does the job, sometimes i do have to go over the area 2-3 times though!</li>
    <li> Definitely a good item for this economy.  I no longer pay to get my legs waxed so this saves a lot of money.  See the hints in the other postings, they help</li>
    <li> I bought this after reviewing many other similar products. I have used it a lot but it&#x27;s not that easy to actually get rid of all the hair. Even while using it shaving my legs, there are still hairs left over or hairs that are too short to be pulled out. It probably gets 80% of the hair and only lasts a few days or so before you have to do it again. Not to mention, any epilator is very painful the first time. I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to get through it!! I will still use it but I expected it to do a better job.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase. Like all epilators this leads to ingrown hairs, so you have to be willing to exfoliate and moisturize regularly. As for this particular epilator, I disagree with a lot of the reviewers-- so long as you are in a well lit room, the built-in light is useful in illuminating the hairs.  The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does take several go-overs before all the hair is gone. As you use it more the hair tends to break off if you go too quickly, so I&#x27;ve had to go over and over the same spots really slowly to make sure all the hairs actually got tweezed. I have tried other brands and I&#x27;d say the $50 I spent on this was a get what you paid for deal.</li>
    <li> This first time I used it it hurt. The pain was bearable, but it was a discomfort. I hope the second time I use the tweezer attachment, it&#x27;ll not be as painful.    The shaving attachment is really good. I use it on my face. I recommend not tweezing your face! It caused me to bleed and I had a sensitive dark spot on my face for a few days. Guess I shouldn&#x27;t have done that.    But anyways, I would recommend this product. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great epilator. I&#x27;ve had one for over a year and it still works great. Easy to clean and use. A bit loud but I don&#x27;t see a way around that.</li>
    <li> I love this hair remover. It hurts just a little bit but I got used to it fast. I always use it on my legs, however, I have never used it under my arms. I think that might hurt more.</li>
    <li> After my old epilator died, I bought this one based on reviews and brand respect.  I don&#x27;t mind pain with epilation, I expect it, but this one is far worse than necessary.  The ingrown hairs were appalling and constant: with dark hair, I always had these terrible looking hairs growing under my skin.  I was so dissatisfied that I started researching other epilators and was directed to the Emjoi Optimax as a brand that caused less ingrowns.  Wow!  What a difference - I had let my legs recover from this Braun, loofahed until they were sore, then tried the Emjoi.  I could barely feel it, and couldn&#x27;t believe it was actually removing the hairs from the roots.  Where the Braun was constantly  snagging my underarm skin, the Optimax leaves it perfectly smooth.  The only good thing I can say about this item is that the light is helpful, but it isn&#x27;t enough to make me want to suffer through a Braun ever again. I honestly feel that the pain is so shocking that it causes the follicle to snap back and result in an ingrown hair when it grows back.  Don&#x27;t buy this one, go for the Emjoi and  toss out your loofah ~</li>
    <li> The caveat is that I am a mother of 3 and a fan of waxing.  It is nearly impossible for me to get to the salon for regular waxing, both in terms of time and money.  I thought, even if I use this product twice, it will cost less than a trip to the spa, and I can do one leg part at a time, as I have time.  Little did I know that I would fall in love with my Epilator.      After using the trimming attachment -- which is great in and of itself (my husband could use it to trim his sideburns) -- I started with the massaging head and the lower setting. It was a little loud at first, but, it did such a great job that it was not long before I was hunting down hairs and did not notice the sound.  By my second session, I was already using the regular head and the faster setting.  Soon, I was even brave enough to use it on my underarm hair.      You will be amazed at the amount of hair you have.  It gets the hairs you see, as well as many that you don&#x27;t.  You do have to stop it regularly to shake out the hairs, but no more than you would if you were waxing and had to change strips of cloth.  Also, because the hair comes out at the root, the little follicle can make the hair stick to the side of the head, but the brush is great for that. I have found that it&#x27;s best to put a small trash can on the counter and shake or brush the hairs out into there.  This helps to prevent a clog in the future (yes, it&#x27;s that much hair), or hairs clinging to the sink or toilet bowl.      A non-advertised feature is that it also exfoliates as it works.      I am very pleased with the X&#x27;elle Epilator, and glad that I went for the \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; product.  While I can&#x27;t say I can&#x27;t live without it, I will say, I&#x27;d certainly rather not.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Silk-epil for about 9 months now...and it does work as it states...but after using it I realized I would like to find another way of removing my leg/bikini area hair because while it works well at removing the hair, and does so consistently, I would rather have a hair removal method that doesn&#x27;t leave ingrown hair and red bumps (from the new hair growth).  The ingrown hairs are a nightmare for me and leave my thighs looking unsightly, where I don&#x27;t even wear shorts above the knee anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because hair growth is in stages, it is almost impossible to remove all of the hair on a leg, let&#x27;s say, and have it all come back at the same time to remove it again.  It&#x27;s like you have to use it every few days to remove the hair from your leg to keep it smooth.  I even stopped using this on my calves because it was easier and quicker for me to shave vs. the time spent to use this machine for the 2 +/- weeks of smooth skin I did get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking into more permanent methods of hair removal.</li>
    <li> Ok.  I read hundreds of epilator reviews before I purchased this Braun, so I knew that epilating is painful at first.  I have been plucking all areas of my body for years now, so I thought there might be a little bit of exaggerating going on.  Let me just say, this was one of the most painful experiences I have had.  It lasted beyond the first use too.  I finally noticed this morning, on my fourth use, that it was getting noticeably easier.  All previous uses left me with red bumps and splotches that lasted well over 24 hours.  The bumps would still be there the next day when I would go to epilate again.  Maybe because I have very coarse hair and very sensitive skin.  Yesterday, after the third use, I was really wondering if I was going to be able to continue (shaking, sweating, fight or flight response).  Today I am ecstatic that it was much easier and I am very pleased with the results.  The only problem I have had is around my kneecaps.  I haven&#x27;t figured out a position to get all of those hairs (leg straight, leg bent, etc.).  Obviously, this is my first epilator so I have no basis for comparison, but so far I am very pleased with the quality and performance.  You just have to be very determined, which I am.  I am already seeing an end to shaving every day.  It will only get better from here!</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilady for about 25 years (same one) and decided it was time for a new one (cord was getting worn on the old one).  The Braun seems to be working very well for me.  I had no redness or bumps because I had been using my old coil model on a regular basis.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have owned the original epilady since 1990!  It finally died on me and I was almost going to get another one.  I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews of different epilators and liked what I read about this one.  I heard the NO!NO!NO! really didn&#x27;t work and some of the other epilators were not great. I can say that this epilator is easy to use.  The epilady REALLY hurts but I got used to it.  The pain is nothing compared to the epilady.  I still get some ingrown hairs but it&#x27;s still not as much as the epilady.  It also takes less time to do my entire leg.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The epilator itself is VERY loud when turned on. This is the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.     When used, the pain level is very high! I have waxed my legs before, and do not find it painful, but I did find this very painful. However, in areas with less hair, the epilator does not hurt, rather it feels uncomfortable. That being said, the results ARE WORTH IT!!     If you can suffer through the pain, your legs will be hair free and smooth!! An advantage this epilator has over waxing, for example, is that you pay the price once, and are left with the convenient hair removal for as long as the epilator will work, thus saving money over time. Also, as another advantage, you can epilate at your convenience, in your home, or away on trips, rather than having to go to a salon.      Overall, I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great. The first time you use it, its a little uncomfortable, but after that its almost pain free. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this epilator. It is painful when you epilate but as others say I think I will get used to it as I use it..(Waxing is painful too). I love the shaver attachment, which helps me to trim the hair and then use the epilator attachment for easier epilation. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First of all, your hair should be long enough before you even attempt to use this...but even if your hair is the optimal length, I would say that this epilator will successfully pull out from the roots, at most, 60% of your hair. The rest it just cuts, similar to shaving, so regrowth time is comparable with shaving.     Another down side is the amount of ingrown hairs it gives me. I have tried waxing before with lasting results but because of my skin and leg hair type, I&#x27;ve always had problems with ingrowns. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I bought this with the belief that my ingrown hair problem would vanish magically. After all, the concept of pulling out hair from the root was the same with both.    All in all, it had the same problems of shaving and waxing (fast regrowth and ingrowns respectively), but to a slightly lesser degree. It takes longer than shaving but is quicker than at home waxing. For me, this is just an OK product. Expect no miracles.</li>
    <li> I have an older version of Remington and this one has a lot more tweezers and it&#x27;s faster. Plus it has more heads that can be used for massaging the skin while it shaves from the root. It hurts less than the other one I had. And I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s faster.</li>
    <li> This was my very first epilator. My sister-in-law suggested it as an alternative to waxing and shaving. I chose this one because it seemed less expensive than other models and had fairly positive reviews.     I found there to be nearly no pain with this epilator especially when you use the massaging head but how much pain you feel will depend on your own pain tolerance and where you are using it. My husband attempted to use this on a small patch of hair on his upper arms and found the process to be pure agony. The item instructions do state that it can be used on your bikini area. I highly advise against it. I tried it and I had very poor results. I found it easy to clean and use. I use it on both legs and both my lower arms.     The very first time I used it I thought to myself, \\&quot;Where has this thing been all my life?!?!\\&quot; My skin was left silky and buttery smooth. The gloss of the first use wore off quickly.     Most of the hair on my lower arms and thighs is the \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; sort of hair that is not really visible to the eye but can still be felt. This product does not do well with this sort of hair. Yes, it grabs the small fine hairs but it doesn&#x27;t rip them out, it snaps them close to the skin. With the peach fuzz hair you don&#x27;t get the stubble feeling when it grows back but it doesn&#x27;t stay silky smooth for weeks the way the product claims.     Unfortunately, I am also having this snapping problem on my lower legs where the hair is more coarse and it is creating a stubble feel in some areas. I&#x27;ve minimized this problem by going very slow and being very careful to maintain the 90 degree angle recommended in the instructions. The drawback with that is that it takes a very long time. Whether or not I&#x27;d have this problem with a different epilator, I don&#x27;t know. It may just be the way my hair is but I have not had breakage problems with traditional waxing. This breakage did happen even with the first usage when the hairs were the ideal 2-5mm length stated in the instruction manual. Another problem I have is that even with going very slowly, this product still misses hairs here and there.     Overall I think this product is just okay. I&#x27;d say that the amount of time I spend with the epilator is probably a little less than how much time I was spending shaving. I&#x27;m also using it on areas I wouldn&#x27;t normally shave (like my forearms). The bonus is that I&#x27;m at no risk of accidentally cutting myself and my husband doesn&#x27;t complain about me using his razors. I still have the product. I still use it but when it gives out I will probably purchase a different model from a different company and maybe spend a little more money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. If you are looking for an epilator then this one is best. Don&#x27;t think, just go for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun Silk-epil for years and I love it...I just ordered another one from [...] and it arrived even before the expected arrival day. Thanks!</li>
    <li> About 10 years ago, my husband bought me an Epi-Lady because that was what his mother used - I hated it! It hurt, it wasn&#x27;t intuitive and it REALLY hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does hurt when you first start using it but it&#x27;s not unbearable. When I started, I only did one leg at a time. Now, I can do them both in no time. The hair takes so long to grow back, it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are confusing so I just ignored them and figured it out on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product - especially for newbies.</li>
    <li> Check out the new Philips SatinPerfect Epilator.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at the results.  I received on by being a BzzAgent and am so thankful that I was introduced to it.  You&#x27;ll be surprised by the results of less hair in such a short period of time.  Don&#x27;t even worry about the pain because it&#x27;s as painless as it could possibly be for what the Philips SatinPerfect Epilator does.  With such a reputiable same as Philips, you already know that you&#x27;ll be getting a great product that is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was a regular epilator user. The previous model I had was of philips. That one was great too, but since I purchased it in UK, there was a voltage difference here. Moreover, it was kind of bulky with the ice attachment.   But this product is simply amazing. It definitely is less painful. What I loved most was the shaving attachment. If you are not in the mood for epilating, simply shave for now. Works great on all parts of the body. Have not tried it on the face though.   Would recommend any one trying epilating for the first time to use this product.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this product and she really likes it. She knew of this epilator from her sister and decided to get one. So I ordered it, and she&#x27;s loved using it ever since she got it in the mail Thanks Braun and thanks Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted one of these and then after she had hers a week and liked it, I decided to get one of my own. Using this for the first time hurts, there is no getting around it. When you have a leg full of hair, there is a lot to pull out. Just do what you can each day until you become accustomed to it. Then once you have all the hair removed on your legs, you will find that a touch up every few days is probably enough. Since hair growth is constant and at differing rates, this won&#x27;t produce a perfectly smooth result, but if you need it, then shave afterwards if you&#x27;re fussy about that. The hairs need to grow to a certain length for the tweezers to grab them.  Also, this gets my major, coarse hairs, but not the tiny, baby fine hairs. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you desire ultra-smooth legs for a special occasion, then you can epilate that day and then afterwards, shave.  For me, I like this product, since I hate messing around with the shaving process every day.  There is less stubble using the epilator. If you feel tiny bumps after epilating, that is where the hair was pulled out of the pore and it&#x27;s a little irritated and raised, but that will go down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now also epilate my underarms, being very careful and holding them taut. Using the bathroom mirror helps ensure I catch all the hairs. What&#x27;s nice about this, is that those black hair roots under the armpits don&#x27;t shows since they are pulled out entirely. The first few times you do this will be challenging, but after a while you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s a little pain for a lot of gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you skin is clean and dry first. Keep the epilator away from any loose clothing, threads, long hair or your socks.  You can also use a natural loofah and gently exfoliate so you don&#x27;t get ingrowns.  Do *not* apply lotion, since lotion will just make the hairs slippery and harder to grab. Technique tips: hair grows in various directions, so you will need to move the epilator up, and diagonally to get the best results. Choose your speed of preference, there is high and low - either works well. The light on it really helps see the hairs. If you have a private area with daylight, then that&#x27;s helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is important: with with brush included, or a separate, clean toothbrush (method I prefer). Unplug the unit first. Then remove the epilating head and brush clean. If you brush it well, it will remove dead skin debris and hair which clogs up the tiny tweezers. If you feel your epilator is not performing up to speed, it is probably because the little tweezers are clogged with skin cells and hair! Brush cleaning also lessens your epilating time and frustration, and prevents you having to go over &amp; over the same areas since it picks up more hair, faster. I actually thought I needed a new epilator, but proceeded to do a thorough cleaning and it epilates wonderfully again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is much handier than shaving.  I will always continue to epilate since I&#x27;ve had great results.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: May 2012 and still happy with it.s. Choose your speed of preference, there is high and low - either works well.

    <li> it works fine but doesn&#x27;t really get all the hair.  it does cause some ingrown hair at times.  i find that it hurts too much to use underarm (even though the pain of plucking individually doesn&#x27;t bother me). it&#x27;s good for the legs and arms.  i use it sometimes but went back to just shaving with a razor because it feels like less trouble.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator in preparation for my wedding--for which I have found myself doing all kinds of things I never bothered to do before. In terms of hair removal specifically, throughout my life I have tried shaving, plucking individual hairs (SOOO time-consuming), and waxing. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used an epilator, and I have to say, all things considered, I&#x27;m extremely pleased.    Being blonde, I have relatively light body hair, but I still find it quite irritating--especially in light of the fact that I will be spending the majority of the honeymoon in a bikini, and the idea of running back to the room to shave is not one that pleases me.    Probably the thing that most concerns people about the idea of an epilator is the potential for pain: I mean, what seems like a billion hairs at once will be simultaneously ripped out of your skin by the roots. Ouch. Considering, though, that that&#x27;s what happens with waxing anyway, I would say it feels about the same. Actually, on the legs, I would say it hurt less.    I did take advice I read beforehand, though, and used it on legs I waxed relatively recently--so the volume of hairs there was relatively low. Even so, I would liken it to the feeling you get when an electric shaver accidentally grazes your skin. I did NOT use the provided cooling glove.    On the UNDERARMS, however, I experienced the greatest, most cripplingly unholy pain I have ever experienced in my life. The only thing that I can think of that even comes close is getting pierced--with a needle, not that stupid gun at the mall. It&#x27;s that same stomach-dropping, light-headed, don&#x27;t-forget-to-breathe-or-you-might-faint all-consuming-death pain. (Incidentally, I am a big baby with things like this--I just do them anyway.) Seriously, I had to keep checking to make sure it was just the hair--not tattered pieces of flesh--being ripped off. (For those of you wondering, no, I have never given birth, so that may very well be worse--but I DID find myselfneeding to employ everything I have ever seen on TV about breathing through the pain.)    Because of this, I skipped the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head (which hurt just as much but accomplished far less in the same time), and went straight to full power with the advanced head to get it all over with ASAP. BUT, now my underarms are delightfully hair-free!    SO, in conclusion, I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to win the war on annoying body hair. IT REALLY WORKS, removing hairs I could barely even see, and the little light is awesome.    I would also recommend that, if you are worried about the pain, you take some VERY deep breaths and begin with the underarms...because next to that, legs, and yes, even bikini area, seem downright pleasant. :) Good luck!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item recently.  I had not tried epilation previously to this purchase, and I&#x27;d only been to the salon for waxing once.  I shave irregularly so I wanted to give epilation a try.  I&#x27;ve never found tweezing hairs to be particularly painful, so I expected minimal pain from epilation.  On the advice of a friend, I shaved prior to the first epilation and made sure my skin was warm and dry.  It wasn&#x27;t painful at all except a few place under the arm and of course the bikini area.  I plan to use it daily for 7-10 days to get a good start - I think if I keep up with it, it won&#x27;t be painful at all.  Highly recommend unless waxing/plucking is very painful for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only desire is for a cordless version that&#x27;s quieter.  I understand that Braun makes another model with those features, so if I like epilating, I might upgrade to that model.  Excellent product overall.</li>
    <li> I used to have terrible itching from shaving my legs, and this product has finally put at end to it.</li>
    <li> Five years ago I bought the Braun 2170 Silk Epil (a white and yellow epilator in a silver mesh zippered bag)which was a revelation compared to the wire-coil Epilady that I had before, much less painful although it did not make the process notably quicker.  However after 5 years of monthly use I thought it was getting slow, and wanted to check out a newer model, Braun 5270 Selk-epil X&#x27;elle, thinking it would be even better.  I must say I am dissapointed.  Somehow the new model is more painful and does not appear any more efficient than the older model.  I have no use for the trimmer attachment, and the plastic sack packaging is not as nice.  So I am back to using the older model as long as it lasts, and will keep the newer model as a backup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years.  eventhough I&#x27;ve never professionally learned how to wax, I&#x27;ve learnt on the job, and I thought it would be the same with the epilator.  I found it to be easy to use, but it&#x27;s extremely painful, and my hair grew back a week later, where as with the waxing, it was much less painful, and it doesn&#x27;t grow back for at least three weeks.  really not worth starting with it.</li>
    <li> I had a previous epilator (Philips) and this one is 100 times better! Almost no noise, the head system is much more efficient, I don&#x27;t feel any pain at the legs anymore and just a little bit underarms. Plus the light is really helpful. The bikini area always hurt (but that&#x27;s something inevitable!), but the shaving head is wonderful for the rest in this area. I totally recommend this epilator! Please keep in mind that if this will be your first time, it&#x27;s not easy and it does hurt, but you should be persistent since it gets better with time. Shaving is not good and waxing is too expensive, using the epilator is really the best option!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS EPILATOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO AND IT WORKED FINE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT THEN I USED IT AGAIN AND THE POWER JUST KEPT TURNING OFF</li>
    <li> This epilator works extremely well and I am very satisfied with it. I would recommend this model to anyone considering purchasing an epilator. The service I recieved from Amazon was timely and professional. As usual I am very happy with my dealings with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was trying to decide if I wanted to purchase a wet/dry shaver or the silk-epil.  Of course after reading all of the great reviews I decided on the silk epil.  Mostly because with an epilator, the results last much longer.      All of the gadgets are great.  Be sure you clean the mini tweezers after each use.  I used it the day after Christmas and didn&#x27;t have to use it again until almost 3 weeks later.  I used the Silk-epil for my legs and underarms.  Leaves your legs very smooth with very little to no stubble!  The pain is almost nothing really.  At first it&#x27;s a little intimidating and stings just a tiny bit but really, it&#x27;s nothing to cry about at all.  Be sure you push down hard enough to grip the hairs.    The trimmer attachments work well too!    I highly recommend the Silk-epil above any other razor!  Here are my pros and cons:    Pros:  Long lasting results  Easy clean up  Long cord    Cons:  Not cordless  A little loud</li>
    <li> I have very pale, sensitive skin with thick black body hair. My skin is so translucent, you can see the black hair under it even when I&#x27;m clean shaven. My skin is also sensitive, so waxing left my legs bruised and swollen. I had about given up on wearing shorts or short sleeves, let alone bathing suits.    I had never even heard of an epilator until I found it on Amazon. This one had great reviews, so I ordered it. I am so happy I did.    Yes, it hurts the first time. I&#x27;ve just been doing small areas at a time. I&#x27;ve completed my arms, my legs below the knee, and I&#x27;m starting on my thighs today. I&#x27;ve gone over my arms multiple times now, and the pain has turned into slight discomfort, nothing unmanageable. Plus, the discomfort goes away in minutes. I love being able to feel comfortable in my pale skin, as it has never looked so good!    Also, I expected to be dealing with ingrown hairs and some bruising, but I have yet to experience either with this.    If you live in a cold place like I do, I recommend ordering this product before the warm weather starts. That way, you can take it slow and adjust your skin while you can still cover up. The popular review that recommends the tips and tricks for better epilation is spot on. Take her advice and this product will work beautifully for you, too.    I&#x27;m off to browse cute bathing suits :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it once a week on my legs and wait for it . . . my armpits.  The thing is that you do really have to be able to deal with some PAIN.  This is a product that litterally pulls out the hair, don&#x27;t be decived, that&#x27;s what it does and that&#x27;s what it feels like.  Using it on your legs gets to be pretty natural though, dosen&#x27;t hurt so bad after a few uses you kinda get over it.  But on the armpits it kills everytime.  But it does leave your skin feeling soft and hair free, no stubble, so for me it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cost, I would buy it again in a second.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job... Tried it on my legs and did a fantastic job! Couldnt get it to work on my face due to large head... underarms were too painful... Will stick to my hands and legs with this...</li>
    <li> This epilator is everything the reviewers said it would be. when it first pulls out hair, it is painful but bearable. After the first time, there is no pain and the hair is very slow coming back. For a woman like myself with light skin and dark hair, this epilator is a dream come true.</li>
    <li> I own an older version of the Braun epilator which I have had for 11 years now and still works like a charm,  but I purchased this in the US after after moving there: it is fantastic, I was so pleased with my first one that I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this brand had the most positive reviews on amazon. The new one is quieter and lighter and I am loving it!  Highly recommend it, the only thing I am not sure is why the price keeps going up...but hopefully I won&#x27;t need to buy another one for at least another decade or more so definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The positives have all been stated, so I&#x27;m gonna go with the negatives:  1. it&#x27;s really really loud  2. It&#x27;s difficult to clean  3. Lots of little parts are difficult to keep track of  4. One of the plastic parts already broke, but totally still usable</li>
    <li> finally found the american version as my european version doesnt work well and thus wasn&#x27;t in use anymore. this new version is great with razing and epilating options and the light. i love not having to shave my legs so often anymore and having smooth legs still... pain factor for me... hardly any, but I guess cause I was used to it quite a few years ago. luckily it hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an epilator in the past, it was so painful that I was only able to do a 2 inch patch on my leg.  After reading the reviews I decided to give this machine a try.  It was wonderful!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does hurt, but much more bearable to do my bikini area, and both legs, not bad for my first try.  I usually don&#x27;t review products, but this one had me running to the computer to share my experience.</li>
    <li> The Braun Silk Epi is the BEST epilator EVER! Granted, it stings a bit, but not like the epilators of the past. My legs and underarms are silky smooth, and I was told, simply irresistable!</li>
    <li> I was real xcited 2 receive this item n try it out.. i tried usind it different times and giving it a chance but I couldn&#x27;t take the pain.. not worth what I pay!</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 months ago. I love this device and I wish I knew about it sooner. This would have saved me so much time and grief over the years. I am a light skinned woman with very coarse dark body hair so if this product can work for me, it can work for anyone.    Like others said, it is very painful for the first time on an area but the pain decreases the more you use it. I followed the directions and took a long bath and shaved the day before so that the hair was not too long.     The key to using it on an area for the first time is to do small sections of an area or the whole area everyday for a week so that you pick up missed hairs, new growth, and  the areas that have not been epilated as yet. This helps to build your pain tolerance and results in less and less stubble everyday until eventually you are smooth.    I tried it on my legs, under my chin and my  underarms. The underarms were extremely painful but I did small sections everyday with the beginner&#x27;s head until I got the whole area and now I am able to epilate using the advanced head with a very slight discomfort.    I am trying to work my way to doing the bikini area. The hardest part is getting past the pain. I think the key to success with this product is patience. You are not going to have perfectly smooth skin the first time you use it and I think that&#x27;s why some people were disappointed and gave it a poor review. But after a few uses,  you will see a big difference. Think of it as retraining your hair. Hope my review helped.</li>
    <li> The light is definitely the best feature, and I love that it comes with a razor head too for when I&#x27;m running late and need a quick touch up. Also it&#x27;s great for the bikini line. The cord is a good length so it doesn&#x27;t really bother me that it&#x27;s not cordless - though I hope they do make a new cordless model because that would be more convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and love it. I found that it is not as painful as I anticipated and after using for short durations for 3 days in a row, my legs are very smooth.  I am excited about not having to shave daily as I have coarse dark hair which grows quickly and shaving daily was a must. I did NOT shave for 3 days prior to using the product so that hair was longer and more easily removed. The light feature is also very helpful. This will greatly reduce my shower time in the mornings and especially will be helpful when traveling as will not have to carry supplies. I did use it around the bikini line but not underarm at this time.    DMC in South Carolina</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I have been using it a little over a month now and I am pretty much immune to the pain and the hairs are already growing back much slower and thinner. I did get bumps after the first time or two I used the product, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any since. The light is definitely a necessity as the hairs are already harder to see with the naked eye.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it does hurt a little (and a lot in some locations) the first few times you use it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good machine ! I tell you, this is the one ! It hurts a little bit and that&#x27;s normal because all machines do.  I really like it and it has a light that really helps seeing all the hairs. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hi this is suesue i did order a braun 5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle.Before i order this machina i kept thinging what this machina about is it going to work with me or just spend some money like everytime i do.I kept waitting 7day 2get this machina,so when i got it i start to look at it and say oh myabe it won&#x27;t work or it won&#x27;t remove my hair like what i want it.I start to clean my legs and to see if it work or no. Finaly i looked at the hair it start remove them form inside. I start to like it and i won&#x27;t use anything after it.So for every women who comes to this website and see that machina i will tell u all dont ever think about it just gohad and buy it bec when i came to this website and i saw that machina i was thinking 2much before i buy it,but now i cant live with out braun5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle bec it saved me alot of money and changed my life,so don&#x27;t think 2much like what i did just buy it rightaway, and thx to Amazon company for this machine</li>
    <li> Before buying this product I read all the reviews on Amazon and the theme was basically the same. It hurts like hell the first time you try it but it is worth every penny. The first time I used the epilator it took me about half an hour a leg. I almost gave up, however the second time was less painful and the third time was like normal. It&#x27;s a similar thing with waxing, but in the end it really is worth the initial pain</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! Using it for about 6 months now and it still works like the first time. WAY better than shaving! I have thick hair, so shaving everyday was impossible for me. After using it hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for 3 weeks on my legs and arms. I also use it for facial hair once a week. I think because my facial hair is thinner and obviously smaller, it doesn&#x27;t pick up on all the hairs at once requiring more frequent use. Yes there is still some pain, but not as bad anymore. I do use a topical numbing cream for my thighs though, just can&#x27;t seem to get use to that yet. On days I am in a rush I have used the trimmer/shaver part and was really impressed with how close a shave it gave me. Like I said before I do have thick hair so typical shavers have always left me with stubble; no stubble, felt just like shaving with a razor, with none of the razor burn. Told all my friends about it and will even be buying one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I have never epilated or waxed before and primarily bought this for my arms.  I was surprised at how much it hurt.  There hasn&#x27;t been enough time for regrowth so I don&#x27;t know if I will experience the ingrown hair issues that other reviewers have.  After the initial shock at the pain, I tried it on my legs, where it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much for some reason.  I&#x27;m not sure if the vibrating rollers are any good for dulling the pain but the light is definitely useful - especially on the back of your legs.  After my legs, I decided to go crazy and try my underarms.  YEEEOOOOWWWW!  That&#x27;s soooo never happening again!  But I do recommend it for arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works as well as all the reviews say. Doesn&#x27;t hurt not nearly as much as our old epilator. It&#x27;s fast and picks-up most of the the small and fine hairs. And the light is really useful, even in a well lit room.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am glad I purchased it.  Now I can wax at my free will. Dont need to go to a beauty parlour for this.</li>
    <li> I read so many good reviews on this product that I decided to try it. The first time I used it I could only do half a leg with the started head attachment and on low speed; My God, it Hurt!!! The next day I tried the rest of that one leg and the other one (sounds like I am an octopus) and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the first day. By the time I finished I was using the more advance head attachment. So, yes, it hurts at first but once you get a hang of it, is not that bad.  The hairs do not grow back as quick as they do when you shave and they come back thinner.  Those of us who shave (or used to) know that once the hairs start growing back, they all come out at once and even all around, well with this epilator they do not. You will not get a leg full of hairs in 2 days, but a few hairs here and there in about 5 days or so.   Overall, I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I have very dark hair and pale skin, so even when I shaved my legs, I&#x27;d be left with black stubble you could see through my skin.  It was horrible!  I&#x27;ve tried a million different things to try and get rid of my hair, and have been saving up for laser treatments.  In the meantime though, the Braun epilator has been a god-send.    It pulls up my hair, including the black \\&quot;roots\\&quot; that get left behind when I shave, so that my legs look and feel smooth for at least a week (often more!).  Moreover, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has been growing back thinner after I&#x27;ve started to use the epilator (though I still have lots of it).    The machine itself is simple to use.  I don&#x27;t use it anywhere other than my legs though.  I tried it ONCE on my under arms, and it pinched my skin and was incredibly painful.  So, I never repeated that again.     The only negative, as far as my legs, has been the ingrown hairs.  As others have notes, this does happen.  I have to exfoliate my legs really, really well after using the epilator, particularly around day 3 or I&#x27;ll get massive red bumps and a leg full of ingrown hairs.  And, even if I keep up with my exfoliation, one or two end up ingrown no matter what.      Oh well.  Honestly?  It&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay for otherwise smooth legs.</li>
    <li> I bought this item from Amazon about 2 years ago and I am still using it. Yes, it hurts. But it is pretty quick, affordable, and convenient compared to waxing. Use it on the areas that can withstand the pain. I find that the more often you epilate the area the less it hurts. Use it even when it seems too early to need to do it again. It helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve had this product for a long time now, and realized I never gave it a review!  I don&#x60;t know how much help I can be for other buyers, but I for one am very satisfied.  All the separate attachments are very useful, and the light is pretty bright to be able to see fine hair.   Epilators.. of course it hurts, but this product wont get locked or tug slowely, so I think its a product I feel is &#x60;quick-n-go&#x60;!   I recommended this to my friend, and she likes it too!</li>
    <li> First, it is no secret that epilating &#x3D; ouch!!!  But as others have suggested, a warm bath to soften the hair shaft and follicle (and for you to relax, haha), plus a few ibuprofen an hour or so before you actually use the epilator can really lessen the blow.     As far as results go, my legs were not really as smooth as they are after I use a razor with shave gel; however, using the epilator a few times per month really reduced how often I had to shave, which is nice. I will really take anything that ultimately makes being a lady less of a hassle:)    Now onto the more sensitive bits:  I have waxed the southern region  (though not totally bare) for many years but wanted to try the epilator to save money and trips to the salon.  Believe me when I say it can be done (but not recommended for the faint of heart, or for the inexperienced), but again, it will not leave results as smooth as the waxing does.  I also found myself having to tweeze hairs the epilator seemed to keep skimming over.    Overall not a perfect product, but it certainly is helpful so long as your expectations are set right.</li>
    <li> OK, so you ARE pulling hair out by root and it doesn&#x27;t work well on household pets, but it does a great job on my legs.</li>
    <li> this epilator is a nice one..i m using this for the first time...it does not remove hair in one stroke, like wax..machine needs to be run over the same area twice or thrice..but still it is less messy than waxing..doesnt hurt much..overall i like this epilator</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It works great!! My wife and daughter use it. Easy to use and cheap. A must buy for girls and women.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, this thing hurts LIKE A MOFO and is loud. That being said, this and the gentler pink model are the only epilators I have ever liked and do a great job yanking most of the hairs out. In my opinion, Braun epilators are worth putting up with the extra noise as I feel they do a more thorough job.</li>
    <li> I can only say it is Awesome! I wish I knew it sooner. it has pain but it worth it alot. Your skin stays very smooth and the grow of hair is less and less each time you use it. I will give this item A++++++</li>
    <li> i bought this with really high hopes, and i was highly disappointed.  I&#x27;m really sensitive to pain but i read a review that said it barely hurt at all so i tried it.  OWCH.  i cried while i was doing this it hurt so bad!  I don&#x27;t think that waxing is too awful but this thing was one of the most painful experiences of my life!  i tried it on my lower calve and it got maybe 3 or 4 hairs and that was it.  i kept going over and over but it would only get about 3 every stroke.  it was a waste of time and money and it really hurt!  i don&#x27;t normally listen to reviews like this but trust me it&#x27;s awful!</li>
    <li> The product is great. Arrived on time, in perfect condition . what i particularly liked about it is that you can use it in and outside USA because of its voltage. One disadvantage is that it doesn&#x27;t have a nice small bag or case to put it in and take it in your handbag wherever you go (which is available in other models of BRAUN).</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I used to work in a salon, so I had originally intended to get a waxing setup, but after reading reviews I decided to give it a try. And I am very glad I did. It works every bit as well as wax without the mess! My underarms have never been smoother!   In terms of pain, it is definitely a different sensation than waxing, but I don&#x27;t think it was worse. I found that keeping the skin taught helped. When doing my lady area, holding my breath helped too. However, if you can&#x27;t stand the pain of waxing, you probably won&#x27;t be able to stand this.  I am very glad I bought this. It is quick, clean and portable, all the things that waxing is not. :)</li>
    <li> Simple to use. First pass somewhat painful. Takes lots of hair in very short amount of time. The rest of the process isn&#x27;t very painful but even if it was it is worth it. Looks and feels amazing. Love my skin :D</li>
    <li> This thing works well.    Unfortunately, I am one that cannot handle the pain!  Please come out with topical pain killer.  Then, I will use this thing EVERYWHERE.  Perhaps, with a beginner head, it would be less painful?  Let me know if they come out with topical pain killers, and I will dust this baby off...    Hopefully, you all have better luck!    My sister liked the shaving head, but I never was big on electronic shavers since they do not shave as close as a razor.  So I cannot give a judgement on that.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; to epilating. I was tired of the high cost of razors and wanted something that lasted longer, was more cost effective and less messy than waxing or chemical hair removers. I got every penny&#x27;s worth and more. I love my epilator!!!!!!!! I wish I had discovered this years ago. While initially it&#x27;s more time consuming to do than shaving, it&#x27;s well worth it in the long run.    I&#x27;ll list the pros and cons, then go thru a summary of my experience/opinion for you.  Areas used on- Primarily legs and occasionally bikini &amp; underarm (the tweezer head on this model imo is too large to use on the face-for those areas I recommend the smaller model by Emjoi called EpiSlim)    Pros:    -Light to illuminate hairs-this is a godsend.  -Multiple Speeds  -Comfortable to hold  -Easy to use  -Multiple guide covers   -Shaver attachment  -Really does what is claims with slowing regrowth and lasting results (although that will vary per person)    Cons:    -Rotation of the tweezer head cylinder will PINCH (only certain areas) IF the skin is not pulled \\&quot;really\\&quot; tight (only in the loose and/or tender skin areas)  -Mild to Mod Pain (first time is very unpleasant, but it gets less uncomfortable each time &amp; I have a low tolerance for pain)  -Occasionally misses hairs (only if your not slow and thorough enough, going against the hair growth or pulling the skin tight enough-basically, if you don&#x27;t following directions)  -Loud running sound/noise      Features would Like to see added:    3 Speeds instead of 2  Brighter LED light      I&#x27;ll address the complaints most ppl had in other reviews from my own experience and perspective.  In regard to:    Pain-----as I said, it gets less so each time you do it-well worth the results    Ingrown hairs and bumps------all forms of hair removal from shaving to waxing can cause ingrown hairs/bumps if the area is not regularly and properly exfoliated and moisturized before and after.    Time---initially, yes it takes much longer, butthe results LAST much longer too.     Missed hairs &amp; random strays growing back in---This is a given with any form of hair removal esp since nothing is 100% totally effective and hair grows at different rates.    Summary:    If used properly, this device does what it claims and is well worth the cost and time.  I highly recommend it. I won&#x27;t ever go back to shaving again!</li>
    <li> I was so intimidated by all these reviews. When I turned it on, it sounded so painful. I felt no pain at all! It was just a prickly feeling. I&#x27;ve never waxed before, but I naired. Maybe the nair makes the root weaker? I&#x27;ve noticed that after using nair, the hair that grows out is really easy to pluck. There was a bunch of red dots afterwards, but went away quickly. After using it, my legs weren&#x27;t smooth, but they did look hairless. I&#x27;m guessing it snapped the hair off at the end or that it missed the shorter hairs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this thing for a while now and I&#x27;m impressed.  There&#x27;s not much pain when I use it on my legs.  It&#x27;s pretty intense under the arms though.  I think I&#x27;m getting used to it.  I think it&#x27;s worth it though because it&#x27;s so smooth when finished and it lasts for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> If you are used to waxing no problems.  It takes some time to get used to it but worth it for the results.  I did a lot of research and this is one of the few Epilator you can you for bikini and works awesome.</li>
    <li> This epilator does a very good job, even with the finer hairs.  As other reviews stated, it does hurt quite a bit in \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas for the first few weeks.  I found it to just tickle my legs; no discomfort there.  It&#x27;s wonderful to have legs that stay smoothe more than 12 hours!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you are considering an epilator.</li>
    <li> I read most reviews for this product and thought it was a safe bet... I have used a Phillips Satinelle epilator before and it worked great for me (until it died)... i would use the epilator for my hands and shaver head for legs as i couldn&#x27;t bear the epilation pain on my legs...i didn&#x27;t find this product to match up to what i was expecting, which was something better than the Phillips experience... the epilator didn&#x27;t cause more pain nor less than the phillips... the result was also not anything different or better ...what caused the worst disappointment for me was the shaver head... phillips left my legs feeling silky smooth after a shave no matter how long or short the hair on my legs was whereas braun just didn&#x27;t do the job... it left tiny hair all over my legs and i was forced to epilate them too inspite of all the pain...ingrown hair seems another problem, i don&#x27;t remember so much ingrown hair from my earlier epilation experiences... in short, i regretted going in for something i had never used when i could have chosen a product that i well liked...</li>
    <li> This is a very good epilator for the price.   I have been using epilators for about 15 years now and this one works well.   I would reccommend it to anyone who wants to remove leg hair and have much smoother results than you get from shaving without the razor stubble as well.   Also, it really only hurts the first time, if you use it on a regular basis.   The only issue is that if your hair is coarse the high speed setting does not work well and it is slightly noisy.</li>
    <li> Very painful to use at first - but the hair does grow back a lot slower than other do-it-yourself methods.</li>
    <li> I have been using an Emjoi (Smarter Image) epilator for years, and although it worked, I would always think I got all the hairs, until I was outside in daylight!  Very annoying!  As soon as I tried this epilator, I could tell it worked SO much better!  It truly was like getting a high quality, suped up sports model after using something you didn&#x27;t realize was bad because you had nothing else to compare it to~and the light is exactly what I needed to avoid missing stray hairs.  However, that said, there are much fewer missed hairs because this model is so good at epilating!  Win-win situation.  You&#x27;re probably wondering why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars:  maybe it can work a little TOO well, as it grabbed my skin and bruised me a couple of times on more delicate areas.  I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll learn how to avoid that happening as I continue to use it.  I&#x27;m happy I bought this product, it does a good job, leaves smooth skin.</li>
    <li> First, the truth. It hurts, especially using at the area under arms and bikini lines.   I went to SPA to remove hairs few time so the hair has loosen and easy to be removed using this device. The needle rolling front actually help earse the pain because it pinched the skin around the hair before the hair been removed.  The result is goood good good. My legs looks great.  I will suggest the first time user to have their hair removed at SPA first, then when some of hair just start to grow back, you can use this device to remove it easily and much less pain.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase.  I had already been told how painful using the epilator was before I bought it.  I thought I was prepared for the pain the first time I used the epilator; the pain was shockingly awful!!!!  I almost regreted buying it.  However, after having used it four times I can tolerate the pain much better.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using an epilator, so I was a bit intimidated by it.  It&#x27;s really loud and scary sounding, but it works pretty well.  The light is a really useful tool.  The pain didn&#x27;t bother me since I was already used to plucking my hairs, but I could see how it may be painful to people.  It comes with two speeds, various heads and a cleaning brush.  It also has a little bag to store everything in.  My only problem with it is that I get impatient (or I just have crazy hairs), so if there hair isn&#x27;t long enough, it has trouble removing all of them.  Sometimes it seems as if it&#x27;s breaking the hair off, rather than actually pulling it out by the root, but maybe I have bad technique.  I wish it didn&#x27;t have a plug and operated on batteries, bc having to plug it in to use it makes me lazy.  Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and would recommend it if epilat-ing is your thing.</li>
    <li> The Braun 5270 works just as the ads say it does.  The light is a great feature and I am very satisfied with it.  Be sure you read up on this subject before trying it but if you decide to try it, you will be very happy with this product.  I got interested in one when my daughter came back from Paris announcing that another reason they thought us Americans were crazy was b/c we shave our legs.  I did some research into eliplating and find that if you go into it with your eyes open, it is a great way to go.  Painful the first couple of uses but worth it.  I save tons of time not having to shave my legs and bikini line.  Only drawback is ingrown hairs but that can be minimized by exfoliating your skin with a long soak in the tub and a good loofah scrub.</li>
    <li> I have been Silk-epil user for 10 years now so have seen all their models but this one is the best ever. I love the increased number of tweezers..means more hair removal in less time &amp; with less pain, also the light is great, actually helps see the shorter hair. It&#x27;s definitely way lighter than the older models &amp; somehow pain-free, love the product but DON&#x27;T buy it from AMAZON.     The product condition was quoted to be \\&quot;new\\&quot; but Amazon.com send me a USED one or probably was a customer return. In any case, the box was already opened when I got it, 2-3 scratches on the machine...worst part...there were some hair stuck in the tweezer head &amp; that&#x27;s when i knew it was used! I have never had this bad experience with Amazon before but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying from this site again, Plus the product is available at a no. of other places. Goto the official site &amp; it will show you where you can buy it from.</li>
    <li> I have dark coarse hair and have been using this for the past year and a half. I only need to epilate once a week - maybe one touch-up in between if needed - regrowth is soft and barely noticeable. So glad to not have to shave every day.</li>
    <li> Decades ago (and I do think it was that long ago) I tried a friend&#x27;s epilator that was something with a coil that reminded one of razor wire.  Anyway, that thing was impossible and horribly painful!  The Braun is a breeze.  Granted, the first go around takes some courage (maybe even the liquid kind), but after that it&#x27;s actually fun b/c if you do it often enough you&#x27;re only pulling a few hairs here and there.  I actually use it daily (even though weekly would be fine) during the time my computer is booting up or waiting for a file to download--a great way to pass time when you&#x27;re waiting around anyway.    Places I wouldn&#x27;t even think of shaving b/c of inconvenience or just not wanting to have even *more* areas to maintain via shaving (thighs, toes) I now have cleared down to unbelievable smoothness, and they stay that way much longer than shaving.    The one gotcha:  in-grown hairs.  Be ready to have a good pair of good tweezers to fish out in-grown hairs.  They have not been a serious problem, and maybe if i used lotion more often it would not be an issue, but just lightly pulling on them with tweezers before I use the Braun helps.</li>
    <li> I have used other electric epilators through the years so I am used to the slight pull as the hairs are removed from my legs &amp; thighs. This one in particular is wonderful--not very much pulling at all and it has two speeds--the slower is very good over the knees.It is very efficient at removing all the hair. I personally do not use it on my underarms so cannot comment on that use.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with using an epilator. I normally wax my thighs and bikini area myself with minimal pain, so I thought epilation would be an easier and less expensive option to using wax strips. I thought I was a pretty tough chick, being able to do my own waxing. Boy was I wrong! This thing is incredibly painful to use. I have tried to use it on multiple body parts, while following all of the instructions, such as making sure the hair is the appropriate length, and holding it at the right angle. I even tried using it after a long steamy shower. I will continue to keep trying to get used to the pain, im hoping maybe it&#x27;ll get better as other reviewers have said. Although, I&#x27;m unable to compare it to any other epilator, I think it does a very good job of doing what it is made for, and that is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that the reviews said you could hardly feel anything, i felt EVERYTHING! I do not get regular waxing done, so maybe that&#x27;s a prerequisite. After a couple of really solid attempts and a lot of screaming i gave it up. If you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like pain this might not be a product for you. Plus it left ugly red bumps on my legs that did not go away after a couple of days. I did use the shaver portion for about 9 months, but then that broke and now it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
    <li> Ordered this about 6 weeks ago and I could not be happier.  I read many reviews and decided to give it a try seeing as I could not afford laser at the present time, and I have been more than satisfied.  This is the lowest price I have found for this model and if/when my epilator quits I will buy this one again.  I was concered about the pain factor, but have found it to be no more painful than waxing, I will say the lower leg has been the least painful in my experience.  Underarms is a breeze, not as bad as the reviews I have read.  I think the thicker and deeper rooted the hair the more discomfort is experienced.  All in all, worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I got this one while ago and am soooo happy with it. Now, whenever one of my girlfriends is having B-day i get them Braun epilator as a present. They are thrill!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products in this category, laser removal, waxing (hot &amp; cold), electric shaving and this little wonder I find does a better job than any of them.  Each of the different attachments work well for different areas.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey when you think abut the cost of a razor, but it&#x27;s well worth the investment.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome, I have no idea why I was using a razor for so many years. It slightly painful the first few times but it&#x27;s better than the razor cuts. I defenitely recommend ladies who are thinking it&#x27;s kinda expensive do I really need it, just go for it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing! Yes, it hurts, but as others have said, within a few minutes your skin is somewhat numb to it. I was able to do both my legs (to knees only) within 30 minutes. In the days following I did some touch up for the finer hairs that it missed. And, don&#x27;t forget that not all hair grows at the same rate. Overall, this does a better job than any professional wax I&#x27;ve ever had.  One recommendation I have for Braun is to somehow find a way to capture the hair as it epilates it. I found that my hair was all over the bathroom floor.</li>
    <li> I am shocked.  You can definitely feel it, but it&#x27;s not painful at all on my legs.  Definitely no worse than using a slightly dull razor.  I am sure using it on other areas of my body will probably be more painful, but on my legs it was fine.  I think the key is making sure your hair is shortish.  Oh, and I have course, dark, thick hair.  Waxing and sugaring are painful.    My only criticism is that it has to be plugged in to use- I think for the price paid it should be rechargeable.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s four stars and not five :) .</li>
    <li> I bought this item almost 2 months back but I just used it once till now. It really does its job well. I really felt good after using it. But there is one thing that I thought wasn&#x27;t exactly true. I read the description about this before buying it and it was mentioned somewhere that it works in such a way that it will take 4 weeks for you to use it again. But its is not really true - atleast in my case. Guess if you use it twice a month it will really solve the purpose. On the whole the product is worth buying and easy to use. I would suggest to buy this item.</li>
    <li> I owned Philips epilator before, and I liked it a lot. It was very efficient, plucked everything at one or two attempts, no need to go over one area many times. This one is not so efficient, I have to go over one area for 4, 5 times (learned to be patient). Guess these tweezers are not strong enough, sometimes they kind of pull, but not pluck. The \\&quot;more efficient\\&quot; head I didn&#x27;t like, my skin gets a rash if I use it. So I stick with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; one. Takes longer than with my older Philips, but the result is acceptable. The little light is a convenient feature though, very helpful. On the whole, not a bad product.</li>
    <li> I had tried \\&quot;Epilady\\&quot; many years ago, and this ISN&#x27;T IT... thank goodness !!  I was so tired of shaving, the very next day to have stubble... it was frustrating.   Waxing is a lot of work.    I have been using this product for close to two years.   I use it at least twice a week.  The best part is there is no more hard stubble.   It seems like the hair is softer, and less.  Sometimes the hair can grow under the skin, but using a loafa helps.   I think based on others reviews I might be better off using it daily.   But it really does the job.  I only use it on the legs, under arms were just too painful.    I use the brush to clean it and it has worked fine.  I would buy it again.  And will when mine gives out.</li>
    <li> I have used an Emjoi epilator in the past. I thought that one was pretty good until I bought the Braun. I replaced my Emjoi with the Braun after using it for about 7 or so years. The Braun by FAR out does the Emjoi. The little light is a super plus. It helps to see the hairs I missed. The extra attatchments are really nice. I dont think that using an epilator hurts but then again I have been using one for about 10 yrs now. The Braun really gets all the hairs. I would not how ever use it on my bikini or arm pit area as that is WAY to sensitive for me. All and all this was a really good purchace and I highly recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the recommendation from a friend.  I have waxed my legs for 15 years and was starting to get annoyed at the difficulty in finding quality wax for a decent price.  I use this device once per week and it keeps my legs hair free!  Note: you have to go over the same area few times-- once through does not get all the hair.  I also tried it on my bikini line.  It hurts but works well for a  quick bathing suit job.  I still plan to get my bikini line waxed as I can&#x27;t get to all the areas with the braun.  I recommend it to anyone who has been waxing!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face the facts: hair removal which is done by yanking hurts whether you wax or use a machine.  After years of messy waxing, I bought one of these.  Yes, it hurts, but I was already signed up for that when I bought it.  I love this appliance because I don&#x27;t have to replenish expendables such as wax, tongue depressors, or strips, so it is only a one-time expense.  I don&#x27;t have to heat it up and risk burning myself.  I don&#x27;t have to clean up after I use it.  I just stick it back in the drawer.      This particular model is great because it has a light, which is helpful to illuminate those fine, elusive hairs.  It comes with a shaver for those faint at heart when it comes to underarm epilation.  Because applying pressure after hair removal reduces pain (somewhat), the pressure rollers on the tweezer head help (a little).</li>
    <li> I decided to splurge out on the Braun Silk-Epil X&#x27;elle 5270 after reading a whop-load of reviews, mostly positive.    I have tried 3 other epilators: an Emjoy, a Remmington and another Braun model. Since two of these were purchased second hand online, I opted to try a brand new Epilator, a bit on the pricer side, so see if there was any difference.    So far, I&#x27;m quite impressed. I find this model is a lot quicker at epilating, it grabs the hairs nicely and gets the really short ones no problems.  With all of the epilators I&#x27;ve tried, I need to epilate every few days, as my hair must grow at a faster rate, although the hairs are definately sparser and finer so it doesn&#x27;t take long. I&#x27;m also discovering less ingrowns which is a plus. My legs feel a lot smoother also, so I&#x27;m happy with the result.    Initially I found the Silk-epil to be a bit more painful to use than the others I&#x27;ve tried, but the results are a lot better, so I don&#x27;t mind too much.  The light is quite useful and the noise doesn&#x27;t bother my ears as much as some of the other models.    The only downside I can think of is that the attachments look a bit flimsy, and mine came with a pouch, would have prefered a nice case or something for the money I paid.  I haven&#x27;t tried the shaving attachments. I am wondering since I bought it new if it will continue to perform well or become less effective over time.    So yes, so far so good, I would recommend this one for experienced epilators :)</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re considering getting this because you want to spend less time on hair removal than you would with shaving, you&#x27;re out of luck. It takes forever to remove all the hair with this. The first time I tried it, it took almost all day.    That in and of itself wouldn&#x27;t be a huge problem, if the only downside was that it took as much time as shaving. After the hair is removed, I&#x27;m left with red bumps that persist 4+ days after using it. When they finally go away, and the hair starts pushing up through the skin again, more red bumps occur.    Certain areas where the skin is soft (inner thigh) are a horrible experience. Pain I could deal with if the results were okay. But the skin actually gets caught in the machine and gets scraped, red, and bloody. This only happens in areas where the skin is malleable, for me it&#x27;s inner thigh, back of knee, underarms.    I thought this would work well considering all the good reviews. However I am inclined to believe most of those reviewers are not representative of a random sampling of the general population. Draw your own conclusions.    I gave this 3 sessions, a week apart, over almost all of my body. After the first time it is less painful. It&#x27;s still not worth it though, because all of the red bumps and all the hairs that snap off above the root. You also can&#x27;t wait a month between uses as some say. After a week, there is a lot of hair visible, and the hair is less even and uniform than it would be if I had shaved it.    In short:  MUCH more irritation than shaving.  Takes a VERY long time.  Fails to remove some hairs.  Painful over dense or deep hair or areas of sensitive skin.    Don&#x27;t believe the hype. I did.</li>
    <li> I am a woman and bought this epilator to help me remove the dark hair on my face (chin, sideburns, and cheeks) about two years ago.  This product has changed my life - it works wonderfully to remove the hair and it is not as painful as waxing (at least for me).  I got tired of waxing, tweezing, bleaching, and the home laser hair treatments did not work.  This product has held up great...Braun makes an excellent quality product.  I use a toothbrush with rubbing alcohol to clean the head.  I just wish I had bought this sooner!    The product is also dual voltage which is wonderful if you travel!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item, and have since used it once. i had never used an epilator before, and decided to try this one specifically since I have heard great reviews. I COULD NOT wax, it is too messy and painful for me.. shaving is a hassle, and my skin is very sensitive.   for any in a similar position- i have found this product to be a God-send!   PROS:gets rid of hair/ grows back thinner       not messy.       bang for buck.    CONS:it is painful at first...however, not unbearable. i prefer this to wax any day.        does not get rid of all the little hairs, even with the useful light attached. quick fix: use in sunlight!    OVERALL: great way to get rid of unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Im still awainting the arrival of this package and i have prime its been like 5 days now..but July 4th is a reason to excuse this delay</li>
    <li> For reference: I&#x27;d traditionally have to shave once a day to once every other day and I&#x27;d never had experience with epilation or waxing.  I have owned this product for almost a month.    First off, what it WON&#x27;T do:  1) It will not give you silky smooth legs to the touch.  2) It won&#x27;t get every hair every time, and it may miss finer hairs completely.  3) It won&#x27;t be like eating ice cream in the park (pain factor).  4) It will NOT last weeks.  5) It will not look nice immediately (need time for the redness/bumps to go down).    But it WILL:  1) It will give you VISIBLY nice legs for about a week at a time.  2) It will become more efficient as time goes on (first time ~3 hours, now ~0.5 hours) and it will dominate coarse, dark hair.  3) It will go from feeling like fire ants are devouring your legs to a vaguely uncomfortable sensation within a few uses.    As for the product itself:  1) The light is extremely useful for spotting finer or missed hairs.  2) It is comfortable to hold and feels solid, plus the kit is nice--I like that it came with a little brush to clean it.    I would recommend:  1) A pumice stone, loofah, etc. to exfoliate--some ingrown hair is kind of inevitable with this thing, but I got those shaving, too.  2) Rubbing alcohol or witch hazel to clean the tweezers (and to prevent infected ingrown hairs, so far all mine are just caught growing along the surface but not \\&quot;impacted\\&quot; if you will).    3) Taking some advil before your first time.  I know some people are recommending an alcoholic drink, but booze tends to dilate blood vessels near the surface of the skin and (in my non-expert opinion) I can&#x27;t help but feel this&#x27;d be the same as taking two steps forward and one step back.  4) If you have a bigger bathroom, you may need an extension cord since you&#x27;ll probably want to do this over the tub to avoid a mess..    Final/qualitative remarks:  I haven&#x27;t worked up the chutzpah to use it on my bikini line or underarms (tried the latter once and it startedto bleed), but those take only a couple of minutes to shave in the first place... I mostly like being able to throw on shorts or a skirt without worrying about my legs.  Every time I&#x27;d get goosebumps after shaving, I could practically feel the hair growing and my legs would no longer be smooth.  Epilation eliminated this problem and I find it fantastically rewarding to see the hairs ripped out by the root (you can see the little bulb on the end, so it&#x27;s definitely not just ripping it off at the surface).  I also love the fact that this thing costs less than a single wax job around here; I&#x27;m very satisfied with my investment.  If you&#x27;ve got a reasonable pain tolerance (for the first one or two uses, especially) and you&#x27;re committed, you&#x27;ll probably love this thing as much as I do.  :)</li>
    <li> I have used Braun products for more than ten years and I am satisfied with them. This one also is a good choice for this prize and it is useful. but its average life will be not more than two years if you use it twice per month for one hour.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because of some so called \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews.  This epilator quite simply does not remove hair easily.  In order to remove the hair, it must be pretty long and I found that I had to go over the same area repeatedly.  It&#x27;s just not that good.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Amazon was great in allowing me to return this product and get a full refund.  GO AMAZON!</li>
    <li> This is my first time, that I buy epilator, overall it&#x27;s good.  the only problem is it must connect to the plug to work!   But it&#x27;s good, with less pain :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for a very long time and I must say this is the best I had so far. It has all the right attachments and it works like a dream. the light is also very helpful, so you don&#x27;t miss anything. great buy!</li>
    <li> Product Usage:  Some reviews say that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all. Other reviews say it hurt a fair bit during the first use. My first time use was very painful and it took quite a while for me to finish the first session. My second session was MUCH quicker and far less painful. Most of the time, I felt a mild plucking sensation as opposed to the \\&quot;OW!\\&quot; feeling I had during the first use. If you wax semi-often, it shouldn&#x27;t hurt much at all. This thing is basically controlled waxing. Sensitive areas of the body included ankles, wrists, elbows, and knees. If you&#x27;re one of those who find epilation painful on the first use, try setting it to the \\&quot;slow\\&quot; mode and twisting your wrist left and right as if you were making paint brush strokes. This will get hairs bit by bit while pulling the epilator back after it grabs a few, reducing the first-time pain from \\&quot;constant\\&quot; to \\&quot;semi-constant\\&quot;.    Women with smaller hands may find the unit a little akward to use, especially when getting the hard to reach spots like the back of a leg or arm. Also, I&#x27;ve never felt a pinching feeling when the epilator is pressed too close to the skin. Finally, redness will occur from use so I advise using it a full 24-48 hours BEFORE going somewhere important or when doing something in which you feel looks matter. Two days after use and still smooth skinned! I have seen many people suggest using a mild moisturizer though after epilation to soothe your skin.      The Smartlite:  Ingenious idea! It helps highlight the hairs in the area you&#x27;ve got the light near and can show you hair in places you might not have expected to see it in. Without this, I would never know if I had gotten all the hairs or not.      Product came with:  The epilator came with a \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head that&#x27;s supposed to sooth the skin and lessen the feeling of pain through vibrations but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between either the beginner head or the precision head. It also came with a shaving head for the men afraid to try it on a particularly long haired area. The shaver also came with an attachment that combs the longer hair is \\&quot;certain areas\\&quot; into the trimmer, making for easy shaving/trimming. The trimmed hair doesn&#x27;t feel prickly or stabby-sharp like hair does a day after shaving.      Storage:  The product came with a durable feeling, draw-string pouch large enough to contain everything. Everything being the shaver head, various attachments, power cord, cleaner brush, and the epilator itself without feeling as if I were cramming the pouch overly full of things. So, storage is fairly easy.      Cons:  Occasionally, I had to turn the machine off to let the motor cool off in fear of it otherwise burning out during my first-time area use session because it was taking so long due to me being a wimp with pain. Second time use, I didn&#x27;t encounter this problem. Secondly, it is a bit noisy so I avoid using it late at night or before the average household bed time.      Overall, this is a good product and worth the money but I would still suggest people shop around for the best price. $50 USD+ is a LOT of money to pay for anything these days so make sure you get the best damned deal you can!</li>
    <li> I was expecting it to still hurt like crazy when I used it, but it didn&#x27;t hurt at all and got rid of the hair.  It takes a few passes to get it all but it&#x27;s better then shaving.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After getting positive feedback from a friend &amp; reading so many good reviews about this product, I also bought this epilator recently. yes, It is definitely good :-) After buying this, I did not go to waxing at all - whenever I want to have clean legs &amp; hands I do it myself at home. yes, it was v.painful for the 1st 1-2 times...then its a breeze :-)   I wish I cud give it 5 points - but it is still not exactly equal to waxing &amp; sometimes, I can feel my skin not so smooth after epilating...there are times, I wish I had done waxing for a smooth feel - but hey, everything has its price,huh ;-)  I absolutely recommend it to everyone who wants to have clean legs &amp; dont want to spend bucks on waxing often...Go for it! This is the only epilator I tried &amp; I do not want to try anything else...</li>
    <li> I bought this product because waxing is expensive, and like everyone else I am trying to cut expenses by doing it myself.  After reading all the reviews I picked this one.  Yes it does hurt the first time.  Yes it hurts a little less the second time, by the 3rd time it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  If you can get past the 1st and 2nd time you are in!  Love, love, this product.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the best on-line shop ever! I&#x27;m satisfied with all items I got from here(and I got a lot). My last purchase was Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator. It&#x27;s amazing: easy in usage, very reliable and effect stays not for couple days, but for a weeks. So if you&#x27;re looking for something like this go for it. I&#x27;m sure you gonna like it.</li>
    <li> first of all this epilator is amazing. second, you need to be patient  before you start epilating to reduce pain take hot towel and put over your legs. that way it won&#x27;t hurt a lot. for lower legs pain level from 1-10 is 2. upper legs pain is 3. the tricky one is armpit. to be honest pain was 6 first time and second time 5. so suck it up and do it. its worth every penny. :D</li>
    <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to use and yet it&#x27;s really fast. Would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators on and off for years and lost my last one.  I was never totally satisfied with it but it was good enough.  I jumped on Amazon yesterday to read product reviews and I admit this wasn&#x27;t my first choice.  The one I really wanted is on back order so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  I got next day delivery and just finished using it.  I am very pleased with my results.  I haven&#x27;t waxed or epilated for awhile so I used the starter head.  Worked pretty well.  Once I finished my entire leg, I went over it again with the advanced head and got a ton more hairs.  Even TINY little ones!  I never used my epilator on my thighs before because the hairs are so fine, it seemed like I could never get them with the epilator.  I used this one on my thighs and it got almost everything.  The light is not bad, not really necessary but not bad.  If you really don&#x27;t like it, you could just put a little piece of tape over it.           Some hair did break instead of getting plucked but that will happen with any epilator.  If you are getting a lot of hair breaking off, hold the epilator so that the light is pointing down towards your ankle and the hair is being pulled in the direction it grows.  Also hold your skin really tight.  That helps too.  I also read that if the hair breaks before it is pulled out, that the hair is too long.  I am going to go over my legs again in a few days to see if I can get all the little ones that broke.         As no epilator will ever be perfect, I am rating this 5 stars becuase it is way better than my Emjoi or any other epilator I have tried.  I love it!  And wayyyyyy easier than waxing.  And yes, the pain will get less, just push through it the first time.  One tip is to get your legs waxed at a salon and then try the epilator when the hair starts growing back.</li>
    <li> ok - I&#x27;m not a softy, I can take a bit of pain, and didn&#x27;t mind the epilator I had previously, but this one definitely has a sting to it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do want to reiterate that you will not receive the listed side items.  Yes it has a spotlight, and a smartstart head, there was NO cooling glove, or facial attatchments. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as results are concerned, first time out I did get two weeks free from hair, and a wonderful side effect of epilating is that hair grows back lighter and finer so it&#x27;s not as noticable when it does start growing again.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Inherintly with epilators you will get ingrown hairs, so expect them, and find an exfoliating regimine that works for you.  I find it a small price to pay for not having to worry about if I shaved when I wear skirts or bathing suits.</li>
    <li> My cousin is the one recommending the product to me.  At first, I have my doubts because the idea of pulling hair from the root sounds painful if you are not a regular wax person, like me.  However, I decide to give it a try and amazingly, it does not hurt at all.  I was really please about the product after my first time usage.  It does not take that long to do my legs (but I don&#x27;t have thick hair though), maybe 2 minutes for one leg.  However, there are flaws, not the product but epilating in general.  The hair grows back rather quickly for me though it was pulling from the root.  My underarm hair will only last for 3-4 days.  The hair go back much faster than that they advertised (last up to 4 weeks).  I really don&#x27;t think it will last that long.  But like I said, the downside is not to the product, it&#x27;s more specific to the process of epilating.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about the pain, don&#x27;t worry.  Because the pain is really tolerable.  I even tried it on my boyfriend and he agrees with me as well.  It&#x27;s not as painful as you think.</li>
    <li> me lo enviaron a tiempo, y lo uso en venezuela, es muy buen producto, la empresa cumplio con el envio dentro del tiempo establecido, sin problemas</li>
    <li> This product worked great.  I am a male and using it on my abdomen.  Needless to say it is still painful.  I liked the trimmer head that trims the hair to the appropriate length for extraction.  The first time was quit painful.  I then shaved what was left and repeat every few days.  Subsequent sessions are much less painful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The LED light is very useful, and it is a breeze to clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battery power might be the only thing I would add.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a couple of months now and I enjoy it better than shaving.  It hurt the first time I used it, for anyone that&#x27;s ever been waxed knows that feeling.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times it&#x27;s like nothing.  I can sit in front of the tv and just go at it, my boyfriend really thinks I&#x27;m gross.  The little poky roller thingies help with the initial pain alot, and the light is great for getting the weird angles on my legs.  To get my underarms less painfully I really need another hand to hold my skin taut but I haven&#x27;t had the heart to ask my boyfriend to do that for me.  Unfortunately I do have the tendency to get ingrown hairs, I did when I waxed and shaved, but I got a lot with this.  Nothing that a good hot soak and scrub in the tub with maybe a couple of tweezes didn&#x27;t fix though.  The other problem is that no matter how long I wait between epilating I never really get smooth.  There always seems to be those shorter hairs that it can&#x27;t grab but mine won&#x27;t seem to sync up at all.  You can&#x27;t see those hairs so at least my legs LOOK nice and soft and smooth.  I&#x27;d recommend a hot bath first with a scrub pouf, dry off really well and then go for it.  Hold your skin tight when you can (I find it less necessary now), then slather on some good moisturizer when you&#x27;re done.  I like Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.</li>
    <li> NOTE:  -Exfoliate after using this product--it is a must!  Pulling hair from the skin seems to loosen skin, especially since it is recommended that you use this on 1) clean skin 2) skin with no lotion on it. You don&#x27;t wanna risk developing ingrown hairs because of that  -Hair doesn&#x27;t grow evenly or at the same rate so it&#x27;s easy to pass or hover over those stands.  It doesn&#x27;t always give you that smooth, \\&quot;just shaven\\&quot; feel because of that.      PROS:  -Good price, powerful, and does the trick  -It keeps you from shaving everyday because even the little hairs that are left are short enough not to be seen unless really looking for them.  -Cheaper than waxing.      CONS:  -It HURTS!  After one or two uses your legs/arms get use to it (hopefully).  -I don&#x27;t think my underarms will ever get used to this.  I&#x27;ve done it once and it was just too painful.  I would have to develop a higher pain tolerance for epilating my underarms.  Same for my bikini line.  -With things like this, I want to keep them as clean as possible. I do my best to clean as directed--with isopropyl rubbing alcohol and the included brush.  I put alcohol in a little disposable cup and just go to town on the wheel.  I turn it on to loosen the extra alcohol and I repeat.  Maintenance does take some time but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> It works very well, and I use it all the time. It does pinch and little red spots show, but if you use a cold pack (which did not come with it like it was supposed to) it&#x27;s fine. I also recommend to use it after a hot shower. The warm water opens up your skin more, so it won&#x27;t hurt as much. I have tried to use it in the bikini area, and it hurt the first couple of times. Now I have used to it. I really recommend this product to anyone. Since I am a first-time user, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I really like it. Oh, I also forgot to include that I shave a couple of days after using, otherwise I get some ingrown hair. Shaving in between each use helps with that.</li>
    <li> The product works fine, but it really came without its accessories, like the cooling gloves and the gentle start head, for example. Since she liked it very much, it thought it would be better to say here its flaws instead of its benefits ( the comment would then be much shorter). Well... the cord could be longer, the noise could be lower and it could come with the accessories its suposed to. Aside those bad things, its a GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I spent years using the epilator from Sharper Image, thinking \\&quot;it&#x27;s Sharper Image, it must be great\\&quot;.  Then (thankfully) the quality started to drop, and I started looking for a replacement.  This is FAR SUPERIOR to my other model.  Prior to this model I had NEVER been able to use it on my legs - with this I can do both legs with shockingly little discomfort (notice I said discomfort, NOT pain.....it&#x27;s amazing how little you feel).  I noticed some other reviews mentioned the noise or the power cord being too short.  I didn&#x27;t find either of these issues to be a problem.  I found it ergonomically shaped, and the little light was ingenius.  Absolutely fantastic product!  Better price through Bed Bath and Beyond, though, since you can use their 20% off coupons.</li>
    <li> I have to second what others said: it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I can&#x27;t say anything negative except that it says in the description (here on Amazon) there would be a cooling glove in the package which is wrong considering what&#x27;s said on the BRAUN webpage and shown on the pictures here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would highly recommend this Epilator. Even for beginners which will obviously suffer from pain in the beginning. There&#x27;s not system which could avoid that. Not even this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I found is the loud noise but after 10 years of epilation I can say, the BRAUN 5270 isn&#x27;t louder than other systems. They all are loud. ;-)</li>
    <li> Just received this shaver and it&#x27;s fabulous.  Best shave I have gotten.  I have been using an epilator for years and they don&#x27;t compare to this one.  Love the light feature - especially if you have vision problems.  Absolutely no pain.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this after finding out I am not a candidate for laser hair removal (lasers do not work on blonde, red or grey hair).  It arrived last night and I first tried it on my arm.  OUCH!!  I had read the reviews that it is painful and they weren&#x27;t kidding!  I got through one arm, took a 20 minute break and did the other.  I was pleased to find that it didn&#x27;t hurt as much when I did my legs.  I did have to go over areas several times.  This product is GREAT!  My legs and arms are super smooth and soft.  I tried it on my face but it was too painful.  I&#x27;ve yet to do my bikini area or underarms.  Just not sure if I&#x27;m ready for that torture!  If you buy this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The little light is a great feature also!  I only gave it a 4 because of the pain.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]  Easy to use. Do not need to go to a beauty salon. Excelent result.   I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product , nice trimmer as an added feature - not painless but nicer by far than others I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I think this product is great!  I have used it now couple times on my legs, once under my arms, and just recently on my bikini line...  I had to work into that last one.  I went three weeks in between each \\&quot;pulling\\&quot;.  I can&#x27;t believe that it pulls out all the hair with out hurting your skin or cutting you.  The motor sounds and seems like it will slice you up, but it doesn&#x27;t.  :)    I used it on my legs first, and it did hurt, but when it grew back, it hardly hurt to do it again.  When it grew back it was a little finer, but mostly just came out easier and I did it when the hair was really short.  If you can get past the first time, you&#x27;ll be okay! :)    When I did my legs the second time and it didn&#x27;t hurt that bad, I decided to try and do under my arms.  It was a little painful, but mostly because I kept thinking I was going to get cut, but I never did.  I made it through and it has been great!        It&#x27;s funny how much less time it takes me to take a shower or bath when I don&#x27;t have to shave for three weeks!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product; I love it! The only thing I recommend to people who have never tried epilating is to first consider your own pain tolerance, since it&#x27;s not entirely pain free for everyone. Personally this epilator is painless for me and I&#x27;ve used it in sensitive areas before, but YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get even very fine hairs and freshly grown hairs like it says, and I really like the light feature which helps me see any hairs I might have otherwise skipped. I also like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it or replacing the whole unit because it won&#x27;t hold a charge, but that&#x27;s me. The optional shaver head is great too, since you get variety if you like that. It&#x27;s also a fairly easy device to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mine for quite some time now and I have noticed a difference in regrowth over time, which was a big issue for me, so I&#x27;m very pleased. Overall I think it&#x27;s a great product and well worth what I spent on it.</li>
    <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to say it&#x27;s not a good product because it is...But it hurts like hell the first times. Especially on the private areas...don&#x27;t even think about it..it&#x27;s unbearable...same for the armpits! I can&#x27;t do it at all. I only use it on my forearms...and it works good...no bumps, no ingrown hair, nothing else to say...If you&#x27;re not too sensitive, buy it, otherwize, just let it go...</li>
    <li> I got the epilator as a gift.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things, coil epilators, wax, gels and of course that lovely razor!  But nothing compares to this one.  I tried it on my girlfriend whose legs were like a jungle.  1 week went by and the hair was substantially thinner and sparse.  It really does minimize the hair and the regrowth.  Just one note, it hurts the first time you do it, but well worth the discomfort.  It was so good, I bought 3 more, you never can enough of a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is great for my chinny chin chin, which would otherwise be rather hairy. I have tried electrolysis, shaving, waxing and plucking and this works better than all. It does not hurt much on the chin, but probably would other places. Did you really think hair removal came without pain?</li>
    <li> My husband researched all kinds of epilators, then purchased this one for me for Christmas. I was happy to get it because I hate shaving, but very nervous about what it might feel like. But since I&#x27;m Italian with dark hair and have to shave about every other day, I am glad to have it. The first time I used it on my legs. It took two days for a total of 4 hours because I have a low pain tolerance. It felt like FIRE on my legs! After reading other people&#x27; reviews, I may not even try it on my underarms, I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m not going near facial hair with this machine...I use creme bleach for that.   But it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I first used it. I had to use it again tonight and it took 30 minutes for both legs and did not hurt nearly as much. I did notice tons of ingrown hairs, so I guess I&#x27;ll need to do a better job of exfoliating.  Bottom line: shaving will give you perfectly smooth legs at least for a day, but you&#x27;ll have to keep it up every other day just about.  The epilator lets you forget about your legs for alot longer, but you&#x27;ll always have different lengths of hair growing out, so you&#x27;ll never have a day with perfectly smooth legs.  For me, it&#x27;s just nice to not have to shave so often! And the hairs that do grow out aren&#x27;t too obvious or prickly.</li>
    <li> Well that is my girlfriend opinion. The Braun 5270 includes a shaver/trimer head and in my gf opinion it is not as painful as wax ways.</li>
    <li> I had this product on my Wish List and got it for my birthday. I have thick dark hair, and I was getting sick of shaving every single day, or going through the embarrassment of having those little buggers say hello to the world if I didn&#x27;t have my legs completely covered. I was eager to try something new, so I did a bunch of research and comparing online and decided Braun was my best bet, and had the best reviews. Being a college kid, I&#x27;ve become quite the penny pincher, but I decided if I was going to invest in something like this, I might as well get something that looks like it would last me.    I tried my new epilator for the first time, and as most will tell you, it&#x27;s certainly not painless. I wouldn&#x27;t qualify myself as a baby when it comes to pain, but I don&#x27;t have super pain tolerance either. The first time I used it I was only brave enough to do part of my leg and then stopped. A month later I decided to go at it again (I strongly recommend making it the first thing you do after toweling off after a hot shower to open the pores, soften the hair and calm your skin).     The part of my leg that I had epillated a month earlier had fewer, finer hairs and I found it MUCH easier to re-epilate this area than to do the rest. I finished that lower leg and have yet to be brave enough to do the other one. It will take time to get used to, but I&#x27;m convinced it will only get better from here! Someday I&#x27;ll be brave enough to do my upper leg and underarms.    I got all the attachments advertised and I&#x27;m happy with my product! Everything works like a charm and the spotlight really really does help!</li>
    <li> I am a woman of fair complexion who has sensitive skin with various types of hair growth ranging from black thick sticks to clear feathery wisps. I&#x27;ve been shaving for years and enduring painful razor burn after every shave. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of razors and cremes and nothing gave me exactly what I was looking for. Electric razors never shaved close enough. I tried waxing at home, but I could never get it to work especially on the thick, stiff hairs (which I am sure was due to my lack of technique). In a moment of desperation I decided to look into epilators. After reading several review sites the Braun line jumped to the forefront. The one I was initially interested in is not offered in the United States so I found the one most similar to it.     Several of the reviews that I read suggested that one should get a professional wax job (one or more) before attempting epilating. I am too cheap to do that so upon suggestion from my boyfriend I tried plucking out some hairs with my tweezers just to see how painful this may become. Yes, it hurt but the pain was fleeting. I decided that I could live with this and bought the epilator.     When it arrived I started with the beginner attachment and ran it on the high setting (the high setting was strongly recommended by many as the slow was too torturous for them). *OUCH!* The initial shock momentarily took my breath away! Tweezing one hair at a time is one thing, but pulling out several at a time is MUCH different! It wasn&#x27;t too long before I felt I might pass out so I stopped and took a break. After regaining my breath I tried again. Each time I did something a little different. I experimented with how fast I moved the epilator along and the attachment that I was using. It took some time and several breaks before I had just my left calf done. However, I managed to gather valuable information such as where I am the most sensitive (ankles, shin bones, knees, and the backs of the knees) and that the toughest hairs will sometimes take multiple swipes to pluck. I also discovered that moving the epilator faster results in a more intense level of pain, but that the pain subsided that much faster. The beginner attachment works just fine, but the professional one is much more efficient in that it plucks out more hairs at one time. More initial pain, less time spent plucking, AND faster recovery ... Oh yeah!    On to the right calf! My right calf was much more difficult. Unlike the left one the hairs grow in all directions. This calf took even longer *Sigh!* I had to move the epilator in multiple directions multiple times just to get all of the hairs. Just remember to keep the skin pulled taught no matter what direction you are going in. This helps tremendously!     The first day was the most time consuming. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t make it! However, the maintenance is a breeze! About every 10 days I go back and epilate the few hairs that are growing out. This is quick and not nearly as painful as before. I&#x27;ve only had my epilator for 1 month, but in my mind it has more than paid for itself. No razor burn ever again!!!!    Since getting it I have epilated all types of hairs all up and down my legs with great success. There were a couple of bumps that formed and quickly went away, but nothing painful. Yes, I have to take multiple swipes with the epilator, but that may be due more to my multiple hair types and multi-directional growth patterns than anything else.    All told, I highly recommend this product to those willing to endure that first very painful session. Believe me, once you get past that point it&#x27;s all a breeze from there!    P.S. - If you decide to try plucking with tweezers don&#x27;t do what I did and pluck too large of an area. The tweezers don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job as the epilator does. I am still dealing with hairs in that area that are growing straight under the skin. I&#x27;ve had to go back and dig them out with my tweezers. I can&#x27;t wait to be able to use the epilator that area!</li>
    <li> I love it!  Much faster than having to tweeze, and the price was fantastic!</li>
    <li> The Epilator&#x27;s discs are not all metal like the one I used to have some years ago, therefore it seems to me like they don&#x27;t do as good as a job. It also seems to hurt more than I remembered (I am used to doing the brazilian waxing, so I&#x27;m not too sensitive). It still is great for when you can&#x27;t wait for the hair to grow long to have them waxed. It takes out even the very short ones. I found the light and the attachments very usefull. The cover for the normal epilator keeps slipping out though.  Overall I like it, but some of those other \\&quot;little problems\\&quot; bother me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for years. My old Remington was starting to slow down after 6 years of regular use so I decided it was time to replace it. After reading all the great reviews for the Braun, I decided it was a good bet. The second the package arrived, I opened it up. I couldn&#x27;t wait to fire it up.     I was shocked at how much hair my old epilator was missing. I&#x27;m now truly hair free and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new purchase. I definately recommend this product!    P.S. There is pain, but work through it, the results are truly worth it.</li>
    <li> I just received my new Braun 5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator in the mail this weekend. I waited a week or so for it and dutifully didnt shave in the meantime figuring on giving this gadget a real run for my money. Amazing!! I love it. I&#x27;ve waxed before so I  understand the pain and was willing to endure this knowingly. Well worth the money. I must say though I dont have thick hair nor is it full by a stretch. It is kind of a slow process but you have to weigh that against the time it takes to shave daily and the cost of waxing/buying replacemnt razors. You will get used to it after a few minutes. My only suggestion is to try your legs first(least painful) and if your brave do your uhm private area next. Its much less painful if you make sure you pull any skin taught as they do with waxing, it helps...you&#x27;ll see. The light is great too! If your really brave you can try to do your armpits which may cause you to cry a little but if you&#x27;ve given birth it pales in comparison. It was such a great feeling to have conquered all of those thousands of little hairs, seeing them flying about with little fillicles attached...VICTORY!! As with waxing you&#x27;ll notice your never going to get them all to grow at the same time so I&#x27;m afraid its still going to be a constant battle. Still worth it though.</li>
    <li> I received my Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator and I must say that it&#x27;s paid for itself already.  I had been a regular waxer for over 3 years but the cost was really getting out of control.  So, I thought I would take things into my own hands.    I highly recommend this epilator over others.  It was very easy to use right out of the box.  Contrary to other reviews that claim the cord isn&#x27;t long enough, the 6 feet of cord length is ample for me.  I used my Braun right out of the shower and was done within 10 minutes.  There was no tugging or pulling on my skin.  My hair length was a good 1/4\\&quot;.  I won&#x27;t lie and tell you it didn&#x27;t hurt a bit but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  If you pull your skin taught, it&#x27;s much more comfortable.    This was definitely money well spent!!!!</li>
    <li> Yeah, it was painful as heck the first time I used it, but I use it regularly now (about every two weeks) without any discomfort.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference between this and my old Epilady is, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.    I noticed the little tweezers, one size is metal and does the motion, the other side is a stationary plastic wall. This is different than the Epilady which has a full-on tweezer action where both sides come together.    All it does is cut off my hair - I might as well be shaving.    I gave it more than one chance and it&#x27;s just not doing what I need it to do so I&#x27;m returning it even though I will only be getting a partial refund.    I am Asian, so I have pretty strong hair follicles, about medium to thin thickness. I would not recommend to anyone with similar hair.</li>
    <li> works well, although i did hurt myself the first time trying to epilate my underarms... so if you are not used to epilators, go slow. i found it a bit too hard to clean after use, takes a bit of time to get all the hairs out. had a satinelle before that was a lot quicker and easier to clean...</li>
    <li> This was much more painful that I had expected.  It works like it is supposed to but I have not been able to use it for more than a few minutes at a time.  Maybe over time this will get easier but for now I still have to shave some...</li>
    <li> I really need to say that all the reviews helped me buy this article.&lt;br /&gt;I read that some people said that the light is not worth it...in my case it is! is amazing how, with low light you can still manage to take off all the hair form your leg. I was amazed because I had one other before and I had to wait until morning to do my legs because I needed the sun light. So for me really work the light!&lt;br /&gt;One other detail, the package is chic, so i can carry it with me all the time. The extra heads really works, for my legs I use one and for my tights I use another, thats a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets at all !!!&lt;br /&gt;Good buy for a a good amount of money!&lt;br /&gt;Ana</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an epilator for years, and this is absolutely the best ever.  It lifts the hair out with no pain and very few ingrown hairs later.  The light is helpful and the width of the \\&quot;pullers\\&quot; means legs are done in half the usual time.</li>
    <li> This gadget works great on some areas and horrible on others. It cuts some hair off at the roots which leaves a little prickly piece of hair that is too short to pull out. It takes FOREVER to get your legs done. I use it and am not upset that I bought it, but I think I might stick to waxing certain areas.</li>
    <li> I love my silk-epil X&#x27;elle. I got it yesterday in the mail, and instantly used it. I will highly recommened to anyone... It is a little painful but the result is amazing and feels really good after. Plus they say that after you use a few times you should be fine...</li>
    <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend.  I do not find it very painful at all and went from beginner to expert within 2 uses.  However, my legs do not feel silky smooth when I finish like my friend&#x27;s.  I am hairy and she is not so that may make a difference.  I continue to use it and my legs feel OK (like the end of the day stubble only soft).  I will keep using it and would buy another if this one quits.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little noisier than I expected, but it works very well. I tried it for the first time yesterday and was amazed. It picked up the finest hairs on my arms and there was no mess and no irritation. That little light really does come in handy. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of shaving every other day, I highly recommend this product. The pain was not nearly as bad as I expected. I use this on my legs and underarms, and I am very pleased with how lasting the results are. I took off one star, because it does make a pretty loud noise. Also, the tweezing is not as efficient as I would like, and I often have to go over an area a few times to get most of the hair. I have not used any other epilators, so I can&#x27;t compare but I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It removes hair quickly and, yes, it smarts a little until you get used to it, but I would not say it is painful.  The irritation is very minimal and goes away quickly, unlike shaving which leaves rashes, nicks, etc.  It works great on legs, underarms, bikini, face, everywhere you have unwanted hair. The little motor is somewhat noisy, but not overly so. Now that I have this little epilator, I will never shave or wax again!</li>
    <li> it hurt, but it does a nice worck and the shipping was so fast. my girlfriend love it.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use this for a week after I got it because I was afraid it would be very painful.  I thought I would just test it out on a little area of my leg, but it went so well that I did both legs and underarms in about 45 minutes on my first use.  I&#x27;ve examined the hairs after this epilator pulled them out and it seems to be plucking hair from the underarm as I can see the little nasty roots of the hairs.  On my legs, though, I am not quite sure.  I can feel the machine pricking my skin, but after each use, my legs do not feel very smooth.  I can feel the stubble already growing in!  Like another reviewer has said, it seems to be only breaking the hairs off and not plucking from the roots.  I am not sure why it works better on my underarms than legs because you would think it would be easier to epilate the leg cuz the surface area is larger and smoother than the nook of the underarm.  Who knows! Maybe my leg hairs weren&#x27;t long enough or something (not that I regularly keep godzilla-like pits...).  I&#x27;ve only used this item twice, but I am not too excited with the results on the legs.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, they are sparse but dark, so I will wait a little while for the leg hairs to get longer before using it again.  Also, this little machine is very very loud.  It&#x27;s quite embarassing to use if there are other people in the house...</li>
    <li> This epilator is outstanding!  I&#x27;ve used an Epilady in the past, and while I liked the results, it took forever, the hair had to be fairly long, and it was a little uncomfortable on legs and excruciating on underarms.  This solves all those problems!  It works so quickly.  Take slow, even strokes along your leg and in 3 passes (tops!) all the hair is gone.  It grabs even the shortest stubble - if you can see it, it can grab it!  And I found it completely pain free on my legs.  Maybe some people have more sensitive skin, or really thick roots and that&#x27;s why they complain, but I literally felt no pain whatsoever.  The underarms is a different story.  Don&#x27;t be fooled, it does hurt but there are some tricks!  First, it takes a bit of flexibility but you need to make sure the skin is tight.  Whether you can manage to use both hands (a bit tricky) or hold the skin so it&#x27;s tight by using the heel of your hand, and move it only with your fingers, keeping the skin tight makes the hair come out much easier.  (Same goes for your legs, hold the skin tight with your other hand and the hairs come out even faster and easier.)  If the skin is very loose it can get grabbed by the tweezers and scratch the skin.  Also, the first time on the underarms is the worst by far.  If you can do it once, follow up as soon as you see some hairs.  The hairs won&#x27;t all grow back at the same rate so if you do it when there&#x27;s only a little it hurts much less.  After only a couple of times I can do my underarms in a few seconds each and it barely stings.    In general, it takes about the same amount of time as shaving (maybe a little more) but the results last for weeks!  My only regret is that I waited so long to buy this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed in my entire life and so I was a little scared when I first tried this epilator. I used it on full speed when I tried it and there was a little discomfort but It really wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  I have fine hair so I have to go over the same spot a couple of times but thats fine because you don&#x27;t need to use it as often as a razor.  If you tend to get ingrown hairs all you need to do is exfoliate regularly.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work by pulling the hair out, it broke the hair off. I rerurned the product within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> When I use it at the first time, i can&#x27;t help yelling for the unbearable pain. but next time, when i use it again, such experience doesn&#x27;t go back again, and like it more and more. very smart product. delivery is also very fast.</li>
    <li> I used to have the old one that hurt like crazy (and i&#x27;m good with pain) and I got this one for my legs and underarms so I wouldnt have to shave anymore. So it does a pretty good job- like you can&#x27;s see any hair but it still doesn&#x27;t feel smooth like after you shave. Hardly painful on legs but hurts pretty bad when doing underarm. I would still recommend it though since even though skin may not feel all smooth, you still don&#x27;t have to shave for about 3 weeks :) and it works pretty fast too :)</li>
    <li> The braun works great on a face full of wild hairs.  If your like me the descendant of a werewolf, it&#x27;ll be your new best friend.  It hurts at first and creates little bumps but that resilient human body will soon adjust and  it won&#x27;t hurt or cause bumps anymore, really.  Plus, its a Braun, they still make good stuff.  It&#x27;s a great tool and will reduce plucking time by 80%.  There&#x27;s no need to worry with Sunday sessions because one minute with this baby and your done.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana</li>
    <li> It works. It doesn&#x27;t hurt much. It is painful to some extent especially for some part of my body. The effect lasts shorter than 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> The epilator works well, a cordless model would be better suited for the task. All in all, it&#x27;s a good item.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t usually write, but if you&#x27;re on the fence about this it&#x27;s great.  It hurts, but beauty is sometimes pain.  I can only equate the pain on your legs by saying that it must be like a tattoo and it does fade after several minutes. The hair doesn&#x27;t grow in evenly, so by the second time you epilate there is a lot less hair hence less to pull out and less pain &amp; so on and so forth.  The bikini area is not something that I&#x27;d jump right into.  I had a bikini waxing a month previous (first one ever)  I would NEVER have been able to just epilate without having that done first.    Also did my husband&#x27;s back (I had waxed it several times before with the green goop that \\&quot;heats\\&quot; with your body heat)  It was excruciating for him, but that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re having the babies isn&#x27;t it?    This item has already paid for itself several times over but don&#x27;t waste your money if you&#x27;re looking for painless....it hurts but the job it does makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this epliator! I was a teen in the 80&#x27;s when the epilators back then were horrible medieval coiled devices--I never could bear the pain. The grip and the light make it so comfortable and user-friendly.    To deal with the pain for newbies: I saw another reviewer&#x27;s suggestions and used them--they worked. Soak in hot water for your first time or two, dry thoroughly, then use the massage head. Believe me, after you do it a few times, the pain goes away. (Think: plucking eyebrows. Hurts at first, but after a few times not at all anymore.) So run through with the massage head a few times, then you can upgrade to the faster attachment when the pain lessens.    To deal with ingrown hairs (A MUST TO READ!!): when you epilate, if you don&#x27;t do anything to your skin to prevent ingrown hairs, expect ALMOST EVERY hair to become ingrown! I have dark, thick hair and was having to shave daily. When I first became smooth with the epilator, I loved it! I didn&#x27;t think anything could be worse than the 5:00 shadow I routinely got on my legs every day with shaving. I WAS WRONG! After my first epilation, I tried using Prince Reigns a few times, but it was so gross and sticky that I did not use it regularly. When the first new batch of hair grew in, it was a horror! I was covered in in-growns! The thing about Prince Reigns is, it&#x27;s pretty expensive, you have to use a lot of it, so the $25 bottle goes really quickly, and it leaves this gross sticky goo on your legs that doesn&#x27;t get better throughout the day...it stays sticky until your next shower--and you put on more after each shower. I felt like my skin couldn&#x27;t breath and was suffocating, plus I had to be careful not to rest my hands on my legs as I sat in shorts or a skirt or I&#x27;d have to go wash them again to get the sticky residue off. And it wasn&#x27;t fun for my boyfriend.    In-grown solution: a good, course body brush. You know, natural bristles on a stick like at the health food store? I recently discovered body brushing (which, by the way, makes your skin feel FABULOUS!), and decided to see if it could help prevent the in-growns, and it does. My hair is super thick and grows in very quickly, and I have to epilate at least a few days every week (versus others who can make it 3-4 weeks). I&#x27;ve been using a body brush for a month on my legs, and the results are just as good, if not better, than Prince Reigns. My skin is also super soft and feels buttery (boyfriend LOVES IT!), no in-grown hairs, and no more sticky, gooey legs. My skin can rock and still breathe! It&#x27;s better for you, natural, and way more cost-effective.    How to use body brush: Do it dry! Don&#x27;t get the bristles wet. Every day before you shower, brush down your body from chin to toe. The bristles are course and it&#x27;s another thing you get used to, but you&#x27;ll crave it after you start. Make sure you really go over the epilated areas well. The brush removes dead surface layers, improves circulation, and polishes and smooths the skin. Easy, takes about 3 minutes. If you love your skin and like feeling beautiful, also look into getting a Clarisonic Pro facial brush. Trust me, you&#x27;ll feel like a million bucks and look like it, too!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy an epilator for my legs. I got this after reading all the reviews.      It doesn&#x27;t hurt much, but it takes a long time to take out the hair.  I had to go very slowly over each spot to make sure all the hair is gone.  Since I&#x27;m Asian, I have relatively thin leg hair.  It breaks off my hairs instead of plucking it out.  Because of that, the hair grows back in a couple of days.  So I don&#x27;t recommend it for those with relatively thin leg hair.  It is also very noisy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got this for my girlfriend and she is so happy with it. And she had a lot of those. A LOT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair removel products but this worked the best.  I usually resorted to have my legs waxed but I no longer will have to do that.  This works great.</li>
    <li> Highly effective product.  I&#x27;ve never had such smooth underarms before!  Sure, there&#x27;ll be pain and maybe bruising (if you don&#x27;t hold your skin taunt or if you have sensitive skin), but it&#x27;s so worth it.  No noticable regrowth for at least 2 weeks!    It actually wasn&#x27;t that painful except for areas where hair is extremely coarse.  But the pain lasts for about the first 4 seconds, and if you keep going it&#x27;s completely tolerable.  And you do have to go over with tweezers sometimes, to remove weird-angled hair or ones that just don&#x27;t pick up, but those are very rare.    Definitely a money saver for waxers.  For a little more over the price of a bikini wax, you&#x27;ll have smooth skin until your device breaks!    I definitely will buy again, after this one breaks.  :D</li>
    <li> I have been waxing ever since i could remember but with the busy schedule it was damn difficult thing to do. One of my friend suggested me to use epilator and after lot of research and reading hundreds of reviews i bought Braun Silk Epil Xelle epilator. Like every product, this has its pros and cons which i am listing below:    Positives:   - For those who have been used to waxing and have good growth of hairs this is the best product. It is much better than waxing as you dont have to wait for full hair growth and you can remove even smallest hair.    - The smart light is very useful as it highlights any areas that you can skip even during daylight.     -Its best for Legs and Arms and its much easier, cheaper than waxing. Saves a ton of money    -Hairs are completely removed and your skin looks as smooth as waxing and regrowth is also slow compared to shaving.     -Eventually Ingrown hairs also are reduced, if you implement and read the instruction manual, which gives you tip about removal of ingrown hairs.    Negatives:  -Truth is it is bit painful, I would say slightly more than waxing. Thicker the hair, more the pain. So the trick is use shaver attachement for thick hairs trim them a bit and then use the normal hair removal attachment. This is just first time, once you get used to it, you will just feel it normal.     - Dont try straitaway in sensitive areas like under arms and bikini, it will hurt a lot. Use them on legs and hands if comfortable try slowly on other areas.    - It is not cordless and is bit noisy you have to station yourself at some place to use it. But i beleive battery powered wouldnt work at such speed so its ok.     -After hair removal, put on some moisturiser or body lotion to prevent bumps.     The trick to use this product in best way is dont wait for the full grown hair, just keep on removing as and when they grow. I have loved it and am much releived after buying this product as i can do it on my own convinience and especillay  dont haveto wait for the \\&quot;rgiht time \\&quot;. So best for busy women.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Silk epil xelle for about a month now.  I had no trouble adjusting to using it on my legs.  Using it on my underarms has taken a little longer but is already going much better (less pain).  The product does what it is suppose to and even though I am getting new hair growth back sooner than I would like, it is much finer and so I can still go an extra day or two compared to shaving. I am hoping over time I will be able to go even longer - we&#x27;ll see.  I highly recommend this product.  Just take your time and have some patience because the discomfort will go away.</li>
    <li> It did take a few trys to get a hang of this product, but once I did, I love this product.  I have been using Epilady for 17 yrs, the one where you have to move in a circular motion. I switched to Braun 5270, I was so impressed.  I love the little blue light and the fact I don&#x27;t have to go over and over again to the same area is a plus.  This picks up the tiniest hair in one smooth stroke.</li>
    <li> Ladies (&amp; Gentlemen),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, and many years of shaving, attempting to wax, going back to shaving, and repeating this vicious cycle, I finally decided to invest in an epilator.  I think I read every single review on Amazon, put this epilator in my cart, took it out, put it back, and finally had the courage to go through with this purchase.  I knew it would be painful, but I was hoping the ends would justify the means - and it has!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, the first time I used the epilator, I did one little strip of hair on my leg and didn&#x27;t know how much more I could stand.  However, I eventually got used to the sensation and found the courage to continue.  The first time I epilated (I didn&#x27;t shave before hand and had about two days of growth), it took about an hour to do both of my bottom legs.  The next day I did my upper thighs and it took about a half hour.  Yes, the first time you do this it will hurt and there will be *a lot* of hair.  However, I am happy to report the growth that does come in is now much less.  Because I just started epilating, I realize that my hair will continue to grow until I&#x27;ve epilated throughout the entire hair cycle.  So every other day I have been epilating.  Now it only takes about 15 minutes to do both legs.  I will continue to do this for another week or two to ensure I am keeping up with the hair growth cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the elusive bikini line - I did shave this area before attempting to epilate.  Look girls, I am in the military, I am deployed to Afghanistan, and I carry two weapons every day... I consider myself a pretty tough cookie, but even I will not attempt to epilate this area without extreme caution.  So as I said, I shaved before hand, and then epilated... It wasn&#x27;t bad!  I will continue to epilate this area as I do my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undearms - I have tried this area, it hurts more than the bikini line - but go for it.  With any area, the first time is the worst time and it will get progressively better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall - a great product!  Oh and don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless America... and Braun :)</li>
    <li> Apparently epilating technology has not made much progress ove the last 20 years.  Still to painful.  I stick with a 10cents DE razor...it&#x27;s also easier on the skin.  The Braun gave me a real bad rash that lasted about 6 h.  Wish I could return the item...alas, landfill here it comes!</li>
    <li> Even though this Epilator is very effective in removing hair, it was the most painful thing ever!!!!!! It took me nearly 3 days to finish both of my legs because I could NOT take the pain (maybe I had extra sensitive skin for it). All pain aside, It has been almost 3 weeks since I used the epilator and I have a lot less hair than ever before...I recommend it for its effective hair removal that can last upto 3 weeks, but the pain is something you&#x27;ll have to take...pain is beauty so...good luck!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun Silk epil in the past and this is a great replacement. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Let me preface by saying that I have been waxing for over 10 years, so I find that there is no pain associated with this product on my legs. It does sting a little if used in more intimate areas, but that too, seems to lessen over time. It is certainly a tremendous improvement over the first epilady from 15 years ago, which caused ingrowns and never really worked properly.    In using this, one gets maximum results by keeping the skin taut. It is essential to exfoliate daily to prevent ingrowns. One one&#x27;s legs, this works as well as waxing, and it is certainly MUCH easier to take to Europe for 2 months than a tub of hot wax.    The biggest failure of this item is it&#x27;s size, which requires a relatively flat area of body of roughly 2 inches across. The epilady slides effortlessly over the legs, but there is not 2 inches of flat body on one&#x27;s underarms or bikini area! Consequently, there is chafting and it is very difficult to remove all the hair.    Please manufacturers, make a smaller head attachment for the bikini and underarm areas!</li>
    <li> I was quite skeptical to try this.  My mom had an epilady long long ago, and I remember trying it and it HURT!  Well, this thing hurts too, but it&#x27;s SOOOO worth the end product of not having to shave every other day!  I worked at my legs in sections, and it took a few days to get most of the hair gone.  But NOW!!! I run the epilator over my legs every few days or when I notice a stray growing.  NO more shaving, unless of course I want silky smooth legs, then I still have to shave.  Haven&#x27;t gotten the courage up to do my underarms or bikini area though.  The only thing I can relate the discomfort to is getting a tattoo.  It&#x27;s that annoying uncomfortable feeling, but once most of the hair is gone, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I have never tried epilating before and the first 3 times I tried it on my legs, I nearly had tears in my eyes.  After I got through the initial pain, it was like other reviewers said and the pain decreased significantly much as with plucking your eyebrows.  I have attempted to do my underarms on a couple occasions, but it really did bring tears to my eyes, so I think I will have to think of alternatives for that area. I shudder to think what it would be like if I attempted the bikini area. I am really pleased with the results on my legs as my skin seems to be much smoother and I can go several weeks without having to worry about unsightly hair.  Since my hair is pretty course and dark, it did take me several attempts to get a hairless leg.  I have been using a body brush to exfoliate and have not yet had a problem with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator with some hesitation because the last two brands I have purchased haven&#x27;t worked very well as the very first epilator that came out in the 80&#x27;s.  Well, I have been pleasantly surprised.  This epilator actually works and works well.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> works well, but I have to go over my skin many times.  but a well-designed and made product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> ok, so i bought this product after reading all the positive reviews on amazon.  it arrived within 4 days and i was very excited (also very nervous) to use it.  many users mentioned that it was very painful.  \\&quot;hah,\\&quot; i said to myself, \\&quot;i&#x27;m a strong chick, how bad can this hurt?\\&quot;  i was pretty convinced that my pain tolerance was high.  just in case, i took two shots of vodka and chugged some wine.      HOLY #$#@ and all the powers of hell, THIS DEVICE HURTS.  the pain is almost unbearable.  ok lets keep in mind i am very hairy.  i have hair EVERYWHERE and i&#x27;ve been shaving since i was like 13... my entire leg, \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot; stomach, etc... (other horrid places that i wont get into...)  And my hair is thick, too.  Three or four grow out of each follicle, from shaving, i assume.      now this epilator hurts like the powers of hell.  i am not lying.  i cannot express how bad the pain is.  i&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s but THIS WAS THE MOST PAIN I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.  i started crying midway through my first leg.  (seriously).  luckily the epilator is so darn loud my roomates couldn&#x27;t hear me.  i had tears, sweat, and mucous streaming down my face as i sobbed -- my legs were twitching horribly and i winced and gritted my teeth against the firey stinging.  i couldn&#x27;t even get through both legs!  (i&#x27;m doing the other one today).  however... my leg is NOTICEABLY SMOOTHER and has less hair.  SO... i fully intend to continue this.  i&#x27;m tired of being hairy.      update:  the pain is getting easier to deal with.  the ingrowns SUCK.  what a waste of my time, pulling ingrown hairs out.  ugh.  and it still hurts A LOT.  it doesnt get my legs smooth either... i still have to shave.  i dont know about this thing... my legs look ugly.  and they have odd stubble.  is it worth it?  sigh.  :(</li>
    <li> Ordered this epilator for my wife and she loves it. She says it takes some getting used to of the pain at first but overall it works great.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of stubborn dark hair on my legs. I cant shave because I get ingrown hairs, dipilatory is only half reliable, and waxing was costing a fortune. The pain is no worse then waxing, and the results are better! Just take a tylenol/advil a half hour before you start using it and that will help. The thing is very very loud - as in lawn mower loud. Still its worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought it because one friend recommend it to me, and she was right, it works very well and I obtaint all the benefits that the product said.</li>
    <li> What most of these reviewers have been writing, I can also attest to.  It works, the hair grows back less and less.   The 1st time is very painful, but if you keep epilating every few days after the 1st time, you will never be pulling out so many hairs at once-thus no more pain.  And over time, less hair grows back.     I took a few weeks to write this to be sure of the performance of this product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely same item that you would buy for 30 dollars more at a regular store.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this product based on the reviews that I read on Amazon.  Well, they led me astray.  Enormously!  This product created ingrown hairs on every inch of my body.  PLUS, this product hurts so badly!!!!  I am very tolerant to pain (I ran, training for a marathon, with a broken foot for over a week and didn&#x27;t even know it was broken, but knew my foot hurt).  Anyway, this product is absolutely impossible.  I am going to stick to Nair and my razor thank you very much!    I used this product on my legs and arms with the same, very painful, results from both locations.  I was really hoping that I would be able to use this on my underarms.  NEVER EVER!!!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect - I didnt like to shave because of the prikley feeling the next day, so I would wax but it would take a long time. I find that the epilator works very well and my legs stay smooth for a couple of weeks. It takes a little more time than shaving but I find it to be more effective since it tweezes the hair from the roots. I dont find it painful at all. So far I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs. The light is very helpful too. Highly recommend it.  Update Feb 2012 - I have used this for over 2 years now - still going strong, and very glad I made the purchase. Highly recommend it. The light feature is very helpful too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had purchased the same model about 4 years ago, really liked it, and needed a replacement. I expected the style to have changed over the years but not the quality of the new epilator and shaver. It&#x27;s now cheaply made and the shaver is duller than the one I have been using for several years. I have returned this product.</li>
    <li> BEST INVENTION so far besides space rockets. Do not waist your time or money. THIS is the BEST PRODUCT you can get!!!!</li>
    <li> My advice to every woman to buy BRAUN epilator... this brand is really very good and easy to use :)</li>
    <li> Okay, so I saw all the wonderful reviews and thought I found a cheaper way to \\&quot;wax.\\&quot; Boy was my head high up in the clouds. I guess one thing I should have looked for in the reviews was the thickness of the person&#x27;s hair. My legs rival a brillo pad. I have my legs waxed but the hair still grows out pretty coarse and thick. Guess I should thank my parents&#x27; genes for that one. Anyway, right off the bat I realized I made a mistake purchasing the silk-epil. Not only did it hurt like \\&quot;insert word\\&quot;, it barely took any hair with it. You have to hold it at a complete 90 degree angle and pray with every stroke for it to nab just a few hairs. The rest of your skin is left looking like you took up giving yourself lashes. Mind you, I wasn&#x27;t pressing into the skin at all - following the instructions to the letter. I, in my brilliant state of mind, decided that \\&quot;gee, I must be missing something here\\&quot; and tried my other leg. Heaven help me! I am so sorry for all the wrong I have ever done. Please make the pain stop! My legs are now burning, red and ready to walk away from me on their own. I have a very high tolerance for pain but this broke all barriers. Moral of my experience: If you have coarser hair, you might want to think twice about purchasing this particular epilator. If you have baby fine hair that won&#x27;t feel like fish hooks being ripped from your skin, then you might consider this for purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun, I love it, I decided to purchase a new one, read the reviews and bought this one.  If you have coarse hair, please dont ever use this, after 3 months, I have had extremely bad ingrown hair and infected follicles.  I had to actually pay so much to go to a salon and she removed the ingrown hair for me, and I still cannot seem to get all of them..  I stopped epilators.. I am scared to go back.. I now shave and use Tend skin. Please dont buy this one.. you will have ingrown hair issues.</li>
    <li> good product , above other in the same class but a verry noisy epilator . OMG is like turning the lawn mower on .</li>
    <li> Smooth epilation. Did not have ny issues with performance or effectiveness. Performed as a Braun product is expected to. Not the cheapest option however worth the money. Much preffered over emjoi epilators.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my first time using an epilator. i read other reviews about how painful it can be, but i have to disagree. it feels slightly prickly, but that&#x27;s about it. it works very well and the attached light was a great idea...it helps you notice even the smallest or thinnest hair. the different attachments are nice. it&#x27;s kind of loud, so, it makes it a bit intimidating when using it. i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but i thought it was able to be charged. i found it kind of annoying that i had to have it plugged in while using it. i don&#x27;t have many complaints. if you hate to shave or wax like me, i suggest you give this a try.</li>
    <li> Quite frankly, I was a little nervous about this product due to the multitude of \\&quot;it hurt so much!\\&quot; reviews. However, I just moved to a house with a pool and need an affordable hair-removable solution that doesn&#x27;t take all kinds of time (like shaving) so I gave it a try. I was incredibly impressed. Sure, it pinched, but I did not find it intolerable. I didn&#x27;t need any pain meds which surprised me. I started with my legs, both calves and thighs, but plan to use it in other areas as well.   The only disappointment I had was that my legs were not super-smooth the first time. I don&#x27;t know if this will improve or not, but as a married mother of two that is not my primary concern anyway. They look hair-free so I can wear a bathing suit or dress without an issue. It does not work really well on the super-fine blond hair on my upper thighs, but again, I didn&#x27;t always shave there anyway!  I will definitely be recommending this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> The Braun Epilator is my new best friend!  Ok so I was at my wits end with shaving.  I am hypoallergenic and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how much of a pain that makes hair removal; I know it&#x27;s a pain enough for the average woman but my skin is so sensitive that I loathe the thought of having to shave.  I was skeptical to try and epilator but it was getting to the point where shaving wasn&#x27;t an option any longer and waxing was too much work for too much money.  I read as many reviews as I could find, and did my research.  This epilator ended up looking like the most bang for my buck...  so I went ahead and decided to give it a try.  I used it for the first time last night thinking I was going to be disappointed with yet another failure.  On my first go I tried it on the \\&quot;Slow\\&quot; setting and with the massage head (this is supposed to be easier and not hurt as much).  To my amazement it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!  And it pulled the hairs out like magic!  So, without blinking an eye I put on the \\&quot;Expert\\&quot; head and used the high setting.  EASY!  I said out loud, \\&quot;I&#x27;m never going to have to shave again!\\&quot;  And I was so excited I called my best friend to tell her about my incredible new find.  I&#x27;m even so happy with this I am getting her one for her birthday.  So, here&#x27;s the breakdown: don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does feel like every hair is being plucked out of your skin but it&#x27;s really not bad at all.  If you are reading this review you are probably as fed up with hair removal as I was and this is your answer!  Don&#x27;t let the idea that it may hurt sway you in the slightest!  It&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t get used to, and ladies if you are reading this and you&#x27;ve ever gotten a tattoo this is completely doable!!!  It is NOTHING in comparison.  And to those of you that don&#x27;t know what that feels like still listen to me when I say that you can use this product.  I also like that it comes with a ladies shaver head too, so you really are getting the most for your money.  Try it!  I bet you&#x27;ll be wishing you had found it sooner.  Just think, you could say to yourself, \\&quot;I never have to shave again!\\&quot;had found it sooner.  Just think, you could say to yourself, \\&quot;I never have to shave again!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I just got it and love it.  I was scared at first because I knew it was going to hurt plus it is pretty noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works awesome!!!  It felt about like the tattoo I got a few years back.  Painful but tolerable.  Waxing hurts much worse and is just more difficult.  Not to mention that the wax sticks to your skin too!  The epilator never caught my skin, just hair.  Im silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little redness in some areas but its gone now.  The head is small enough to get most everything you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hopped out of the shower, dryed off and got started.  Im very happy that i purchased this epilator!</li>
    <li> I am sorry to have wasted my money on this product.  I purchased the Braun 5270 as a replacement for my Remington Smooth&amp;Silky EP-1000 that has  served me well for the last 6-7 years of regular use.  By comparison the Braun left many hairs even after repeated passes over my legs, and yes, I know how to use an epilator properly.  In addition, the construction seems flimsy compared to the Remington model which is no longer available for purchase.  I wish I had tried the Emjoi AP-10L with the gold plated feature.</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant to buy an epilator, since I have a low pain tolerance!  But I bought this one, thinking it was a nice mid-price option, and I actually like it!  Gives GREAT results and I actually don&#x27;t dread using it like I was afraid would happen :)  Comes with a nice long cord, the light is very nice to have, and the attachment to use it like an electric shaver.  Only thing I&#x27;m kind of disappointed in is that I have to epilate once a week, not once a month like I thought it would be.  tip: don&#x27;t give up on using this if it hurts too bad.  just go over one spot over and over, until you get used to it.  then you won&#x27;t have a problem with the pain.</li>
    <li> I have gotten waxed several times.  I noticed that there were still little hairs the wax didn&#x27;t get.  I would go home and tweeze as many as I could with relatively no pain.  Well, I thought I was getting tough and could handle doing it all myself at home.  I bought this epilator (my first ever) and it hurt worse than waxing.  When you wax, it&#x27;s a quick motion, this thing has to be dragged slowly up your leg.  I would have to force my arm to continue up my leg it hurt so bad.  It did seem to cut some skin where it raises up around the hair.  I even used it on my boyfriend who is very pain tollerant.  After it was on his arm for 2 seconds he pulled his arm away.  Spend the money to get waxed.</li>
    <li> I used this for 6 months and LOVED it!  Then I noticed that my legs were getting bumpy.  I was exfoliating regularly to try to ward of the ingrown hairs and thought it was working but soon my legs were covered in them.  My legs were an unsightly mess for over a year.  After not using it for over a year and using every ingrown hair product I could get my hands on my legs look OK.  A few more scars to show for it but at least they aren&#x27;t covered in red bumps anymore.  So sad, cause I really did love not having to shave all the time.  I know of 2 other people who I told about this when I loved it.  They also bought it and had the same problem with the ingrown hairs and had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> very impressed with the quality, easy to use, fast results. pain is noticeable, but i have tattoos and this pinch doesnt even compare to an ink needle so the process honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me as far as pain is concerned. definitely prefer this to waxing-- 10 thumbs up!! thank you!!</li>
    <li> Its working good but its bit pain full when u r using it for first time...</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair.  Always have.  I look for new better ways to get rid of said hair reguarly.  A few years ago, I purchased an excellent well-reviewed epilator machine that worked like a charm until it finally died on me.  I replaced it with this Braun epilator, and wow.  I had not felt that kind of pain since using the original models of the Epilady about 20 years ago.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about it, but every rotation, ever hair grabbed, is too much pain that one should be having with such a machine.  Also, the cord is just too short.  I don&#x27;t know how to return it, but wish I could.  It just lays there now, collecting dust.  I&#x27;ll be looking for and replacing with the original if I can, with its completely reasonable pain level and option to go cord-less.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my wife.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She has been using it ever since, and says its so much better than shaving.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think I like her legs better than with the shaving...</li>
    <li> Of course I was nervous to try this, even more so after I first turned it on and saw how it worked.  The legs didnt hurt much at all for me, bikini area not too bad either, but the underarms hurt like bloody hell!  It seriously took me about a 20 minutes each arm because I couldn&#x27;t bear it and had to keep taking small breaks in between.  But I have to say the results are amazing and definately worth a few minutes of discomfort.  Thats just my opinion-of course everyone&#x27;s pain tolerance is different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would highly suggest you at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> Hi, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Item I liked so much. I recieved the Order in time... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Regards, &lt;br /&gt;Miranda</li>
    <li> Ugh. Too painful to tolerate for more than 3 seconds at a time. Stick to shaving and waxing - this product was a major waste of money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of it, changed my life and my daily routine.    At first use my legs were covered in red dots, they stung minimally and were irritate for the next two days.  That was the worst of it.  Since then the follicles have become less noticeable (I swear I am not caucasian but translucent)and my legs stay fairly smooth with out the need for a touch up for at least 4-5 days.  And when I say touch up I mean 3 minutes of my time.      My armpits were the trickiest area but the pain wasn&#x27;t enough to detract me from using it.  Having said that the armpit area actually looked the nicest afterward. However, I think that armpit hair must serve some super special secret function because it grows back faster than any other hair.      I bought this because I recently bought a wax set from Gigi and lets just say that I am a lazy coward.  This hurts significantly less that waxing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes that it would make my chin smooth and silky, like I read in so many reviews for various body parts.  However, for me that was not the case.  This left my chin with more stubbles than I have ever had and it left me even more self conscious than I was prior to.  Oh well, back to tweezing and plucking!!!  Since, I have been able to get the skin smooth again, but was hoping for a quick fix, such as an epilator, but in my case, that did not work.  I wonder if I can return this product after use.  Minimal use, but nonetheless, use.</li>
    <li> I like this product. However, I have been using it as directed for 1 month, and I have yet to not have stuble. I think that it pulls lots of hairs from the root, but it also breaks some off. This causes the stuble. I have noticed that some hairs take weeks to grow back, but a lot grow back within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have always shaved, SHAVE FIRST, then use the epilator every day for two weeks. This will DRASTICALLY reduce the pain. It does hurt, but it is true what they say about it not hurting as bad the more you use it. I think that when the hair is pulled out, it weakens the root, causing less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder helps a lot. Make sure you use the brush to clean it after every use, or it will get all jammed and it will not grip hairs. It takes about an hour to do both legs. I have not used epilators in the past, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think that it takes too long. Hopefully, if I keep using it, eventually I will get every hair and have no more stubble. BE SURE TO EXFOLIATE!!!! If you don&#x27;t YOU WILL GET INGROWN HAIRS!!! PROMISE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a good product, but don&#x27;t expect some miracle machine that makes your legs feel the way the models do after they spend hundreds on a wax job. LOL. I wanted my legs to feel like butter in my husband&#x27;s hands, but sometimes I find myself \\&quot;checking\\&quot; my legs to be sure I won&#x27;t scratch him! That is something I never did when I shaved. I hope it gets better. LOL.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I have ever used and I love it! I&#x27;ve only waxed my legs once in my life and HATED it b/c it hurt so bad and because it never got all the hair on my legs. I do not have a high tolerance for pain so I was a bit nervous about trying this but it really didnt hurt that much, its like a mild stinging (it helps if you use the protective thing with the little blue rollers that it comes with). AND it definitely gets the fine hairs too (like the ones on the thigh), you just have to go over the area a few times. I havent tried it on my bikini area yet, but the epilator comes with an electric shaver which is awesome if you are too nervous to use the epilator on sensitive areas. FYI Silk-Epil IS a bit noisy but I dont really have anything to compare it to except for men&#x27;s electric shavers (its not too much louder than that). Oh, and the shorter the hair the less it hurts, I swear! I am not sure if this epilator would be great for everyone but it definitely worked for me and I have medium-coarse hair and pretty sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Having used epilators when they first came out many years ago, I can tell you the difference is astounding.  I purchased an \\&quot;Emjoi\\&quot; epilator first and while it was a major improvement over the originals, the Braun far surpasses it.  Within the first 2 or 3 uses you don&#x27;t even feel discomfort and the growth rate of hair is reduced considerably.  I will never go back to shaving or any other hair removal system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, as far as reliability, I have an original Braun battery powered epilator that was made for removal of the hair on your upper lip.  I don&#x27;t even know how old it is, although it is well into double digits.  Still running.</li>
    <li> I just received my epilator 2 days ago, I used to be a regular waxer cause I loved the smooth skin after waxing but It hurted me a lot, so I tried shaving for a while but it was not satisfactory for me. when I bought this epilator I found it like Magic, it does not hurt as much as waxing and definitly my legs and arms feel much more smooth than shaving. It met all my expectations and exceeded cause actually I was expecting it to be more painfull but it was not. I know that this epilator is much more better than others cause I have tried once in a couple of years an old model that my sister had and it hurted me a lot back then. &lt;br /&gt;so in Short I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a fast shaver get this one, is clean and fast to use</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator for years and it finally died on me. I searched around and bought the Braun based on positive reviews.  I am so happy with it!  It is very easy to use, works fast, versitile, and really is less painful than my old model.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Does what it says. Takes much longer than waxing of course but good.  Takes the really tiny hair out as well. Using something to take care of the ingrown hair would be a good idea though. The light really really helps to see the hair. I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months now and love it.</li>
    <li> The Braun 5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator sounds like it works in one use, but not really. You are still require to use it almost every week or every other day because the hair that was too short to be pulled out will grow out and make your legs feel stubby again. But what&#x27;s cool about this Epilator is that you can actually see the root of the hair that&#x27;s pulled out. It&#x27;s hard to work around the knee. But I love the flash light, it really helps me see the tiny hair I&#x27;m trying to pull. My guess is that you&#x27;ll have to use it 5-6 days consecutively before you will actually get silky legs. You&#x27;ll feel little pinches on your legs but you&#x27;ll get use to that feeling.    Don&#x27;t even get me started on the armpits. It hurts/burn like hell. I was brave enough to do two armpits because after using it on one armpit, I was ready to stop there. Definitely not a good idea for the sensitive area but hair did grew a little slower and when it grew out, the hair seem less thick. So it&#x27;s a good trade-off.</li>
    <li> It is a good product to buy and worth the price...I found the in built light very useful...and happy with the seller also. It got shipped at the right time for me :)</li>
    <li> I just recieved my epilator a few days ago. Today, I was so thrilled to finally get to use it; I wanted smoothless skin everywhere too! So, after reading so many reviews, I first thought, maybe everyone who said it hurt was just wimps, but no, they are not. I am a wimp! This sucker hurt so bad, I am not even kiddinG, I couldn&#x27;t even finish after two minutes! I have no idea what I am to do with this &#x27;satan&#x27; hair remover. I am so scared to try it again!! I will say the one tiny patch I was able to do, is hairless and smooth, but I honestly must say it was terrible and felt like an hour!!! I really can&#x27;t say if I will ever be able to totally complete my bikini area. I have never been so frightened in my life. Let&#x27;s just say, that a tattoo on my side was a piece of cake compared to the epilator. One perck, is that the shaver worked very well. Another purchase you may consider is the \\&quot;Princereigns\\&quot;- Ingrown hair serum.. I bought both product together, and after going through the nightmare with the epilator, I must say that the serum really soothed it. I hope someone can give me some advise on getting through this. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> I get really terrible ingrown hairs from shaving.  Plus - I have super sensitive skin.  The more I shave - the itcher and sadder my legs look from all the issues.  No more shaving!      Here is the pain comparison.  It hurts LESS to shave the legs than waxing.  It&#x27;s hurts MORE to shave the bikini area with this.      The cord is somewhat short - but I wonder if it&#x27;s because they think we&#x27;ll shave in the shower or something with it.  Little bag is cheapo - but sufficient.  Attachments are just fine.  Everything comes apart for cleaning - yes - it needs to be brushed off after use.      I gotta say -that stupid little light was decent.  It turned out to be a nice bonus.  Yes, worth having.    Performance?  Yeah - it&#x27;s pretty good.  For the really really fine hairs on the upper half of your leg.... ehhh - not so great.      The shaver is loud - and those nubby rollers that say they help with the pain - yeah whatever.    I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for someone who wants to switch from shaving.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.  I use it ~ every 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!  I haven&#x27;t had to shave my underarms for weeks!  I shaved it initially and when it started to grow back I took a long warm shower and started using the epilator.  It pulled the hair out from the root and I only felt a slight pinch.  My pain tolerance is not that high.  I think the warm shower is key...I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll shave ever again!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I have tried. I normally do shaving and waxing. I read the reviews which did say that they stayed hair free for weeks(I wish, great for them). I wanted something that was easier and would last longer than waxing. My hair usually grows back by the 3rd day after waxing. I like this better but I am disappointed that the hair comes back fast 4 days for me max. but it is smoother hair. Under the arms grows back faster and really hurts to use the epilator there. I will continue using it because at least I don&#x27;t have to deal with the messy wax.</li>
    <li> First off, some parts (the cooling glove and the smart start head) are missing, as other previous customers have complained.  How is it that they can advertise a product as coming with certain parts, and then you get a box which doesn&#x27;t contain all the parts advertised?      Secondly, the product does work, but it&#x27;s rather painful, and you have to keep going over the same spots repeatedly until the hairs are finally all plucked out.  Maybe I will like it better as time goes on.  I am using it regularly.  I am somewhat more used to this kind of discomfort because I have used leg wax often.  However, my 2 daughters, who usually shave, say the epilator is too painful for them to use.</li>
    <li> I was a usual waxer and couldn&#x27;t do without it until I tried Braun 5270! It&#x27;s effective, doesn&#x27;t make your hair grow thicker, pain wise it&#x27;s bearable, and you&#x27;ll save time and money.</li>
    <li> If you donot have very coarse hair growth, then dont even blink an eyelid, just buy the product.  If you do, it will be little uncomfirtable. I had very small red bumps on my arms but they went away in 2-3 days... and it was better the next time.  on my legs (relatively finer hair growth), it was smooth  used it for upperlip and chin... &#x27;lil uncomfirtable and so are any other methods that I have tried. But this is very handly and no visits required to the salon.  as written in other reviews, that little light is really useful.</li>
    <li> All my life I was afraid to try again and again another Body Epilator... before this one. I love it. It works great, event if little painful at the beginning. I definetly recommended to anyone willing to try this method.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun epilators for years, and this one is by far the best. It is much faster than the previous versions, or, it seems to me, more efficient. I can do full legs in 30 minutes tops, when before it took me over an hour. I also noticed that it really pulls the hairs from the root, instead of cutting them; that way it takes longer until your hairs grow back. The little light is very helpful too. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you are used to wax or to depilate. It might hurt to some people who have been shaving for long time. I use it for the full legs, arm pits and even bikini area without problems (and I consider myself \\&quot;Mediterranean\\&quot; type when it comes to hairs, if you know what I mean...).</li>
    <li> No more having to use tweezers on my chin or neck and trying to find the one hair that&#x27;s sticking out but can&#x27;t find where to pluck it!  So much easier.  It&#x27;s worth the \\&quot;pain\\&quot;.  I think I&#x27;m going to have to ice my upper lip though, because I tried it for a split second and it killed...  But this is great!  Doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad on the chin and neck.  The upper lip is going to be a challenge, I&#x27;m afraid...  Maybe short taps with it.  Ughhhh...  Use an ice cube maybe...</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product about a month ago and have used it ever since.  It works well, does its job well and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad. The only problem is that there are some small ingrown hairs that don&#x27;t come out, and you basically have to use it about every day if you really don&#x27;t want to have any hair sticking out.  Other than that it is a good product, the little light it has helps a lot, and it does its job well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the epilator, the poblem ocurred when I travelled to the UAE where the source power is 220v, even though I used a converter from 220 to 110, the epilator just burnt.    Please be aware of the power source.</li>
    <li> If you can tolerate the pain under your armpits for the first few times and tolerate the pain if this is your first time buying this then you will never want to go back to shaving. Makes hair finer , takes longer to grow back and saves you money in the long run... I was using a Venus shaver in which I had to replace every so often and was spending way too much money on it... Amazon&#x27;s price on this product is lower than anywhere I found and it&#x27;s a great product.. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs the hair on their legs, arms, armpits, ... to stay away longer and to become finer.</li>
    <li> I have waxed myself for years.  I became totally sick of the whole process; heat up the wax, get out the strips and the baby powder, blah blah blah - then you have the clean up...not to mention, if it was bad &#x27;waxing day&#x27; it is totally possible that you bruised yourself in the process (I&#x27;ve done it).    So, based on the other reviews, I bought this little do-dad.  I freakin&#x27; love it!!!!  Personally I think it hurts way less than waxing!!!  You might be wondering &#x27;where do you use it?&#x27;...answer, on my legs and bikini line - and I&#x27;m totally serious when I say that it hurts way less than waxing.  I use it about once a week or so, right after i get out of the shower.  It&#x27;s quick and very effective - takes me less than 5 min to the job.  The light is awesome - the other folks were right when they told you that it really illuminates every little hair.  I guess it is a little loud, but frankly after dealing with wax - I&#x27;ll put up with the sound of a little motor for the whole 5 min that i use it.  There is little to no clean up and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bumps or in-grown hairs.  If you are currently using wax and you are considering making the switch to an epilator I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This works great.   But I am wondering why on the earth they have doubled it&#x27;s price? I have purchased it from amazon itself for 64.49 bucks(new piece) in Feb 2011 &amp; now it is of 132!!!   This product is good but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $132.  Anyway I am happy that I got it at older price.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I was given the original Epi-Lady, which was a torture device. Consequently, when my daughter-in-law bought a Braun Epil System, I thought she must be nuts!!  But I am much older and so tired of shaving, I gave it a shot and ordered the Braun 5270 Silk-epil.  I was all set for the pain, but I didn&#x27;t experience any!  Unbelievable!  The Braun Epis of today are the best way to go to get rid of unwanted hair.  I even use it on my underarms and only feel a little prick.  So, ladies out there, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you have ever used any other epilator you will find this to be the best ever.  Rids hair for at least a week and when it does grow in hair is lighter and softer.  Only downfall is it&#x27;s not rechargeable and must be used with the cord.</li>
    <li> Wow...  this is the TOPs of Braun line. I have been using Braun epilator since 1996.. I decided to get a new one cause I lost the cable/cord ,, but my old epilator is still running.  Any ways  You  must learn how to use this product and you will love it:     to start using this epilator,,  you must shave first   than  you use it aprox  3 to 5 days after your hairs have grown a little.  Please dont use this epilator if your hair are about an Inch long, because it is going to really  hurt you...       aprox the first 3  times you use the epilator  it is going to hurt you,,  but you will get used to. By the time you use the epilator more than 2 times...  you will see your hairs growing thiner and thiner,,,  and each time it will less pain and less hair growing...      Make sure you always use this product right after you shower or have taken a bath so your pores are open... DO Not use any creams or powders if you are going to use the epilator..      I dont know about the shaver part that come with this epilator cause I have no need to shave.    Maintain the epilator by cleaning it every time you use it. This product will last you  for ever...  Good Bye hairy legs !!!!</li>
    <li> Yes it hurts and Yes it works. I though this would be the solution to all my unwanted hair  but I am really disapointed because the reason I bought this is because waxing breaks me out and this did the exact same thing! Every spot I used the epilator has red bumps on it that looks like acne and then it turns into acne! I used this on my face and on my lower back, so its either have unatractive hair or have unatractive acne.. I guess you really should just use on your legs but thats not where I need hair removal :(</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt , actuallly it is quite nice to use ( on legs) but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job at taking the hair from the root . It cuts many hairs, so those hairs come back as if you have shaven them. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for underarms. It just doesn&#x27;t take anything out. Bikini line , tried once , but I need to get more courage to try again. it takes about 5 strokes to get it right.     Nice handle, wouldn&#x27;t buy the same one again.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I love it! It&#x27;s soooo much better than waxing because there&#x27;s nothing to stick to your skin. I thought it might be easy to pinch myself but I haven&#x27;t at all. I love that it comes with all the different attachments so it&#x27;s great for beginners and experts alike. I also love the light feature. It helps a lot. It&#x27;s a little scary at first because of the noise and the fact the head is spinning so fast but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s easy to use and not as painful (depending on the area) as I thought. I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, legs, bikini, underarms, and face and it works everywhere. You just have to go in different directions to get all the hairs. If you&#x27;re looking for something quick, this is not it. It does take time to get all of the hairs removed especially since your body has curves. Also, your hairs grow at different rates so when you start out you may have to use it a couple days in a row but then you will have a lasting result. Be warned... you may get addicted to hair removal because of this product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of this little machine.  It&#x27;s true that the first time especially it definitely hurts, as you have the most hair then, but it&#x27;s not unbearable if you&#x27;ve waxed before.  I&#x27;d been shaving for much of the winter, so it was especially uncomfortable the first time I used it, as I had a lot of shaving regrowth.  However, now I can just get the little bit of regrowth whenever I like, and due to the cycle of hair regrowth (just some regrows at a time), it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all as it&#x27;s so little hair to pull each time.  It will be so much easier, so much less messy, &amp; so much less time-consuming than waxing!      I&#x27;m also the sort of person that when they shave, the hair is already stubbly and gross the next day, so waxing or something of that sort is essential for me.  I&#x27;ve only done touch-ups in the past month (which is much more easily done than with waxing), but my legs have stayed mostly hairless the whole time.  I use it on my legs and arms currently so I can only attest to those (I can&#x27;t stand to do my armpits- it is too sensitive!!- and I had my bikini-line laser-removed 2 years ago, so there&#x27;s nothing there to test.  I&#x27;d never done my arms before but was tempted with this product as I&#x27;ve long disliked the dark hair there.  It seems to do well so far with that too.).        As with waxing, ingrown hairs can be a problem on your legs, so you need to experiment to find what works for you.  I use a loofah, but it&#x27;s not totally perfect, so am still looking for the best solution- sometimes something like a medicated scrub on a loofah or something like that seems to do it.      So far, this product has greatly helped me and made my life easier- I&#x27;m very happy with it.  For those that can stand waxing, I&#x27;d highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of brands! this model for me is the best I have ever tried. Painless (compare to the others!) and very efficient.  I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> BRILLIANT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bears repeating &#x3D;0) I am a mom with two young girls (4 &amp; 1)so I cannot be  a religious waxer no matter how much I love the effect/convenience.  This ingenious handheld has answered my prayers; Simplicity and ease... and it get the job done! Yes it takes me approx a half hr but that includes my shower, so I do not mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so it is not completely painless and it does carry a bit of a sting, if you are not used to the pull from the tiny tweezers, especially where the hair is coarse.  I suggest, to ease up the bite, you stretch any loose skin taut when gliding the epilator over it; and also for me the highest setting causes the least amount of irritation(if any).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, truly this removes the hair safely and easily and I discovered that if my skin got caught by mistake the device immediately shut off, so as to avoid ANY cuts or scrapes... WOW!  Could you imagine what a mess if it didn&#x27;t?!  And I didn&#x27;t even think to check for that... thank God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really IS the BEST hair remover I have EVER used... EVER!!! And as a mom and wife who is in the process of packing to relocate to another country, let me just say... to not worry about looking unkempt where shaving is concerned for a couple weeks and keeping an expensive appointment?  HAHAHA,  That&#x27;s one huge worry off my mind - now if only I could get Braun to invent something for the rest of my other day-to-day inconveniences.....</li>
    <li> Got this a few days ago and am OVERJOYED. My legs look and feel amazing. It works. It&#x27;s fast. It&#x27;s cost effective. It&#x27;s weirdly fun -- same satisfaction you get when vacuuming a dirty floor, hehe.  Way better than home waxing (messy, time-consuming, hard to get back side); salon waxing (whoowee, pricey); shaving (I nick myself and it comes back the next day so it&#x27;s endless); creams (smelltakular and messy); laser (haven&#x27;t tried that one but thought about it and can&#x27;t justify cost/risk).     It&#x27;s a bit loud so prepare yourself for that. Does it hurt? Didn&#x27;t bother me on my legs (but I have self-waxed). Maybe a bit pinchy at times and I did have some dots on my legs (slight irritation) after wards that subsided in about half an hour (don&#x27;t whip this out right before you&#x27;re gonna showcase your gams). A quarter inch length made it easy to grip and remove hairs but it got shorter ones too. You do have to pass it back and forth to get &#x27;em all (i.e., more like a vacuum than a lawn mower).     I tried it on my armpits. Whoa nellie! Had to grit my teeth and just did a teeny area at a time. But ahhh totally worth it. It&#x27;s so easy to use that you can grab it, run in back and forth over any new sprouts in 30 sec and be done (since hairs will come in at different times). And then you can smile knowing they won&#x27;t be back for a few weeks.    DO get this version, not the cheaper one cause the light is FANTASTIC. Look, yer gonna be using this for years and years, so pony up and treat yourself. You will be happy. Also, be prepared to use the wee brush that comes with it to clean it out (a toothbrush would work well too).     Tried it on bikini line. See notes above on armpits. Trim to quarter inch if ya need to. I&#x27;m just sayin.    Finally, i will share that I did it with no skin preparation (exfoliation, washing etc.). I just wrestled that sucker out of the incredibly frustrating packaging (have scissors or axe handy), plugged it in and had at it. Worked just fine. For Legs of Devastating Glory I would 1) use this night before; 2) exfoliate with awesome salt scrub next morning; 3) lavish with rich moisturizer. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This is a useful product for girls with lots of body hair! I bought it for my girl friend. But she was very lazy to use it. Anyways, we broke up after a while and I don&#x27;t have any idea how the device works now!</li>
    <li> Wonderful packing and shipping service. I only had to wait 2 days to get my epilator, and free shipping!    The epilator was more than a expected, I am a user of epilators since I was 18 so I know what I am talking about (39y). This one is the best I had:   - the smart-light which is the best addition ever, now I don&#x27;t have to go around with a lamp to get the hair at the back of my legs  -It pulls the hairs out at once (any length).    - And with the pro-efficient head it works faster! and it is easier to clean (less hair gets attached to the epilator&#x27;s head and tweezers). I even depilated my bikini area using the pro-efficient head.    Pain? almost non existent but I am an old epilator and wax user. it hurts less than waxing though, and there&#x27;s no mess.  Sturdy? I don&#x27;t know yet.I read other reviews and didn&#x27;t find any repetitive/weird defect, like stop running after a week.  I truly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  After years of depilatories, waxing, regular and electric razors I have found freedom.  I use this all over my body.  It only hurts a lot the first time.  If you &#x27;dot in&#x27; and remove quickly at first it will pluck the areas gradually.  It takes a few days at first to remove all of the hair.  After the first use, I use it every 3 days or so.  Since hair grows in gradually &amp; at different paces its quick, simple and comfortable to use.  No more embarassing stubble, smooth perfect skin.  This is one of the best items I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have waxed for about 2 years, but it has just gotten too expensive. So, I decided to give this a shot. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it hurt...a lot. But, you must keep in mind this was the bikini area. It removed most of the hair within one or two swipes, which was a relief, and left a smooth result. I&#x27;m really happy with it, now use it all of the time (it hurts less and less each time). Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was impressed that it actually didn&#x27;t hurt very much - it was a lot less painful than waxing, and after the first time using it it was even less painful. I feel like it is more surprising than painful at first. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it takes a while and you have to use it, clean it, use it again. A LOT cheaper than waxing, and I do recommend it, but know you have to dedicate a bit of time.</li>
    <li> I cannot lie. It was really harsh the first few times on my armpits. It was almost unbarable. I got through it and have PRETTY PITS! They have no five o clock shadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair that grows back takes a long time and is very fine. This is why it doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore. The coarser the hair is, the more it hurts. The more you get rid of it, the finer the hair becomes. I imagine one day it wont even come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really about how bad you want the results. If you want them badly, you will get them. Painful at first though.</li>
    <li> Supper fast delivery:) excellent product:) I used other brands too but this one is the best one in pulling even very small hair out! I use it for bikini area and armpit and it makes my skin to feel very smooth. The light also helps to see the hair easier. For the time using any of these kind of hair removal expect to feel pain. But after you passed the pain step enjoy not shaving for weeks and very smooth skin :) I love my white/blue friend:)</li>
    <li> I love this epilator. Its one of the best stuff I got from amazon. Though epilation is painful, this product makes it a little less painful. The massage epilation head works very well. In grown hair could be a menace if not looked after carefully. Other wise this product has been of good use. I have and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good epilator.</li>
    <li> Waxing is what im used to but its too time consuming at times. My friend had this Epilator and Ive used it at times and just had to get one of my own. Although it can be really painful (depending on where you use it) it is works great and is quick. I gave it 5 stars because does what its meant to do and very effectivly. Although there is pain involved, you should know that going into it with any hair removal system. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a rather old epilator on my arms for several years now, and what was previously pain is now tingling I barely even notice. I&#x27;ve always chickened out when it came to using the thing on my legs, but lately I&#x27;ve become so frustrated with shaving that I forced myself to go through with it. Ow ow ow! Just as bad as I remember. While the model I was using was still a Braun and served me faithfully for a very long time, it just wouldn&#x27;t pick up hairs until I ran it over the area again. And again. And a painful again. Completely fed up but still determined to get the job done, I went out and bought this newer X&#x27;elle.    The difference is astounding. It removes almost every hair in a single stroke without breaking it, and doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much. The glee! Now that I&#x27;ve successfully and fully epilated my legs, I just need to do weekly touch-ups - and these take only a few minutes. I&#x27;m a very happy girl!    You will want to avoid dealing with in-grown hair however. Exfoliating every few days is very important, and I also use a home-made Tendskin mixture (the recipe for which can be easily found through a search engine) to prevent inflammation and red bumps. I&#x27;ve noticed that it makes a huge difference in the appearance and feel of my skin after an epilating session.    Overall, this device is a large improvement over the epilator I previously had, and shaving is definitely a thing of the past. If you stick to it, the discomfort will diminish to a negligible thing. And the process is well-worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is great. So far, ive only tried it on my legs, and the results were great. Yes, it hurts but not as much as some make it seem. Personally, I would describe it as... medium discomfort. The only drawback so far has been the constant ingrowns, but with some exfoliation and moisture they seem to be going away. Plus you can&#x27;t beat not having to worry about the unsightly dark hairs coming back after a couple of days. After using the epilator you can stay smooth for weeks!!    yay!    It&#x27;s a good product overall, and the light is amaaazing for getting to all the hairs you didn&#x27;t think you had.</li>
    <li> I bought  this 2 months back and and after trying it for first time I waited for 2 months to leave here a true experinece. My first reaction was why didn&#x27;t somebody tell me about this before this !I have been struggling to find a better way to get myself waxed! This is a no mess and very fast thing. I did it while watching TV so really didnt bother much if it hurts.Its 2 months I did my arms and they are yet not due and I will wait for 1 to 2 weeks more. My legs I did 1 month back and they are somewhat due now. I did my underarms and it stay clean and soft for 2-3 weeks. Does it hurt?? NO for me on arms and legs. Underarms does hurt but i did it twice and would do again. I was a regular waxer of arms &amp; legs &amp; this item goes beyond expectations. I run a icecube to the area I do and then lotion massage for 5 mints and no bumps at all for me . It comes with 2 attachements, an epilator and a shaver as well in the same pack.for me its like a kitchen without a dishwasher now:) cant do without this item!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and easy to use.  It does an excellent job on my under-arm hair but be careful in using it on one&#x27;s more \\&quot;intimate\\&quot; areas!  It pinched me and drew blood, probably because I was unable to actually see and was using it \\&quot;blind\\&quot; so to speak.  It does indeed seem to cut down on the frequency of how often one has to use it as time goes on.  My hair is not coarse and is rather sparse, being a redhead, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work with coarser hair.    Would recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> This is a very reliable product. Light and easy to use. Most of all, it works well. I like its smooth touch and feel. It is really good to clean and trim tiny and soft things. The price from Amazon was also the cheapest.</li>
    <li> I used to have the old type of Braun Epilator and I liked it, but all of a sudden it stopped working. So I&#x27;ve got an excuse to get the new one. I was reading reviews and decided that Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator  is the best one for me. It has a lot of good features like high speed rotation, shaver and stuff like that. Personally all I needed is good high speed Epilator, but it&#x27;s very nice to have all this \\&quot;bonus\\&quot; stuff. It is not painless at all, but since it has very high speed you will not suffer for too long :)The very process could not be painless - this is obvious!!!!By the way a few day later I checked my old Epilator and it was working again :),but I am glad that I already bought the new one because it is much better!I love it. I would recommend it for my friend for sure!</li>
    <li> Ok, it does hurt- especially underarms.  I was sweating it hurt so much.  But that was my first time epilating/waxing in that area.  Legs were uncomfortable, not unbearable.  But the bikini line, (waxing 2 yrs) was fine.  Not more uncomfortable than waxing, but more convenient and less expensive ($53 a visit).    So here&#x27;s the thing.  If you have daughters, long-run plan, teach them to epilate before they shave.  It lasts longer and they won&#x27;t scar their legs with razor cuts.  Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this epilator. I am a regular waxer and the problem with that is that you have to wait for the hair to be at least 1/4\\&quot; long before you can wax again. I used this for my lower legs and it works.... I have been able to wear skirts and shorts all through spring and summer. :)  The thing really pulls out the tiniest hairs and is SOOOOOOOO much better than shaving!  Ah! yes, the pain?  Its really a tingly stinging sensation. And after a couple of times of using it  you dont even feel that.  Use the pressure-before-pain techinique, i.e. use the fingers of your free hand to stretch out the skin before you go over it and you will be fine.  Upper thighs are more sensitive so you might want to test before, however I have used it on the inner thighs and very satisfied.  Its great to take out those stray hairs on your toes and the tops of your feet if you are one of those hobbit ladies like me! :) Try it out, really. Using it just once will pay for itself considering waxing costs about $50 per session.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this hoping this would be the solution to my chest hair. I had shaved for the longest time and was sick of the stubble all the time and was hoping this would take care of the problem. First of all, this hurts like a mother____!!! Every time I used it I would start sweating and breathing hard bc of the pain, even though it became more manageable as I got used to it. Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure I was doing everything as the directions said to but I kept getting tons and tons of ingrown hairs everywhere which resulted in some nasty infections. The redness and bumpiness on my chest lasted 2-3 days (not incl ingrown hairs), and it was fairly smooth for about 4-5 days after that. However I was hoping it would have taken more time to grow back and I wouldnt have to constantly epilate every 3 days, but no such luck.     I have tried an Emjoi epilator before and that seemed to work better to be entirely honest. Took a little longer because it was smaller but it seemed to not cause so much redness and irritation, and I didnt get any ingrown hairs either. Although I only tried the Emjoi once so maybe it is the same after a few times.     I ended up giving this to my Mom, and I guess she likes it. But for guys, I would HIGHLY recommend against this. Chest hair is just too thick, goes in too many directions, and grows back too quickly to make it worthwhile. I&#x27;m back to the old razor now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year now and chose this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend money getting my arms and armpits re-waxed periodically and having to schedule numerous appointments. I didn&#x27;t need a giant two-headed epilating monster, neither. This thing is quaint and does the job. It&#x27;s also painful, but so is beauty. You get used to it over time.    It comes with two massaging heads, trimmer, epilator head, plastic trimmer guard and cleaning brush. No complaints. Braun knows what they&#x27;re doing and the price is more than reasonable.    This isn&#x27;t any cheap piece of plastic. The hardware seems to be of great, solid construction and I see myself using this for the next decade or so.    And, ladies, don&#x27;t epilate your legs, face, or pubic region. I just use this on my arms and armpits and use the trimmer on my pubic region. Epilating such a large region like the legs is ASKING for trouble, and all the other regions are just too sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is my first experienece with epilating and I must say it is a bit painful for me even after three times of usage. This despite the fact that I have been getting my body professionaly waxed every month so it&#x27;s not like I have  a low pain threshold. I love the fact that that this device has a light that makes you see hairs that you would otherwise miss, and yes, the pain is getting better with each use but I have two problems with it:  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but I have been having more ingrown hair on my legs after using this machine than I ever have.  Second, Although the manual advices against using it on very short hair (I mean hair that&#x27;s not even reached it&#x27;s mid length), I like to use it on very short hair or medium length as it eases the pain. Anybody else had a similar experience? Is there any problem with doing this?    I can&#x27;t say if the machine is better than others, but definetely worth your money as it saves you the money you&#x27;ll spend on waxing.</li>
    <li> When I started looking for a product to remove hair from the bikini area, I went between this and the Philips bikini hair removal system.  I went for this (initially) because it got slightly better reviews.  Huge mistake!  HUGE.  I lost hair and skin using this on the bikini area and it was horribly painful.  I am used to the pain of waxing so I consider myself to have a high threshold.  If you want this for the legs, I think it would be wonderful.  But for the bikini area, go for the Philips.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried the Braun, I was very surprised at how little it hurt compared to waxing.  The next day, I realized why: It seems to only be breaking off the hairs and not pulling the hair out from the root.  To be fair, I decided to use it for 6 weeks and then decide on effectiveness.   I have exclusively used the product once a week for 6 weeks and have seen no diminishing of hair and definitely no reduction on the need to shave.  After 2 days I need to shave and by the end of the week I definitely need to do something with the hair on my legs.  As far as effectiveness, it is no different than using an electric razor.  It is slower than shaving (electric or otherwise) and since there isn&#x27;t a difference in the need to shave, you are better off just shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing a few days ago and I really like it. I had another one with a foreign plug and since moving to the US I decided to get another and I am very happy I chose this. Works perfectly, light is good, clean up is not a problem. I used to wax my legs (and still do on occasion) and axing myself is tricky when you do the back of the leg, I usually get wax on th floor... yet another reason why I like this so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those customers who complained about pain... it pulls your hair out at the root and it has no pain killers in it, OF COURSE IT HURTS A BIT! This one hurts more than my last one and I don&#x27;t mind at all because I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area 5 times. I&#x27;m very happy with this and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have now used the silk-epil twice and have been pretty impressed. I have purchased 2 epilators in the past and have given them away because of the pain, but this one strips the hair out almost painlessly!!For me it&#x27;s a much better alternative to waxing as it will take out fairly short hairs so no shaggy regrowth!!!</li>
    <li> This epilator is fantastic!  It removes hair very quickly and is very effective.  My legs have never felt smoother.  I knew epilating was going to be painful but never imagined how painful it could be until I actually tried it.  I have no problems with this product, I think it&#x27;s phenomenal but it hurts like crazy!  If you can tolerate the pain then it&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I was very hesitant to buy an epilator at all because I was one of the victims of the original Epilady back in the 80&#x27;s which was a spinning coil that grabbed a bunch of hair and ripped.  Yes, it was as bad as it sounds.  I remember sitting outside in the snow hoping the cold would numb my legs enough to deal with the pain.  It didn&#x27;t.  Money wasted...      Fast forward 20 years...MAJOR leaps in technology and design were made with epilators!  I bought the Braun 5270 because I liked the idea that the massaging rollers that would help to dull some of the pain.  Well, I didn&#x27;t even need that attachment. I started with it, but quickly went to the pro clip and maximum efficiency.  I did my entire legs without a problem.  Sure, it pinched a little, but you kinda get used to it.      After my legs, I was so confident, I went on to my bikini line.  The top part, I had no problem with.  It wasn&#x27;t as painful as I had expected.  Inside my thighs, though, was another story.  I haven&#x27;t been able to conquer that or my underarms yet.  It feels like it&#x27;s getting caught on my skin even if I pull the skin tight in both of those areas.    Ladies - if you had the torture device know as the original Epilady in the 80&#x27;s and are hesitant about ever owning one again, DON&#x27;T BE!  This is nothing compared to that thing!  I wish I would have gotten one of these sooner, but I&#x27;m so glad I finally did!    I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews that said that it is painful, but bearable.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more than bearable, it&#x27;s more annoying than painful.  That was my experience anyway.  And just to put it in perspective, I&#x27;ve only waxed once...recently did full legs and full bikini.  I&#x27;m so glad I won&#x27;t have to waste my money on that again!    I hope this review helps!  If you can stand the minor annoyance of tweezing, or the pain of waxing, then buy this.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  The massaging rollers do help, but it also keeps the tweezers from getting to all of yourhair.  So, it helps, but is less efficient.    Overall, I give this product 5 stars.  I think it&#x27;s great!  I wish I bought it years ago, and if I had to do it over again, I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have been using epilady since I was 12 or 13; for about 20 years. Bought this Braun due to replacement of an old epilady. I wish I purchased this model much earlier. Better in every way than any Epilady I&#x27;ve used in a long time. Light that assists vision while removing hairs at first seemed rediculous but it really does help. Fast removal, completely does the job. Super highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun System Epilator two years ago.  It is excellent for removing facial hair ( don&#x27;t wear   \\&quot;bikini\\&quot; any more...would be nice! The Braun is still working!!!! It has reduced the hair growth. I would recommend the Epilator Cream with it...can&#x27;t remember the name....you Amazon folks...help me out with this......  susan g</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a month, and I really like it. I did follow the instructions of a previous reviewer and shaved before using it. For my legs, that was the last time I had to shave. For my armpits, they were more sensitive, so for the first couple of weeks I shaved another 2 or three times. Basically, anytime it really hurt, I shaved before epilating again. That way you kind of work yourself up to it. If you try this and it&#x27;s just way to painful, I would definitely recommend that method.    I haven&#x27;t tried any other epilators, but so far this has performed perfectly. It&#x27;s a nice shape and size. Easy to clean. I really like the light. I have also used the razor/trimmer attachment, and like that, as well. If I ever needed to replace this, I would have no problem getting the exact same one again.</li>
    <li> I have used an depilatory for years now and this, by far, gets the smallest hairs.  Great product especially the light.  Great feature.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair, and I find that I have to shave my legs a lot.  So, I bought this item and used it.  At first I could only stand to use it for about 20 seconds around my ankles, but the more I used it, the better it got.  I now use it on my legs and LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day!!  This product does exactly what it was built for... removing hair.  I now use it on my lip, which does a great job, though it&#x27;s worth the brief pain of removing it.  Plus, you don&#x27;t have the red skin from hot wax!  Great product!</li>
    <li> After a year and a half of regular use, with both the epilator and the shaving function, this product still works very well. This is much better at grabbing very short hair than previous similar epilators that I owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: after seven more years of regular use, it still works!!</li>
    <li> i had an emjoi which was much better. i read all the reviews for this one and i went for it. it definitely is not as good, but i kept it and will use it until it gets old, but i when it does i will buy an emjoi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and it seems to work great.  No problems yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as efficient as I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s painful and hair grows back within a few weeks.</li>
    <li> First OK I am I guy.....This product does remove hair as  promised. Hurts at first...you get over that it you want to be hair free... And really quite well.. My main problem is the unit&#x27;s cord. Twisted failed almost the first day received.....Spend too much time removing twists from the cord to use the unit.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her use. This is her first epilator. She was skeptical before buying.. She likes it now..</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]    It works great, I like it. Even it is pretty painfull I can handle it.  It has only one \\&quot;minus\\&quot;: it is noisy...</li>
    <li> The first time I used this it was pretty painful but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.  I love how well it works on my armpits.  It keeps them hair free for weeks.  I have been using it about once a week to keep the straglers in line.  I would recommend this product.  For the first time I used it on the armpits I put numbing cream on before hand.  I didn&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun epilator from Amazon, I am very satisfied with it and it is realy my best choice. I recomend it, it realy does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was worried that it would hurt alot but it did not.</li>
    <li> If you wax and hate getting wax all over the floor and on everything, this is a super alternative. it gets all the hair out.  know that when you are pulling hair out, it will be a tad tender! my hair grows rediculously quickly, but my results last about a week, and with the regrowth being like normal soft hair instead of grizzly stubble, I&#x27;m happy.  it gets around my knees, bikini area and underarms with ease and doesn&#x27;t grab my skin. I&#x27;m ultra sensitive, so I feel comfortable recommending the xelle to weenies like me.</li>
    <li> This was my very first epilator, so I read a lot of reviews and bought one with the head attachment that is supposed to make the process less painful.  Just FYI - it still hurts. The attachment does make it less painful, but it also keeps it from grabbing as many hairs.  However, I am still using it and have discovered that if I epilate regularly (once a week for me), it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad because your hairs grow in cycles and not all of them are there. It does a pretty good job of getting short hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a reviewer but I had to write a bit on this product. I have been a waxer for years. I am dark haired and of mediterranean descent. I would consider the hair on my lower legs to be thick/course, as well as the hair on the back of my thighs, my arm hairs are plentiful but fine. Generally when I wax I would have my upper lip ($15), full leg ($75), and bikini (brazilian) ($40), and on occasion my arms ($40) done. The bill would total out to $170 dollars w/o the tip (um...NYC is pricey, no?). I had been growing out my last wax job to have another when a friend recommended this product. I thought there was no way it would do a job that would compete with my professional waxer. I was mistaken. I did my legs while watching TV. Good job, it got all the hairs! So I decided to do my arms which I would wax on occasion but would always get pimples here and there because of the wax, so stopped. It did my arms and I woke up this morning with no red inflamed little bumps anywhere! woot woot! I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible that this machine could possibly get the finer hairs on my upper lip but it did, PERFECTLY, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the inevitable zits there either, where historically the wax would clog my pores, or the bright red swath of irritated skin where the wax was applied!!! I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do the nooks of the bikini area but was able to get a bit off the sides and top, after using the trimmer. Good enough until I get around to fully waxing the lady bits. It was time consuming but I could do it at home and, again, I saved a total of $130.00. And I love that I can get all the little hairs that will pop up in 3 to four days when I feel like it, so I can stay smooth. As for the pain, I followed the same regimen that my waxer has recommended for years. Hot bath, loofah, no moisturizing or oil based product beforehand, and two pain killers of your choice, before you start. Also never wax/epilate right before or during your period because (she says) you feel more pain. Whether this is true, I don&#x27;t know, but it sounded reasonable so I followed her advice. (clearly not a concern for the men folk...) I would recommend this little marvel to any waxers out there or anyone that is super busy and just doesn&#x27;t want to deal with the salon, specially for the upper lip and arms! Love this purchase, love a beauty product that ACTUALLY WORKS! Love the convenience of never having to wax my upper lip again and LOVE the hundreds of dollars I will be saving! (all the positives outweigh that this little guy is kinda loud and for a second I was paranoid that my 3 male neighbors might think I had some kind of industrial &#x27;vibrating device&#x27; going for two hours...;) so be warned, its not soundless!)</li>
    <li> Bought this for the girlfriend.  Works well for her.  Tried it on my back.  Hurt like hell.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and trim my hair first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complain is the instructions are a bit confusing.</li>
    <li> I got it for my wife. She seems to like it.  She had a cheap one that just had one wheel and it took her forever.</li>
    <li> Not quite medieval torture, but darn close.  I tried this in order to avoid shaving every day and just couldn&#x27;t stand it.  It is simply too uncomfortable to entertain the notion of using on a continuing basis.  Put the money towards laser hair removal instead.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it would be better on my sensitive skin than waxing, but found it to be very painful and made my skin puffier and redder than waxing. The pain and puffiness may have been tolerable if it worked for longer and didn&#x27;t need to be used so frequently.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Silk-epil X&#x27;elle in 2006 and still use it and love it. The first few times it hurt like crazy and I&#x27;d shout with each pass over my legs and arms. My neighbors must have thought I was crazy. Over time, however, the pain has lessened and the hair has grown back thinner and there is much less of it growing back. Consequently it now takes less time to epilate and it doesn&#x27;t hurt half as much though it still gets stingy if there is a lot of growth to clean up. I have to do this about once a week to keep my legs smooth. As for ingrown hairs, I found that exfoliating in a hot shower prior to epilating then using a lotion (PFB Vanish is sold here at Amazon in a kit) made to prevent ingrown hairs afterwards reduces the bumps quite a bit. I&#x27;ve been using the Braun on my bikini area, arms and legs and absolutely will never return to the daily shaving routine! It&#x27;s not painless, it&#x27;s stingy for lack of a better description; hair does continue to grow and you will have to do this about once a week; and you will get some ingrown hairs, but even with all these things, it still beats the chore of shaving. The Braun does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great product just started using it. Stings a bit at first, but after you get going it works very well and hardly gets to you as far as pain goes. Contrary to other reviews it does NOT pinch the pinch are your damn hairs. Take it from me I pressed as hard as possible on many spots and no worries just hairs coming out. Took about an hour and most of the work is done on major areas of my body. Silky smooth!! Wasnt terribly pricey either. Guys/girls will both like this.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this product even though the reveiws were mostly good.  I received the Braun 5270 Epilator today and tried it imediately.  I have yet to master small curvy areas on my upper lip and chin, but even so it worked pretty well there.  However the results on my legs was excellent.  A little painful at first but I seemed to get over initial shock in a fairly short time.  I would reccomend this to anyone who is used to tweezing by hand on the face This is much faster and definately for legs.  Waxing is still way more painfull and also on me leaves a skin rippd off effect, which I then have to deal with for days after using.  This product did not leave rash or any other obvious side effects to the skin after using.  Well thats it I say 4 stars</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it! At first it was somewhat painful but she reports that you get used to it and over time it hurts less. She swears by it and says she wouldn&#x27;t go back to shaving.</li>
    <li> K first off I have kinda a high tolerance for pain.  That said I used my sisters epilady for the first time.  It hurt pretty bad, but I was excited to try it so I didn&#x27;t mind the pain for beauty.  I don&#x27;t like shaving all the time.  Then I ordered this so I could have my own!  The Braun seemed faster than the Epilady, it has a light and multiple heads.  It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad, but that could be that I had already epilated once before about 2 weeks earlier.  Anyway I love it and am addicted to it!</li>
    <li> So I should start by saying that this review is from a man&#x27;s perspective, so I have no idea how much it hurts to use on your legs... I was somewhat skeptical of the silk epil based on what other people had said about the pain level, but I hate shaving my chest and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to be prickly the day after shaving.      Upon opening the package, I was impressed by its compact size and attachments.  I was very disappointed to find that the device is not cordless!        The first time I used the silk epil was misery!  it feels like waxing, but at a very slow pace!  It does get all the hairs, but only after a few excruciating passes.  I needed to take a few breaks in order to finish.        The second time I used the epilator, I definitely noticed a difference using the massager attachment.  It tickles a little and helps to make the hair come out easier and less painfully.  I now don&#x27;t need the attachment (after my third use), and removing hair is relatively painless.  I would definitely recommend this machine for men who want the smooth look, but don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on waxing every month.</li>
    <li> to start off..I have never waxed or used an epilator before. Having said that, it hurts but really not that bad, just take your time. I was able to do one leg, wait about 1/2 an hour and do the second leg. The next day I did both legs and it was much much easier and less painful. Today I will do both legs again to get rest of the hair. Overall, I am really glad I bought this and I am looking forward to summer!</li>
    <li> I had an older Braun for about 10 years, when it finally broke I replaced it with this one. I love it!  And Ladies, once you get used to it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used a hand held razor for years.  The cost of the blades has gotten so ridiculos I dedcided to buy an electric razor.  Of course, I tried to figure out which would be best.  In my research travels the epilator types were discovered.  Didn&#x27;t even know they existed!  I have eyebrows done in a similiar fashion, with a longer time effect, this sounded better than the conventional shaving process I have used since my teens.  This product had good overall marks so I went for it.  I was amazed that I found it on Amazon for nearly $25 less than other sites, which averaged around $75. Didn&#x27;t have shipping cost either!    Bottom line is thus far it has delivered.  It defnitely has a ping factor when using but the results make the slplit second discomfort you feel worth it.  I have used it on my legs, and bikini area, as well as the under arms.  I&#x27;m beginning to think I may not ever have to do the underarms again.  Been a month at least and still no stubble growth.  Bikini area real smooth so far last a good 2 weeks for me.  Legs again about 3 weeks and feel growth.  Initially the product has performed.  I will state I am a blonde in my cougar age where hairgrowth is suppose to naturally winddown.  As long as the product last several years and maintains solid performance I would most likely buy another of the same.</li>
    <li> Alright, I surfed and read reviews both positive and negative before settling on this epilator.  I based my purchase on the number of realistic reviews given. I have very thick body hair that likes to grow back fast.  I also used to have an ingrown hair issue.  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found since my purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise: Yes, it&#x27;s loud. It&#x27;s about as loud as a pair of hair clippers. Believe me, you&#x27;ll get over it. If you can&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not certain what you&#x27;re trying so hard to hide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain:  Yes, the first time it is painful. What do you think it feels like when a machine pulls out your hairs but the root at a very fast speed? You&#x27;re probably right - a LOT. But you will get used to it and find little tactics that work for you to make it bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: If you can get beyond the noise and the pain, the shave is worth it. My hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for over a week at a time, sometimes closer to two weeks before I see the bare beginnings of regrowth. That&#x27;s saying something I think! Will it miss hairs? Occasionally. It&#x27;s not that bad. I&#x27;d say shave the first time and do spot checks everyday for the next week. It will get it out, the hair just has to be poking out of the skin enough to grab. I hardly have any ingrown hairs and my skin is SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time it takes: Set aside 2 hours if you&#x27;re feeling ambitious and want every last hair out. It does go somewhat slow, but after that first really long painful shave, it gets easier and takes less time because there&#x27;s less to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all this sounds like the positives outweigh the negatives, I strongly encourage you to try this product.  Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> This seller got the product to me in a timely manner and it was received in the condition described. The product itself works well, but is not recommended for those whith sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I thought this device had laser hair removal to it. Mainly because I searched under laser hair removal...Once I got it...I noticed it had no laser and that hairs grow back within three weeks. It says it&#x27;s like using forty tweezers....This may be good for the legs.... But thats all...</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I agree with the other review that if you are used to waxing, this is a good bet! It does not pain as much and with regular usage of the epilator the pain decreases. I simply like the multi dynamic usage of this product - epilating, shaving, trimming the hairs before shaving etc. One should know how to epilate if one is still seeing small hairs left behind after epilating- work the epilator in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Also the spotlight is a very good idea as you epilate, makes the hairs more visible.    The epilator works on very small hairs as well. Someone who is thinking of whether to purchase this product, I recommend you go for it. The shipping also was prompt, arrived earlier than expected. :) I&#x27;m very happy with my epilator. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought Braun epilator in Amazon.com. That works perfect for me. Doesnt hurt, but I think thats because I am using epilator already 3 years. My last epilator was Braun older version. I like this one better because of the smart light and shaving option. Sometimes you just dont have time. I can recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I owned an Epilady years ago and figured this couldn&#x27;t possibly be as painful, but I was wrong; it really hurts.  It is very painful, but it gets ALL the hair--even the ones the tweezers couldn&#x27;t get. The package states 40 tweezer technology and I believe it.  The only problem 2 problems I encountered are 1. you can only do a small area at a time, as there is too much pain involved otherwise; and 2. after doing my upper lip, there were some small bumps that went away after 3 days or so. Since I have very thick hair, I&#x27;m pretty sure this part of the issue. However, many of the other reviews state how painful it was for them too. If pain is of no consequence to you and you want to save money by skipping the waxing sessions, this is the way to go.  But if you have a low or even medium pain threshold, do not buy this product because there is no way around the pain that I can figure out. Finally, the good news is if you use this product long enough and use it consistently, you&#x27;ll eventually get a little used to the pain, but you can&#x27;t skip too many days, otherwise you&#x27;ll have to start all over.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I can tolerate a lot of pain--I&#x27;ve gotten tattooed on my ribs and hip bone for 8 hours, have had permanent eyeliner done, laser hair removal on my face, and own two other epilators (emjoi). The Braun one featured here hurts like no other. I can only use it on my underarm but not for anything else (arms, knuckles, bikini line) because it catches on my skin ALL THE TIME even when I am holding my skin down with my other hand. I think it&#x27;s because the rotator base is made of plastic instead of ceramic or metal. Don&#x27;t know what that would have to do with it but my Emjoi epilators were not plastic in the rotator. Also, I have never used the other accessories. The speeds are: fast, extremely fast, and way too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it has a light so you can see if you missed a hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it&#x27;s functional and when I use it on my underarms, it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME.  I cant even begin to tell you what a great tool this is.  Just buy it, it will pay for itself by making all your other skin care stuff obsolete.  I started just using it to nab the random hairs that waxing left behind..... Then I just went crazy!  I use it everywhere!  It takes every single itsy bitsy hair off your legs, underarms, and any coarse hairy places... And on softer places like toes, chins, and all those places women dont want to admit that they have hair... Well, it snags out the dark coarse ones and leaves you the softest peach fuzz... So it doesnt look like you shaved your chin, it just looks like you dont have any dark hairs sprouting there.  Just buy this product.  You will not be dissapointed.  Does it hurt?  Only as much as waxing or tweezing.  But just like waxing and tweezing, it goes away after a while.  JUST DO IT.  You can do it.  Afterwords I promise it is SOOOooooo worth it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product because it sounded like a great alternative to shaving (which I have to do everyday if I want to stay smooth).  It sounded like it would really work, not to mention the reviews were mostly very positive.  Let me warn you, this product has been a HUGE letdown.    Plain and simple, it just doesn&#x27;t work like it says it will.  It does pluck hairs out by the root--but not nearly all of them.  I was left with tons of stubble and I had to shave over it anyway.  I tried everything I could think of--going over areas multiple times, different angles, different pressure, and I just couldn&#x27;t get smooth.  Huge disappointment.    The pain was pretty bad, too, especially in sensitive areas.  I thought I would be able to handle it since I had a child and seemed to manage that okay, but this thing really hurts and it&#x27;s a totally different ballgame when you&#x27;re inflicting the pain on yourself.  I might have been able to handle it better if someone else were epilating me, but who would want to do that?! :)    Also, it takes FOREVER to do.  I thought it would save me time not shaving, but it takes an hour to do both legs.  If I epilated once a week, it would still take longer than just shaving in the shower everyday.      Overall, this product did not do what I thought it would, or even close to it.  Major buyer&#x27;s remorse here!</li>
    <li> I pulled this out, went painfully over my legs for the first time ever (I was a shaver, not a waxer).  It hurt like hell, I won&#x27;t lie, but I expected it to since hair was being pulled out by the root.  I did it every day for 3 days because I knew hair had different growth cycles.  After day 3, my legs were smoother than they have ever been in my life!  And that is a great feeling after being a girl who had to shave twice a day to even be somewhat smooth, with dark hair follicles so bad that it never looked like I had shaved, even if I was just out of the shower.  I dubbed this my &#x27;wonder gadget.&#x27;  And it was.....until about 2 weeks down the road when almost every hair that had been yanked out came back in as an ingrown hair.  I epilated and moisturized as instructed, but they still remain.  My legs, which looked so beautiful just a few weeks ago are now ugly and scabbed with thick dark hair that refuses to break the skin surface without a needle...this is just AWFUL!!!!!  So, for actually removing the hair, it works wonders.  The after effects can be devestating however.  Purchase with caution.  I do not wish this on anyone!  I am hoping that maybe maybe maybe in time using my homemade concoction of rubbing alcohol, aspirin, witch hazel and tea tree oil, that my skin will heal itself.  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am spainard, so I have alot of hair everywhere. And by shaving I get ingrown hairs. So, that didn&#x27;t work out so well for me and I have never tried waxing. I saw this product on YouTube and the girl was explaining what it was and how it worked. So, I did some research and decided on this product. I got it in the mail and took a hot shower and tried it. It scared me and it was painful but after a few minutes doing my legs and arms I am so excited about this product and would recommend it to everyone and anyone. It truly is great the pain was not so bad after a few times. Great!!!!</li>
    <li> after a few weeks of reading through many reviews i chose and bought this epilator. id never used one before but i hate hate hate shaving my legs and knew something had to change. i&#x27;d planned on using it everywhere i had ever shaved- legs, underarms, bikini area- i never wanted to use a razor again!     i was super excited when it came- i took a long hot shower, exfoliated and ran a few inches of hot water in the tub after i got out and dried off. i sat over the hot steamy water to epilate my legs for the first time. it was pretty painful- not gonna lie! i listened to some music to distract me a bit and i think that helped. i tried to do my underarms but it was sooo painful i couldn&#x27;t stand it.     a few days later i went over my legs again to get stragglers/missed areas and decided to try the armpits again. i took a deep breath, turned my ipod to a hard rocking song and went for it- i exhaled through the pain and went over the areas quickly and repeatedly until i was smooth- i did it! haha! the next time was infinitely less painful.     i did try the bikini area and i was a little surprised- i&#x27;ve waxed nearly everything for almost a decade and so my hair has definitely thinned and it is much sparser. because of this i fully expected to be able to epilate with very little pain- not the case! i still haven&#x27;t been able to go over all the areas yet because of the pain (i&#x27;ve had it for about a month and have gone over the area 3-4 times).    my only complaint is that it seems to be just breaking off the hair on my thighs. my hair is very thin and fine (night and day different from my knees down!) and even if i go over the area very thoroughly i feel stubble in the next couple days... disappointing but i&#x27;ll keep at it as i&#x27;ve tossed all my razors!      overall i&#x27;m pretty happy with this and will absolutely keep at it in all areas and would recommend it to all my friends! hope this review helps you make up your mind to go for it!!</li>
    <li> I am a Semi-Professional Wrestler and to maintain that look I have to remove unwanted body hair, and I got a lot of it, this is so much better than shaving it off in my honest opinion. I used the epilator today and man it worked very well on my hands, arms, legs and especially my chest. I recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of unwanted hair, your body get used to the plucking and the results are well worth the pain that is relatively minor to the results. Next best thing to the expensive electrolysis or laser hair removal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in May 2009, as an alternative to waxing. I was using it every six weeks or so, and by the end of the year, my legs had turned into this monstrous web of hairs growing under a thin layer of skin. The ingrown hairs cause bumps, sometimes become infected and as a result, my legs are all scarred with dark spots everywhere. If I need to wear a skirt, I need to apply leg makeup even under pantyhose.   I have olive skin with medium dark hairs, and I don&#x27;t know if my type of skin has a tendency for ingrown hairs. If you are going to buy this product, test first... or you will risk paying $60 on the epilator plus $100 on creams and lotions, a couple thousand on permanent hair removal (which does not entirely solve the problem) and a few other hundred on skin treatments to minimize the scars.</li>
    <li> The epilator part of this system works great (for those who can handle the pain involved) as does the trimmer portion of the shaver. However, the electric shaver portion never has shaved too closely (though for me it works fine for my arms &amp; bikini area). I purchased this item about 3 years ago and still use the shaver for trimming and for my arms &amp; bikini area. I quit using the epilator due to the ingrown hairs it caused but that was by personal choice, nothing to do with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pluses to this system are that it works in several ways for all parts of your body, it has two speeds and the light is a wonderful feature. I would recommend this system to those looking for its flexibility.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the money if you need to remove unwanted hairs, however, the razorblade attachment to shave your legs is not the greatest, unless I am using it wrong, which does not seem that complicated. As they save &#x27;live and learn&#x27; so for the overall product I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I got my Braun epilator and used it twice. it works pretty well. I had never used a epilator before and it didn&#x27;t hurt anything unbearable. you will feel a slight prickly feeling while using thats all. it worked well on both hands and legs. I am relived that I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore. Its been 2 weeks since i used it &amp; i still don&#x27;t have any new growth.</li>
    <li> After reading all these great reviews, I picked this piece up. I have to say, wow. I never knew technology like this existed. After reading the instructions, I went to town on my chest hairs. I am a guy who likes to \\&quot;man-scape\\&quot; usually with an electric trimmer, and occasionally self-wax (ouch- what a mess). Mind you, my hair is darker and quite dense, this device literally plucked the hair out right from the root, forty at a time. I couldn&#x27;t believe the precision- leaving nothing behind. At times, I cringed from the pain on more sensitive areas but kept going- the results, too amazing. I chose the Braun Silk-epil because of it&#x27;s reviews from confident consumers like you. Reviews on other devices seemed to either indicate pinched skin or leaving affected areas prickly- and that&#x27;s not supposed to be the effect. After my first epilation, my skin was smooth like I&#x27;ve never felt before, I had minor redness, some bumps and applied Tend Skin immediately to prevent in-growns (I have been using Tend Skin for years, and it has also changed my life in getting rid of unsightly razor burn after shaving,  they now make it in a roll on). I was told to exfoliate regularly too. Although this product is marketed to the ladies, it is equally as effective on men. Compared to waxing this is the most amazing thing ever. Just wanted to share my story, and thank you Braun- for this truly is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I use this product for facial and forearm hair, and I will NEVER go back to tweezers and creams. I have not used it for my upper lip yet.    There is some minor pain with this, but it&#x27;s probably about as minimal as you&#x27;ll ever get, considering that the device works by plucking thousands of times a minute. But I&#x27;ve noticed that once I remove longer hairs from one area, the discomfort of removing the shorter regrowth is much less.    And the results are definitely worth it. Regrowth is much slower than I ever had with tweezers and depilatory creams, and I don&#x27;t miss any hairs -- which I often did with plucking, because I am farsighted; I had to use glasses and a magnifying mirror just to see the hairs. I often found plucked hair remaining just below the surface, so they looked like blackheads.    The light is essential, at least if you wear glasses. It&#x27;ll give you a nice clear view of the area you&#x27;re working on.    Get this device - it is a god-send for anyone plagued with excess hair.</li>
    <li> First, I have an issue with hair. I have thick black hair and no matter what I do; shaving or waxing, you still can see the dark roots under my skin. Not very attractive. I purchase this specific Epilator because it was the same price I would pay every other month I would go in to get waxed (arms &amp; armpits). So I thought it would be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 6 months and Im just starting to see a difference! WARNING!! The first month or so there will be a lot of ingrown hair and man those are painful!!! I still get them on my arms but not as much. And the hair pores are somewhat visable. My legs look great! Smooth and I don&#x27;t even see hair pores!!&lt;br /&gt;Im thinking of getting a more expensive one because the only CON i see is that it takes me an hour to epilate both my legs and arms. I would have to go over everything more than once and it gets really warm after 5 to 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I would recommend this to anyone. My hair is pretty thick and coarse and needs more attention but I bet with others with thin and finer hair this would be perfect!</li>
    <li> I like it for the most part.  But it does have trouble pulling out thin or short hairs.  I use it mainly on my legs and underarms.  Personally, I think it is way too painful for the bikini area. XD    As for ingrown hairs, you will get them no matter what...always make sure to use moisturizer and exfoliating scrubs afterward.</li>

    <li> I purchased this epilator to replace a much older Braun model in which the gears had begun to slip.  Considering the old one was nearly 15 years old, I would say that it held up quite well.  But this baby!  Wow, what a difference!  It is so much more gentle than the older model was, and the LED light feature illuminates even the finest of hairs.  If you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, yes, they ALL sting a little the first few times you use them, but this one comes with special rollers and skin stimulaters to make the process much for comfortable than some of the other models out there.  The shaver/trimmer attachment for the device is very nice, and does a wonderful job on the bikini line.     I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal for over 15 years and I&#x27;ve seen many posts that complain about \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  The stubble is a by-product of hairs that break off, rather than get pulled out, while using the epilation process.  For first time users, or if you haven&#x27;t used the product for a long time, this is very common.  First, the length of the hair is important.  If it&#x27;s too long, it will likely break off, especially if the machine only grabs the hair at the end.  However, if you use the shaver/trimmer head first, to cut the hairs to optimal length, it will greatly reduce the amount of breakage that occurs.  For the hairs that do break, simply allow a day or two for them to grow out a bit, and reuse the epilator to extract them.</li>
    <li> Can someone please tell me why the price has gone from $49.99 to $69.99 in just one month for this model??!!  Have they added some special features or something?? when is the price coming down!!!  Thank youuuuuuu</li>
    <li> Yes, this is the best epilator currently on the market.  If you&#x27;re here at Amazon, you&#x27;ve probably done your research.  But if there was a magic bullet to remove all unwanted hair, then we would all be walking around smooth, sleek, bald goddesses.      I could write the book on what the review \\&quot;pros\\&quot; and \\&quot;cons\\&quot; are, from the 1,000 plus reviews on Amazon, but here&#x27;s the reality:  The success of this epilator does not depend as much on your pain tolerance as it does on your natural individual hair shaft density and your skin type.    The reality is that 40 fast-spinning tweezers running across your skin not only can hurt, but it can be unsuccessful.  I am a frequent at-salon waxer, and also use a GiGi professional wax warmer and Brazilian hard wax on myself regularly.   It is expensive and time consuming, and I am not at all afraid of pain, so I decided that if \\&quot;it hurts\\&quot; and \\&quot;it seems to cut hairs off and leave stubble\\&quot; were the two biggest complaints, my pain threshold (I laughed at reviews) and my skill would put me in the \\&quot;it&#x27;s a winner!\\&quot; category.    Turns out, I was on the opposite end of the spectrum. Not a winner. Despite changing techniques, following directions obsessively, and sparing no expense when it came to discomfort I felt, this simply doesn&#x27;t work for my \\&quot;genetics.\\&quot;    I have dark hair, but it is very fine.  The tips of the tweezers are rather sharp, so when they grab my hair, they clip the tender hairs and are unable to rip it out at the roots.  The result is the appearance of \\&quot;no hair,\\&quot; but it leaves my legs feeling stubbly.    In some areas, where my hair is slightly thicker, the tweezers are able to grasp the hairs and remove them from the root, but it leaves tiny red pinpricks all up and down the area epilated.  Tend Skin, and other post epilating/waxing products would sooth the sting, but could not reduce the appearance of marks.  This is not a design flaw in the machine.  This epilator has a bright light that highlights every last speck of even lightly colored hair.  The grip is comfortable.  The epilator has to be plugged into an outlet, but it is via a generous power cord that I found I adapted to easily.  The product runs smoothly, functions well, and has a nice quality to it.       I tested it on a few friends, my fiancé&#x27;s arm, and a few volunteer male legs and chests.  It works well on men because of the thickness of their hair (trimmed first).  It worked well on friends with denser individual hairs than mine.  It worked beautifully for some of them.  So the truth is, just like the latest \\&quot;Must HAVE Allure Magazine Beauty Product of the YEAR\\&quot;...one size just doesn&#x27;t fit all.  Sometimes, today&#x27;s \\&quot;best\\&quot; beauty product just is not your shade.  Sometimes, the latest clothing trend just isn&#x27;t the right cut for you.  And sometimes, the best epilator on the market just won&#x27;t leave you baby soft.     This product will be your best friend, if:    You have coarse or thick hair.    You have firm, tone, well-exfoliated skin in all of the areas intending to be epilated.      This will be your enemy, if:    You have fine hair, or soft blonde hair.  The hairs will be cut off, rather than epilated.    You have areas of thin skin, loose skin, dry skin, or skin that needs vigorous exfoliation.  (If you are prone to ingrown hairs, I am talking to you.) This product is likely to make you bleed and leave tiny red bloody spots.      With that in mind, this is absolutely worth trying out.  For those it works for, it&#x27;s an utter miracle machine.  And if it doesn&#x27;t work for you?  Well, at least you&#x27;ll stop having that burning, tingling, \\&quot;what if?\\&quot; anymore.  I&#x27;m keeping mine.  Just in case.</li>
    <li> The one thing that I had to learn the hard way was that you have to use it in the positions showed in the manual, you have to hold it really straight and as close as possible to your skin so that it is as painless as it can be, if not you will feel so much pain. Other than that, it is very loud, once you use it a few times, you get used to the noise but at the beginning it was way too loud to keep it on for a while. Now that I know how to use it correctly, third time so far, the noise is not too bad and it goes faster. I LOVE the smooth skin for weeks, it totally rocks!!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about various epilators and didnt know which one to get. I also read that it FRIGGIN hurts. I was kinda worried when i got this one because It was my first time using one. And surprise surprise.....IT DIDNT HURT as bad. From what I read, its supposed to make you cry. But my first day using it and I even epilated my underarms. I lose this product. It has various speed levels for slow and fast epilation, 5 different heads for various areas and purposes. The smart light is awesome. I really dont know what else to say about it? Its a great product.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy who happens to be extremely hairy. I end up spending 70 dollars a month to get my chest and back waxed in order to keep the wife happy and from calling me &#x27;Wolf Man&#x27;.     My wife ordered this product thinking it would be a &#x27;fun&#x27; (by fun I mean getting the chance to torture me), and inexpensive way to remove my excess body hair.    I did all of the proper prep. I took a hot shower, and ensured the hair on my chest and back was trimmed using a Wahl trimmer. The first pass of this thing on my back was unbearable pain. The second pass on my chest wasn&#x27;t any better, and I put a stop to it after that. Of course my wife is rolling on the floor in laughter at my pain and excessive use of profanity.     I ended up returning this product, and will just stick with waxing once a month.    I have a whole new respect for women, and what they go through in order to stay beautiful.</li>
    <li> This machine restored the smooth skin of my woman. I am happy that I bought it for her and she was very happy too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is pulling the hair out, it feels more like it&#x27;s cutting it. When the hair grows back in, it looks like it has been cut, not pulled at the root.  I used to use EpiLady and that thing pulled from the roots, you felt it and you could see the difference with the way the hair grows back. This seems like it is just cutting it really low. I would not really recommend this product if you are looking for something to replace waxing.</li>
    <li> This thing is fabulous. In just a few months it has saved me time and money on waxing. I find this to be far less painful than waxing and the light is a big help. The shaver attachment works great too and the design is really pretty cute. For some reason at first I got more ingrown hairs than with waxing, but a weekly scrub with a loofa sponge has all but eliminated that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my bikini area waxed three times this year. Can we just say, \\&quot;OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!\\&quot; I also had my arms waxed for the first time a few weeks ago, which was considerably less painful. I was highly considering plunging into waxing my legs once summer was over. I didn&#x27;t want to go around all hairy in between waxing while I waited for my hair to be long enough to be waxed. I was waiting for \\&quot;pants\\&quot; weather. However, after talking with a friend who epilates, I decided to try it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I spent much of today reading reviews on this site and others. I narrowed my search down to the Braun Silk-epil X&#x27;elle and the Epilady Discrette. The Epilady was rated #1 by Consumer Reports. This Silk-epil X&#x27;elle wasn&#x27;t tested by them. The Braun they did test came in #3, but was since replaced by the EverSoft, which I don&#x27;t even see on this site. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I pretty much read equally positive reviews on both epilators in consideration. I was 50/50 in my decision. It finally came down to the fact that I couldn&#x27;t find a store nearby where I could go and buy the Epilady, yet I could drive to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and use my 20% off coupon to buy the Braun. So, I did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wax my legs yet, since I just shaved them today, but I did try it on both my arms and bikini area. As for my arms, almost pain free. Little pricks here and there, but it was really quite a breeze. The bikini area ... NOT so pain free for sure, but SO much better than waxing! I&#x27;m sure it helps that I just had my bikini area waxed three times, so there was less hair to start with. With waxing, a large section comes off all at once with one big, \\&quot;OUCH!\\&quot; every time. With epilating, I can control how much is taken and just do a teeny bit at a time if I want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; SmartStart Head, which pulls out less at a time. It takes longer, but is easier to start with until you get used to it. I&#x27;m confident that if I can handle epilating my bikini area, I can certainly handle my legs. Iwould have had to wait another 3 weeks to get my bikini area waxed, by the way, because I&#x27;m suppoed to let all the hairs grow to a certain length to get optimum results. My waxing gal says 6 weeks. Yet, with epilating, I can do it whenever there are any hairs long enough, which is WAY sooner than 6 weeks so far. Also, it&#x27;s free and I can do it in the privacy of my own home. Not sprawled out for a stranger to see my \\&quot;privates\\&quot;! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer stated that she didn&#x27;t like the SmartLight feature. I, for one, thought it was great. I have blonde hair, so having a light to show me wear all those little buggers are is wonderful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve done any waxing and you know what that feels like, epilating is so much better. I can&#x27;t comment on any other epilators, but this one seems to be a great one.</li>
    <li> If you are someone who is used to waxing then this is the product for you. I am one of the lucky few who has fine, blonde hair on my legs, and this product is simply wonderful. I used it last night and in 10 mins I was hair free and happy. It will save me dollars since I don&#x27;t need to pay to get my legs waxed every 3/4 weeks now. The &#x27;pain&#x27; level is actually less than some of the waxing sessions I have gone through. If you can bear the pain of tweezers pulling out each hair, you can bear this, (but remember I am talking from the point of view of someone with fine hair) The noise this epilator makes is not too drastic either. It has a light on it too, which is really useful as you can see every single hair. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough, so if you are the kind of gal who waxes often, I recommend swapping over to this epilator, just think of the money you&#x27;ll save!!!!</li>
    <li> This is exceptionally painful, especially at first, which is to be expected for what it is, but it generally gets the job done. You will often have to go over certain areas a number of times to get everything, and I will occasionally need to tweeze or shave spots that the epilator has trouble with. I will say that the guard on top doesn&#x27;t seem to massage away pain so much as fall off all the time and annoy me. The device can also occasionally pinch or catch on skin, which is a big ouch. But generally, I&#x27;m pleased with how long hair stays gone and the large area that can be covered relatively quickly. It beats constant tweezing every day.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing in the world to remove hair on the body. I&#x27;ve been using this from more than a year now. And I love it.     My first time took about 3 hours for my whole body, just cos of the pain of epilating the first time. Trick? Have a lil wine before/while epilating if you are above legal drinking age. Or tylenol works too sometimes, I prefer wine. After the first time, use it weekly for touchups. I will not take more than half hour if u use it every week and it doesnt hurt at all if you do it often. I use it weekly sometimes, just to avoid pain. But after a while the hair growth reduces and slows down. Trust me, it reduces, i&#x27;ve been using this from over a year. Now i use it once a month sometimes.     I use it on my legs, hands, underarms and does a wonderful job. I dont know if it can be used on facial hair, but i havent tried it either.     It has a trimmer attachment too, in case u just want to touch up. The cord is pretty long to sit on a step or on the bath tub while using it. Has a cleaner brush. And massager attachment for epilating. 2 speed modes. Everything is lovely.    Bottom line - Buy this....!!! Best and only investment needed for body hair removal.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator and I love it. It truly is very long lasting effect and the pain is very negligible, much less than with waxing or threading.I did not experience any skin redness either. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was its not very quiet. But it does the job nicely especially for facial hairs.</li>
    <li> First off, nowhere in the description for the Silk-epil did it say that you needed an additional attachment to use it on your face.  So, while you *can* use it on your face (and I have, since that&#x27;s primarily what I bought it for!) it&#x27;s REALLY painful to do so!  And while it is slightly less painful to use on the lower leg (the only other place I have tried it) and supposedly this will get better over time, I can&#x27;t say that I don&#x27;t cringe when I realize it&#x27;s time to epilate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in lieu of the much-advertised Tweeze, and now I am wishing I&#x27;d just gone with the hype and bought &#x27;the original.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I waited a while before writing my review, just to make sure my first opinion on the product was correct.  Let me say, this is a great product!  It works like it says, leaving you with smooth legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair on my legs, that is pretty light in color, so I don&#x27;t shave normally more than once or twice a week.  My arms are even lighter, so it&#x27;s mostly the smooth feeling that I am looking for, not ridding my body of sasquatch hair:)  All joking aside, I was absolutly terrified to touch my arms when I got this.  I really thought it&#x27;d hurt.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t hurt on my arms at all, very very slightly on the back of my thighs, but it&#x27;s not painful.  I will say that my underarms do hurt, and since I can&#x27;t seem to get the skin taut enough, I have had my husband do it.  It doesn&#x27;t do a great job on the underarms, but it could be my technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head on it for a while, then just changed it to the advance because I felt comfortable doing it.  It does get more hairs this way.  Also, I use the high speed, not the slower one.  Again, it gets more hairs.  And, regardless of what others have said, I DO like the light, especially since my hair is fine and light.  If your hair is on the dark and coarse side, it may seem a worthless feature, I don&#x27;t know.  I have not used the clipper feature yet, seeing as I do not need it.  It is easy to clean, which is always good in this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things that I would change.  I would make it cordless, or give it a swivel cord.  And the \\&quot;advance\\&quot; head seems almost too loose and wants to come off.  Other than that, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator!  I ordered it a few months ago after reading mostly positive reviews and I love it.  The first time I used it, it took me a while to do both legs, it was really painful.  After that first time, it&#x27;s cake, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I used to have to shave my legs every other day and I don&#x27;t have to shave them anymore!  The hair grows in very fine and with less frequency, my legs are so smooth, compared to that second day stubble I used to get.  The only drawback is that it is really loud so I can&#x27;t do it at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for about 6 months as of this review.  I have coarse, dark hair that I used to have to shave almost daily to feel presentable.  I wanted an epilator to try to cut down on the maintenance time and, hopefully, improve the results, as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this epilator.  It&#x27;s no magic fix for coarse, dark hair, but then, nothing is.  It hurt like anything the first few times I used it, but just like plucking your eyebrows, it stops hurting after a few times.  What I like the best about epilating is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t require daily maintenance to keep my legs feeling smooth.  My hair grows quite fast, so the results don&#x27;t last anywhere near 4 weeks.  In fact, if I don&#x27;t epilate for a few days, I will have quite a few stray hairs.  Yet, I&#x27;ve found that I really don&#x27;t notice.  Despite stray hairs, my legs are still very smooth overall.  The only major downside I&#x27;ve found with epilating is the amount of ingrown hairs that result, something I never had when shaving.  Nonetheless, I won&#x27;t go back to shaving, and that said, I&#x27;ve never even used the shaver head that you can switch off with the epilator head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I researched a number of epilators before buying, and I chose this one because Braun seems to have a good reputation for reliability and this epilator has 40 tweezing disks as opposed to the 20 on most epilators.  As I&#x27;ve never used the 20-disk epilators, I can&#x27;t speak authoritatively for the difference in speed, but I figure it has to be faster.  I&#x27;ve never had trouble with the length of the cord, the shape is easy to grip, and the Smartlight helps the task in a way you won&#x27;t understand until you&#x27;ve used it.  You don&#x27;t receive the cooling glove, as the product description states, but I&#x27;ve personally never needed it.</li>
    <li> Just had to vent out against the shipping delay for in stock products! A delivery estimate of 03/23 to 05/03???? opening up quite a large window! &amp; they needed the window!</li>
    <li> I can say that this is an awesome product but it hurts way to much it does reduce the size of the hair and all that. Pretty much it does what it says it does, but it hurts way too much for me. So i only use it in small section like my armpits or small parts like that where i can take the pain for a small amount of time. so ya.... i rather do waxing its a lot faster.</li>
    <li> This is a slightly hard product to endorse because when it is working properly it is excruciatingly painful, but I knew that going in and this little baby does its job brilliantly.  I love the various heads, they all work beautifully; I love the light, it really, really helps; I love the results, exactly the same as having my legs waxed.  For the price of a single leg waxing I now can use this little X&#x27;elle whenever I want.    It comes with a little silver mesh bag to store it in, just the right size for all the parts.  All in all, I love this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a good epilator, relatively painless. Good at pulling out even short hairs. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator.  Waxing was so messy, inconvenient and time consuming. I figured some brief pain would overall be less of a problem than the waxing.  I do have a pretty high tolerance for discomfort, but this isn&#x27;t that bad at all.  I do recommend, but don&#x27;t have experience with this brand over others.  But I certainly would buy again.  It is working great for me on legs and bikini area.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get the ingrown hairs, but... I did! arghh. I&#x27;m a mom, and the only time I&#x27;d be able to use this is after my son sleeps... so taking around 45 mins to do my legs at night becomes a little bit of a chore. I gave in and went back to shaving... (for now!) The pain is not bad at all.     Also, after you start using it, the hair will grow out finer. That&#x27;s nice and all, but the epilator breaks a lot of hair, instead of actually plucking it. I still like the product, though :)</li>
    <li> This epilator is great, it can catch all hair (small ones included) without any pain. Light and small, easy to bring with you everywhere. Just a little too loud maybe. Great purchase !</li>
    <li> You may call me a sissy, and maybe you&#x27;re right.    But, anyone who reports \\&quot;no pain whatsoever\\&quot; is apparently numb!    I have been using mine mainly on my chin &amp; neck. It does remove the hair. I want very badly to use it on my upper lip, and I&#x27;ve even tried using a topical anesthetic spray first, but it&#x27;s just too painful.  Maybe if I numb the area with ice first.      I can&#x27;t imagine using it on a large area of body, like the legs, and I wouldn&#x27;t even THINK about my underarms.    Not sure yet if I like it better than shaving.     Even though it&#x27;s WAAAY better than the old Epilator with the spring that pulled out the hairs, I&#x27;d say pass on this one if you have a low tolerance to pain.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;d used. I think it was mostly the reputation they had for being painful that kept me away.    In any case, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I don&#x27;t mean to minimize anyone else&#x27;s opinions, but I can think of so many things about being a woman that are more painful than using this epilator. It&#x27;s really no big deal - a bit unpleasant, but the result is worth it. Another reviewer really nailed it by saying \\&quot;Pain is relative, and the pain of cuts and razor burn is worse.\\&quot;    I will say that the first time I used this on my armpits, it did test my limits. But - after the first clearing, it&#x27;s not that big a deal.     Right now I&#x27;m waiting for hair to grow in the rest of the phases so all of it can have the first initial plucking. After that, I expect it to grow in progressively thinner.     But - seriously. A great product. I don&#x27;t understand why more women don&#x27;t epilate, as it&#x27;s clearly a superior result.</li>
    <li> This was definitely not designed by a woman. I have never experienced this much pain, I have 3 kids and tattoos all over, but the pain this caused is wayyyy worse. Just imagine 40 pairs of tweezers pulling the hair from your bikini zone all at once. OUCH!!!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried epilation since the first Epilady in 1988. Underwhelmed by the performance, it was almost 20 years later that I wondered if anything better was available.    I purchased this Braun after reading the reviews.  It works great, removing very short stubble and tiny fuzz.  The instruction sheet has spare and accurate line drawings to get you started.  Other reviews have lengthy instructions.  Just remember to clean it after every use with the included brush so you don&#x27;t get dried folicle goo stuck in the gear.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a year..loved it..but exactly at the end of one year it wouldnt work and the warranty did not apply. So please retain your original purchase receipt for the whole time of the warranty period and pray that it lasts longer than that.</li>
    <li> If you are sick of shaving or can&#x27;t afford getting your legs waxed, then I totally suggest buying this. I have only used it once (as it just came in the mail yesterday) but I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am very glad that I bought it. I highly recommend it for everyone. The first time I used it was almost a month ago and it kept me 99% hair free for over 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> this is the best thing I have ever tried.  Yes it hurt alot at first and I did have some red bumps for a day but I did not have to shave again for 3 1/2 weeks.  If it ever breaks I will buy a new one right away.</li>
    <li> I had a Philips epilator before, and I still thinks philips its better, but this one is fine. It does the job fine, and the light works wonderfull. Im peruvian and Im taking this to Peru in a couple of weeks hope it works fine in Peru too.   I would recommend this if you cant find the philips, but philips is not selling anymore in the states so yes, try Braun. It doesnt hurt as much as I though.</li>
    <li> I bought it accoding to its higher review value. Now regret.  Itself looks nice, but Very noisy! Always break the hair into shorter, instead of get it out.  Won&#x27;t recommed it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an epilator for a lot of reasons:  1. Wax works but it takes too long to warm up, and too long to CLEAN up  2. I travel a lot and I hate that 3-days-into-the-trip stubble  3. I kept shaving off my tan!  This thing is great! With a little (very little) practice it keeps your legs/underarm/wherever (and my boyfriends back) smooth for weeks! Each time you use it it lasts longer; after 3 uses I can now go 3 weeks in between. And it hurts less each time too as the hair gets finer and you get used to the sensation. Easy to use, easy to clean and extremely effective. I know what all my girlfriends are getting this year for Christmas...</li>
    <li> If you are a lady with facial hair, this is a great product.  I have had mine about  6 months now and thought this morning other women should know this is great for   that problem. Tweezing took my morning time and by night I would need to do again.  I had tried shaving, ok if you can live with the 5:00 shadow (how sexy!!) I could fill a page with embarrasing stories and times trying to hide.  Does it hurt, just a tingle. I meant to write this review months ago and have better things to do than write review, but it was the other reviews that made me  try this so felt I should take the time and \\&quot;pass it forward\\&quot;.   Worth every penny! If it breaks, I will look for one just like it.  Three months ago I went on medication to help this problem.  You may want to ask your physician if Aldactone (generic fine) is ok for you (low dose). This is a diuretic with a side effect that really lessens facial hair growth. I have not had any problems on this med. I still need the braun, but not nearly as much. Ask your doc. It took me years to find out about this med. I have suffered this embarressment for at least 15 years and I&#x27;m 52 now. Buy the braun anyway.  W</li>
    <li> This catches newer, shorter hairs than my last epilator leaving my legs perfectly smooth.  And while not exactly pain free, it is less painful than I&#x27;m used to.  I also like all the options it has, different heads and different speeds.  I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
    <li> I own 2 Emjoi Gold epilators. They are good but Braun is superior. The motor is much more powerful. It doesn&#x27;t slow down and stop like the Emjoi. I like the light on the front. What a great idea. As the hairs become finer after several pluckings they can be hard to see. I like having different heads to choose from for different body areas. I find that the Braun grabs much shorter hairs than the Emjoi. Leaving less stubble. Epilating is a process when you first begin. It may take 4 or 5 times to get all the hairs plucked. But once done maintenance is a breeze. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews on here seem to be written by people using an epilator for the first time - all \\&quot;it hurts\\&quot; and \\&quot;it&#x27;s noisy\\&quot; so I thought I&#x27;d add a review from someone who&#x27;s epilated for years and tried several different models.  After 4 or so years my emjoi optima needed replacing, one of the heads simply stopped turning. It had served me well so I nearly just bought a replacement but decided I&#x27;d see what else was out there. It seems the Optima is still a top pick but the Braun range consistently got great reviews. The 5270 wasn&#x27;t the highest rated overall but I know I don&#x27;t need cooling mits, easy start kits, or a range of heads and at just under $50 I figured it was worth a try even if the light seemed an unnecessary gimmick.    Initial impressions, nice size, fit well in the hand. The blade head arrives with a sort of guard with 2 rollers on it, apparently to kneed the skin and reduce pain. Don&#x27;t waste your time, it just decreases the hair removed on each pass; swap it for the other guard. I really like this attachment, it makes it easy to keep the epilator at the perfect angle on your skin and it made light work of deforesting my legs (in the name of research I left them untouched once my optima failed). This brings me to the light. It annoyed me there&#x27;s no way to switch it off but I quickly found out it&#x27;s actually very useful, especially when there&#x27;s serious hair to remove, it really highlighted what was left on each pass, without the need to stop and run my hands over my legs to check. Overall I got a better result than with my old optima and in less time which surprised me. I did my underarms too and found it easier to maneuver than the optima although a little more painful but I think that&#x27;s down to having shaved for the last few weeks. It&#x27;s also no noisier than other epilators and the power cord is a decent length.  Comes apart easily for cleaning and as the guard comes off getting the blades clean is simple. In fact the only downside of this is that there&#x27;s no cover for the head. I&#x27;d have preferred that to the bag that was included.    Overall a highly recommended buy, I just need to see how it stands up over time.</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator but I always will now.  Love it.  I rarely have to think about hair removal anymore.  What a relief.  It hurt the first time but after a few times the pain is no big deal.</li>
    <li> Being a beauty therapist I&#x27;m quite adept at body hair removal, albeit a painful episode, until now.  The Braun 5720 is realatively painless, quick and very easy to use. It&#x27;s idiots work.  The rollers in front of and behind the automatic tweezers seem to act as a \\&quot;pain barrier\\&quot; resulting in hair free legs for up to 6 weeks.  Occasionally you will get a \\&quot;rogue\\&quot; hair popping up here and there but because hairs are yanked out from their roots, the new growth is soft and hardly noticeable at all - instead of the blunt stub that shaving creates.  Without a doubt worth the money.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I was looking for something that would remove hair from my legs and underarms but unfortunately it has only worked on my legs. I have to go over the area several times for it to remove all the hairs.  This machine is quite noisy and it would be better if it were cordless,</li>
    <li> Being new at this I made sure I was buying the best product. It arrived today and of course I had to try it out right away. I&#x27;ve never waxed before so I had no idea what to expect. I was able to do all of both my legs with only a little pain! Of course it didn&#x27;t feel GOOD but once I got used to the tingling feeling it wasn&#x27;t too bad.   And then came the armpits.....It was very painful. But I was very motivated! I found that stretching my arm as high as I could helped. I also found that using a mirror was easier than looking directly at my armpit. And now that I battled through it, I have perfectly smooth armpits! There is some redness but I&#x27;m told it will be gone tomorrow.   I am definetely glad I bought this product. It worked awesome and didn&#x27;t pinch my skin once. Even as a first timer!  The power cord is plenty long, the light works fine, it&#x27;s easy to operate and it did exactly what I got it for....to take all the hair away.</li>
    <li> I have to say, after being a slave to shaving and waxing - this is fabulous!  No, you won&#x27;t get EVERY single hair off, but you know what - it&#x27;s pretty doggone smooth.   Initially it&#x27;ll be a little uncomfortable but I use it every 2 days and have welcomed the little &#x27;stings&#x27; as it means that the hair is being plucked.  Make sure you take your time (do it while watching tv) and go slow so it&#x27;s more effective.    No more waxing or shaving for me!!!!  Worth every dime!!    p.s. I&#x27;ve got coarse thick hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased it this afternoon, took it home &amp; was SO excited to use it! I have been growing out my underarm hair for weeks-just waiting for this day to come. I read the instructions (keep at 90 degree angle) and plugged it in. The first thing I felt was a tiny pinch, the hair being pulled out obviously. Then, everything after that was the most horrendous pain I have ever felt! I have given BIRTH, had over four tattoo&#x27;s, waxed, shaved, threaded-you name it! THIS, by far, was the WORST pain I have ever felt! I tried it in every darn direction and it SNAGGED my skin and ripped it to shreds! Both of my underarms are red and tender from where the skin got torn off and it&#x27;s been 8 hours already (it&#x27;s 11 pm and I did it at 3 pm). Other bad things: Noisy as hell, the two settings, Soft and Something Faster should have been labeled Super Fast and Something even Super Faster! The Soft setting was so fast I was AFRAID to put it to my armpit! It&#x27;s like this scary weedwhacker! The massaging rollers did nothing at all. I am giving it TWO stars because it DID get 95% of my hair out by the roots (all over the place), the color is cute...and thats about it. I can see how this would pay for itself after one or two sessions-but imo, the pain was NOT worth it! I am going to stick with sugar waxing &amp; shaving thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a week ago in hopes that I would be able to stop shaving, and be able to go longer periods in between hair removal.  Both of my roommates epilate, so I figured I would try it again (it has been years).  I spent a good 3 hours of tooth-grinding pain removing my body hair.  I did my legs, arms, underarms, and most of my bikini zone.    This was a week ago, and my forearms still are covered in bumps.... It looks like I have chickenpox or something similar.  I have not gotten any ingrowns (yet), but a few of the bumps on my arms pimpled up.  It took multiple passes to remove most of the hair, which I then had to go at with tweezers.  The bikini zone was torture, so I switched it up a bit and went to my underarms.  At first it wasn&#x27;t too bad, then it started to REALLY hurt.  I have a VERY high tolerance for pain, but this was really excruciating...    So, I took a few aspirin and waited about 30 minutes.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help at all and a large portion of the hair under my arms was still there, but the pain was too great.  I decided to put the epilator away for the next day.    The rest of that day, my underarms were a deep, vivid red color and I couldn&#x27;t put on a shirt.  I tried deodorant.  Big mistake - it BURNED!  When I woke up the next morning, my underarms were still red along with some scabbing.  This continued for 3 days.    I spoke with a friend about it that owns a spa, and she begged me to return the epilator, even though I was planning on actually giving it another try - because all the reviews say it gets easier.  I have thin, light hair (being a blonde), and thought about it a while - and determined that I never had a hair problem, so the torture really isn&#x27;t worth not having to shave.    I would say stick to shaving, waxing, Nair-ing, or laser removal - epilating is just not for me :/</li>
    <li> Works great, removes very short hairs. The only problem is I got a couple of ingrown hairs afterwards on my legs. It also can occasionally break a hair off, but it&#x27;s easy to go over spots you missed.</li>
    <li> I bougth a similar product about a year ago, from the beginning it didn&#x27;t work well until it broke with no apparent reasons. Most of my life I had use wax and now with the Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator, hair removal, braun, silk-epil, best hair remover ever, epilation, grooming, bikini, health and beauty my legs feel smooth, they look great and I use it very 2 weeks.  I highly recommend this product. Is a BRAUN brand!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the product but my girlfriend does.  She says it works fine.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and it does hurt, but its the first epilator that she&#x27;s ever used so she has no other experience to compare it to.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t heard about anyone using an epilator since the old torture springs of the old 1980&#x27;s epilady until I met a woman from South America who told me  epilators were very common there. Since I am always looking for better methods of hair removal, I researched and read all of the reviews for different epilators and decided on the Braun 5270. I&#x27;ve had the epilator for about a month now and I love it. It&#x27;s easy to use, there&#x27;s minimal mess, and the results last a lot longer than shaving and just as long as waxing. The light and the other attachments are useful too! I usually use it in front of the t.v. in the evening after a bath, then I follow with a moisturizer.    The poor reviews this product has received due the lack of pain tolerance is unfortunate. I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for a while so the pain was not an issue for me.  Actually, the more I used the machine the less painful it was. I will say that if you are prone to ingrown hairs from shaving or waxing then you should definitely exfoliate regularly in addition to using a product like \\&quot;No Bump\\&quot; which can be purchased at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I highly recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the mess of home waxing or the price of salon waxing. For those who don&#x27;t wax regularly the pain will probably be a bit much to get used to at first.</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd review for this product i gave it 5 stars the next day i bought it as i really loved it.but today i am giving it 3 stars after using it for 2 months and this is why.    1-my hair is growing faster than the rate i used too when i was waxing,i used to wax my arms every 3 weeks but now i epilate every week.    2-the growing hair is rough,thick not as i used to have it while waxing .    3- i had a bad problem with hair growing under skin (arms and legs)which increased very much after starting using silk-epil.which need to be exfoliated which is an annoying thing for me to do.    But to be honest i still use it ,especialy for upper lip and whole face ( but also the hair grows faster than i used with threading)  i belive i have to take rest from time to time and go back to waxing at least it exfoliat my skin and gives a healthy feeling.and i still believe it saves time ,effort nd money    i am attaching my first review     I got it yesterday and i used it ,i don&#x27;t believe my self in less than half an hour i was done with my legs ,my arms and under my arms. i used to use wax and suger which used to take longer time and sometimes i go for shaving if i am in hurry and the hair is short to be waxed.   yes it is painful ( is there a method for removing hair not painful???)in the begining but i believe i can tolerate this pain for the sake of time and effort saving.     i tried it near the sensitive area but i felt it hurts very much and leaves the skin injured with bleeding ,Don&#x27;t use on sensitive area nor near it TRUST ME.use your old way you used to remove the hair in this area.     i have fine facial hair where i used to get it done by threading ,but i tried Silk Epil over it and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all and i got a clean smooth face,i used it for upper lip too ,its great better than waxing and threading i used to do. ( be careful not to go near your eyebrows )   wowww i am saving alot of money by no more threading     By the way i bought it from bed bath andbeyond and used a coupon and got it cheaper than here.   but thanks amazon customers for the reviews that helped me to buy it.</li>
    <li> It REALLY hurt on the armpits, but once the bulk of the hair was gone, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much. It got better because you aren&#x27;t doing it all at once anymore. Similar in the bikini area too. I would NOT recommend doing all of the are \\&quot;down there\\&quot;; use the trimmer/foil shaver instead or a razor. I did bleed some in the armpits and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP*&lt;br /&gt;get a cool washcloth/wetwipe and WITCH HAZEL (or Tucks pads); helped a LOT on the armpits/bikini areas! It cools it down, is an antiseptic, and helps the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP*&lt;br /&gt;touch it lightly at first on the armpits and rotate in between your armpits to give yourself a break and using witch hazel and dry it off before going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP*&lt;br /&gt;Put your hand way up on a door frame or wall to help hold your arm back to pull the skin tighter in your arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs were no problem at all. Barely felt it. LOVED it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP*&lt;br /&gt;use it right after you dry off from your shower; you hair is more flexible and won&#x27;t break off as easily, plus your pores are more open and the hair comes out easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the light a LOT, as my hair is pretty fine and difficult to see under room light. I didn&#x27;t even need the vibrating head; I used the head that gets closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was cordless/rechargable, but I&#x27;m in the bathroom anyways near an outlet. The cord is long enough. I was under the assumption it was cordless and thought it was a charger, not a power cord. But I think it has more needed power being corded.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this epilator today and already used it on both my legs and underarms.  I&#x27;m a once a month waxer so I figured there could be some pain.    Well I started with my legs and... no pain!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it so I turned it off, removed the roller cover and my gosh, tons of little hairs!  It was working.  So I tried my underarms.  A little more pain but not nearly as much as I expected.  Hubby felt my legs after and couldn&#x27;t take his hands off them!  Now that&#x27;s worth it, when your hubby of almost 9 years is acting like he&#x27;s just dating you again, lol.  I&#x27;m going to try bikini line next.  All in all, I LOVE this epilator.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for years and this is just so much easier.  I do lay out an old news paper when I use it to catch the hair that fall on the floor; it is easy to just role ut upa and throw it out, no mess.    It works beautifully.  and the effect lasts so you only need to use it every 3 or 4 weeks.  again, I can&#x27;t say how happy I am with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I really researched epilators before I bought this one.  I read all of the reviews from it was a definitely comfortable experience almost calming (I thought they were on drugs you are after all ripping out hair at the root) to it was the most excrutiating pain I have ever felt I would rather have a baby.  I felt that the actual experience should fall in between these two.  It did.  My most painful area was my ankle area.  The rest of my legs did not bother my much.  It stung and I had red bumps and irritation that was obvious for 24 hours.  It was not smooth after the first night.  I have contiued using it each day for the past week.  My legs are still not smooth. This could be because of hair growth from shaving or it is breaking the hair off.  I am not sure.  It is a breeze now.  Not painful at all on legs.  I gave the product a 4 because of smoothness.  I am pleased with it and will continue to use it on my legs.      I tried under my arms last night.  It was painful.  I did about half of each.  It takes multiple swipes for this.  I am hoping to work up to this.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have lots to say and I will try to be organized about it.  I had never heard of an epilator before.  I was looking for a new electric razor and came upon them in my search.  I ordered an Emjoi and when it came it did not work.  I started researching after that and found many reviews that said Emjoi works well WHEN it works...so I moved on to Braun.  First let me say that Amazon has the fastest shipping and terrific customer service.  Now on to the epilator.      First of all, the pain.  I am not a wimp...had my first baby naturally...on pitocin.  This process HURTS.  The first time I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to be able to get through it.  But, I did one leg one day and the other the next.  My hair is course, medium darkness, but I have a lot of it.  I think I should have shaved and gotten the hairs and different periods of regrowth.  Although I used the trimmer, I was yanking a lot of hair all at once.  The worst areas were my ankles, inner thighs and behind the knees.  I found that my bikini did not hurt as much as other areas-perhaps because the hair is more sparse there.  Now, the second and third time I used the epilator the pain was decreased one hundered fold.  BUT...IT STILL HURTS-it is just more bearable.  This last time was even better....perhaps as the hair changes it will continue to get better.    Now...the results.  VERY smooth the first time, but not very smooth since.  However, the regrowth is so fine, that although I am not completely smooth, I ahve found I can last 7-9 days without a touch-up and it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband or me.  I used to have horrrible stubble the morning after shaving.  I have used the electric razor part to smooth some problem areas out and it works better than any I have ever used.  The trimmer is also very nice.  I am too afraid to try my underarms.    Side effects:  I got a terrible red rash that clears after 24 hours.  That has also been getting better with each use.  But...don&#x27;t expect to put on shorts right after epilating.  I got some ingrown hairs, but I got those along with horrible razor burn after shaving also.    TIPS:  Exfoliate before and EVERY day in the shower.  Pull your skin tight in the opposite direction that you are epilating...it eases the pain.  The roller head is a good idea for 1st timers, but if you can stand it, use the \\&quot;experienced\\&quot; head on high speed-the pain is reduced and it is much more efficient.      I gave the product 4 stars because you don&#x27;t get completly smooth for \\&quot;weeks.\\&quot;  Epilation is not for everyone.  It is very labor intensive (my first time took me 2 plus hours) and it is painful.  But, I find that compared to shaving every other day and my razor burn and stubble from that I really like it.  The more I do it, the less I want to go back to shaving.  I first used this around Feb. 20th and it is March 19th and I have not used a razor on my legs since.     The product itself is great...the attachments are nice and it works as described.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this epilator doing a search for hair removal, read all the reviews and hesitantly purchased. Until I found this the only epilators I had any experience with was back in the 80&#x27;s when I was a kid and a cousin and I experimented with my aunts coiled torture device-needless to say I swore never to epilate again. Fast forward twenty-five years and thousands of disposable razors and nicks later and I have saw the light.     I used it for two weeks before I reviewed it to give an accurate description. It does hurt like #@*! the first time you use it but as most other reviewers have said it lessens each time. I did get a rash after the first time and for some reason it was worse on my arms and the worst bumps lasted a couple of days. The second time I epilated the rash was minimal and went away overnight. It lessens the sting if you just use the massaging rollers first and pull your skin tight when epilating. I use a good moisturizer afterwards. I have course hair on my legs and have always had to shave every day, but I have been able to wait 5 days before doing a touch up and alot of the hairs I get then are ones I missed before. The light is great and very helful especially on the backs of my legs. I have not used it on my underarms or bikini area yet-trying to build my courage. I&#x27;ll never use a razor on my legs again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, and let me say this epilator really works!  I used it three days in a row when I first got it, and after those three times it no longer hurts.  I&#x27;ve also noticed the hairs are a lot finer, so even when they&#x27;re growing in they&#x27;re not as noticeable as they used to be when I shaved.  This was worth the money.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how I got by with shaving before.</li>
    <li> Hi,  I bought this product on suggestion of my friend. It was painful while it pulls hair the first time but then iam used to it now... i never go to a parlor noww...I like it though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie - there is pain involved.  But if you have an average level of tolerance for discomfort you should be ok.  In my opinion it is totally worth it to have smooth skin for weeks after!  If you&#x27;re prepared for the noise (it&#x27;s a bit loud) and the discomfort, and would like to not have to shave all the time, this product is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I have been using a different brand of epilator, off and on, for years now.  Many times I gave it up because of the pain.  I thought I might be a fool for buying another epilator, but I saw that there were over 200 reviews on this one, and decided to give it a shot because I really wanted it to work for me.    I am SO GLAD I bought this one!  I love the spotlight it has.  If you follow the directions, and move the epilator slowly up the length of your leg, for instance, it does a great job.  My other epilator never got my skin that smooth.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results are after using this for a month.  It also hurts substantially less than my last epilator - I almost feel like I&#x27;m not doing anything!  But you can see the hairs flying all over the place (LOL) and it&#x27;s pulling out hairs the other epilator never found.    If you are considering buying one, just try it!  I have often wondered why more people don&#x27;t use epilators, with these great results - but the shaving industry doesn&#x27;t want people to know!  Think how much money people spend on razorblades and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I have very corse hair and it won&#x27;t take the hairs out unless my hair on my legs is pretty long.  I do love that some of my hair is coming in ver fine and almost blond so the hair is less noticeable but it doesn&#x27;t seem to elipe it very well thin either.  Even after using it which for my legs can take 30 minutes my legs still feel stubby on the bottom.  My top feels very soft but I still will hav alot of fine hairs I can get to come out.  I do love to use it on my pits..works great and I can get all the hairs out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and hoping that the longer I use it the better it will get but I&#x27;m not sure it will matter.  I&#x27;m kind of wishing I would hav bought a cheaper one first but oh well.  The concept is awesome just wish it worked better for me.  Oh and by the way...it does hurt like hell when you first start but then gets better everytime you use it. I still can&#x27;t force myself to use it on my bikini line...I get waxes and this thing hurts 10x worse down there.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator ever.  I was anticipating alot of pain at first and this it did hold true to that! It feels like an electric shock, but it isn&#x27;t that bad after a few times. I started shaving with a razor and did a once over every day until the hairs started growing in. It did get better after just a couple of days of just doing spots at a time when the hair did come in longer. I&#x27;ve had this for 3 weeks now and I don&#x27;t hesitate to grab it and do maintenance. The downside is most of the time it doesn&#x27;t fully grab the hair and pull it completely out so I&#x27;m not getting that super smooth feeling that it claims. It like cuts it shorter, but doesn&#x27;t fully pull every hair out. I have some very short stubble all the time. It&#x27;s like when you just shave and you get a shiver and the stubble appears almost instantly. It feels like that all the time. I do need to keep practicing so maybe once I master the technique it will improve.  ALSO, YOU HAVE TO EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE! Exfoliate every day especially before using. Dead skin cells accumulate every day and when a hair is pulled from the root it has to have a clean follicle to grow through or it will create an INGROWN HAIR!  I had a a million all over and am just now fixing this problem.  Other than the super smooth feeling that this epilator implies, I love it. I hope it lasts a long time for me because I&#x27;ve only had to use a razor to do underarms and bikini line. It&#x27;s been very liberating!</li>
    <li> This epilator is pretty good at what it does, but the quality is not as good as it could be. So far it works fine, but I wonder how long it will last due to the mostly plastic construction. I found it rather painful the 1st application and had to take lots of breaks. I then tried waxing another part of my body, and recommend that for the 1st time if you haven&#x27;t tried it before. Then the Braun epilator works great to maintain and is not very painful either. For the money I think it is well worth it if it holds up to time. Then again with the cost of a wax job, for maintenance it is great. Plus there is the advantage that it will grab hairs much shorter than needed to do a good wax job, so you can stay smoother more of the time. I would recommend this to others, if you are fairly pain tolerant. Otherwise do the wax 1st, and use it to maintain.  Shipping was fast, and arrived in good shape.</li>
    <li> I had an old epilady that I got about 10 years ago that I used for my bikini area in between waxes.  It wasn&#x27;t too quick, but got the job done if I couldn&#x27;t get to the waxing salon.  The Braun epilator is amazing!  I don&#x27;t even go to the waxer anymore at all.  I have completely replaced those $50+ trips to the salon with a quick, easy home solution.  I have been waxing for years, so pain isn&#x27;t really an issue.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove all the hair.  Quite painful.  Redness lasted less than 1 hour.  Overall, not impressed.</li>
    <li> I just got this a few days ago in the mail. I purchased it after seeing all the rave reviews about it. The only real concern I had was the price, and was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it. Boy was I wrong. I am now throwing out my shaver, wax kits, bleachers, etc. I love that you can use it anywhere on your body. Used this to get rid of the peach fuzz around my belly, bikini line, underarms, and legs. It does sting a little bit at first, but hopefully I will get used to it.</li>
    <li> With over 300 5-star ratings, I doubt there is more I can say about how great this product is.  Instead I have two tips for users or potential users.&lt;br /&gt;If you have skin that gets red &amp; blotchy after tweezing or epilating, get a bottle of Benadryl itch stop gel, apply to the skin, wait 5 minutes, wipe off and then epilate with blotch-free (or at least reduced) skin!&lt;br /&gt;If you are a person absolutely terrified of the pain, get a bottle of skin numbing gel.  I don&#x27;t adhere to one brand, just anything that ends with -caine.  Just  test a small area first to make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic to the product first.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed, it really works. I was nervous at first because I didn&#x27;t know how unpleasant it would feel. There&#x27;s a bit of \\&quot;sting\\&quot; but if you just keep moving the device it really does remove the hair! I really am thrilled.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, it really is!!  I was in the search for a better and cheaper way to get rid of hair on my legs and searched the internet for hair removal information.  I came across the reviews left for this product and I figured this product was something for me to try. I got it yesterday and I was so excited to try it!  The pain was minimal considering this device yanks hair from the root.  I was expecting much more discomfort and pain.  I did not experience ANY, no lie!  My tolerance for pain is a bit higher than most people I would guess. I do give myself bikini waxes on a regular basis, so maybe that has something to do with it.  But people on here compared it to getting a tattoo, and well, I find that quite hard to believe!  The Braun 5270 Silk Epil X&#x27;elle did not leave any hair behind on the first pass along my leg.  The light is a great feature that shines just right and helps to light the way along the skin.  In reading the reviews posted here people complained of the noise, I did not think it was loud at all.  People also complained of red dots and irritation to the skin, so I was expecting something along those lines.  There were NO red dots or skin irritation (which I was expecting) for me.  I did follow the advice of doing it right after a shower, that could have helped.  After I was done, I applied some lotion (non-perfumed) and my skin felt great!  Now my legs will be hair free for weeks rather than days!  This product works so well and I believe it is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been usign Braun products for years and fairly happy with all of them. This Braun Epilator is no exception. Before this, I&#x27;ve tried cordless Epilators from various brands, and found none of them worked quite well. I don&#x27;t have a lot of body hair, but the few there are have grown coarse through years of shavings. The corded Braun Epilator is the first one that works on my hair. Compared to all the cordless epilators I&#x27;ve owned, this Braun is powerful and intimidating at first. It is also much more painful than all my wimpy cordless because it actually pulls a lot of hairs out with one swipe. I thought about having a glass of wine while using the Braun, but didn&#x27;t because I was not supposed to operate heavy machinary while drinking. Luckily, it is almost painfree after the first round because the new growth are much finer. Despite its intimidating power, it is actually quite easy to manuver around curves as long as one is careful. Some features I thought not necessary, such as the lighting, turn out all very handy and practical. It&#x27;s finally time I can throw away all my other cordless epilators and shavers. Braun is the way to go.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product.  I&#x27;m not sure what my feelings will be long term as I haven&#x27;t owned it for too long.  I haven&#x27;t really had any pain problems, however I haven&#x27;t attempted my underarms just yet.  I can certainly feel it around my few ankle hairs!  I won&#x27;t say that it tickles yet it isn&#x27;t that bad.  I have a fairly high pain tolerance, and an obsessive \\&quot;plucker\\&quot; if that explains anything.  I usually start out my legs with the \\&quot;easier\\&quot; attachment, then graduate to the closer attachement.  By then my legs are somewhat numb.  Gave it five stars because my husband was impressed when he felt my legs for the first time after using it!  His exact comment was \\&quot;oooh\\&quot;.  Need I say more?  So, ladies and gents I wouldn&#x27;t purchase if you can&#x27;t handle eyebrow plucking or waxing, but if this isn&#x27;t a problem then go for it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as to whether this machine would hurt so bad that I could not use it but the pain is not that bad. Sure an epilator is going to hurt a little bit but it is worth the pain. By the way, maybe I have a high pain tolerance (I don&#x27;t think that I do) but it didn&#x27;t really hurt that much, more of a tickling sensation and of course some spots hurt more than others. This is such an awesome machine, it&#x27;s like waxing but without the mess!</li>
    <li> This product is just as I expected and more. Good quality and does the work. Together with the accessories it becomes an extremely good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a woman but if I were I&#x27;d imagine this would be teh epilator for me.</li>
    <li> if your hair is too fine it will break the shaft instead of pulling from the root.</li>
    <li> i suppose it works...but very very painful if you aren&#x27;t used to your leg hairs plucked out. i bought it to save money...thinking that was way cheaper than buying razors. its sitting under my sink collecting dust.</li>
    <li> Good Product, does what it is supposed to do. It does not hurt too much, although epilating without hurting is impossible. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an epilator so I experienced a mix of fear and excitement when it arrived at my doorstep.  I expected pain, but I figured the excellent rating on this item meant it was either tolerable or worth it.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for exactly 1 week, I&#x27;ve found there is also a big mental component as I kept closing my eyes and tensing in expectation of the pain, too.    This is what I did:  I shaved and then used the epilator every night (on the low setting) as the hair was growing back.  I tried both head attachments and prefer the massaging rollers hands down (the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; attachment felt like it was scraping my legs because I couldn&#x27;t get the angle exactly right).  Yes, it was painful and certain areas are worse, but having baby smooth legs, arms, and underarms make it worth it.  The bikini area is still a \\&quot;high anxiety\\&quot; area for me because it is the most painful to do but I think it will get easier with time or until I master my fear.  Doing my underarms weren&#x27;t too bad and arms were actually a piece of cake.  My goal now is to gradually increase the days between use.    Would I recommended this product?  Yes.  Does it work?  Absolutely.  Is it loud?  Yes.  I also wish it was cordless but it&#x27;s not a big deal.      Best of luck to you!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s just two things you need to know: 1) it really works and 2) it is painful.     Pain of course is a relative thing - some handle it better than others, and some handle different types of pain differently. I can&#x27;t stand tooth pain and hate going to the dentist, but had no problem getting a tattoo. This is more like the tattoo for me. Also, since I previously had my legs \\&quot;sugared\\&quot; (like waxing) for cycling, I am probably more desensitized to this than someone who has only shaved their legs.    So if you can take the pain, then get one. I could buy two of these a month for what I paid for sugaring. That alone makes it worth it. I like the way it operates and (as others have noted) the light is a brilliant add-on. If mine breaks, I will definitely get another!</li>
    <li> I am hairy, I take after my dad. My razors go dull after two shaves. I&#x27;m finally retiring the razor!    True, it hurts, but only for a bit, because the skin goes somewhat numb as you work. Initially it reminds me of the time I was gardening and thought I was standing in a pricker bush (thistle).  It was a bees nest I stomped through and they were stinging me. But if you aren&#x27;t being stung then you know you have a bad investment. Also - by the time you think you want to stop the hair is gone and you can. That&#x27;s how the upper lip felt. However, unless you have no nose I doubt this unit would satisfy you for an upper lip job since it&#x27;s too big for that for most people.    I highly recommend, as soon as I got it I did my legs, pits, and I bought a small one by enjoi for my upper lip, also recommended. After treatment it feels like I shaved. Inspection of the hair reveals that some was cut, others pulled, no pulps were present, unfortunately.  But this thing does the job fast, although it works better to take it slow and steady, and I am happy. Also - this unit is made in Germany, not china :)    If you are already tweezing, if your hair grows so fast that you get shadow after two hours, then this may be for you!</li>
    <li> I love this Braun epilator! It is my 2nd epilator (the first one was the Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim which I didn&#x27;t love). I have been using this product for about 5 months now and I would love to share with you my experience with this great epilator!    It comes with 3 detachable heads:    1) Shaver head with OptiTrim attachment   (I totally forgot that it came with a shaver head until I started writing this review. It don&#x27;t think many people use it but I guess it&#x27;s not a bad thing to have around. I have never used it myself).     2) Active massaging rollers - \\&quot;massaging rollers stimulate the skin with micro-impulses before and after epilation\\&quot;  (I only used it the first time because it says that it&#x27;ll \\&quot;massage\\&quot; your skin. But I think that it just gets in the way of faster removal of hair)    3) EfficiencyPro clip - \\&quot;provides a thorough epilation that is now even faster. It ensures maximum skin contact at the optimum usage position thus enabling more effective hair removal\\&quot;.  (This is not a clipper as I had initially thought when I was doing my research...it&#x27;s just a head thing you put on the epilator and this is the only thing I am using with this epilator.)    I have used it on my leg, underarms, bikini, and upper lips.  I&#x27;m going to go over each body part separately because the hair is so different for me (thickness and how fast it grows).     My Legs - I probably need to shave my legs a 2-3 times a week.  My leg hair is kind of thin and sparse to begin with but I do have black hair so it is noticeable (at least to me) when I don&#x27;t shave for more than a week. My first time using the epilator - I let my leg hair grow out for a little over a week (maybe like 10 days). I took a warm shower as some other reviewers suggested. My gosh, the first time was very painful but tolerable that I was able to finish both my legs. It did take me about 40 minutes the first time because it was pretty painful so I couldn&#x27;t go as fast. I was very, very happy with the results. My legs weresuper smooth and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about hair removal for at least a week. A week later I tried again and I was shocked to see that it hurt a lot less...I couldn&#x27;t believe that I had already gotten used to the pain, plus it took half the time (20 minutes) to get all the hair out. By this time I had discovered that EfficiencyPro clip head was much more efficient than the rolling massaging head. My hair was even thinner than before. After about 4 months of using this, I had gotten a bit lazier with my leg hair. It still takes me at least 15 minutes to do both legs. I think the reason is that my leg hair is so light that I can&#x27;t see them and I have to look at my legs closely to make sure I get every little hair. Because it does take me 15-20 minutes (which is a long time if you have a busy schedule like me), I have recently started shaving my legs again because it takes me less than a minute to shave.     My underarms - This area is a whole other story!!! The hair on my underarm is totally different from my leg hair. When I was shaving, I had to shave every single day. I have dark, coarse underarm hair (and I have a lot of it). 12 hours after shaving, I usually have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Sometimes I would pluck my underarm hair and I always loved the results but it just took forever to do. When I discovered this epilator, it was a dream come true! Because I was so used to plucking my underarm hair, it didn&#x27;t hurt at all to use the epilator on this area! It takes about a couple runs over the same area to remove the hair. It takes about a minute or two to do both underarms. This is how I used it: First time, I let my underarm hair grow out for two days (it wasn&#x27;t a pretty sight!). I used the epilator and as I&#x27;ve mentioned already, it was not painful at all.  The next day when I took a shower, I accidently grabbed my shaver as a reflex (I&#x27;ve been shaving my underarm for like 15 years every single day)...then I realized that i didn&#x27;t have to shave anymore!!! On the third day, I noticed that some of the underarm hair had started to sprout already. By the fourth day, I had to use the epilator again. And that has been my pattern for the last 5 months...every 3-4 days I will use the epilator for my underarm. I have not shaved my underarms since I got this epilator. I&#x27;m loving the freedom of not shaving every day! Using this epilator hasn&#x27;t made my underarm hair any thinner like it did with my leg hair.     My Bikini area - I wax (myself) in this area. I have thick, coarse, dark hair in this area so shaving is not an option (unless I want to shave everyday...which I don&#x27;t want to do). I thought that it was pretty painful the first time I used the epilator even though I&#x27;m used to waxing my bikini area. I have not gotten the nerve to do a complete Brazilian bikini hair removal with this epilator (I&#x27;m not that brave...yet). I have to say that this does a good job in removing the hair...but I do end up with more ingrown hair than with waxing (which other reviewers have commented about). I guess with waxing, it removes the the dead outer layer of the skin so it does exfoliate the skin but with epilating, it just removes the hair so you have to remember to do extra exfoliating before and after using your epilator. I use Tend Skin to help prevent and treat ingrowns and I have to use it more frequently when using the epilator. I think I prefer waxing over epilating but in this case, epilating takes less time so I tend to epilate my bikini area. Unlike my legs, it is still relatively painful (not as painful as the first time) but I guess my skin is more sensitive in this area. I use the epilator maybe twice a month on my bikini area. I&#x27;m not so overly concerned about being hairless in this area.     Upper lips  - I used to wax once a week. My upper lip hair is relatively thin and sparse but I do have black hair. Epilation with Braun has completely replaced waxing. I tried [[ASIN:B0000DK5LW Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover]] but it could not get the tiny, thin hair out. With this Braun epilator, it removes the tiniest hair, even the ones that are barely sprouting out of the skin. It takes about a minute or two to remove everything. I use the epilator once a week on this area and that&#x27;s all I need. I don&#x27;t get ingrowns (never have) on my upper lips.     As you can see, overall I have had a positive experience with this epilator and I totally recommend this to anyone! One annoying thing about this is that the cord gets tangled very easily...but that&#x27;s not super important. Maybe the next time I get an epilator, I might get the cordless ones but for now, I&#x27;m happy with this Braun epilator!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for 7 months now.  It&#x27;s been a wonderful thing for me, but not without its issues.  So here is my synopsis.  For reference, I&#x27;m a dark haired person with sensitive fair skin who has both been waxed by pros and done it herself for the last 10-15 years...  It&#x27;s a great little gadget that will keep you hairless and smooth - for me, I have to do a &#x27;touch up&#x27; approx 1x per week during bare leg season.  But my hair grows fast and coarse.  I can get away with a longer timeframe during the winter months since my hubbie never seems to notice if my legs are smooth and silky or if I&#x27;m a sasquach.  ;-)     #1.  Does it hurt?  Of course it does. You&#x27;re yanking out hairs by the root.  It&#x27;s probably a bit worse than waxing because you have to go over the same area a few times to catch all the hairs.  But if you can stand waxing, you can grit your teeth and stand this.  Or take an aspirin/advil/tylenol first to help a bit.    #2  Does it scar?  NO.  In my opinion, it will definitely cause ingrown hairs, but no actual scarring.  If you have an ingrown hair that becomes deeply embedded without being removed, it may leave a dark spot on the surface skin.  What has worked well for me is the following:      - Exfoliate both with a scrub wash regularly and use a chemical exfoliator (such as KP duty) once a week or so.  - Follow the product instructions and make sure to use rubbing alcohol to clean the exfoliator parts every time you use it.  - If you need to remove an ingrown hair, use good tweezers which are dipped in rubbing alcohol first.      What else.  I like the light.  Yes, it is noisy, but the motor works well so far, which is more important to me than quietness.  Does it break the hairs?  Yes, I&#x27;d say it breaks some hair rather than removing it, but not overly so.      Overall it functions as advertised. It takes about an hour for me to do both legs and bikini area properly each go.  A professional waxing is probably less painful and more effective/less ingrowns - so if that route is affordable to you, I&#x27;d say go for that.  But for someone who gets 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on her legs after shaving in the morning, and can&#x27;t standing paying $80+tip for waxing every couple of weeks, this is really a great product.  It&#x27;ll pay for itself the first time you use it!!  What do you have to lose?  Try it!!!</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised that following my first use of the Braun 5270 epilator, that very few hairs have returned to my chin area. My skin is smooth and very soft with no stubble after many days. In the past I used a battery operated model, however I find that this electric model far excels my old one. I would recommend it to anyone that has facial hair to remove.</li>
    <li> At only $50, more women ought to give this great little epilator a try! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not right for everyone, but only a few weeks in it&#x27;s hard to imagine ever going back.    I read a LOT of reviews here and elsewhere before buying this, my first epilator. Everything pointed to this being the best value. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase so far. Ouch factor dropped off pretty quickly. Be sure to hold the skin taught if you notice it pulling - it makes a huge difference. I&#x27;d read the best way to get started was to shave as usual, then use the epilator every day for a week, then every other day for 2 weeks, then less and less. I&#x27;m in week 3 right now. Do NOT \\&quot;grow out\\&quot; and then start. The more hairs you have to pull in each pass, the more it will hurt! I found my legs were much less painful than the reviews I read made it sound. A few weeks into \\&quot;the schedule\\&quot; I barely feel it - plucking my eyebrows is definitely worse. But my leg hair has never been thick.    The included trimmer/shaver work pretty well, though I find the device&#x27;s shape rather awkward and bulky for use in that mode. I guess the idea is to be \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; and offer you alternatives for any areas you chicken out of epilating.    Personally, I was most interested in getting this for my underarms and I&#x27;m extremely happy with the result. That area always grew a lot faster, darker, and thicker than my legs, and tended to get very irritated by shaving. By the time the razor burn went away, the ugly prickles would be back! First day after shaving, epilator could only find a couple strays at the edge to yank out. The second day was, I admit, painful enough to make my eyes water. But the results were fantastic. I&#x27;ve continued \\&quot;on schedule\\&quot; to minimize pain but could easily be going more days in between already. Going in, I was hoping I could work my way down to a once per week grooming regimen, but I&#x27;m confident at this point I&#x27;ll get to the 2-4 weeks between sessions people talk about.    I&#x27;m working on the bikini area very, very slowly. It is much more painful than legs or underarms (not surprising - waxing there is a lot more painful, too). I think I may have to get waxed and restart \\&quot;the schedule\\&quot; down there. That should get me past the worst of it (pulling the firmly rooted existing hairs) all in one go so I can skip straight to the maintenance phase. Fewer hairs with younger roots will be a lot more manageable.     If I successfully keep this up, I may buy one of the cordless, water-proof versions next year (for easier cleaning and travel). But I&#x27;m glad I got this first. When I&#x27;m down to using it every other week or so the minor inconveniences of the cord and the alcohol/brush cleaning procedure may not be worth upgrading to avoid.</li>
    <li> No regrets with this product.  I have been using now for 2 months.  I did get the little red bumps after first usage and it was not comfortable but now I use weekly with no bumps, no pain, no problems. Would buy this product again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s possible, but like other reviewers, I find it to be more painful than waxing.  It is not just uncomfortable.  Maybe it is painless for some, but it is extremely painful for me.  But I have lots of very thick hair.  Plus the sound it makes is psychologically jarring.  I always cringe when it&#x27;s on!  It hurts a little less if you use that Smooth Away product that supposedly removes hair (it doesn&#x27;t remove much, but I think it gets rid of those tiny, invisible hairs that still hurt like crazy to yank out at the root).      If I could feel no pain, i would love it.  It is so quick and easy to use every day.  Although I always think it&#x27;s going to pinch my skin, it never has.  If you&#x27;re brave, or have very fine hair, it&#x27;s great.  Otherwise, it just collects dust b/c you&#x27;re too scared to use it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and would buy the same one again.  I use it on my legs and it did hurt, but I expected it to.  I haven&#x27;t gotten any ingrown hairs and it reduced the appearance of my pores.  It doesn&#x27;t seems to grab the really fine hairs on my thighs, I&#x27;m very fair skinned and my hair is pretty light and thin on my upper legs. I still recommend because it does what I need it to, it is very liberating to not have to shave every day. Warning: it takes two or three times using it to get used to the feeling of it working, so don&#x27;t be discouraged after using it for the first time.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my best friend and she loves it! Not only that, I received it in the mail about 4 or 5 days after i ordered it. I would recommend this product as well as this seller :)</li>
    <li> I only use this for my underarms, and I think it&#x27;s great because I pay $12 for waxing every time I go to the salon. I don&#x27;t use it for my arms or legs or anywhere else so I can&#x27;t really say, although I&#x27;m guessing it is pretty painful... It also has a razor head so that&#x27;s another option. I like it... :) I honestly think it&#x27;s worth the money, and this is pretty good coming from me who can be pretty stingy. I also love that it has a mini pouch to put everything in. :)</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun Silk epil (Comfort) that I used for over 10 years before it finally died. I&#x27;m glad it did because this one is much better in several ways. First, the light does help you see the hairs -- one of my complaints with the old one was that in my bathroom lighting, I would miss hairs, have to come out to a better lit area, then go back and re-do. Second, it gets all the hairs in fewer passes. I thought maybe because mine was so old, it was not as precise anymore, but it looks like this one had more tweezers, so I think that is a factor. Third, the rolling head attachment makes this practically painless. Even though I have been epilating for years and usually would keep up with it (if you wait too long in between, there are more hairs to epilate at a given time, and therefore more pain), it still would hurt a little on occasion when I did my bikini area. Also, I think this creates less irritation since you go over the area less, so fewer in-grown hairs. Finally, as for epilating in general, I have found some areas where the hair has not regrown (certain parts of my bikini line and some of my leg hair) because of years of epilating. I would never go back to shaving because of the superior results -- no stubble. Even when some of the hairs grow back, you can run your hand up your leg and will still feel smoothness. I did not need to use the starter head, but if it&#x27;s less painful than the regular, I would say there is no better way for a beginner to check it out.</li>
    <li> Who ever says this is painless is lying. Its very painful in the begining but as you go it does lessen considerably.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow.  As someone whose underarm stubble used to reappear within a few hours after shaving, this epilator is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I can now go days without shaving and remain stubble-free.  And no more waxing or buying expensive Venus razor blade replacements!  This pays for itself the first few times.</li>
    <li> I am a pale skinned dark haired woman.  I am obsessed with body hair removal and I have tried it all folks!  This is by far the best purchase I have ever made for hair removal.  Yes it hurts, but they all do.  I hate my underarm hair.  Even when I shave, it immediately looks like I didn&#x27;t.  The dark hair root can be seen under the skin and it looks like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow under my arms.  I waxed for a while, but had to have help from my husband to hold my skin tight, because it is a little loose.  Otherwise I would bruise my armpits pulling the wax off.  Since he refused to help me pluck with tweezers, this is my alternative.  It works so great.  The first time it hurt, but I do it once a week and I never have to shave my armpits.  My once a week use only pulls 20-30 hairs so it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Hair grows at all different rates so you can always pluck something out.  It&#x27;s so much easier to maintain once a week then wait the 6 weeks for it all to come back in.  It would hurt too much if you do it that way.  I have so much more confidence because of this product.  I never feel self conscious when I lift my arms, because I know they are silky smooth and hair free.  Did I mention that I LOVE this device.  And to the person who gave it 4 stars because it hurt.  No pain no gain sister!  Use it frequently and the pain only happens the first time.  You must be a hair removal virgin, because this is easier than many other ways.</li>
    <li> Pros: Easy to use. Low power consumption. Saves costs and time incurred on waxing.     Cons: A bit loud on the noise. May be a bit prickly or ticklish initially or for first time users but the pain is less than a first time wax pull.      Suggestions: Waxing is still the best when you have the time and patience but the Braun epilator comes very close. I&#x27;d suggest using the Epilator for frequent usage but would recommend a wax once a while just to keep it smooth always. Though it may be a bit expensive than the other brands but I&#x27;d still recommend Braun because its German precision and quality. Trust me you&#x27;ll notice the difference with cheaper ones.     I am a guy reviewing this item. Bought it for my wife as a surprise gift. She loves it and I her skin.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve wanted an epilator for a while and it took me forever to decide which one to get. it was between this one and a panasonic i finally went with the braun because of all the positive review on amazon. this one definitely epilates better than the panasonic - the light helps me see finer hairs, and it takes less passes. it&#x27;s noisier, but i don&#x27;t really mind that. the only problem with the braun is that it&#x27;s corded! the panasonic is cordless and it&#x27;s wet/dry so you can use it in the shower (which is nice because of all the hair that falls...gross i know). so basically the braun is great but i&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s corded :(</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I waxed my legs first and a week later, when I started to notice new growth, I used this product. It was a breeze -- very little pain. I am going to follow another reviewer&#x27;s advice and dry brush my legs to prevent ingrowns. I really hope this products means the end of razors and waxings for good.</li>
    <li> Its a great product. Works very nice and does not hurt at all. Its very fast and easy. Skin feels smooth. The light also comes very handy for highlighting the area being epilated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly impressed with the 5270 epilator!  I have gone back and forth between shaving and waxing for 14 years.  Other than a little bit of touch up for fine short hairs on my knee area, I think I can retire my razor.  The biggest pros are that it gets all of the thicker, lower leg hairs and exfoliates your skin at the same time.  If it&#x27;s not pulling out hair (in an area you&#x27;ve already done), it feels like a little massage.  In other words, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or scrap your skin raw.    If you can handle waxing (in terms of pain) then you can certainly use this epilator.  I don&#x27;t feel much pain from waxing anymore on my legs and bikini area.  I don&#x27;t feel any pain with the 5270 there either.  Just little tiny plucking feelings.  Because it&#x27;s pulling so many hairs at once, it causes nerve confusion and less plucking pain vs using a tweezer.    My armpits are still really sensitive to waxing (just started doing that 2 years ago), but I get ingrown hairs and pimples there when I shave.  After showering, I stretched my underarm as taut as I could to get a firmer surface, and was done with both arms in 2 minutes.  It hurt a bit, I won&#x27;t lie.  No blood though (which I sometimes get with wax).  After a couple hours, my under arms were back to regular skin tone and only let me know they&#x27;d been through a rough time when I touched them with my fingers.    I would recommend this to anyone who wants a superb alternative to waxing!!!</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I really liked this product.  So nice not to have to shave every other day with a razor!  Best to use the roller head a first to get use to the pulling sensation. Once you graduate to the closer head, be careful to keep constant contact with your skin; otherwise,it will grab skin and cause discomfort and red marks, which do go away after a while, but can cause soreness.</li>
    <li> After I bought this product through Amazon, I was so nervous I would hate it. I finally tried it last night and was thrilled with the results. I&#x27;m impressed by the fact that it really doesn&#x27;t hurt! It&#x27;s more like a surprise zinging sensation. I concur with the other reviewers that mentioned this isn&#x27;t done quickly.  I spent at least an hour going over my legs (and bikini area) in every single direction possible to make sure I got each and every hair.  But that was my first time, and I suspect it&#x27;ll only get easier from there. I&#x27;ve got very fair and sensitive skin so I&#x27;m glad I did it an night because i did develop very distinguished red dots all over my legs but I rubbed them down with lotion and went to bed and this morning they&#x27;d vanished.  And honestly, if I can easily &#x27;tweeze&#x27; all of my leg hairs in one hour, small red dots(that go away!) aren&#x27;t even an issue. I&#x27;m amazed at how user friendly this is. This doesn&#x27;t even compare to waxing--it can be done quicker, with less pain, in the privacy of your own home, and by YOU.  The cord is nice and long, and the &#x27;smartlight&#x27; is helpful, as are the attachment that shaves your hair to the correct length for epilating.    As for ingrown hairs, anytime you rip your hair out by the roots, you&#x27;re going to run the chance of an ingrown hair.  This has nothing to do with the product, but with the act of tweezing out hairs and that hairs way of regrowth.  I know from shaving and hand tweezing that I&#x27;m prone to them so I plan on epilating after warm showers and scrubbing everything down pretty often to reduce them.  This is my first epilator since that godawful Epilady coil thingie (which stung so much I could NOT use it)so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others...say the Epilady Legend for example but I do know that the Silk Epil is a very exciting find.  I&#x27;m super impressed.</li>
    <li> The epilator hurts like heck, especially around the backs of your ankles, and it doesn&#x27;t feel silky smooth like a razor or waxing, but it does work longer than a razor, but less than waxing. I liked the attached razor attachment and the light that helps you see what you&#x27;re doing. The quality of the product was great and I would recommend this as and adjunct to the other methods of hair removal.</li>
    <li> There were parts of my body this did not hurt at all, upper thighs, both inner and outer, knees, backs of lower legs. However, the front of my legs in the shin area and the ankles. Wow. My legs were so incredibly smooth. It took about an hour to finish both legs. Now, I have been attempting a Brazilian. Holy mother of God! The pain is unreal and it&#x27;s bloody. I kept looking to see if it had pulled off strips of flesh, but no, it was all good. I am still working on it. I am hoping the pain will lessen in time. Hairs should be as short as you can get them before you start. Coarse hair seems to hurt about a hundred times worse.</li>
    <li> I am an old time user of epilator&#x27;s.  I still have the original coil (I cannot remember the name now). I have two epiladies and this one tops the list.  I have been using it for about 1month now and I love it.  If you are look for something pain free and long lasting, this is it.</li>
    <li> braun epilator is a very good one. My wife has been using this since arnd 2 months ans she is satisfied with this. She feels that it removes all thick hairs very well but it just rips thinner/finer hairs at the tip most of the time and not from the root. Its been nearly 1 and half month since she removed her underarms and leg hairs and still hardly few hairs have come up. But since hands had lots of finer hairs ..grew bit early :-(&lt;br /&gt;She had following complaints abt this epilator:&lt;br /&gt;1] Its not rechargeable though the cost is bit more.&lt;br /&gt;2] It bleeded a bit while removing her underarms[ as she couldn&#x27;t hold that area very tightly to remove the hair ] and not happy regarding finer hair removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still its a worthy product !!!! Makes skin smoother :-)</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to epilators after living in Europe. I use it all the time and love it!  It hurts the first time, and then it is not too bad.</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before, but wanted to wear something other than swim skirts this summer... So I did my homework and selected this product.  The light is VERY helpful in finding hairs that are hiding, and the roller bars really do help keep the pain as the hairs are being RIPPED out at an absolute minimum.  After the initial getting the hang of it, this is a very easy thing to do.  Very good results.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is VERY loud.  My two children (who I locked out of my bathroom for my hair removal proceedure) both demanded to know what I was doing!  They heard the noise all the way from upstairs in their rooms with the door shut.  (our house is appx 3000 square feet...)  It could have been my screaming and not the machine... JUST KIDDING!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.  Don&#x27;t be afraid.  I did use a topical pretreatment spray made by veet.  It helped with the red bumps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One last thing... I have red bumps where the hairs were.  So don&#x27;t do this for the first time on your way to the pool, lake, or whatever!  It would be hard to disguise!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I got my mom&#x27;s old epilady about ten years ago, used it a few times and never went back to it again. This is nothing like that...it&#x27;s a great alternative to any hair removing system. It is less costly than waxing (much less), it leaves body smooth, hair grows back finer and much less often than shaving, it&#x27;s easy to do, not messy and can be done anywhere. I had to shave my legs every day and I still would always feel little stubbles here and there....this leaves my legs so much smoother. I used to be a waxer when it came to other areas of the body...this is by far much less costly and messy. (for utter mess-free, put a towel underneath you when epiladying as recommended by a user below and that&#x27;ll take care of the little hairs so they don&#x27;t go everywhere!). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as the pain is concerned, I was very hesitant due to my experience w/ the old (80&#x27;s style) epilady, yet found this to be so much less painful than waxing. The trick for the underarm is to hold it at a perfect 90 degree angel and get the hairs the first and second time through so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area...because of loose skins, it is more sensitive. I use it for my legs, underarms and outer bikini area. It all seems less painful than waxing and you almost don&#x27;t even feel anything after a couple of minutes. (in some ways it&#x27;s pleasant due to the massaging feeling :p)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The light is definitely a great feature...it is very helpful especially when bright light is not available. It shines on the area being epilated and aids w/ getting \\&quot;every hair\\&quot;! I haven&#x27;t used the other heads yet but they seem like good additions for those who are interested. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complain is the directions...I either didn&#x27;t get the full thing or there aren&#x27;t any! Thankfully, I have a pretty good idea and managed fine w/out them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and is definitely not comparable to its older cousin!! It works wonders and I look forward to the upcoming summer months! Definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a better machine - except maybe a cordless version. Otherwise it&#x27;s excellent!  The daylight light is genius, and it&#x27;s powerful.  God knows why I put up with waxing for so long..</li>
    <li> this is very good product ... I have been using it for 4 years now. I love it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to want to work well.  It was necessary to make multiple passes and when you are required to do this I believe it becomes more of a torture device at that point.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was so tired of shaving every two to three days with the time and razor burn and could not afford to get waxed. I also like to keep my nether regions clean so was excited about the shaver attachment.     The first few times I used the epilator it hurt like sin. I found that pulling the skin taught made it more bearable but, lets face it, it hurts and be prepared. BUT, stick with it and it will hurt less once your hair becomes thinner with each grow back.     I use the shaver attachment for my nether regions and my armpits. I really like it and it does get pretty close. I get horrible razor burn if I use a razor in those areas so this was a great alternative for me. My only recommendation if you choose to try it, be aware of the little teeth that help grab the hair might catch your skin if you go too fast, go slow and you should be fine.     I have been using my epilator on my legs for 4 months and I LOVE IT. I only have to do it every couple weeks to one month depending on what I am wearing/the weather. I usually do it right before I shower and just watch TV or something while I do it. It takes me about 30 minutes now that I have done it for a while but I do remember it taking longer at first. I never tried it on my bikini area, women who do use it there are BRAVE and I commend them.     Hope this review helps. Cheers.</li>
    <li> I only recently tried using an epilator for the first time. I borrowed a friend&#x27;s emjoi while on vacation and I liked it. I decided to get my own and purchased this instead because it had a lot more reviews than the emjoi epilators with a good average rating. I was disappointed in this. It doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job removing the hair. It seems to have some trouble removing some hairs and also cuts them instead of pulling from the root. Also, corded is more of a burden than I thought it would be. The epilator is harder to clean. With the emjoi, all I had to do was knock the head on the sink a couple times and it would be completely clean. I didn&#x27;t want to return someone&#x27;s epilator with my hairs stuck on it! The Braun on the other hand is a pain to clean even when I use the cleaning brush it&#x27;s still never clean. The hairs get trapped in the \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; and you&#x27;d have to pull hair out of each slot one by one to get it totally clean... Not only that, but this somehow pulled at my skin when I did my armpits and I ended up getting blisters!     I&#x27;m returning this one and getting the Emjoi. I should have stuck with what worked for me but I thought this would be better. The only thing that makes this Braun better than Emjoi is that Braun is made in Germany and Emjoi is made in China.</li>
    <li> I read all of the other reviews before purchasing this Braun 5270 Epilator.  The majority of the reviews referenced the pain involved, especially during the first use.  So, I was expecting the worst, but the pain was actually more of a discomfort.  It helps to pull your skin tight, and also to make sure the hair on your legs is standing up by rubbing it the wrong way.  The 2-week duration of the epilation is overestimated - I found that I need to use it once a week or so.  However, the write-up said that when the hair grows back, it is finer and lighter, and that is true.  So far, I have only used it on my legs, even though the literature says that it&#x27;s safe on bikini area and armpits.</li>
    <li> Good for legs. It does hurt the first time, sort of like a waxing in super slow motion, but follow-up sessions are not as bad. I could not do underarm hair, too massively painful, but maybe that&#x27;s just me. The light is good for finding small hairs.</li>
    <li> I am a first time epilator so I was very nervous when i purchased it. Everyone kept talking about how bad the pain was and blah blah blah....i think the pain in completely bearable and it only hurt like the first time...now i can use it with absolutely no pain! I have had it for about a month now and have not picked up my regular razor since!! I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator for the last 15 years and my old one just died.  I bought this particular one because it had a light and I have to say it really comes in handy.  You can see every little hair, even the light colored ones.  The best ever!  If you&#x27;re not used to epilating, it may hurt at first but I have to say it&#x27;s better than having to shave every day.  My legs are much smoother and softer after using this and I could not live without it.</li>
    <li> The first use was a little scary, and painful, but after that touch ups are a breeze, and it really does pluck the tiniest little hairs.  I use it after showering every few days and it takes just a minute and does what waxing never did. No more monkeying with the hot wax, then tearing it off of your body only to be left with a million hairs that never came out.  This little guy does the trick with no skin irritation.  I&#x27;m still not baby bottom smooth, but I&#x27;m a dark haired, hairy person, and though I epil one day, the next day new, different hairs are growing.  I&#x27;m hoping that over time and regular use of this little guy, the hair will grow back much less heavy.</li>
    <li> 1) It hurts me, I grit my teeth when I use it. (Why? I hate sticky warm wax)&lt;br /&gt;2) Does NOT pull out all my hairs. (My arms always have strays that just won&#x27;t go)&lt;br /&gt;3) You have to run it thru a couple of times to get most of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;4) Still faster than waxing. (No warming, spreading, pulling....)&lt;br /&gt;5) If you have hair and suddenly find yourself going out with no time to wax, this can save you. (Plus you get a  LOT less - to none, of those bumps and redness on your skin)&lt;br /&gt;6)It did prick my skin, tiny blips of blood. (Not often but there you go. Happened to sis as well.)&lt;br /&gt;7)Hair does NOT grow back thicker. Feels thinner if anything. (Don&#x27;t have ingrowns but always use pumice, so....)&lt;br /&gt;8)Freaky sound like it&#x27;s going to eat your skin off.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I do not bleed ever anymore. Maybe newbie mistakes. Hurts a lot less if you don&#x27;t let your hair grow long, plus you can clip it first with the included shaver blade. The strays are not too bad now, usually all the hair goes. Still happy with it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using an epilator, and I was pretty nervous. But I LOVE this product. It&#x27;s easy to clean, works fabulously and really isn&#x27;t that painful (definitely not more than waxing). And for the amount of time it saves over the course of the week, it&#x27;s so worth it, and the results are SO much better than shaving. If you&#x27;re considering at all, just go ahead and buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> 5 star review from me...I&#x27;m only sad that I waited this long to get it!    I have dark, relatively coarse hair and generally shave every day. I couldn&#x27;t stand seeing/feeling stubble everywhere and feeling like I could never keep up with it. I found waxing to be a bit embarassing and never removed all the hairs, leaving me completely smooth. I was beginning to give up and just admit I would be hairy forever. In comes the Xelle.    After reading others&#x27; reviews here on Amazon, I purchased it for myself. I tore into the box and plugged it in immediately, eager to see what it could do. I was NOT disappointed!! I find that this epilator is pretty quick, and removes 98% of the hair (some are too short to be pulled up by the tweezers). I probably couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.    A fair warning is that this IS painful. I think I have a high pain tolerance, and doing this on my bikini line had me gasping for breath...not in a good way. It is extremely painful in sensitive areas, but I&#x27;ve found that by doing just a tiny bit at a time, you can get through it. I have not been able to do my underarms yet, but I am going to try numbing them a bit with ice first. Either way, this is the best $ I&#x27;ve spent in a long time!!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a guy who&#x27;s a little hairer down below and wanted a solution that wouldn&#x27;t keep me attending to my backside every few days. Nair stinks and is toxic, shaving blows because of ingrown hairs and quick regrowth, and waxing is just too expensive. This was the perfect solution. I have mainly used it for my behind thus far, but plan on trying it on other places soon. It certainly DID hurt when I did it, but I&#x27;m a fairly hairy guy, so that&#x27;s a lot of simultaneous plucking going on. I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t be as painful next time. The result is amazing. Smooth smooth skin that feels great against everything. I do have a couple red bumps, but they seem to be getting better. As far as ingrown hair goes... I&#x27;m not sure yet. We&#x27;ll see in a few days I guess!     Anyway, great product. Especially for the price. Thing hurts like a mofo, especially in places where the hair is more dense, but it&#x27;s worth it for the result you get. Recommended for any guy who was blessed/(cursed?) with lots of hair follicles :).</li>
    <li> Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle epilator works well.  It is less painful to use than an older model I had (can&#x27;t remember what the model was). The built-in light comes in handy - it is easier to see if you missed a spot. The epilator is easy to clean, which is a plus.  I am pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I just tried this epilator and it does a fantastic job.  I have been using a tweeze but it only gets one hair at a time.  Not to mention it uses batteries a big negative.  This epilator does speed \\&quot;tweeze\\&quot; the hair out and it will hurt but after continued use it will not be noticeable.  It beats shaving by far.  I did try it on my upper lip and yes it hurt but it will get easier after a while of use as well.  So I highly recommend this product and of course you can&#x27;t go wrong with a Braun product haha that rhymed.</li>
    <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work so well. I&#x27;ve tried many products that make claims and don&#x27;t live up to them, so it was a pleasant surprise to find an item that does exactly what it says on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my legs silky smooth or anything, but that&#x27;s not what I wanted. I absolutely loathe the feeling of after-shave stubble (which, for me, appears within an hour of shaving), so I wanted something that lessen the feeling of stubble and keep it from growing back so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product every couple of days for 2 weeks on my calves, the hair started growing in much finer, and now I only have to do it maybe once per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I REALLY REALLY have to exfoliate the skin on my calves EVERY DAY, otherwise the hairs start growing under the top layer skin. Not that it&#x27;s hard to pick them out or anything, but it&#x27;s made me wary of using the epilator in spots I can&#x27;t easily see ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When using on delicate skin, you really have to pull it tight before epilating! A couple of nights ago, I thought I might try it on my inner thighs and I forgot to pull the skin tight first. The machine got caught up pulling at the skin on the edge of one of my stretch marks and made it bleed. That was not so good.</li>
    <li> I would surely recommend this product. This epilator is just great. I tried epilator at hands, legs .. it takes off every little hair.. offcourse with some pain but bearable.  I even tried for underarms.. it was great. Plus u get a Razor with is also good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item about 4 months ago.  This was by far a very wise investment.  So, I am a latina female of 32 years of age who has thick black hair all over.  I was waxing all over before this purchase. Pain: minimal, as I was waxing before so this helped with the pain level.  Use: I use on upper and lower legs and armpits.  I found that the arms hurt more than I was comfortable with.  Complaints: Some women complain of the \\&quot;stubily\\&quot; feel and not getting a smooth feel like you get after shaving.  The secret to getting the smooth feel, which I have now, is not going fast when epillating.  I notice I was rushing through my legs and was snapping the hairs instead of pulling them out.  I now go slow and make sure the hair is plucked.  I have extremely smooth legs, no stubble, my husband LOVES, and I only use this machine once a month.  As I see hairs pop out here and there I just remove with the epillator.  My hair barely grows back now.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with ingrown hairs as I vigorously exfoliate before and after use of epilator.  I don&#x27;t use this for the bikini areas as I wax once a month anyway.  I haven&#x27;t used a shaver in almost a year (I was waxing everything previous to this). The armpits I epilate once a month and I used to have a hell of a bush when I would shave and a shadow....gross.  Now I have smooth baby soft pits (I was waxing them before but this is easy and faster).  ENJOY!!!!</li>
    <li> It tweezed about half the hair and cut the other half so I would still have to shave on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I decided I was really tired of shaving every other day, and the regrowth of shaving is always sharp and spikey! And I didnt want to spend tons of money waxing everything at a wax salon every single month. But I still wanted to be as smooth and hairless as possible, so I did a little research and deceided to buy the Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator.  I have used this item for a little over a month now. It is the first epilator I have ever used or owned. Here are my thoughts,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;This epilator was not nearly as loud as some reviews lead me to expect. I like the helpful light on it and the choice of speeds and the soothing roller buffer head or the close, I-Know-What-Im-Doing head. It comes with a shaver head as well. I like the clear instructions and little cleaning brush and storage pouch it comes with.  At first I was really afraid it would suck in my skin and pinch me, but as long as I pulled my skin taunt, I had no such problems.  It worked VERY WELL for my arms and underarms.  Although the underarms was EXTREMELY painful the first time, I was prepared for the pain as I have had this area waxed in the past. I have been shaving there the last 2 or 3 years consistantly, so had some strong, thick hair there. After the first traumatic time of epilating the underarms, I have almost no pain and very sparce hair regrowth which I epilate simply every few days now. No problem and I enjoy having smooth, clean underarms everday. looks even better then when I shaved because there is no \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; to deal with!  I have no ingrowns under my arms, but I think maybe its because I am diligent about exfoliating with a rough washcloth every time I shower.  SO that first super painful time was so worth it for me.  You could get it waxed the first time and just maintain with the epilator if you wanted to forgo that first time torture.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my legs and face and even attempted to do the bikini area with it.  I was way to scared to do the bikini area.  Having this whirlwind of spinning ninja tweezer action so close to such a sensitive area was just too scary for me. The face peach fuzz was surprisingly painful to epilate!  But it did remove most of the blonde fuzz on my checks and upper lip. The legs did not work so well for some reason, even with multiple passes it just didnt pull out all the leg hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;My face broke out HORRIBLY 2 days after I epilated!  I will never do that again!  I will either live with the peach fuzz or use the electric razor to trim it down, but not remove the hairs entirely. The break out was REALLY, REALLY bad and just not worth it! I still have some scars from the blemishes which are slowly fading.  The pro waxer I saw said it was possibly because our skin oil uses the hairshaft as a vehicle to get out onto the skins surface, so maybe with out face hairs the oil couldnt get out and made me have an awesomely ugy breakout? I dont know, but Im kinda bummed because I usually do break out with any face wax as well, and was hoping the epilator would solve this problem, but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;My legs also became comletely COVERED in ugly bumps and ingrown hairs about 2-3 days after I epilated them.  I have since exfoliated the bumps and ingowns away and resumed shaving the legs, which isn&#x27;t too bad since I have only peach fuzz on my thighs and really only need to shave from the knees down.&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This powerful and inexpensive product seems well made and was worth it for me even if I can only really use it on my arms and underarms. I like the razor function for trimming down the blonde hairs on my arms and bikini. But the epliator function is way too painful and epilating makes me break out terribly.scared to do the bikini area.  Having this whirlwind of spinning ninja tweezer action so close to such a sensitive area was just too scary for me. The face peach fuzz was surprisingly painful to epilate!  But it did remove most of the blonde fuzz on my checks and upper lip. The legs did not work so well for some reason, even with multiple passes it just didnt pull out all the leg hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;My face broke out HORRIBLY 2 days after I epilated!  I will never do that again!  I will either live with the peach fuzz or use the electric razor to trim it down, but not remove the hairs entirely. The break out was REALLY, REALLY bad and just not worth it! I still have some scars from the blemishes which are slowly fading.  The pro waxer I saw said it was possibly because our skin oil uses the hairshaft as a vehicle to get out onto the skins surface, so maybe with out face hairs the oil couldnt get out and made me have an awesomely ugy breakout? I dont know, but Im kinda bummed because I usually do break out with any face wax as well, and was hoping the epilator would solve this problem, but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;My legs also became comletely COVERED in ugly bumps and ingrown hairs about 2-3 days after I epilated them.  I have since exfoliated the bumps and ingowns away and resumed shaving the legs, which isn&#x27;t too bad since I have only peach fuzz on my thighs and really only need to shave from the knees down.&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This powerful and inexpensive product seems well made and was worth it for me even if I can only really use it on my arms and underarms. I like the razor function for trimming down the blonde hairs on my arms and bikini. But the epliator function is way too painful and epilating makes me break out terribly.ould be, kinda looking forward to my next appt.  Being smooth and hairless is so nice :)</li>
    <li> I didn´t receive this item! I really want it, but I don´t know more what to do! How can I get it? Is it in the post yet? That´s terrible!</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator 6 weeks ago and I just decided to write a review because I have to try this product first. My first and second used was really painful and a bit kind of scary :-) because I thought the epilator will pull my skin out too :)) but the 3rd time, I get comfortable using this product, lesser pain too. It is very good and must buy this one.</li>
    <li> I am a female of ethnic descent and, consequently, have very coarse body hair. I&#x27;ve tried waxing but was not pleased with the results - or the expense. I looked into laser removal but that is expensive as well and I was concerned about its overall effectiveness. I finally got tired of shaving twice a day just to keep up and started scouring the internet for ideas. That is how I came upon this epilator!    I tried it for the first a few days after receiving it and heeded some advice but not others. For starters, I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a couple of weeks and decided not to \\&quot;prep-shave\\&quot; before epilating. What I did do though is take an aleve, take a hot shower, and exfoliate the areas to be epilated (to help prevent in-grown hairs). I then situated myself on a heated blanket to keep my legs warm and pores open and started the process.    Yes it hurts but, for me, it wasn&#x27;t anything close to intolerable. It felt like little pinches - just like tweezing your eyebrows. If an area I was working on happened to get a little tender I would pull the epilator away for a moment and then go right back. I worked in small strokes on the lowest setting, staying in one area until all of the hair had been removed, and I had no problems! It took me a fair amount of time to complete both legs but there was a considerable amount of growth; I think it is fair to say that it will take less time if kept up with regularly. The next area I tried were my underarms - also not pre-shaved. This stung more than the legs and required more frequent breaks but was also not intolerable. After epilating I re-exfoliated all treated areas just to be safe. (I exfoliate using a sugar scrap and real loofah.)    It&#x27;s been a few days since my first epilation and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! My legs have been smooth all of this time and it should be a breeze the next time I epilate due to the minimal regrowth. The best part is that I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; effect on my underarms anymore. My skin color is lighter thereso you could actually see my black hair growing underneath the skin - unsightly with nothing I could do about it, until now. :)    Can&#x27;t remember the last time I looked forward to wearing shorts - hurry up summer!    This product is highly recommended by me but please be sure to take precautions to prevent in-grown hairs.</li>
    <li> My wife if really hairy, and they&#x27;re not the delicate little hairs most women have.  It&#x27;s more like heavy underbrush in the woods, except on her legs.  Well, she&#x27;d been wanting something like this for a while, so I got it for her.  I works great!!! She loves it!  The hair doesn&#x27;t come back for way longer than just shaving.  The only issue we have now is sweeping up the huge pile of fallen hair stubs in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun customer for it&#x27;s epilator for ever (more than 10 years). sometimes the new one was worse than the old one. I had different models which I don&#x27;t know the codes but I had the pink, blue-green, purple, light blue and this one which is a shade darker than my older braun. It is a great product. It is amazing in the first 4-5 times you use it then it&#x27;ll be good but not that fast. I had it for more than 6 months, and still love it. I tried some other brand in between such as Emjoi and Remington which are not competitors.    Regarding Amazone service I have to say it was flawless. Fast and easy. I love shopping from amazone.com</li>
    <li> The product is really worth it, it&#x27;s very efficient, you don&#x27;t really have to spend a lot of time to epilate, for example, yours legs, but it takes at least 2 weeks for the hair to grow back. Besides it&#x27;s not painful at all. I am really greatfull with this product and would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> First of all I am a guy, and this product worked great for me.  I use it for my chest and abdomen area down to my underwear line.  It is totally awesome.  I say that because I was using an electrical rechargeable \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot;.  That was great but I had to use it daily.  With this Silk Epell by Braun it is WAAAY better.  Now the first time, guys, you use this you will question your own sanity.  Yes it hurts.  I don&#x27;t think it hurt as bad as the only chest waxing I once had, but it hurt.  Then several hours later it looked like I was hit by rock salt from a shot gun.  However some lotion and about an overnight sleep off and I was clear.  I have had it two weeks now, the follow up uses are just like what previous reviewers reported, much easier.  The hair comes back much finer and less painful to remove.  The only fault, to damn noisy.  I am dark haired and was tired of that 70s look.  It&#x27;s the 21st Century, I&#x27;m glad this product is available and OK to use.  Hopefully Braun comes up with a more masculine color for this product, I know I&#x27;m not the only dude out there. I am only telling my Fiance though, she enjoys it.  Maybe your girl will too, go for it guys!!</li>
    <li> My best purchase in 2011! Wax never more!  Yes, it is a little pain when you start to use it. But you know what? It makes your hair reduce soooooo fast! I did my legs one time/month. Now, I did just in three months. And I had to many hair.  I use it on my legs and armpits. I don&#x27;t have courage to use it on bikini area. And I&#x27;m brazilian, lol! And Brunette.  Buy it! You will not regret!</li>
    <li> Okay.... wow. I have no idea how I spent literally hundreds of dollars on waxing just to go through making an appointment, sitting uncomfortably in a little bed and waiting as a stranger removed strips of WAX off my body when I could have just owned this little gem. I like it so much, I&#x27;m upset for not buying it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it comes with a lot of nifty attachment thingies, I&#x27;ve found the most basic one (without the massager) works the best. LITTLE TO NO PAIN. I don&#x27;t have a low pain threshold but I&#x27;m not tattooed all over either. Also, my mom has an epilator (the old Epilady) and that thing hurts like crazy, so yes, there is a big difference between the Braun one and other ones. I think the delicate, tiny tweezers on the Braun epilator make the process quicker and almost painless. The more you use it, the less pain you feel (keep in mind that, like waxing, the first few minutes are awful but after that the skin sort of goes numb and it&#x27;s not bad at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is... IT REMOVES THE HAIR! In less than half an hour I did both my lower legs and I&#x27;ve never felt softer. I think it even exfoliates a little because the skin texture improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is great. And the one I got is double voltage, so I can be soft and hairless in Europe, too ;)</li>
    <li> I have been a regular waxer for years and I used to epilate, but found that most did not work well or would pinch my skin.  This epilator is the cream of the crop!  It met all of my expectations and more! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Packaging is nice, but whatever, let&#x27;s get to the good stuff.  It is well-designed, comfortable bean shape that fits nicely in the palm of your hand.  It allows for good grip and control, especially with the components on the inside rumbling around. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used this on my forearms, upper thighs, lower legs and even....underarms.  The epilator worked well for all areas and the massaging rollers really do help ease/numb any discomfort you may have.  I braced myself for the pain, and was surprised to find little to none at all (keep in mind I&#x27;m a regular waxer).  The sound of the epilator is a little overwhelming, as it is quite loud.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The optional shaver head is great on it&#x27;s own and even better with the trim attachment---does the job quickly and easily.  I like the fact that if I don&#x27;t have the option of epilating (hair is too short), the shaver works just great.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The smartlight, I have to say, I LOVE IT.  It has got to be the best feature on this epilator.  Without it, I would have just gone over the regular areas that I always wax.  However, this light picked up every single hair in every nook and cranny on my body.  I mean, I discovered hair in places I never knew I had hair----inside the bend of my elbow, on my hands, the crook behind my knee.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is with the short cord.  The cord could be longer, as I had to plug it into an extension cord for it reach properly, and it would be nice to have a swivel on the cord.  Other than that, I love this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Is a great machine, it has the light that shows you where the hair is and my legs are smooth. It is painful at first, but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product after reading all the rave reviews.  My leg hair is so coarse &amp; thick that shaving always hurts and I have to do it every day.  The pain was terrible the first time - like everyone says - but I was determined to do it.  It does get less painful every time.  However, I was doing it every day or every other day just to keep up.  The ingrown hairs were horrible - I still have scars from them!  I did exfoliate all the time but it didn&#x27;t seem to help.  I finally had to stop after 2 months of pain &amp; suffering.  Never again!!</li>
    <li> When you first start to use, it hurts pretty darn bad.  Since it is ripping out your hair over large areas of your body, that should be expected.  But once you keep using it, it does not hurt so badly. I have sensitive skin, so when I used it on my legs I was not able to wear shorts the same day. It is awesome to use on underarms.  Doesn&#x27;t take long, and the results last for so much longer than shaving.  Also, small areas are easier for me on the upkeep.  Since hairs grow at different paces, it is a little hard for me to use on my legs and have them look smooth, especially when you are around light.  I don&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> This does work very well.  It rips out the hairs at the roots without pinching skin.  However, this hurts a lot.  I wondered why more women don&#x27;t use epilators, and the reason is because it feels like needles poking through your skin.  It hurts less after a minute or so, and hurts much less your second, third, etc. times.  But it does hurt a lot--more than waxing because it&#x27;s slower, but it&#x27;s not messy like waxing and you can do it at home any time, and it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing.  (I wouldn&#x27;t plan on using it on bikini areas or armpits unless you have nerves of steel.)    As for this particular epilator, it is sturdy, made in Germany, comes with different attachment heads, and comes with a shaver head and a trimmer attachment.  And everything fits conveniently in a little storage case.  The light it has on it really does help you to spot every rogue hair.  I can&#x27;t think of anything it could/should have to make it a better package.</li>
    <li> With practice, this product does well for legs. However, it is really too large for other areas of the body, and much too harsh for fine facial hair. It should come with an attachment and a lower speed for more delicate areas, imo.&lt;br /&gt;  The good news is that it was not the least bit painful for the legs, and I would recommend it heartily for that area alone.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to try this product. I had tried waxing and shaving my legs, but this was totally new. It hurt a bit, but it was  worth it. It&#x27;s not a completely painless process no matter what you choose, but this makes it a lot less pain for a lot of gain. My legs are smooth for weeks.    Also, the after the first time I noticed it was a lot more pleasant. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I would recommed it instead of shaving. It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to shave every day and I end up with dry legs and stubble. This totally eliminated the hassle of worrying about leg hair.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. I used to have an older version that lasted a good 15 years, and hope this one will do the same. It is improved thanks to the added light which is very practical when you don&#x27;t see as you used to.</li>
    <li> I have had this epilator for about 6 months now. It is effective but it is painful depending on where you use it. I use it on my legs and underarms. It is pretty effective, although sometimes it does take a few strokes to get all the hairs. I found that the massage head really does not help the pain and is not worth using in my opinion. The light is very helpful in seeing the ingrown hairs which is one drawback to this. Since I have been using this, I have noticed a lot of hairs that have grown under the skin&#x27;s surface. While it is bothersome, I have tried using the epilator after I have exfoliated to loosen these hairs, but it doesn&#x27;t really work. But overall it is just annoysome and I manage to get these out. The pain on the underarms is very very intense. It does dissipate after using it for a minute, but it is pretty painful. I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try the bikini area. The only real complaint that I have is that some hairs do not get pulled out by the root and it seems to be losing some of its power the longer I have it. (BTW I only use it about 1-2 times a month). We will see how it holds up. But it is worth it for me to not have to shave everyday.</li>
    <li> It felt a little prickly the first few times I used it.  It did reduce the overall amount of hair and became easier to use over time. However, I started noticing I got ingrown hairs. I tried exfoliating, but i continued to get them. If you are typically prone to them, you might reconsider. I can also say that I never was able to use it under my arms with much success.</li>
    <li> This is a good epilator. I owned one of different brand but this seems to be much better. It has different speeds and different heads and this helps to minimize unpleasant feelings as well as to extend period of time when you shouldn&#x27;t be worried about hairs. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> it saves me a lot of time and really easy to use.  highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> What can I say other that this product has changed my life. It has eliminated the daily routine of shaving. Let alone all the other things I have tried for hair removal. At first is HURTS..... ALOT... Be prepared. But at time passes so does the pain. If you can bear through the pain it will pay off in the end. I have tried waxing and my skin would be irritated and have red bumps. Not what I want after paying so much for the waxing. Then I have tried the creme hair removers and it removed the hair alright and the first layer of skin. So this product is really AMAZING. I only have to use it once a week and thats is only about 10 min. of time invested. My adivce for first timers is use powder before you start the treatment. Then for sensitive areas I apply ice for a few mins. after completing treatment. And REMEMBER take a break... If the pain gets to bad take a break. I do my epilating while watching TV and time passes faster when you are distracted from the pain. I mean face it we are Pulling Hair From the Root. It is going to hurt. But as time passes the hair get thinner and grows in slower. Overall A GREAT PRODUCT. I have tried others and this IS THE TOPS. I highly reccomend this product. Become friends with it. You to will Love It.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a guy so I wanted to give my opinion.  I play tennis and arm hair seems to make me sweat more, so I wanted something to take it off.  After reading the reviews here, I broke down and bought this thing when it went on sale.  I was expecting it to be a walk in the park, and I have to say after using it, I have a new found appreciation for the pain tolerance women obviously have.  I am a big guy and this thing had me writhing on the first try....yikes!  I cant imagine what the more painful models rated on here must feel like...cause this one felt like someone sticking me with needles...I was actually sweating from the pain!  I also had some definite redness and irritation on my arms the following day although to be fair to Braun, they tell you in the manual to do it at night so your skin can recover before going out the next day.  I will say that it works pretty well...not as easy as they say it does, but after several runs across my skin it does get all the hair out...but certainly not in one pass.  My subsequent visits with this needle machine have gotten less painful (as they suggested it would).  I would give this thing a 3.5 if it were available, but I rounded up to a 4.  It hurts the first couple of times, but the pain gets less with more uses and it does what it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> The purpose of this product is to make you as smooth as possible.  It does that, 100%.  If you are concerned about the pain, don&#x27;t buy an epilator because I don&#x27;t see how any epilator on the market would not hurt.  Definitely don&#x27;t buy it if you have never been waxed, because using an epilator is basically like the slowest ever waxing you&#x27;ve ever had.  It is pretty brutal, but it is much more cost effective than spending $100 or more a month, and for the money I have to say that this product is amazing.  So if you can handle the pain, this epilator is the bomb.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I just loved it........... no pain as compared to the messy waxing thing. Best purchase i ever made....</li>
    <li> This product is plesaant to look at and comes in an attractive silver mesh carrying case. The weight is perfect and it fits comfortably in the hand. It has two speed settings and a few attachment pieces. All the different attachments seem intimidating at first, but it&#x27;s easy to get their usages down after the first session. This epilator does make a bit of noise when you switch it on, which in itself can be intimidating and scary. Once on, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use, though the instructions are very long-winded: just hold against skin at a 90 degree angle and move slowly along. The second you place the device on your hairy skin, you are shocked by the pain. It may be quite painful, even if you&#x27;ve waxed before as I have. Despite the excruciating pain, it does work very well. One swipe of the epilator is usually enough for legs. I used several swipes in different directions to remove my underarm hair. The epilator pulls out the stubborn hairs that waxing would miss. It also doesn&#x27;t remove a top-layer of skin, as waxing does, which is a plus for those with sensitive skin who are prone to hyperpigmentation. Like waxing, it doesn&#x27;t always pull hairs from the root; sometimes the hairs just break off instead. Epilating stubble seems to help with this problem and also with the pain. It&#x27;s been too painful to epilate my entire leg at one time, so I&#x27;ve been gradually epilating more and more of each leg one hairy patch at a time (I used to do the same thing when I waxed my legs). I am definitely going to stick with it--regardless of the pain. I highly recommend for women who are willing to endure a bit of pain for hairlessness and hair density reduction.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 5270 Epilator about six weeks ago and I&#x27;m just getting used to it.  I only use it on my legs and bikini line as my under arm area is too sensitive.   It hurt A LOT when I first started using it but it&#x27;s true that the hairs do grow finer with continued use.  I can now epilate without gritting my teeth;-) It takes longer than I thought though, as I find that it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs the first time and I have to go over the same area a few times until they are all pulled out.  I really like the bright light that it&#x27;s fitted with as I would certainly miss many hairs without it.      I do have some advice though for anyone, who like me, is new to the whole epilation experience.  I made the mistake of buying some waxing strips and using them a couple of times before I bought the Braun Epilator.  What I have noticed is that because I didn&#x27;t remove all the hairs on my legs with the wax strips I now have hairs growing at different rates.  This means that I am using the epilator about every two weeks, which is still much better than shaving every three days.  If you are going to buy this (or any) epilator then I suggest you wait until all your hairs are at the same length and remove them all at the same time.    Overall I think the Braun 5270 is a good device and Amazon has one of the best prices I have found.  I am also using Nisim Kalo Lotion in the hope that some day I&#x27;ll be totally hair free.  Until that day, I&#x27;m happy to epilate with my Braun.</li>
    <li> This epilator is great.  It works really well, resulting in very smoooth legs.  I really like the light, it is definiately a feature I would look for in future epilators.  Overall, just a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I read quite a few reviews before I bought this product. I&#x27;d never waxed or used an epilator before so I was nervous.  I followed one reviewer&#x27;s advice and shaved before my first use-which was a great idea. It let me ease into the whole idea of epilating over the course of a week.  When I first turned it on I&#x27;ll admit that I almost took the whole thing back due to the loud noise it made.  Like most others, I&#x27;d advise skipping the attachment for beginners-it is more frustrating than helpful. Using this product was no more painful than using a disposable razor 1-2 days past when it should have been thrown out-just a little scratchy feeling.  This is my third week using it and I am now starting to experience the ingrown hairs phenomenon which is annoying, but expected.  A little exfoliation is not much of a price to pay to skip shaving! I like the light on it as my bathroom lighting is not as good as I thought. I protest the company&#x27;s claim that one swipe gets 90% of hairs.  I&#x27;d put that percentage closer to 70. Overall, though, I am very happy with how well it works.</li>
    <li> If you want a great shaver/epilator...look no further.  I received it quickly and used it right away.  Never being a regular waxer or user of epilator, I was concerned about the discomfort I was about to experience.  I was thrilled when I tried it!  Didn&#x27;t pull, didn&#x27;t hurt...awesome product!  A week later, still no stubble!</li>
    <li> This Epilator did a great job on my legs and wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as I was expecting.  After using a couple of times it isn&#x27;t even uncomfortable.  However... beware if you use in sensitive areas. I would suggest using the shaver attachment rather than the epilator in sensitive areas.  Made the mistake of doing this and turned very red and irratated for a couple of days. Would have appreciated some instruction as to which attachments to use in specific areas.   All in all, I really love this!</li>
    <li> HURTS!!  I thought I had a high pain tolerance, but the pain of using this on my legs is unbearable.  For what it is, it&#x27;s an excellent epilator, but be aware that it&#x27;s much more painful than tweezing eyebrows or waxing. It&#x27;s like ripping a huge bandage off very, very slowly, and leaves the legs not very smooth due to fine hairs breaking off just above the surface of the skin.      It may work better on thicker hair that doesn&#x27;t break off as easily.  It works well enough under the arms, where the hair is thicker and the surface area is small enough to be done with before I lose the ability to inflict any more pain on myself.  So I&#x27;m still happy with the purchase, because I don&#x27;t need to worry about shaving my armpits anymore.  Give it a try!  This is an excellent model.</li>
    <li> Yes I am a MAN who for the past several years, off and on, have been shaving my entire body below the neck.  I would only keep my legs shaved every week, and 3 or 4 times a year I would get it all, unless I was on vacation somewhere, then it was 3 or 4 times a week.    I have never tried waxing, so this YANKING the hair out by the root was a new experience for me.  And can be a painful one, the first few times.     Well when my Braun 5270 Silk-épil arrived last month, I noticed several attachment heads.  One was the shaving head that was suppose to cut the hairs to the \\&quot;Ideal Length\\&quot; for epilation.  That does work on some areas, but for most areas there is no \\&quot;Ideal Length\\&quot;.    I had read in another review, the user suggested shaving the area you plan to epilate, and latter that day or the next day, start epilating.  Some areas work just fine using the shaver head to get started; the legs, arms for me the pubic area was one of the less painful areas to start with.  But keep in mind trying to epilate anywhere the hairs are full length, it will HURT, and hurt BAD.      There were a few areas that even using the shaver head, or the old fashion razor blade caused me to break out in a cold sweat the first time I took the epilator to them.  The area between the pubic hair and the navel was not that bad, but I did know the epilator was there.  When I did the area between the navel and the nipple line, it did curl my toes a few times.  But one of the worse areas was above the nipples to the neck line.  I had to do that area in SMALL sections, with plenty of breaks over several days.    But the area that I&#x27;m still trying to get completely done is my under arms.  Those two small areas are being more painful than the entire rest of my body.  I will do as much as I can stand, and then take the razor to the rest.  I&#x27;ll start again the next day and get as much as I can as the hairs are starting to grow out again.  One day I will have it all done.    Keep in mind that the first time is always the worse, no matter what part of your body you are trying to do.  But it will soon seem like there are on hairs to pluck.    When you shave the area with a razor and then start using the epilator a few days latter, you will not pluck all the hairs at the same time.  It seems to me that the hairs grow back at a different rate, so on the first time you may be getting only 10 to 20 percent.  The next day another 10 to 20% and so forth.      You will also have a certain percentage of breakage, the hair does not pull out, but it breaks off level with the skin.  Those can hurt worst than the ones that do pull out, and they will look much thicker than the ones that did pull out as they continue to grow.      Like I said I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month now, and I still go over at some part everyday.      At this point I&#x27;m about 99% smooth, there are still a few strays that I find every few days, but for the most part I have not been this smooth I was born.  Also less and less hairs seem to be growing back.    Yes if I had it to do over again, I would buy either this model, Braun 5270, or the next one up.                              ***UPDATE***    Two nights ago I convinced my wife to let me start using it on her legs.  She is very pain sensitive, so I used the shaver attachment on both of her legs first.  I then started using the Epilator attachment and started pulling the hairs that the attachment could grab.  She didn&#x27;t mind it at all, but keep in mind I did a pretty through job with the shaver head.  Tonight I could feel a little more stubble from the shaving, so I went over both of her legs again.  She felt far less pain tonight than she did last night.  Apparently I missed quite a few hairs around her ankles.    We are going to keep up this nightly ritual until we can tell all the hairs have been plucked.  Once she gets use to it being used on her legs, I&#x27;ll try to convince her to let me do her arms, underarms, bikini line and anywhere else she has been shaving at.    I hope to have her as smooth as I am by next summer.    For myself, I spend an hour or two once a week to stay smooth all over.  At first she hated the smooth look on me, but now she likes it.</li>
    <li> Totally worth it! It hurts a bit at first, but you get used to it. It&#x27;s totally worth it. You&#x27;re hairs grows back really slow and soft.</li>
    <li> This machine really works!    I have been running to spa&#x27;s for years to wax my legs regularly. A friend just recently recommended me to try Silk-epil and I thought - why not!?    The price of this epilator is actually cheaper than what I pay for one leg/bikini wax!!! So I tried and it really works!!!    It takes some time to figure out how to reach some parts of the legs but after that everything works just great. I belive this is even less painful than being waxed. And the Epilator pulls up the hair with the root not just pulls it off .    The little light is really great and works so well.</li>
    <li> Longtime user of 15 years - this epilator is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve read some reviews and some complain about pain and to those people I suggest using it right out of the shower when your skin is more pliable.  I love the variable speeds. Being a skilled user I hated it when some models started putting &#x27;protection&#x27; in for the unskilled user. Those models did not work on me I have some pretty stuborn hair!</li>
    <li> I have always shaved, never waxed. I have tried Nair and Veet and neither worked for me.  This sounded like a good idea because you don&#x27;t have to grow you leg hair to mammoth length like with waxing.    I got this about 3 months before I was getting married, so I could have a shave-free honeymoon.  I knew it would hurt at first when I used it, but I had no idea how much!  Ouch, good thing after about the second time using it there was much less pain.  It didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped though.  It took me about 45 mintues to do both legs from knee to ankles.  (very hard to use on knees.) I had to take breaks about every twenty minutes because the machine gets very warm and makes using it uncomfortable.  I have blonde hair, so it&#x27;s a mix of course and fine hair on my legs.  Unfortunately, it only pulled out the course hairs.  The finer hairs were broken off and grew back in a few days.  NO WAY could this be used on my bikini zone, but the trimmer works great for that, trimming it down really close, which is good enough for me.  I also used a sugar scrub to exfoliate and get rid of all the ingrown hairs it produced.  I have to say, it was too much effort for very little pay-off.  I had to use the machine every week, and the finer hairs still grew back in between usages.  I went back to shaving, much less time and completely pain free.  I think I will still use the trimmer in the summer for my bikini zone because it leaves no razor burn, but I won&#x27;t use the epilator part again.  I gave a 3 star review because I think it would work better for people with darker, courser hair, and the pain lessens with each use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll add to the chorus of praise for this product.   It&#x27;s just fantastic, a great solution to an age old problem.  To be fair, it did hurt -- and more than a little -- the first time I used it.  However, now I can just pick up a few strays every few days and it hurts pretty much not at all.  And the hair does grow back finer, yahoo!  This is probably my product of the year.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> i wasn&#x27;t impressed. it broke off hairs more than plucking them out. so i was left with stubble and a painful experience. i&#x27;m disappointed that i payed $70 dollars for this when it didn&#x27;t work the first time.</li>
    <li> This is a cool hair removal system. My skin is sensitive when pulling out the hairs but it works and I didn&#x27;t get a lot of red marks and when I do they just vanish in a couple of hours. I love the shaver head that comes with it, I like it more than the epilation head because the shaver head cuts really close without no nicks, it also has a trimer that is right in front of the shaver that works really fast and it glides smooth on your skin. The light helps in dim places so you can light up your skin to see if you got all of the hairs epilated or shaven, it&#x27;s like an extra.  If you like getting rid of unwanted hairs fast without the hassle and the mess, this is the way to go. I tried creams that make your hair fall out with melting the hair off of your skin that is really harsh on your body and leaves red bumps all of the time and it&#x27;s a mess to do, also waxing doesn&#x27;t get you very far when you have to wait for your hair to grow long enough for it to strip off and the wax is messy and sticky. I am telling you that the Silk-epil Xelle epilator is NOT a wast of money at all.</li>
    <li> The Braun 5270 Epilator is a hands-down, fantastic product.  Nothing like the eiplators from the 80&#x27;s (remember those, they could make a grown woman cry).  This epilator actually WORKS.    It&#x27;s a nice size, fits well in the palm and is easy to control, even in the most awkward of places.  Easy to clean and store.  Long cord makes it pretty easy to use just about anywhere and the little blue \\&quot;headlight\\&quot; is terrific for spotting hairs.    Legs:  Legs are sooo smooth.  It even gets the little fair fine hairs on the knees and thighs.  Shaving could never leave your legs this smooth and soft, and waxing requires you to grow hair back before you can be smooth again.  Smoothness lasted for five days after the first use, and after two months of use now lasts up to two weeks.  Took very little time and pain was a 2 out of 10 (1 being a splinter and 10 being amutation without anesthesia!).  Kind of like rubbing your skin with sandpaper.  Very little redness or irritation, and what was there was gone in an hour.  Seriously, never had legs so smooth, even with waxing.    Bikini area:  Unbelieveable!  No more painful than waxing (3 out of 10 the first time, minimal after that) and you can customize your grooming.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for maintaining anything as radical as a Brazilian, but you can certainly groom anywhere from a basic trim to nearly bare.  Redness and irritation for a few hours, use a good antisceptic finish and a bump preventer if you&#x27;re prone.  And the result is again, so completely smooth!    Underarm:  Never shave again!  Again, no more painful than waxing, and like waxing, the more frequently you do it, the less there is to do.  Pain the first time is probably a 4 out of 10.  No stubble, minimal redness and irritation.      I&#x27;ve waxed the above areas for many years, and this product does a better job.  You can touch up whenever you please, and there is no waiting for complete regrowth before grooming.  Regrowth lessens within just weeks with consistent use.  Super convenient and paid for itself in one use (versus the cost of waxing).      Wish I had stumbled on this even sooner!</li>
    <li> Let me just say - I am officially converted. I used to spend tons of money getting waxed, and tweezed, and whatnot. Doing it at home is messy and can be dangerous, and having it done gets expensive. Because of my heritage, (thanks mom!) I am blessed with thick dark hair, and shaving is not a good option for me... I did some research into this product, and after seeing all of the great reviews for this particular one, I decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I did! The thing paid for itself with one use, in one day. I got it yesterday, and went straight home and took all of my body hair clean off. Literally. And they don&#x27;t call it \\&quot;silk\\&quot; for nothing!! My skin feels so so smooth, and I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Although the only thing I would warn someone new to this like I am - it is a little painful. I found it much less painful to epilate in short, firm, quick bursts, than to drag it over a large area of skin. The little rollers next to the tweezers really do help out, and after I got the hang of it, it wasn&#x27;t so bad. Not painless, but 100% worth it. I will never shave again!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I know I am not the first to say this but expect pain--real pain. I have a very high tolerance for pain but I still had to do my legs over several sessions. Since the first time the pain is less but I still don&#x27;t usually finish both legs in one sitting. I have a baby and it just takes too long to do a good job, plus after a few minutes I need a break from the noise, it is a loud little machine! I wish I could use it on just battery power or that it had a longer cord but other than that I highly recommend to those willing to take the pain. Side note, I have used it on my belly and husbands feet neither hurt like the calfs of my legs. Don&#x27;t expect your legs to feel they way they do after a great razer but reduces appearance of \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock\\&quot; shadow which I have on my legs and much less regrowth.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It hurt like crazy the first time.  I had to have someone else do it for me.  And, for about two weeks my legs looked awful (ingrown hairs, red bumps), but now I use it twice a week and no problems.  It has helped me a lot because shaving was hard for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Relatively pain-free as compared to waxing. There&#x27;s a ticklish sensation. Works pretty well and leaves you hair free.</li>
    <li> Okay, so we wax and it hurts, we shave and hair grows back twice as thick and as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonferdul. The little pain goes away as soon as you feel how smooth your skin is. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it now while the price is down. You will save tons if you are the type who uses wax.</li>
    <li> Another review here put it best: \\&quot;If you want results badly\\&quot; you will love this product.    I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week now, but I believe a lot of the people who have given up on using an epilator simply have never had to deal with the awful difficulties some of us do with shaving. Starting out with this is time and pain intensive, but for people who want long-lasting relief from the futility and demoralizing effects of shaving, this is an unbelievable invention.    I have very dark, coarse, fast-growing hair, paired with very sensitive skin. With shaving, I got ingrown hairs along with painful razor burn all over my thighs and bikini line when i shaved. On top of that, I&#x27;d have visible regrowth by the end of the day. Yet, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shave again for at least 48 hours because my skin was still so damaged. In the summer, I could only wear shorter skirts or shorts once a week, and even then I would usually have to put foundation on the areas that broke out. I say this in the past tense, because I am so thrilled to have found a method of hair removal that will free me from constant worry over having to cover my legs!    As I said, I&#x27;ve only recently begun epilating, so I can&#x27;t compare this model to others or talk about longterm results, but for me what&#x27;s already happened is amazing. I did it initially four days ago on my legs and bikini line, and it was painful and tedious, but also gratifying to see all that thick dark hair be done away with. I&#x27;ve done waxing before, so I understand how hair grows in cycles and that there will be some irritation that will resolve quickly, so I was not put off by the red bumps or the fact that there was stubble.     The second time I did it, two days later (my hair grows very fast, so the next cycle comes in quickly), it was still rather painful and, but much better and took much less time. I then waited another two days (today), and it was fast and totally bearable to touch up. I think I&#x27;ve gotten at least 75% of my growth by now (I see what I haven&#x27;t gotten yet because my hair is so dark, I can see it before it grows above the skin), and hopefully after another four days and two more attempts will have had a chance to nab them all. Because of my waxing experience, I have high hopes that when the hairs grow in again, they will be much less dark and coarse. Some ingrown hairs (I got those shaving and waxing anyway) and soft, invisible stubble seem like blessings, knowing that I won&#x27;t be constantly hairy and having to mangle my skin with that razor anymore if I ever want to show it!    Maybe people who don&#x27;t have thick hair growing quickly on them all the time aren&#x27;t thrilled by the idea of being able to look at your own legs everyday without having to cringe, because they already can, but to me, it is a wonderful, novel experience. I don&#x27;t have the money to wax, and I really like not having to wait for a full cycle to grow in before getting it taken care of!     This product is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product &amp; I absolutely love it. This is my very fist experience with an Epilator - so needless to say I really didn&#x27;t know that to expect (as far as pain was concerned).    Initially I was a bit taken aback by the discomfort from the rapid hair removal - but in the end it has proven to be totally worth it.    I&#x27;m glad I made the investment. If you can tolerate a moderate amount of pain - for a short period of time - then I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good and very fast. Very painless. Massaging staff really helps and i like its light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for underarms. The speed is too high for such sensitive and lots-of-hair area. Massaging doesn&#x27;t help in this case, it is not plane area like a leg. So it is painful and hard to do. This is the only point in which my last epilator was performing better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is much better then the one I had before.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s speed is the point. You don&#x27;t need to spend hours and hours to complete the process. If you work a lot and have troubles with free time - this should be best choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;An update to add - today (Jan 31, 2013) it has died, its been 4 years and 2 months of work. I consider it a decent amount of time for small electronics.</li>
    <li> Painful? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Better than waxing(for a regular \\&quot;waxer\\&quot;)? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Better than shaving? Yes, smoothness lasts much longer, hair grows back softer.&lt;br /&gt;More painful than shaving (cuts) and waxing(bruises)put together? Heck yes.&lt;br /&gt;Advice? Yes, have a small towel and a bowl of hot water beside you while epilating. Before epilating a patch of skin, dip the towel into the water and gently dab the area for at least 15 seconds, then wipe off and epilate. Relax and don&#x27;t anticipate pain.&lt;br /&gt;Great for a person who has two jobs and school and/or kids AND hairy Hands/Legs? NO. Takes ridiculous amounts of time. Quick for epilating (frequently epilated) underarms though.</li>
    <li> Dont get me wrong but it hurt like hell. I thought maybe I was doing it wrong at first but I wasnt and it just hurt so bad I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I had this on my Amazon Wish List and got it for Christmas.  I&#x27;ve had the unopened box on my desk since then and I&#x27;ve glanced at it several times a day.  I hesitated trying it out because I really wanted it to work and I was afraid that it would be too painful.  I had used an epilator years ago (MANY years ago) and it was a torture machine.  It hurt so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was browsing Amazon several weeks ago and I came across this one and I read the reviews and I was amazed that so many people liked it!  Yes, people did say there was some pain, but somehow they were able to withstand it and get the wonderful results of smooth skin and not having to shave for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted those results, too!  So, I decided to put it on my wish list and see if anyone got it for me.  When I opened my gift on Christmas morning, I was excited and scared at the same time.  Ok, I had to try it out now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to say that after trying this out this morning, I can use this!  And it works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the head with the massaging rollers first and at first, OUCH!  It really hurt.  But, somehow, the more I used it the more it felt ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I took out the user&#x27;s guide and read the instructions and found that there was another head (called the EfficiencyPro clip) that was for people that are used to epilators and worked much faster to remove the hair.  Ok, I decided to try that out and I was able to use that one, too!  And it WAS faster!  There was more sensation, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it pain.  It&#x27;s hard to describe.  For me, using the EfficiencyPro clip is similar to grabbing several eyebrow hairs when tweezing.  You can tweeze one hair out at a time and then massage the area and then go on to the next hair, but once you are used to the tweezing, you just go in and grab as many as you can to get the pain over faster!  It&#x27;s the same with the EfficiencyPro clip.  Things are done much faster and for me, there was less pain because of the speed of the hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my first leg using the head with the Advanced Massaging Rollers and the second leg using the EfficiencyPro clip and did my second leg in less than half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin super soft and smooth.  I love it!moval.      I did my first leg using the head with the Advanced Massaging Rollers and the second leg using the EfficiencyPro clip and did my second leg in less than half the time.    It left my skin super soft and smooth.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product was too painful for me to use as an epilator.  HOwever as just a regular razor it&#x27;s fine, but the real delight is the built in light.  Find haris you didn&#x27;t even know you had.</li>
    <li> It works good on places you don&#x27;t have much hair and after you overcome the pain it is ok. The bad thing is that I tried to used in my arms and it hurts more than wax. The second time I tried to use it I had small scars. I&#x27;ve read somewhere that using some ice before helps, so I&#x27;ll give it a try. The result is not long lasting like wax or laser. And the problem is that you need TIME to do it. Other than that...I&#x27;m ok with this product.</li>
    <li> As most people claim, it was indeed painful the first time.  But after a few times you get used to it and you don&#x27;t feel it as much.  I noticed that it was actually less paintful on its own rather than with the Massaging rollers.    Also, i did notice quite a bit more ingrown hair than with waxing.    However, it was easy and fairly quick.  And the best part, unlike waxing, is that i don&#x27;t have to wait for my hair to be long enough to do it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times now and for removing leg hair, it works nice.  I have to go over areas a couple times, though, so to get through the lower legs and knee I usually have to set aside a good 10 to 15 minutes to get it done.  The inner and upper legs can be a little painful.  I tried using it on my arm pits and bikini line and it hurt like a mofo.  I will stick to shaving those areas.    It would be nice if it would pick up every hair in one swipe, which is my only complaint on the product.  Still, it&#x27;s a good alternative to shaving and I can go a month or so before I need to epilate again.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a 28 year old male try to master Venusian arts. The basis for my craft is presenting the best you all the time; presenting inner game and outer game in harmony. My outer game still needs some work so I decided to purchase the Braun 5270 to take care of some of the more hirsute areas of my body.     This device straddles the fine line of the end justifying the means. I used it for the first time yesterday and the pain was undeniable. I was trying to control my breathing and hypnotise myself into a trans-like state...unfortunately my self hypnosis skills aren&#x27;t at that level yet. So I ended up clenching my teeth and continued to epilate myself in a cold sweat.     The result of all this pain is amazing results. They say it only hurts really bad the first time. I hope they are right.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this didn&#x27;t come with the smart start head, or the cooling glove- but once I tried it without I found I didn&#x27;t need them anyway.  It is the least painful and most effective epilator I&#x27;ve tried.  The massaging rollers really do make a difference, and it does get a majority of the hairs on the first pass.  It works so well, with such minor discomfort that using it on my bikini area (which using an epilator down there is brand new) was a piece of cake. The little light really came in handy here. Left me baby smooth everywhere, when other epilator (Emjoi Optima) left me feeling prickly. I highly recommend this epilator, especially if you&#x27;re new to this method of hair removal!</li>
    <li> For many years I had an old epilady, the kind with the coil. It finally broke down and I got the Braun 5270 Silk-epil and now wonder why I waited so long to replace my old epilady. The silk-epil works great! The first time I used it on my legs they felt a little stubby but subsequent use leaves my legs smooth and it really seems like it delays regrowth: I find I don&#x27;t have to use it very frequently and when I do, it takes no time to remove the regrown hairs. I also used it on my underarms: the first time was extremely painful but the hair that regrows is softer and removal is virtually painless. The light is very helpful too. I highly recommend this product. It sure beats daily shaving!</li>
    <li> I had been shaving for a good long time, and then in an effort to make life simpler and more hair free I got one of these Epilators.  I was a bit nervous since the idea seems painful but I tried it out the afternoon it arrived and it was not painful at all.  I know that sounds like it can&#x27;t be true, but on my legs it really is not painful.  I then tried it on my bikini area.  It was a bit painful there understandably, but not enough to stop me from using it again a few weeks later on both my legs and bikini.  It is great to not have to worry about shaving every other day and this is much faster since it does not involve a bath or shower.  The light is really handy, and the little brush is great for cleaning it out when you are done.  I know some people complain about ingrown hairs but I have been using the epilator for about four months and I have had a total of one ingrown hair.  I seriously don&#x27;t know why people shave.</li>
    <li> I first bought a less expensive brand, I thought by purchasing this top of the line model, it would solve my problems.  With both brands of epilators, I never did get a smooth leg result as some reviews mentioned.  My legs feel like porcupine legs, even after use.  I have been using for three months now and followed all recommendations.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have actually had better results with the bikini line area, with no ingrown hairs like I had when shaving.  Also, the light is a great plus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With shaving, at least I had one day with smooth legs....If I were single and dating, I would have to shave.  Since I am married, with kids, the porcupine feel is not as big of a deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as pain goes...It does not hurt on the legs and only hurts slightly on the underarms and bikini area.  I wish it were less noisy so I could watch television while using it.</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with my purchase. Everything in its description section is absolutely true. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it, before I had three different epilators. Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator is best among them.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator that I have purchased and used. I wanted to try it out and see if it would be better than shaving. It&#x27;s a little painful at first, but it&#x27;s not as bad as using the home waxing products.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reading the reviews for this particular epilator, convinced me that it was one of the better ones to try. True to all of those reviews I read, I agree that it works like it&#x27;s suppose to, just as it was described in its product description. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t mind the light. There are some really good suggestions in some of the other reviews, you could put a piece of tape on it if you don&#x27;t like it, or use it in a well lit room, I don&#x27;t think it would interfere with you seeing the hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase an epilator.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator for my legs. I have had to shave my legs daily for years. At first I used the massaging head until I got used to it. Now I use it on my legs, lower arms, bikini line, and underarms. I find it too big and noisy for facial hair. The Smartlight is fantastic - you&#x27;ll see hair you never thought you had. The pouch is great for travel. Best of all I don&#x27;t have to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many epilators in the past. This one removes all hair, even the tiniest ones. The light is a great addition. I am a seasoned user so I can use it without the covers. However, the beginner cover is a great tool for the underarm area....something I have never used an epilator for in the past. My hair in that area is only coming back now after four weeks and much finer and sparser. I love this product!! I would highly recommmend it.</li>
    <li> Just got this the other day. Well, I actually was VERY surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt too bad :) Well, on the other hand, I do have high pain threshold...so......legs were just piece of cake....wonderful....bikini line was absolutly nice....I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it but it didn&#x27;t hurt....then the arms (I have very hairy arms....I usually bleach &amp; rub pumice stone to make hair less thick)....arms were a little more painful than legs....The worst were the underarms....I wasn&#x27;t able to do it...not going to since that wasn&#x27;t my area of concern at all. So far I did it twice on legs &amp; arms cause hair grows sporadically....we&#x27;ll see how it goes. So far I&#x27;ve been very surprised that it doesn&#x27;t hurt practically at all :) And also, if you look at the package, it tells you how to start using it...with what kind of thing on top of it...well, i used it w/o anything...just w/that twizing head...it&#x27;s the best cause it takes the smallest hairs out. I am happy so far .Although, package didn&#x27;t contain 1 head it was suuposed...    I used to shave my legs, I&#x27;ll keep shaving underarms :) I used to wax bikini line....no mas :)</li>
    <li> I love this epilator!  I used to use the Epilady epilator and it hurt so badly that I would only do it once every two weeks and I dreaded it all day when I had to do it.  Finally, I decided to look for a better product that might not hurt as much.  AND I FOUND IT.      I&#x27;m so grateful to Braun for making this product.  It does not hurt very much at all, while using it.  I have a few sensitive areas on my legs where it hurts a little bit, but nothing like my old epilator.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  I literally only went over my leg once.  I didn&#x27;t really have to go back at all to redo missed hairs.  There were a few on my knees because I have boney knees but no where else.    I love the light because I can go back afterward and make sure I didn&#x27;t miss any sections.  I just throw an old towel down and sit down and epilate and then throw the towel in the wash.  It&#x27;s been a week and my legs are still smooth.      Just a tip for people new to using epilators.  They are wonderful.  I&#x27;m a fairly hairy lady and when I use this I don&#x27;t get that situation where the hair grows back in two days.  Thing is your first few times epilating it does hurt more because you have more hairs to get rid of.  Then once you get into a routine with it you actually have less hair growth and you&#x27;re keeping up with it so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much in the future.  I highly recommend bulling your way through the first few epilations to get to the point where it&#x27;s easier and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  Don&#x27;t give up!    I love love love this product.  I can&#x27;t tell you what a relief it was for me to be able to epilate with so little discomfort.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator! As with any epilator there is discomfort the first time or two using it. If you have used the old style coil epilators you will like the tweezer style much better. It pulls the hair not the skin.  Specific to this product:  It&#x27;s easy to use.  The attachments are easy to change.  The shaver/trimmer attachment is a nice addition for those places you would rather not epilate.  The little \\&quot;headlight\\&quot; on it sounds silly, but is a great help. I&#x27;m not a fan of the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; attachment, but all in all I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an epilator.</li>
    <li> I am new to epilators but ordered this one after reading the reviews. I must say it is so good that I am asking myself why I didn&#x27;t buy it earlier. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. To finish, amazon delivery system is very reliable and arrived earlier than what I expected. this product is a must!</li>
    <li> Amazing.....It is the best silk&#x60;epil I ever have. If you need one ...take one of this, and you will see the  diference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 months now.  I LOVE it!  It does sting the first time you use it, but lessens each time.  Once it&#x27;s been on an arm or a leg for a few minutes, it kind of numbs and I have no trouble continuing use.  I have blond hair (I know, I&#x27;m lucky) and for us natural blonds, the light is a must!  There is no way I could see those little blond hairs without the bluish light.  Other than having to epilate in different directions for bikini area, I didn&#x27;t find it very uncomfortable.  I have sensitive skin and I was red for days after the first epilation, but that never happened again.  The hair comes out easier every time.    tip:  Before attempting underarms, blow dry on cool for a minute or try wiping with alcohol to completely dry the hair, otherwise it hurts like @*!#!</li>
    <li> I received my epilator and started in on the process of what I thought was going to be painful.  No pain whatsoever.  This little device is wonderful.  I had the massaging head on it and it works so well.  My husband was impressed when he felt how smooth my legs were.  :)  This is truly a very good buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun Epilator for about a month. I had used the old epilady 20 years ago and it was quite painful. I hoped that the Braun would be an improvement and it really is light years better than the old epilators.   It is so wonderful not to waste all the time and money constantly shaving. I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Lovely, easy to use and very efficient one. I like my new epilator, Though it was bit painful during first usage. And the hair didn&#x27;t reappear for another 2-3 weeks which is exactly why I prefer epilators over razors and hair remover creams. I wud recommend this quality product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I was a little disappointed about some of the accesories were not included.  This one doesn&#x27;t have a cooling glove or one of the attachments I have seen for the face.  It comes with the beginners attachment and a seperate shaver attachment (which is a little handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hairy chick, I&#x27;ll admit, and I can sometimes even develop a five o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs when I shave in the morning.  What this epilator has done for me is not eliminate shaving, but now I feel like one of those fair-haired girls who can skip a day of shaving if they want.  And my legs are so smooth!  I will epilate, and then shave, so my legs will be extra smooth and when the hair does grow back, it is slow and not stubbly, so I could skip a day even!  That is really nice for me, especially if I am going to the beach for the weekend or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most pleasant surprise about this is that I LOVE using it on my arms!  I never knew what to do with my hairy arms, because who wants shaving stubble on your arms?  But when you epilate, your hair grows back spiradically, so no stubble!  It looks very natural.  I use this product exclusively on my arms about once a week--its the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could use it on my chin more easily, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well on curved surfaces like your chin or knee.  You can still do it, but not as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is fantastic--you can see everything, even when your room is not that well lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain hurts the first time around, but I think that is mostly becasuse the hair is all there at the same length.  But the future epilations are less painful because the hair grows spiradically, so there is not as much hair present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the bikini area goes, I couldn&#x27;t tell you because I am afraid to try.  Overall, I highly recommend this product for someone who is hairy like me and can make it past the initial pain.  It won&#x27;t eliminate your hair 100%, but you will definately be very smooth for a longer time and no more five o&#x27;clock shadow!dow!</li>
    <li> I have used Epilady spring epilators since the 80&#x27;s. Can&#x27;t believe how much better the Braun 5270 is. Less pain (anything that pulls your hair out is going to hurt), more efficient, faster. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order it earler. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Braun Silk-épil, especially in its new double system (epilator and shaver), provides a accurate and easy to do epilation. The skin remains soft and smooth for very much longer than usual razor blades, without the unconvenient itchy sensations!!   In its practical and elegant pocket, you can also bring it anywhere you need, in your purse or luggage!  It is an absolute MUST for every woman! Say good-bye to the old razor.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would actually work, but all the reviews I read said it worked, but that it was just really painful.  WOW was that true!!!  It does hurt so badly, but if you can get yourself through the pain it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  After awhile I just wanted to get it over with so I just went crazy with it and my legs started getting used to the torture.  I&#x27;ve tried waxing before and it works the same way, but epilating is so much less expensive and messy.  Afterwards I had some irritation and red bumps, but I just put some aloe vera on it (which STINGS), and in the morning my legs looked fantastic.  I would definitely recommend this product, but DON&#x27;T and I mean DON&#x27;T underestimate the pain.  Put it this way, a tattoo tickles compared to this!</li>
    <li> 1st time i used this it was brillant.  2nd time i used it, it was great, 3rd time i used it, it was good.  So what i&#x27;m saying is...it seem to be getting less effective the more i use it.</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughters and they love it.  My wife try only once and she said was painful; all is relative but, the finish and the frequency of depilations for my girls dropped significatively.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth silk-epil I purchase in the past 12 years.  I use it until I feel it is time to get a better and newer version of it.  I have tried other brands -roventta, philips- and realized that Braun is the best by far.      This last version, the X&#x27;elle one, is interesting since it has the little light which is always useful, and you do feel it removes more hair in less time. I also liked the blue color.    None of the epilators I own have ever given me a problem.  Indeed, I still use one from 7 years ago that I keep in my parents house so I don´t have to carry mine when I go visiting them.  My mother also has one and so does my friend.    The legs last in good shape for about a week and then you start seeing those little ones showing and growing. Still, it is a better option than shaving your legs.</li>
    <li> I have been using an epilator for years and was pleasantly surprised with this one.  It works great and is faster than my old one.  I am very happy with this product though I think the light is unnecessary.</li>
    <li> Compared to waxing, shaving and laser hair removal (which I&#x27;ve all tried) this is a good hair removal method for people who have a fairly good tolerance for pain. It comes with a shaver head and an epilator with a light to help you see the fine hairs. I&#x27;ve had this for years and it still works well to this day.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife  There was discount on this product at that time, maybe 50%  This product works only via electricity, no batteries  Best Features Of this product :  1- Power Cord Cable is long  2- The light positioned to the target area of epilation   3- Made In Germany</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty good, hair removal is painless and has 2 speeds, has a lamp that lets you see clearly the shaved areas and missing. It is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in July 2009, and after more than two years its STILL WORKING GREAT!! This epilator, however, isn&#x27;t perfect. I am a person who has a high tolerance level for pain, and so the actual epilating isn&#x27;t TOO torturous for me. It definitely hurts, but if I&#x27;m doing a large space like my leg, I take breaks. You definitely have to go over an area two or three times before ALL the hair is removed. This epilator is good at getting short hairs, but usually requires you go over the hair two or three times. It also has a light that comes on when you turn the machine on, so that&#x27;s very helpful in making sure you&#x27;ve removed all the hairs you wanted. Cleaning is also easy because the  attachment is removable, so you can rinse it out with soap and water. It is definitely a good buy for the price!</li>
    <li> There are several very well-written reviews about this product already, so I&#x27;ll just mention a few thoughts I feel are salient, particularly for first-timers or people who are new to the vast world of epilators.    BENEFITS: I&#x27;ve been using an epilator on-and-off for years. This time I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;on\\&quot; for about 4 months, and I can&#x27;t see ever going back to shaving. Reasons: 2) The fur-free look and feel last way longer than they do with shaving, since the hair grows back both sparser and finer. 2) Uses no water. I&#x27;m in an area suffering from exceptional drought right now; it would be irresponsible of me to stand in a shower for 5 minutes shaving. 3) No more having to buy razors and shaving cream full of chemicals. 4) No cuts. 5) No paying $$ for waxing.    PAIN: I realize this is a huge issue for many people, and rightly so. I&#x27;ll give it to you straight: You&#x27;re ripping hair out of your body by the root. There&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s going to be painless the first time. I did the hot bath, the deep breathing, etc., but it was two generous glasses of red wine and sheer tenacity that got me through that first epilating experience. (The next day I had a gnarly headache, but my legs looked great.) All I can say is buck it up, take frequent short breaks, and IT WILL BE BETTER the next time. This goes for legs, arms, and underarms. Remember to exfoliate every day to prevent ingrown hair.    WHY THIS ONE?: You may have noticed there are eleventy zillion epilators out there. I bought this one and I like it because it has two different heads for epilation on different parts of the body. The little light on it is outstanding as well. Finally, my old epilator is a Braun; I&#x27;ve had it for over 10 years, and it still works. I don&#x27;t argue with that kind of quality.    I also recommend a nice cabernet sauvignon. Best of luck to you!</li>
    <li> it works well and prevents hair from growing back as quickly as when shaved but it leaves skin on legs dry and bumpy.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent epilator. The light that comes on it is fantastic. I previously owned a Panasonic and this one beats it hands down. It is comfortable to use and the slight pain that comes with epilating is very minimal. If your looking for one of these I encourage you to try this one.</li>
    <li> I tried this epilator on a whim, and wish I had heard about how great electric epilators were years ago!    Way faster, neater and easier than waxing or shaving, and way  more affordable than lasers. I have not found using this to be very painful either, some areas are just a little sensitive. The light is a valuable feature, it really works well to  reveal the finest of hairs. I am now telling all of my friends how great this epilator is! Great Value, Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> wife has used one for years and is very happy with it, highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I decided to purchase this item based on the overwhelming amount of positive reviews. Let&#x27;s just say, even with all the hype, I was not disappointed in the least bit. I regularly waxed for years - legs and arms to be exact. It is sticky, messy, expensive, takes a ton of time, doesn&#x27;t get all the little hairs, and often removes a thin layer of skin leading to redness and discomfort. Shaving never worked for me either. I always had razor burn that would last a day or so - right as the stubble came in. I tried my cousin&#x27;s epilator recently for the first time. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t even know such a thing existed. I immediately purchased one myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Silk-epil looks great with it&#x27;s glittery blue exterior. It is very comfortable to hold and fits very nicely in the hand.  It comes with several attachments - all of which seem useful. I am particularly excited about the \\&quot;beginners\\&quot; attachment with the rollers. It really lessens the pain and, in my experience, doesn&#x27;t elongate the time it takes to epilate. As for the pain, it depends on where you are epilating. Some areas are painful, some are not at all. I keep reading that the pain goes away after a few times - that would be nice - although I would keep using it even if it didn&#x27;t. Another great feature on this epilator is the Smartlight - it really helps you see all the little hairs and get them all. Another great thing about epilating is that the mess is at a minimum and you can do it wherever you like.  I like sit in front of the T.V. on a towel. I just air the towel out in the bathtub when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the Braun epilator is that I can \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; whenever I want.  With waxing, you have to wait until your hairs grow out or the wax won&#x27;t catch them.  This leaves a long time \\&quot;in between\\&quot; where the hairs are too long for shorts and not long enough for removal.  The Braun epilator grabs even the shortest of hairs! To me, it means having smooth legs whenever I want, quickly, and without the mess!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I only wish I would have found it earlier!!!and without the mess!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I only wish I would have found it earlier!!!</li>
    <li> I have a hairy chest and stomach which was the main area I was going to use it on. My hairs are dark and thick. I followed the instructions and went on with usage. The machine does work as I looked at the hairs it was pulling out and could tell they came straight out of the root - However, my hairs are just to thick and deep and I ended up getting really red, irritated skins that lasted for a few days as well as blood coming out of a lot of spots where the hair came from.    If your hair is thick like mine I would suggest waxing. I believe it works great on women&#x27;s thick hair but not guys horse hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I think this product does an okay job. One thing I dont like is that I still have red marks on my legs where the hair was torn out and that was a week ago. Maybe it will just take some time for my skin to get used to it. I sure wish I could afford a nono (an at home laser hair removal system) though.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic! I have really coarse thick hair and used to have to shave my legs every single day, otherwise it felt like I had a pine forest popping up on them. But now with this product, I only have to \\&quot;epilate\\&quot; once a week. And even when the hairs do start to grow back in, they grow in so thin and light that you can barely see or feel them. I was so impressed with the way it worked on my legs that I decided to try it on my underarms. It hurt...a lot!!! But the results are wonderful, and I&#x27;m starting to get used to the pain. And again, I only have to do it once a week and the hairs grow in finer. I love this product and it is saving me a fortune in razors and saving me a ton of time in the shower everyday. Every woman needs one!!!</li>
    <li> Just love the epilator.  Only have to use it once a week.  The hair on my legs is coming in finer, and appears to be much thinner.  Just love it!    Sandy</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife. No more shaving for her, she said it is the best thing a woman can buy for her legs. She loves it.</li>
    <li> UPDATE, May 17: I LOVE THIS THING! It&#x27;s SO much better than my older model Braun epilator! The process is MUCH less painful (even in the most SENSITIVE of areas), and with double the tweezer heads of my old Braun epilator, it truly IS faster and MUCH more efficient to use this one! The light feature is GREAT, too, and very helpful for ensuring that you get every little hair that you&#x27;re trying to remove! I think I&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few extra notes and suggestions: if you have issues with ingrown hairs, try exfoliating every day or every other day to help the hair shaft make it past the epidermis. I had initial trouble with ingrown hairs, but have found that exfoliating scrubs, like sugar scrubs and similar products, really help make a difference. In order to keep the progressively softer hairs from getting trapped below the skin&#x27;s surface, you have to help things along by scrubbing the area that you&#x27;re epilating with an exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Braun epilators DO remove the entire hair shaft, as opposed to just cutting at the skin&#x27;s surface layer, like razors do. Since your hair follicles are constantly producing new hairs, the hairs that resurface WILL be straight at the end, as if they were cut, but epilators as a rule pluck the hairs out to the root, which is why your skin stays soft and smooth for more than just a day. Give these things a try - they&#x27;re SO worth the time and effort!&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had an older model Braun Silk Epil Eversoft for easily five years. I&#x27;d seen it the last time I was in France (they had them in every Geant store we visited), and wanted one desperately. Got back home to the U.S., picked one up, and have loved it ever since. I use my epilator on almost every surface that visible hair grows on, except my eyebrows and my scalp. If I can reach it, and I can see dark hair there, I epilate it. The upper lip area is very sensitive, but the bikini area is the MOST sensitive, as you might imagine (I have no problem using mine on my underarms, though). Pull the skin that you&#x27;re epilating taut, go full speed ahead, and you&#x27;ll be done in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got no experience with epilators outside of the antiquated Epilady of the 80s, Braun&#x27;s epilators are SO much better! One caveat, though, if you don&#x27;t mind my suggesting one: once you&#x27;ve acclimated to using this, and you experience less pain using an epilator on your body than you did when you first started (especially in the oh-so-sensitive bikini area), for the love of all that&#x27;s Holy, don&#x27;t stop using it! If you wait too long (like I obviously had), you&#x27;ll be right back to square one with the level of pain you experience when epilating (IF you&#x27;re like me, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect my experience to vary from anyone else&#x27;s). Epilators are GREAT tools for removal of unsightly hair, but if you stop using them, from my experience, the hair returns to its pre-epilation thickness, and your skin returns to pre-epilation sensitivity levels. It DOES get less painful over the course of the months after you begin using these; just make sure you stick with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you consider that the purchase of one of these is going to be, on average, less than the cost of ONE bikini waxing session at the salon, is there really any question?

    <li> When it first arrived I plugged it in, turned it on and was absolutely terrified. Thought it would tear me to shreds. I couldn&#x27;t bear to use it. So I let it sit a few days and then tried again. It is uncomfortable. The pain is comparable to waxing, and so are the results. I LOVE IT. It leaves my skin so smooth and is just as fast as shaving; only it lasts much longer. I handle the pain better each time I use it. It works best when the hair is not very long. The attached light is great too.</li>
    <li> This epilator works great, and leaves my skin smooth. It&#x27;s horribly painful if you&#x27;re not used to epilating. I still suffer when using it for my underarm. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be used to it!! but otherwise, it&#x27;s perfectly fine on my arms and legs, not so painful.</li>
    <li> Great product! Of course very painful at first but eventually it hurts less. The only complaint I have is itchy legs! Then again I used to have itchy legs before when I shaved too. I had very thick regrowth while shaving now they are growing thin. It&#x27;s a great alternative if you can&#x27;t afford laser removal. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! It even gets the little fine hairs on my thighs!! Waxing couldn&#x27;t even do that!!! (LOVE the light by the way).</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]    Great system.  This is a 2nd unit for traveling.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; feature is most convenient.  Can use the unit even while watching TV in the evenings.  I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!!</li>
    <li> Let me just say first, that if this didn&#x27;t hurt at all, nobody would be using razors to achieve a smooth leg.  Yes, the first time I used it, it did hurt some, but it was nothing I couldn&#x27;t bear at all.  I have never waxed my legs before either, and find waxing very painful, so that gives you an idea of my tolerance.  However, the second time I used it, it was much less painful, literally more than 50% less painful than the first time.  I will say one thing, use this at least a DAY BEFORE you want to have smooth legs, because it left me with little pink dots all over my legs.  Those were also not as bad second time around.  Anyway, down to the other aspects:    The device overall - The design is great and fits in my hand very comfortably.  I wish it could be charged so I could use it as a cordless device, but I don&#x27;t mind plugging it in and sitting on the floor for a little bit.  I also really like the light on it, which from the pictures looked useless, but really help you see all the hairs.  I also like the little bag you can store everything in, it makes it easy to cary around.     The Attachments - I definitely recommend the epilator head with the massaging things for the first time around.  It helps distract from the pain a little bit, and also helps pick up little hairs wanting to stay on your leg.  The second Epilator Head without the rolling massage things worked great the second time around and was good for getting it done faster.  The Shaver works well too, it made my legs pretty smooth and I used it on my under arms as well.  I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer attachment so I can&#x27;t vouch for that.    The effects of this device were overall great.  Yes, it did miss some hairs the first time I did it, but it didn&#x27;t matter because some hairs grow in at different times, so I did have to epilate like a week after my first go.  But even if there are a couple little strays hanging around, they are the finer hairs and your legs still appear very smooth.  I will definitely keep on using this product knowing now how much the pain reduces the more you use it.  It does hurt significantly more behind the knee, and other sensitive areas, but that will get better over time.  If you are looking for a good option other than shaving to keep your legs looking great and getting rid of other unwanted hair, I definitely recommend this.  It does not seem like a crappy little electronic that is going to die out anytime soon, and I&#x27;m excited to keep using it and see the results!  Very Happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. she very loved this product. we recommended it also to friends (and they also bought and liked it).</li>
    <li> I remember when the EpiLady first came out and was hesistant on trying an epilator again. I am glad I did. This works great. Almost painless.  Less hair grows back and what does, is finer. The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c there is a very small amount of stubble that is left after I use this, if you&#x27;ve had your legs waxed, it&#x27;s the same. What&#x27;s left is definetly better than what I would have the day after shaving. The light is a nice feature but not essential.   I would and have recommended product to my friends/co-workers.</li>
    <li> it hurts! although, i suspect this is a good product for an epilator. my friends use it and LOVE IT. however, as someone who previously did their own waxing (for many years), i found this device cruel and unusual. it seems to pluck your leg, bikini and armpit hairs out 10 at a time. the whole process is remarkably slow and it is easy to lose courage. i&#x27;m back to wax.</li>
    <li> I am using epilators for many years now and the one I bought lately (Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator)is one of the best ones I had own. It&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job good , and is very detail .What I mean I can epilate my legs in 1 hour ( not like with other epilators 1:45 min).Plus I like this little light. Well I have to say it! When I was reading reviews I was surprise that people even concidered to mention the pain while they \\&quot;shave\\&quot;......Oh! Of course it will hurt!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t matter what brand you use or how much you have paid for it! It&#x27;s pulling your precies hair out from under your skin with the root! Just take aspirin and make your self beautifull!</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever using an epilator, and I never did the waxing thing either. Well, as advised buy some other reviews on [...] where I purchased this (and days after purchasing this, they no longer sell it, they sell newer models), I took some ibuprofen for the pain and then i took a hot shower. I used this on my right lower leg immediately after my shower. It still hurt, but going slowly it worked well. I had to go over some areas two or three times. But the pain was tolerable, knowing that with frequent use the hair will grow less and will last longer than shaving. The light on the product is a good thing to help see the hairs. Its a little noisy but I guess that can be expected. While I can tolerate the pain, I still decided to save the other leg for tomorrow night. SO in total it will probably take me 4 days to have hair free legs. One for right lower leg, one for left lower leg, one for right upper leg, and one for left upper leg. Then in a few days I will have to do it all again as hair grows in different stages. But it seems like a good product and will last. Only issue is my leg right now has a bunch of little red  bumps on it that will probably go away overnight (at least thats what other reviewers say)    My advice from my experience and other reviews if you&#x27;ve never done this before:  1. wait until evening  2. take some Ibprofen for the pain and swelling(the red bumps after the hairs are plucked)  3. take a hot shower or bath  4. epilate immediately after shower/bath  5. apply an after shave gel or creme to prevent ingrown hairs (I used bikini zone medicated after-shave gel and it helped with the pain and bumps right away)    follow up advice:  epliate in stages if you can&#x27;t stand the pain  make sure to exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs  moisturize      hope this helps you out!</li>
    <li> Just could not switch it on!Will buy from a department store because this one has the best reviews.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after my epilator broke. I was hesitant since it was cheaper then the one I had been using. Works great. The light is a must. Really helps see those hairs you missed. Still struggling with the ingrown hairs but that happens with any product like this</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have such an excellent hair removing product after all these years of obviously having picked the wrong brand. I especially recommend the Braun if you are getting an Epilator for the first time or you are not happy with the one you have. I have blond to light brown body hair that is mainly fine textured. With my previous epilator products (touted the best by the speciality stores I purchased from), I always spent at least on hour or more going back and forth trying to remove all the hair just on my lower legs. I am not talking about a lot of hair, most was only visible upon closer examination, but the other brand would not remove it easily. I always had to settle for stubbly hair at the knees, which were fine and blond that were often only broken off and not removed. The Braun however, in 10 minutes or less, gave me the smoothest shave I have had in years without a stray hair in sight. I am ecstatic.  And, it only tingled slightly without the slightly painful pulling (I have a high pain tolerance) that my previous epilators caused. Now I feel I can shave easily year around, as I usually did not shave in winter because it was so time consuming with the other product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my X&#x27;elle  for 3 months now. I purchased mine for $58.99 on amazon when it was the deal of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is sturdy and the light is a definite plus. It&#x27;s very easy to switch from the epilator head to the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;Braun was nice enough to supply us with a little brush that helps to clean the hairs from both the epilator head and the shaver head. The bag is very cute and compact which is great for travel. It holds everything including the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of use, my light tends to turn off (from the vibration i think), but all I have to do is push down on the piece and it comes on again. I&#x27;m thinking that pushing it down connects the light to some sort of circuit under neath the part. Not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 spinning tweezers at even the low setting looks shockingly fast. The epilator head design is very unique and trustworthy. 3 months of use and it still hasn&#x27;t pinched my skin with the tweezers. Not even on my elbow or knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a regular shaver like me, than brace yourself for the pain. I was only able to get through with one leg the first time and it must have taken a good 10min with the breaks i gave my poor leg. Rest assure that it is very painful only the first few times. Once you make it a habit to epilate once a week or at the sign of hair growth, then the pain is bearable or nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The messaging rollers don&#x27;t help much but it&#x27;s better to have that attachment on then with the regular attachment on the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear trimming attachment for the shaver is very useful to get the hairs down to the right size before epilating. It helps to reduce the pain caused from tugging the hair. Also it helps the tweezers get a closer grip when the hair is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs, arms, and upper lip so far. Not able to muster up the courage to epilate under arms or bikini area, but that&#x27;s what the shaver head is for :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not epilate before making a public appearance. Your skin may seem fine, but the redness will kick in after a few min. Best used before sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run the epilator with an alcohol pad to disinfect it before use. just hold the pad against the back portion of the roller and turn the epilator on on low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason not to get this epilator would be to get a cordless one so you are not restricted to epilate in areas with an outlet, or a wet &amp; dry epilator so you can epilate in a nice warm shower when your pores are open, hence less pain :) But with all that in mind, this is the cheapest and a very popular epilator for the lack of those options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Input: 100-240 V ~ /ac&lt;br /&gt;50-60 Hz/7W&lt;br /&gt;Output: 12 V m /dc 0.4 A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UL Class 2 Power Supply C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^ is a bit of what is listed on the plug of the power cord.but the redness will kick in after a few min.

    <li> I can take a lot of pain, I have plucked my leg hairs and my mustache with a tweezer but this \\&quot;braun epilator\\&quot; was a whole new level of pain. As painful as waxing, but more direct pain.   I do not think this amount of pain is worth not having to shave in \\&quot;1 week\\&quot;. It doesnt even get that close and it misses hairs. And i cannot imagine putting this on my bikini line.    The rollers go so fast, that i felt like a was going to give myself an electric shock. Girls, this is not worth the money. As much as i wanted this to work, it is too painful for live humans, for cadavers it might work ok.  Dont waste your money like i did. No epilators work well, unless you can deal with extreme levels of physical pain.     It has been months now and I still havent the courage to try to use this machine again. I really am not exaggerating, i really wanted this to work, but it was torture.     I wasted $50 that I wish that I had back. I wish someone told me, please, dont buy this product. So, im telling you, think about it, read more reviews, do more research. Or youll wish you had your $50 so you could eat at the Olive Garden.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend the product! I love it..  Finally I can stop shaving!   Received the product in 3 days! The epilator was pre-assembled although the manual showed how to assemble the product. I also found some vaseline like substance, perhaps it was used during the assembly, but the product was brand new. I started using it without any preparation like people in their reviews had suggested (warm shower to reduce pain, pain medication etc). Actually if you can withstand threading, this pain is minimal. I don&#x27;t understand why pain is an issue. I would definately not recommend consuming pain killers etc, it is insane, come on!! after all we have waxed or threaded before and the pain does not kill you does it?? I do agree that initially it hurts, but it is the same plucking sensation from threading and as you epilate on skin patch by patch, even this pain becomes negligible. I would recommend chatting with your friend or watching tv or listening to music while epilating to distract yourself from the pain. The process is super fast and I took 15 min to epilate both arms, fingers to shoulders. The smart light is very effective and the massaging rollers also indeed reduce pain. However after your epilate you will notice small bumps on the skin so you must wash the area with cold water, dab it dry and then massage some soothing lotion over it.Skin feels like silk. I would recommend first-timers to use the slow speed setting and enjoy the experience without worrying about the pain. Afterall I am sure we women are capable of withstanding worse pains :)  I have epilated before this, roughly 9 years ago I used my aunt&#x27;s Braun. That one was very painful and slow so you could feel the hairs being plucked one by one, however I can assure you that Braun has advanced a lot over the last decade because this epilator is so much less painful compared to the old one. I try it on the bikini line gradually patch by patch. Shaving for me has been a bad experience, scraping of skin, burningand tingling sensation etc, which is unhealthy and can cause the skin to get septic(infections). Thanks to this braun!    Relax and don&#x27;t worry about the pain- the results are simply wonderful!</li>
    <li> This system is ideal for those that have sight problems because the light fixture makes it easy to see and to yank those short hairs. I gave this to my nearly 70 year-old grandmother as a gift (she has thick European hair)and she loves it.     Yes, it hurts a tad but the results are lasting.</li>
    <li> The pain is noticable, of course, but not unbearable.  I bought this to use as a full body hair remover (down to the very last inch) and it worked wonderfully.  Don&#x27;t let the loud noise scare you, it works very well.  I also loved the electric razor head attachment.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> I researched this product thoroughly and decided to buy it based on other peoples reviews. Most said it hurts, but it&#x27;s bearable. Well, not for me! I have never been a waxer - always shaved - so I expected it to hurt.. but OMG!! I popped some pain pills, and went at it. No matter if I used the massaging head, soft setting, experienced head or the optimal setting, I just couldn&#x27;t bare the pain! I could feel each and every hair pulling out and it felt like someone was stabbing me! But, I did both legs until it wouldn&#x27;t pull anymore hairs, and they were still left prickly, sore, and swollen. I tried again the next day and decided it&#x27;s not for me. I have really dark, thick hairs on my legs, so maybe I just have more rooted hairs than most women. The machine does work as it should and is well made. The foil-shaving attachment is nice too because it gets as close to the skin as using a razor would. I had no problem with the Silk-epil&#x27;s performance, it&#x27;s just that epilation is not for me.</li>
    <li> I just bought this a week or so.  I recently began waxing my underarms and it was not as painful as I thought but it was messy.  Ended up having to do it in the kitchen to be close to the microwave to heat the wax, and that is not the place for waxing your armpits!  So while looking around for wax products, I came across this.  I thought since it was the cost of a good bikini was job, I&#x27;d give it a try.  I started first with the underarms.  A bit uncomfortable the first time, second time not so bad.  I have been doing it every morning, after you get the first big amount off, I think it is less painful to do it daily, since the hair grows in a different times anyway.  Then you are only pulling 10-20 hairs out instead of 100-200.  I certainly do not want to let it all grow out and go through the initial feeling again.  Then I got the nerve up for the legs.  I gave it a dry run and it was very uncomfortable, but became bareable after I got over the shock.  I also tried the bath first, but it did not make a difference in pain level.  I really think those first times it is more painful purely for the amount of hair that is there.  So, if you try it once and your turned off by the ouch, try it again the next day.  I also have been going over my legs daily for the past week.  Did my toes, little ouch.  I have gotten close to my bikini line, but I&#x27;ll have to get back to you on that one, I have not gotten up my nerve yet.  I was using the head with the rollers, but now I am using the one without.  It gets down closer, but you do have to be careful using it on skin that is not so smooth, I pinched myself just a bit under the arms.  I definately will like not having to go to the salon to get waxed if I can get the nerve up to do the bikini area.  I will also like not having to let the hair grow out to a waxable length, expecially the underarm hair.  I have no problems with the cord length, but I have an outlet right near where I use it.  My last bathroom, that would of been aproblem.  Definately like the light and the additional trimmer/epilator heads.  I would vote for a cordless unit though!  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands or models, but I am very happy to have this as my first epilator.  STAR RATINGS: Each product is carefully reviewed in an unbiased manner. Star ratings are earned.   1 Star:  There may be something wrong in the product details or description, it does not live up to what it is advertised as or made extremely low quality. I would tell my friends, acquaintances, and strangers that they shouldn&#x27;t use their hard earned money on this product. 2 Star: This is not a great product at all. It has mistakes in the product details or description and does not live up to what it advertises or normal customer expectations. It is still now worth the money. 3 Star: This is a neutral rating. It met the product description and details for the most part but isn&#x27;t something I am ever likely to order again. It could have some really cool features, An awesome looking design, Or maybe it’s just a killer deal. But overall the price of the product is not worth it. 4 Star: I like this product. This item has met all expectations, The design is sound, The build is great and the product does what it was made for. It’s a great product that i can recommend buying. However it didn’t wow me. It does what it is supposed to do.  5 stars: Wow! This item is amazing,  it is an exceptional product. Not only does it meet all expectations but it’s well made and lives up to the product details and description. It exceeds normal consumer expectations.</li>
    <li> So, I received this product as a \\&quot;gift,\\&quot; which was fairly insulting, but I was still a little excited to try it, as I love beauty products and enjoy bragging about my high tolerance for pain.  After reading this review, you will likely think that I am a big wussie, but I am far from it.  I have lots of painful hair removal experience.  I&#x27;ve even been a training model for estheticians who have never performed a bikini wax.  (That sucks, by the way.  They don&#x27;t realize how hot the wax needs to be until it&#x27;s too late and your crotch is cemented to the bedspread.) So, as you can imagine, I assumed this Epilator would be a piece of cake.       I decided to try it out on what I assumed would be a low-sensitivity area: my ankle.  It was not low-sensitivity. This thing freaking HURTS!!!  I felt like I was tattooing a baboon&#x27;s butt on my ankle. You know?  Puffy and red? I&#x27;m not exaggerating here.  I would rather tweeze each individual hair.  Or rub it off with sand paper.  Or just be eternally hairy.  Or, here&#x27;s an idea: SHAVE!         The sound is really annoying too.  Maybe it&#x27;s designed that way so you can&#x27;t hear the voice inside your head screaming, \\&quot;WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT?!?!\\&quot;  I will never use this on myself again.  I will only attempt to use this product on my boyfriend&#x27;s back when he&#x27;s wearing headphones and can&#x27;t hear me coming.</li>
    <li> Hurts like heck, but it&#x27;s tolerable. I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and have not noticed that it hurts any less over time. But, I love the convenience, and the \\&quot;no mess\\&quot; of this thing. The light is a huge help. I am glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because the idea of waxing, lotions &amp; shaving just seemed annoying.  I also read the reviews &amp; it had a shaver attachment so in the event I hated epilation I didn&#x27;t feel like I lost out on my investment.  I&#x27;m no wimp.  In fact, I have the potential to be downright masochistic.  This thing impressed me with the amount of initial pain.  I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I&#x27;ve read reviews thinking, \\&quot;ha! these people are kidding right? no pain, no gain!\\&quot; and let me tell you, it hurt.  I used the massager roller thing &amp; realized that was half of the problem!  I kinda had to use it every couple days because I only felt comfortable epilating a little at a time.  Finally I decided to stop being a baby &amp; just get it all done.  I took a tylenol (it helps) &amp; went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you know anything about hair it grows in cycles so I was only hair free for like a week then a patch would show up on my leg.  I also have the sense to know that a loofah or some sort of exfoliation is the only way to keep the ingrowns at bay.  The pain becomes tolerable the more you use it...I&#x27;m used to it already.  A really cool feature I like is the light that comes in handy in finding those stray hairs.  I could have done without the scratchy annoying \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; head.  I also would like this in a rechargeable, but its not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> The good news is this shaver worked wonderful under my arms. There is some pain involved and I noticed I still have to touch up anywhere from one week to 2 weeks later. I&#x27;m guessing that it will take a while to get all the hair off my legs and underarms to fully experience the 1 month without shaving as advertised. I like the light feature; very useful. I attempted to use as a bikini shaver but, the pain was too great. Overall, I&#x27;m still in the learner curve of this product and maybe once I get the hang of it, I can give it more stars. At this time, given the time it takes to shave with this (much longer than razor) the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have battery option, the issue with having to go over areas repeatedly, and the pain is too much for bikini area, I have to rate accordingly.</li>
    <li> Maybe I did something wrong, but not only did it not remove the hairs from my leg, it scraped my skin and yanked at the few hairs that it attempted to remove.  Bad experience for me.</li>
    <li> I think that it is a good product, it just didn&#x27;t work well on me.  Instead of ripping the hairs out, it would break them off...which meant that in a day or so, I had stubble.  I have waxed before and the hair rips out.  But the electronic version of waxing (epilator) didn&#x27;t work for me.  I think that it is me that is defective, not the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet!&lt;br /&gt;I used to wax my hands &amp; legs, never shaved and wanted something slightly more convenient, also never used/owned an epilator before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for over 2 months now and my cut - Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, small, smartlight is very very helpful, lightweight, does a fanatastic job and does not hurt as much (that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m used to waxing).&lt;br /&gt;Downside it&#x27;s time-consuming (maybe you could plan it better!!), and a little noisier than I would like! But these are things you can easily live with.&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s pretty awesome!!</li>
    <li> As a redhead, I felt the need to expand on some of the other reviews I read before purchasing this product.  I love this product- it is great for removing coarse hair, like bikini area and some on my legs.  It is so much better than hair removal creams, because by removing the entire hair you get longer before you develop \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; and feel smoother much longer.  The idea that it takes three weeks for hair to re-grow is medically inaccurate, and will disappoint people expecting to not have to use this epilator but every three weeks.  (I have to use it about every three to four days.)  This epilator is wonderful for pubic hair.  When I use it on my legs it takes out the coarse hair, which makes my legs feel very smooth.  It DOES NOT take out soft, fine hair, which is what I mostly have on my legs.  So while my legs feel smooth, if you look at them (as I noticed the first time when out watching tennis in the sun) you see lots of little hairs.  Of course, when you then shave with a razor, you still feel smoother for longer bc removing the coarse hair totally again makes you feel smoother longer than any other hair removal.  I have spent extensive time trying to remove all the hair on my legs, but have realized it is just not going to take out the soft hair, but I really like the effect it has even just removing coarse hair.  I tried it on some facial hair with the same effect- I bought another smaller emjoi epi-slim epilator which does better with facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, anyone with sensitive skin, just be aware your skin can develop little bumps when hair is removed (like a mosquito bite) but these go away on me in about 4-6 hours.  The first time I used it I was horrified bc it looked like I had some kindof serious disease, but the inflammation completely went away.  Because of this inflammation I can&#x27;t use it the same night I am going out on a date or anything.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the pain is moderate the first time you use it.  I did not think it was at all severe, and there was no way it would stop me from using the epilator.  It feels like having several hairs plucked at once. (I kindof like the feeling bc I know it is working when I feel that sensation.)  It is more tolerable when you use the epilator regularly, but I think that is just bc there isn&#x27;t as much hair to remove with subsequent uses.  I had no problem with the pain when doing my legs, underarms can be tear producing painful, and I stopped doing them (bc of the coarse/fine hair problems- I still had to shave them regularly).  The pubic hair is variable.  The outer hair is not too painful at all, but when you get to the more sensitive areas there are serious limitations.  I am not able to do all my hair down there bc of pain.&lt;br /&gt;I think there are some differences that people will notice depending on their hair type.  Just wanted to give a heads up to all the other blond and redheaded women out there! :)ere was no way it would stop me from using the epilator.  It feels like having several hairs plucked at once.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 5 years and I love this product... if you have ever had your legs waxed, you will find this device to be a much better use of your money. I was paying over $50 at least once a month to wax, so clearly this purchase paid for itself in short order.</li>
    <li> A gift to my now ex-wife.  Do not know how well it works...sorry!</li>
    <li> My pits used to be dark and gross looking, but I stopped shaving and started using the epilator once a week and it has completely cleared up... I also lost about 100lbs and started using doves cleartone deodorant... I find that every once in a while I have to shave for a week and skip the epilator to get the hair to thicken enough to be able to use it...</li>
    <li> Its great! I took me forever to choose between this one and the philips with the ice thingy. But im so glad i took this one! I had a very bad experience with epilators a long time ago and i was pretty scared!... I almost didnt even felt it. It doesnt hurt that much at all and does the job fast. Really thats a great product! -and its true the light and massage rollers are pretty cool! and its cute!!.. always helps the torture! &lt;br /&gt;My only problem would be it doesnt go with european voltage. (but you can buy a converter)</li>
    <li> I is not only an epilator but a trimmer as well and really works goooood. &lt;br /&gt;It catches the small short hairs that some epilators cannot and is &lt;br /&gt;perfect for often usage.I love it,it is my epilator.</li>
    <li> I was very reluctant to try this but I took the plunge.  It works great.  My legs are smooth and it lasts a long time.  Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t really hurt.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Of course, it hurts like heck and it makes my eyes water but it does a decent job. It is torture around the ankles but it works really well. If you use it regularly, the pain isn&#x27;t so bad. I&#x27;m just a slacker.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was very tired of shaving - I like very smooth legs so I shaved every other day at least.  I have never had professional wax, and only tried home waxing once and hated it so much I never did it again.  I was worried since some reviewers said it was very painful that i might be flushing money down the toliet, and couldn&#x27;t compare it to waxing.  Thankfully, it is not that painful.  The pain of epilating is like a 2 out of 10, slightly uncomfortable but bearable.  For reference, this pain scale would be 1 as muscle soreness after a tough workout and 3 is stubbing your toe.  I would agree with other reviewers the first time is the worst, but after its much easier - both because you are more accustomed to it and because you have less hair to epilate.  The introductory head I found useful only because I had trouble keeping the epilator at 90 degrees otherwise although now I have switched.  I like that it has two settings also, so that now that I have used it for a while I can use the faster setting.  I find that using the epilator once a week or every other week is enough to keep you legs pretty smooth.  You will miss hairs, so if you like you legs to be very smooth you may still have to shave.  I would also recommend epilating at least 24 hours before you want smooth legs bbecause you will have unattractive little red bumps where the hair was plucked out for  half a day or so.</li>
    <li> I first bought Braun Silk Epil about 10 years ago. It was one of their first models. I use it once or twice a month for legs, underarms and arms. Before that, I used to wax. Over the last decade, my hair growth had really thinned and I can easily go up to 4-6 weeks without having to do my legs. After nine years of use, my original Silk Epil suddenly broke down when I was only halfway done with my legs! I bought the 5270 from a local Target store for $70. I just love it! They have really improved the Silk Epil and I love the light!! The two heads also help. I can do my legs and arms very fast with the expert clip but I need the other more gentle clip for underarms. The new model is also more accurate and removes the hair in slightly less time. I wouldnt say it hurts any less though. It doesnt hurt much because you get used to it, but both models feel the same.     If you are thinking about using an epilator, just do it! If you dont like it, you can return it. But having used it for so long, I love the ease and convenience Silk Epil offers. No sticky wax, no expense of going to a salon. And no stubbles that spring up after shaving. I have never used any other epilator except Silk Epil so I dont know if others are better or worse.</li>
    <li> I found this product disappointing. It works well on my armpits but that&#x27;s about it. The process is incredibly tedious when it comes to the legs and, since my hair grows at different speeds, my legs are NEVER completely smooth. It is impossible not to miss spots as well. So, if I want somewhat smooth legs, I&#x27;m having to pull out the epilator every other day, waste alot of time attempting to find new/missed spots, clean up the epilator, vacuum, just believe me..it&#x27;s tedious. The ingrown hair problem cannot be overlooked either. I&#x27;ve gone back to shaving my legs b/c it works better and is less annoying. Yep, it sucks to be a girl.</li>
    <li> works great! previously had epilady and this is more powerful.  would recommend and would buy again</li>
    <li> I previously owned an Epilady and liked it pretty well but read many reviews that stated that the Braun is much better.  No comparison! The Braun is hands down the Mercedes of the two brands. I get more hair removal in less time with the Braun.  Hope it lasts as long as the Epilady at the very least! This is not perfect so no five-star rating but is very, very good in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who invented this thing,(undoubtedly a man) but I love them and hate them at the same time!!!!!!!!!! I bought one at Target today after weeks of agonizing over the price and potential pain. I just finished epilating my arms and I must say, OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWA!!!!!!! However, they are now silky smooth and I can&#x27;t stop touching them. (so glad my husband&#x27;s not home right now) Although I feel a strange buzz in my skin right now, hopefully that sensation will subside by the time I get up the nerve to do my legs!! If you can keep from passing out from the pain it soon becomes a rather enjoyable experience watching the fur fly!!!Get your mind out of the gutter you pervs, I&#x27;m still talking about my arm hair!! LOL! Anyway, pain aside it was very fast, clean and very effective. Beats the hell out of messy waxing! Alas, the things we ladies do for beauty. Bottom line... Buy it. It hurts but you know what they say, no pain, no gain!</li>
    <li> It does what it was supposed to do. My wife is happy now....</li>
    <li> For years I had been trying to figure out how to solve the problem of arm hair. I don&#x27;t mean underarm hair, I mean hair on my forearms and upper arms. Being part Italian, I&#x27;ve been plagued with dark hair on my arms. Up until now I&#x27;d tried everything - waxing (the hair would come back after 2 weeks, so that was like $100 a month! I only did it a couple of times), shaving (I&#x27;d have to do it practically every day, otherwise I&#x27;d get this awful stubbly, prickly hair all over my arms...). I just wanted to solve that problem. I didn&#x27;t care about my legs, since all women deal with leg hair, and I don&#x27;t mind shaving my legs, but not everyone deals with too much arm hair (many women are lucky to have sparse arm hair). Anyway after MUCH research I decided on this great little Epilator. I was a little nervous, because some people said it didn&#x27;t work well, or that it was really painful, gave them really bad ingrown hairs, etc. My pain threshold is probably slightly above average... When I got the Silk Epil in the mail, I tried it out immediately on my arms. It was somewhat painful.. I took breaks and slowly did both arms. Afterwards, and for about 12 hours afterwards, they were red and blotchy. I exfoliated right afterwords with a back scrubber on my arms (it&#x27;s rough but really exfoliates well). I then applied aloe vera gel... soon after, voila, I had smooth arms (the redness went away and I did not get any ingrown hairs). For the first time ever (aside from when I waxed), I didn&#x27;t feel that annoying below-the-skin stubbly feel on them. To make it even better, I didn&#x27;t have to re-do them for another couple of days (to get the next stage of hair growth, I believe). After that, I didn&#x27;t epilate them for about 9-10 days. Some regrowth appeared but it was actually in the form of fine hairs, ones that were not really noticeable, and that were fine to the touch (NOT prickly...!!!!). I have been really happy. I feel like this thing has really changed my life, because I no longer have to worry about shaving my arms each day (and having that gross \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock\\&quot; shadow on my ARMS... and not having to worry about someone touching my arms). I also used it on the nape of my neck a little as well as on my lower stomach a bit (I was blessed with dark body hair :(  ). Now, it&#x27;s not PERFECT, there are some finer hairs that it doesn&#x27;t really pick up, but I don&#x27;t mind. I love my Silk Epil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the last 12 years. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Braun and this latest model is a definite improvement.  There are several cutting heads - both beginner and novice levels, plus a little light to see the way.  Definitely worth the money and costs have not gone up very much for the Braun product in the last 12 years.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m pretty sure this is the model i have.  that said, this thing has revolutionized my life!  okay, that&#x27;s an overstatement, but it is really nice to be able to go at LEAST a week without shaving.  sometimes i go for longer because with this epilator the hairs grow in softer (so you don&#x27;t have that unpleasant \\&quot;stubbly\\&quot; feel).  i didn&#x27;t think it hurt all that much on my legs (unless you&#x27;re doing some euphamistic hedge trimming, which was a terrifying lesson for me), but my underarms were another story.  i still use it on my underarms, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as it used to, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel great.  if you do choose to try it on your underarms, here are some tips: rub down the area with baby powder (this will temporarily absorb any moisture which makes using the epilator both more painful and less efficient), then pull the skin as taut as you can with your free hand, and then go to town.  i think that second suggestion is really important for epilating on skin that has any laxity to it (eg, thigh, underarm skin): pull the skin taut!!!  also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much if the hairs are on the shorter side of things (with this thing you don&#x27;t have the unpleasantness of having to grow out your hairs super long so it can catch hold of them).  that said, you will probably need to make a couple passes to remove all the hair.  it can take a while, but if you mindlessly do it while you&#x27;re watching tv or something, you&#x27;ll be carefreely bare for awhile!  overall, i&#x27;m really happy with this thing, and my mother and sister both sneak using it when they visit me.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I have ever used, having always been a shaving woman.  On the first use, the pain is quite awful as has been stated in other reviews.  I thought the comparison to getting a tattoo was right on the money.  I have been using it for about four months as of writing this review and am pleased with it for the most part.  The other ladies were correct in saying the pain does lesson with each use. I have not been able to use it on the bikini line or armpits though.  My tolerance for pain is fairly high but that is just too much (even with the ibuprofen).  I&#x27;ll stick with shaving on those areas, and the shaver included with this works very nicely. I am using it weekly and havent noticed any lessening of hair growth as was described by others but it probably takes longer for that to happen. It is a time consuming undertaking and it is just a matter of personal preference wether you want to spend 30 minutes epilating once a week or 10 minutes shaving every other day (or in my case epilating AND THEN shaving the more sensitive areas).  All in all it seems to be a good product and I would recommend it as long as youre prepared for some discomfort.</li>
    <li> Save yor money on dipers. Buy from Amazon.Good saler, fast shipping.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am a silk epil user since it first came out.   IT&#x27;s not too bad, although i didn&#x27;t see any real improvement from the last version. I like a lot the little light, it really helps in seeing what you&#x27;re doing</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, ripping out hair hurts.  I had one of the original EpiLady epilators in the dark ages and it hurt so much I couldn&#x27;t use it. This is definitely better, and it seems less painful with each additional use. Make sure to pull the skin tight before you use it - especially on delicate areas and the face - or it will take the outer layer of your skin off. It would be better if it was cordless and rechargable. As a follow-up to other reviews, I think all the parts were in the box, and the light is helpful.</li>
    <li> Progress continues to be made in the field of hair-yanking. This device has more little wheels to grab your hair and rip it out - yes, it&#x27;s as fun as it sounds - but this one hurts less than its predecessors, and that light feature was a stroke of genius.     I&#x27;ve used several brands of these things and so far this is the best one.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased and used an epilator. Although it was not as painful as I thought it would be when using it on my legs, I was disappointed with how many times I had to pass over the same area. I&#x27;ve tried both beginner and advanced settings. The light was a very nice feature. The main reason I purchased an epilator was to try using it for my bikini line, but that was too painful. I reverted back to shaving.</li>
    <li> Ironically, I haven&#x27;t used the product too much since I got it since it works so well.  It&#x27;s a relief not having to shave all the time and deal with razor burn or rashes.  And I don&#x27;t have to pay for waxing anymore (not to mention dealing with incompetence).  This epilator seems very well deisgned.  I appreciate the little \\&quot;headlight\\&quot; for viewing any spots I misssed.</li>
    <li> I am European and i had so much problem to find a good epilator in US until  this Braun Silk-épil . Firstly I bought the \\&quot;Epilady Legend Rechargeable Epilator\\&quot;. It was so long to do one leg that i was running out of battery to do the second one. It made me wonder if I had normal amount of hair for american standard (I am a true brunette from south of Europe). With the braun silk-epil, i have no problem at all, it goes fast and takes all my hair off as I have always been used with European epilator. It s the first true epilator that I am happy with here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wicked mechanical tweezers for almost two decades now.  And they&#x27;re still the best bet all around.  Cheaper than waxing.  More convenient, that&#x27;s for sure.  You don&#x27;t have to make appointments.  You go through relatively the same process of growing out your hair and then it grows back in without the blunt end as would a shaved hair, so it seems smoother and finer.  And, as with waxing, the more often you do it, the less often you have to do it.  This Silk Epil Xelle is nice because it doesnt have the old fashioned coil, so you have an awful lot of control with what you&#x27;re doing.  The light is a nice touch - though frankly you either need a bright light or you go by feel.  This product has a nice wide system.  I can&#x27;t comment on pain factor as some other reviewers have as after so many years, I&#x27;m pretty immune to it now.  But insomuch as every few years I do need to buy a new one - and I like this one -- that&#x27;s a good recommendation coming from someone who has owned more than 10.</li>
    <li> The attachments fall of as you are using it and you spend more time picking up the parts from the floor than using it. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.  Quickly and efficiently removes the unwanted hair without pain.  I am delighted with this product and looking forward to gaining time for other activities.</li>
    <li> Received mine tonight and started it upwith great trepidation.  Would it be bearable or will it hurt so bad I&#x27;d be unable to use it?  I hovered it above my skin until I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore, then touched it down.  Not bad at all!  My hair is still pretty short from shaving so I didn&#x27;t get all the hairs, but I think that was for the best for a first time anyways.  I could do this everyday if needed.  Legs looked like a plucked chicken for a bit, but it&#x27;s been an hour and almost all of the redness is gone.  I&#x27;m so happy and so excited to retire my razors!  The shaver works great too, for the parts you don&#x27;t want to pluck.</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and the first time I used this, I actually drew blood!  Just little spots here and there, but totally annoying.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and now use it after showering (as recommended in the instructions).  Yes, it hurt a lot the first time, but it definitely gets better.  I still haven&#x27;t achieved total smoothness but I&#x27;m hoping that will happen over time.  Right now, I still have a mild stubble but it&#x27;s not visible.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it - it beats shaving by a mile.</li>
    <li> Good price for the quality of the product.  I used to have a Phillips and it seemed to keep the hair away longer then this Braun but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this braun 5270 and I thought I made  a good choice but I was wrong.It doaesn&#x27;t do its job very good leaving short hair behind. I don&#x27;t recomend this product to anybody. It was a gift and the person didn&#x27;t like it, she said philips are better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.  It works just as promised and the lighting is great.  the first time is the worst time, because the skin isn&#x27;t used to it and there&#x27;s so much hair, but if you stay on top of it and do it frequently, it becomes painless.  Because hair grows at different rates, you&#x27;ll only get some hair on the first go-through.  The next day, do it again, and you&#x27;ll get more.  Do it again on a third day, and most of the hair below the skin should be gone.  From there, about once or twice a week.  Shave for added smoothness.  When shaving, the smoothness seems to last much longer.  I adore the built-in light!  It really helps!  And I was impressed at how short the hairs can be and still be plucked.  This eipillator is so good, I almost want to buy two so that I have a spare should something happen to my current one.</li>
    <li> I went out and purchased this from bed, bath and beyond with my 20% off coupon, just so i could use it this weekend. Let me tell you that this product is very effective! i won&#x27;t go back to shaving if i can help it. Take some time to get used to the sensation because I&#x27;ll be honest - it&#x27;s Painful with a capital P at first. I did one whole leg on Saturday and the other on Sunday, just so I could handle it. I didn&#x27;t find that the cooling mit helpled all that much. Overall though, today i have hairless legs and it&#x27;s great, well worth the pain. The red spots went away quickly. I even used the epil on my chin and under my chin, as I have a medical condition that leads to a lot of facial hair, and after a few passes of the epil in different directions it got almost every hair! I was so impressed and could not get these results with nair or waxing, and tweezing by hand would have taken forever. I&#x27;m going to recommend the epil to everyone!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Well built and easy to use. Highly recommend. However, I still think Emjoy makes better products in term of comfort. Both of them do very good job of removing hairs, but this Braun product will leave your skin with redness, but not irritate though. By saying that, you can remove your unwanted hairs in seconds. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> The hair on my legs is coarse and fast-growing, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of methods over the years--shaving, depilatories, sugaring, and waxing--to keep it from getting unsightly. So after reading a number of reviews and user comments, I thought I&#x27;d give this epilator a try. I&#x27;ve had it for just over a month now, and it&#x27;s worked well for me. The process is uncomfortable and takes a little while to do thoroughly, particularly the first time or two, but the results are good (especially if you follow Braun&#x27;s instructions about recommended hair length and skin preparation before you start). Hair regrowth is lighter and the new hair is finer, as advertised, so stick with it.</li>
    <li> Over the years, starting with its introduction in the 80&#x27;s, I have bought several epilators, my first being the Epilady and never have I used them more than once, usually over a very small area. The pain was excruciating. Even up to a few years ago the experience was the same, however, the Braun seems to have solved alot of the problems that its predecessors and competition had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now mind you I have only done one calf (I was so impressed I had to stop and write this review), but it didn&#x27;t take long and the pain was minimal. I did find that due to my excessively dry skin that I had some itching and redness but the redness was no more than you would find during a waxing and some quality hand cream took care of the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I HATE shaving, I can say with certainty that I will be keeping this epilator and using it. I highly recommend this for hair removal. Wonder what it would feel like under the arms, yow!</li>
    <li> This is a well designed product.  It has 2 speeds and a little light so you can see the fine hairs.  Its is slightly uncomfortable on your legs, actually just a buzz but other areas are a bit tricky, especially the bikini area.  But having waxed there for years, its really not much different.  Waxing discomfort is more intense but is quicker.  This way is a bit less intense but it not over in one pull.  Also, I never had much luck doing the waxing myself.  The stuff is messy and its hard to do to yourself.  This is pretty easy and obviously much less expensive as it pays for itself after just one session.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. At first I was getting a lot of ingrown hairs, but I started using a luffa in the shower everyday and they are all gone. It does hurt a little but it is well worth it. I only use it on my legs have tried other areas but cannot bear the pain, yet.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I love the Braun 5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle, but I do like it enough to keep using it.  First of all, I don&#x27;t know who claims that you can use it as infrequently as every four weeks.  I have been using the 5270 for a month now, and I have to shave my legs at least once a week and my armpits every two to three days.  In addition, it definitely takes me longer to epilate than it ever did to shave, so I&#x27;m not sure that there is any time savings.  That said, the hair is definitely finer, less noticeable, and sparser, and I can only hope that things will continue this way until I hardly have any hair left at all....  My other complaint is that, no matter how much I epilate, my legs never feel completely smooth -- I suspect that I&#x27;m feeling hair that I&#x27;ve previously epilated that is too short for the tweezers to grab, but it is annoying.  So, why am I keeping at it?  I like the fact that, even as the hair is growing back, you really can&#x27;t see it.  There is no appearance of stubble or \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; (for lack of a better term) on my armpits as the hair is growing back.  Also, you can&#x27;t beat either the cost or the ability to epilate at home on your own schedule.  A final word on the pain factor -- it never hurt on my legs and, after the first time on my underarms (which was downright excruciating and actually drew blood), it doesn&#x27;t really hurt on my armpits, either.  I think it still would hurt on my armpits but for the fact that I am now contending with significantly less hair so there&#x27;s not as much chance for the pain to accumulate.  I have not yet braved my bikini area and am planning to follow another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to get a wax first and epilate thereafter.  Overall, although I don&#x27;t love this epilator, it beats shaving in appearance and waxing in cost, so I will probably keep using it.</li>
    <li> i liked the product . it did not hurt much.the only thing i didnt like personally is the noise when i switch on the machine. neverthless, it works just fine. i too read a number of reviews before i bought the product. as mentioned elsewhere, i think with frequent use, the pain subsides</li>
    <li> This thing is my hero. Let me just start out by saying that, being Italian, I have always had issues with dark, course hair...EVERYWHERE. Shaving my legs was pointless--the hair follices were so dark you could see them through the skin so it always looked like I had stubble, and the hair would grow back by the end of the day. As for everywhere else I couldn&#x27;t readily shave, I just had to deal with it, because waxing would just be way too expensive. Finally I just got so fed up being furry all over the place that I took a risk and decided to buy this.    When this epilator came in the mail, I was so eager to use it, but my legs had just been shaved, so I went straight to my stomach. In all honesty, it HURT. Bad. But I was willing to do anything to get a hairless stomach. I kind of got freaked out when I got red welts all over, but they disappeared within a day. When I tried the epilator on my bikini line, I almost died. It was the most excruciating experience of my life--I was sweating and cursing at the top of my lungs. But again, I am, it appears, amazingly motivated in the name of beauty, so somehow I managed to get it done, and I&#x27;ve never felt cleaner or neater down there in my life (the razor attachment helped with that). No razor burn, no ingrown hairs. Amazing.      I also used this baby on my lower back--a little painful, but it did the trick pretty quickly. I&#x27;m just reveling in the (unfamiliar) sensation of being soft and hair-free. I did the stomach a few weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve only had to do a very minor touch-up since then (which didn&#x27;t hurt at all). The precision head gets out hairs I didn&#x27;t even know I had on my legs and the dark roots are gone. Overall amazing. I just hope that, as many people are saying, the pain lessens with time.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous at first, but really found this to be an awesome little gadget!  Saves me so much time in the morning since I don&#x27;t have to shave!  I expected it to hurt more than it does...the legs are particularly easy for me.  The underarms were pretty painful the first time, but maintenance has been painless (some mild discomfort for a second or two but that&#x27;s it).  I haven&#x27;t touched a razor in about 4 weeks, so I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m fully converted! I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This epilator is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s perfect in every way possible. The smart-light is wonderful. The machine itself is fast and efficient; easy to clean and use. After the first use, the process is quick and painless. Before making the purchase, I was worried that this epilator would be TOO efficient for my rather sensitive skin, but it really hasn&#x27;t given me any problems. You&#x27;ll never have to shave or wax again! :D I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  For someone who has always struggled with shaving and course dark hair, this product solves everything.  Now granted, this doesn&#x27;t come without pain, especially the first time you use it, but now I&#x27;m doing weekly maintenance &amp; for the first time, I have \\&quot;clean\\&quot; underarms!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! I think the thing that surprised me the most was how well is gets very short hair. You don&#x27;t have to let it grow out for a couple weeks before hand like you do when you wax. I go the gym 3 times a week and don&#x27;t want to be hairy as long as it takes for waxing to be an option. It was able to grab on to hairs after not shaving for two days. It even gets the really fine thigh hair that waxing can&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts but it hurts less than waxing since you can get the hair as it grows and not have to rip everything out all at once. If you have waxed in the past it feels about the same as shaving with a dull blade. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is tired of shaving every day and doesn&#x27;t want to wait for the hair to grow out enough to wax.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator based on the good reviews here. I was really exited when I got it at home. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my arms.Man,it hurts!I got a couple bumps too.And it turned out arms are the worst places. I didn&#x27;t feel anything on my legs and even underarms.  I didn&#x27;t get a complete hair remover.There are always some hairs,although not noticalble, left.But I guess that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m new to it.  And one more thing about this product,it is really noisy.But it won&#x27;t bother me when I get better results.</li>
    <li> It hurts! I can&#x27;t stand the pain, my skin gets red and stays like that for another week. I do not recommend for women with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This epilator works great.  I removed hair from both of my arms in less than ten minutes.  You don&#x27;t have to go over areas several times.  The light feature on this apparature is really useful and helps me not miss even the smallest hairs.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re going to save a lot of money by using the epilator, because in theory is just like going for a wax. The only little inconvinience is the pain you may feel at the beggining but after couple of minutes you get use to it. I think is is worth it to have it!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve used this for months now and I can say it can really take a lot of hair off easily...BUT I&#x27;ve had horrible ingrown hairs and I hate them so much! I used the epilator to smoothen out my skin making it hairless and flawless... my hair legs are just thin and after I&#x27;ve used this for the first time.. guess what? my thin hair just turned into thick coarse hair! I have no choice but continue to use it since I can&#x27;t stand the thick hair on my legs...but what I hate most is the ingrown hairs that bumps on my skin which is so itchy and irritating! I am now looking for a better hair remover... I&#x27;ll say no to epilating if all epilators would cause this!</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve had this for less than a week and I have lovely smooth underarms (ouch, ouch, ouch) for the first time in many years.  My legs are pretty smooth, but haven&#x27;t grown out enough yet, but I can shave my underarms and in two hours have a \\&quot;five oclock shadow\\&quot;.  Allowing two days growth, I tried this last night (it took about three different times) and now, I should be able to go bare for the rest of the season.  My legs didn&#x27;t hurt much, but I don&#x27;t have the density there that I do under my arms, and the two days growth isn&#x27;t enough for a leg test yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the calf area really didn&#x27;t hurt, I was thinking maybe it was just cutting the hairs, but when you remove the cover, you can see all the little hairs which have been ripped out by the roots!  Yucky, but gratifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve waxed before, you will find this to be a boon.  It works on those pesky little chin hairs that crop up after ladies reach 35 or so, and I thought that would be a daily job for the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a couple of pain relievers an hour before hand and maybe apply some ice for a few minutes if you are really sensitive.  It is a great product and I&#x27;ll be recommending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an epilady for the last 20 years. . .not easy to get used to, but by now my legs are broken in.  I like the light on this and it leaves my legs feeling fine.  I have always loved the \\&quot;no stubble\\&quot; feel of the epilady.  This one seems to leave less stray hairs.  Use it every week or so.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun models of epilators for many years, and this one is the best one, it takes all hairs even the tiny and shortest ones, I am amazed by its work! and the smart light is very good idea, helps identyfing very thin hairs.  There is only one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product: it is very noisy, other Braun epilators don&#x27;t make such noise, it sounds like a mower) i hope Braun producers will take this litlle minus into conderation in next Braun models...  Nevertheless, I still love this epilator for its efficiency!</li>
    <li> I have very dark body hair that is fine, but plentiful. I usually shave my lower legs and under-arms. I occasionally Nair my upper legs and arms.    Since I am not a waxer, using this device the first few times was definitely \\&quot;ouchie,\\&quot; but nothing you can&#x27;t handle. Just switch back and forth &#x27;tween legs and arms. The comfort head definitely helps. Also, the first few times don&#x27;t worry about getting every single hair, just get used to it. I have not had the guts to try my under-arms yet; I&#x27;m sure it will work great, but I&#x27;m also sure it will hurt a lot worse! :)    I&#x27;ve used it three times, and I&#x27;ve already switched off the comfort head in order to get smoother results. Make sure your skin is dry before you use the epilator, with no lotion! I have a small scrubbing sponge that I use to exfoliate before and after I use the epilator; I also use lotion afterwards, and I have not had any ingrown hairs (a big problem when I shaved).    My hair is already growing back smoother and slower then with shaving. I also do not have to worry about melting off my skin with Nair anymore.    This thing is pretty loud though, so it&#x27;s not very discreet!</li>
    <li> If you do not have a lot of hair, you will love this epilator, it is very nice.  You have to get used to the way it works, because it created a little pain, but with few procedures, you will be fine.  If you have a lot of hair, you need more time.  This product it is not very effective in terms of time.  It takes a lot of time to take care of one leg, very long time, and the results are not perfect.  But with few procedures, it gets better.  I own one, and I am sending one as a gift to my friend, I like it.  So far it works well after extensive use of three people in the house for 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> Ouch, ouch, double ouch....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I was really not prepared for just how painful this thing would be. I&#x27;m a shaver/waxer/cream hair removal kinda girl. And it drives me nuts. Because it&#x27;s an everyday affair that gets tedious, expensive and downright annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I popped this thing out of the box after it arrived(and I had been dancing on pins and needles for it to get here as part of my New Year&#x27;s Resolution to be a happier me), I was quick to read the instructions and then plug her in for a test drive. Now, I had been avoiding shaving for a few days to get some good growth, as it was my understanding that these things work better with a slightly longer hair. But I finally gave in and had shaved just a couple days ago during my agonizing wait, as I could no longer handle the bristles on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First contact with skin was indescribable. I&#x27;ve had two c-sections and had babies latch on to my breasts. I thought that hurt. Thought. I was wrong. THIS is pain. This thing literally RIPS the hair out of its happy socket. It drew blood on me several times!!! And I had to stop (because I was doing the wussy dance so much) multiple times and try a different area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now having said all that, you would think I would hate the thing and ship it back to Amazon faster than a long-tailed cat escapes a room full of rocking chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contraire, mon frere. Actually, I think it&#x27;s AWESOME. After multiple swipes, the thing actually starts to soften and/or numb the skin. The pain subsides and you are left with virtually hairless, smooth gams, pits, Happy Trail (or chin - which was the biggest reason I bought the thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it became obsessive. Where else on my body did I have unwanted hair? I won&#x27;t go into details, but I will say that, despite needing to take a break from my masochistic spa day, I am feeling much more optimistic about someday tossing the old triple-blade razor!! The little light does help with the super fine hairs, and this thing DOES find the really, really short ones. I even showed my hubby (and, God love him, he pretended he cared) the root of a very, very short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to hair-free days. Or, at the very least, less hairy days! I strongly recommend this product, and I&#x27;ve only owned it for 8 hours!!ES find the really, really short ones. I even showed my hubby (and, God love him, he pretended he cared) the root of a very, very short hair.    Here&#x27;s to hair-free days. Or, at the very least, less hairy days! I strongly recommend this product, and I&#x27;ve only owned it for 8 hours!!</li>
    <li> I use this one as a shaver only and I love it. I know others who use it as an epilator and they say it&#x27;s very nice for sensitive skin. I recommend it for both epilating and shaving delicate areas.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for myself off Amazon last December.  Used it a few times, and then had to stop--the shift from shaving to epilating created a GIGANTIC ingrown hair (!) problem.  It&#x27;s been over a year since I bought the machine, and about 8 months since I stopped using it.  I still have healing areas on my legs which are red and angry, and severe scarring--lots of discolored white areas that I&#x27;m worried won&#x27;t return to skin color.  I don&#x27;t know if I have extra sensitive skin or something (would be news to me) but SERIOUSLY consider if the risk is worth it before buying this!  I was excited to save money/hassle, but now I&#x27;m embarrassed to wear shorts.  I regret using this.</li>
    <li> Love this product but I still miss the hair on the knees. Have to take time to get every little hair.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It removes even the shortest hairs and fast!  I had an epilator before buying this one, but I found that it was very loud and not very good at pulling out the little hairs.  I also didn&#x27;t like its speed.  All these issues were resolved with my new Silk-epil.  I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to either upgrade from an older model or who might be thinking of getting their first epilator.    The first time you use an epilator it WILL hurt, but after just one time the pain is non-existent and the results last a very long time.  If you consider shaving/waxing your legs a chore like I do, get this product.  You will more than get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this epilator.  the light is a helpful extra feature.  I used it for my legs and it worked great. It pulled all hairs pretty efficiently.  I also used this epilator on my bikini area and it was extremely painful.  this is the 3rd epilator I&#x27;ve owned and this one has been the most painful to use on my bikini area.  I think I am going to buy one of the previous epilator brands that I owned which was much more gentler on my bikini area.  However, I will keep using this epilator for my legs.  It works great on the legs.</li>
    <li> good epilator. it does not hurt if you are used to epilators. the probleme is that it cuts some hair instead of pulling them out by the roots.And the rasor does not cut very well.</li>
    <li> I had an older model that \\&quot;gave up the qhost\\&quot;! I bought this as a replacement.     It goes much faster (I use the slower speed on my underarms &amp; bikini area). The biggest improvement is the \\&quot;head light\\&quot;!! It really helps see those hairs, which I might otherwise miss (or contort my body to try to see)!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with the good aspects of this product. First of all, it really does grab a lot of the hair and the bright light does show the fine hairs. The shaver attachment works really good except I hate that it needs to constantly be plugged in to work. I like the design of it, it fits easily in the hand and looks nice. Now for the bad...the so called massaging rollers are actually little tiny spikes that feel almost like they&#x27;re scratching, oh and as everyone knows...pulling hair out DOES HURT like hell and the body parts you use it on will get irritated...as with any epilator, but there are ways to minimize this problem. The braun 5270 does grab most of the hairs, especially the thick ones, but sadly, some of the fine hairs were left behind and some of the other hairs broke in half. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I own this product, however, if I would&#x27;ve tried before I bought, I wouldnt have bought it for as much as it is.&lt;br /&gt;BTW never used an epilator before, but I have waxed.</li>
    <li> It works very well and leaves you with a smooth skin for many weeks. It was very painful for the first time. I liked it a lot and its definitely better than shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African-American woman with dark, noticeable hair on my arms, legs and so on. I bought this on a lark for $40 when Amazon had it as part of a Gold Box promotion.  Waxing was too expensive and shaving was too time-consuming and inconvenient.  I had never epilated before and some of the reviews scared me.  I tried it and immediately thought, \\&quot;what in the world was I thinking?!\\&quot;  It hurt like you-know-what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few tries, this is what I&#x27;ve learned.  You really do have to shave first with the accompanying razor.  The hair on my legs was visible, but not really long.  BUT THE LONGER THE HAIR IS, THE MORE IT HURTS! So shave first, then epilate, then keep epilating every few days or as needed.  Also, don&#x27;t give up if you see hair in a day or two.  As another reviewer explained, you&#x27;ve got thousands of little pores/follicles on your skin and hair grows at different rates.  So just because you see hair on your legs two days after you epilated does NOT mean it&#x27;s the same pore/follicle from before.  Keep doing it and you&#x27;ll achieve uniformity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I was initially ready to pack up this epilator and send it back, I now can epilate in areas I NEVER thought I&#x27;d even try.  The result is smooth, hairless skin, just in time for the spring and summer. The product works very well and the light is a nice feature to see the really fine hairs.  The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish it was quieter.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of waxing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for over three months, at first it was painful and still is painful but more tolerable, the down side to this epilator and i must say a very serious down side are the ingrown hairs.  I have gotten allot of them on my upper leg.  So if you can find another product to do the same thing without the ingrown hairs part, good job.</li>
    <li> I love watching the hair fly off my skin and feeling the incredibly smooth after effects. I like watching the hair fly out by the root so much I hardly notice the pain. (well, most of the time anyway). I use the epillator everywhere except my legs and I never feel disappointed. I would highly recommend using it every day though. A couple of days off and you&#x27;ll be sure to feel it.</li>
    <li> So let me preface this by making a confession. I am 28 years old. Ever since a boy teased me WAY back in 8th grade about fuzzy sideburns, I have been shaving my face. The unfortunately part is that in hindsight, I really never did have a facial hair problem back then but you know how kids can be! After daily shaving of my sideburns, chin, and partial neck, it would grow back prickly and some even dark. I had to keep it up and became a prisoner to shaving. About 4 years ago, I bit the bullet and paid for laser hair removal. This cost me nearly 1000 dollars, and was VERY painful (even though they tell you that it is not.) Because my facial hair is light and I have very fair skin, this did little to nothing even after a year and a half of treatments! I went back to shaving and just gave up thinking this was something I&#x27;d just make part of my daily routing on vacations, at home, etc. THAT IS until I decided to buy this a few weeks ago. I used it on my face the evening after I did my morning shave, and it removed a LOT of hair. Not really painful either! I thought my legs hurt WAY more. I did NOT shave the following morning, and repeated this for three days. I am completely hair free, folks!!! It has been over 3 weeks and I still am hair free! The only hair that is coming back is super fine and light. This thing is a god send, it really is. I recommend that anyone that is worried about facial hair try this thing out. It may hurt slightly at first, but it is nothing compared to laser and the results are SO worth any discomfort. I am so glad I finally found my answer. I can&#x27;t wait until our next tropical vacation where I&#x27;m not a slave to the razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this Epilator in 2010 and have it to this day. It has a wide head and is sturdy, unlike its newer conterparts that have a narrow head and take longer to remove hair. The cable stays IN during the usage and never falls out which is not the case with Silk Epil 5. The only surpise about this product is:in 2010 iit cost me 60$ and now it costs $99!</li>
    <li> The first epilator I purchased wasn&#x27;t a Braun.  I thought it was okay--I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  Then a few years ago, I purchased a Braun epilator from Amazon.com and I really liked it, but this one is even better!</li>
    <li> Okay, even though I gave this product five stars, I have to admit that I struggled between 4 and 5. I really like the Epilator. The light on it is very helpful, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. But for it to be completely effective, you really have to be dedicated and patient. Here are some tips: &lt;br /&gt;1. WAIT. I don&#x27;t care how excited you are to use it... if your leg hairs aren&#x27;t long enough (2-5mm)... it will just get most of them, and then you&#x27;ll be using it for days and obsessing over every little hair on your leg. &lt;br /&gt;2. Expect ingrown hairs. How do you deal with them? Take a razor and shave in the same direction as hair growth. THEN epilate. Otherwise, it&#x27;s recommended that you take a warm bath before epilating and/or spread lotion on your legs afterward to avoid the ingrown hairs. &lt;br /&gt;3. Epilating your armpits is completely worth it. If you find yourself wondering why the hell you&#x27;re putting your poor pits through such agony, think: you&#x27;ll never feel this pain again, because next time, the hair will be much lighter and that won&#x27;t even be for at least three weeks. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m so happy that my boyfriend found the idea of an epilator and showed it to me, because now, every time I get in the shower, I don&#x27;t think, \\&quot;darn, I haven&#x27;t shaved in a while. I should really shave, but I don&#x27;t have the time,\\&quot; and regret it later.</li>
    <li> No more waxing arms and legs.. this takes care of it. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made this year.</li>
    <li> I was really afraid of using this at first but you get used to it pretty quick and it is so fast and easy, and it&#x27;s not a hassle like waxing. The amount of hair growing is also decreasing so it beats shaving. And, the product is cute too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same epilator from Braun over 13 years, before this one.  I thought change it because I had problems with the power cord of the old one.  The new epilator works really fast, comparing with my old one, but it cuts my hair not from the root sometimes, so hair grows faster.  The old epilator had a system that you select the hair thickness so it won&#x27;t tear it up. I will use the new one to see if I can correct this problem using it more frecuently, so hair doesn&#x27;t grow to much and the epilator don&#x27;t tear it.  But braun epilators are very durable, like I told I had my first one over 13 years, and my second one is this one.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product becauase I was getting tired of waxing. &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t believe it would actually get rid of the hair, but after reading so many reviews I decided to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt;Works best everywhere but the bikini area (it grows too fast there and leaves like a dark shade, since it doesn&#x27;t really pull the hair from the root)...but is great for facial hair, underarms, etc... &lt;br /&gt;As an advice: try it after waxing!once your hair in thinner and short, otherwise it would hurt too much! &lt;br /&gt;The light device is excellent!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd epilator, so I have a bit of experience with them.  I chose this one because my first one was not up to par for the underarms.  It simply would NOT work for underarms.  This one not only works for the underarms - if you can stand the pain - but does a good job on them.  Note that you may have to run it up &amp; down and then try left &amp; right to get the job done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Legs - GREAT job.  The first time I did the legs with the roller attachment and it worked good.  I&#x27;ve epilated enough times that my legs don&#x27;t hurt when doing this, so I tried it without the roller and was pleasantly surprised.  It noticably cut the time required to finish - probably by about 25%.  The roller is nice for the first few times, as you get used to the feeling and also reduce your hair to a more manageable level.  Once you are used to it and have less hair, remove the roller for speed.</li>
    <li> I tried epilator couple of years ago and screamed in pain. Now, 2 years later and many waxings later, it&#x27;s not bad at all. Maybe it&#x27; because of the technology, maybe I&#x27;m used to pain. Anyhow, I can&#x27;t say much bad about this Silk-epil, except maybe it&#x27;s takes longer to remove the hair than waxing. But then again, I have used it only once and I may not know how to use it properly. Great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Another good thing that it picks up shorter hair that waxing does. And it&#x27;s much, much cheaper! :-)</li>
    <li> I have just finished using this product and  I am so enthusiastic I want to tell how great it is. Well I was already familiar with Braun Silk Epil products, I have owned two previous versions, but this is by far the best ever. The smart light feature is one of the best adds they could put, as it really heps seeing hairs in spots that would be impossible to find. The thing that amazed me the most though is the extreme quickness of this new version; it really does its job in half of the time and NO PAIN! I am greatly satisfied. The price is by far the best around too, this babe sells for 89 Euro were I am from, which is more than $110.00, so it is really a steal. My advice is GET IT NOW!</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying I have never waxed before only shaved and IT WILL HURT.  It took me 2 days to do my entire legs the first time.  I had to work in small sections quickly moving it over my leg several times until I had most of the hair gone then it became more tolerable to keep going over the same area until I got all the hairs.  You have to go over it in different directions to get all the hairs.  Once I made it through that initial torture, I have fallen in love with it.  Every couple days I zip over my legs with only a little picking and voila I have smooth legs again. Even in between my legs don&#x27;t feel as stubbly as they did between shaving. I even love the fact that it comes with an electrical razor attachment to do my underarms and bikini line without the irritation of shaving. It is worth the pain of the first time.  With summer coming up I&#x27;m excited about not having to shave as often .</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  No need to shave every few days and no need to for messy and costly waxing!  Totally worth the money.  It wasn&#x27;t painful to use it on my legs, but the underarms were more painful than waxing.  At least waxing is painful, but quick.  But epilating takes more time and hurts quite a bit.  Overall, I am so happy with it.  I wish I had gotten it years ago!</li>
    <li> Much improved over the old one I have. Quick ship and excellent product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that this is not painful because it is. It really hurts!! I have never used an epilator before and used it for the first time today and it did hurt a lot. It was bearable though. I had to take a lot of breaks. I did it while watching TV. It does get all the little hairs too. I am definitely happy with the results and so I am happy with this purchase, but I only gave it 3 stars since it does hurt a lot!! I look forward to doing it again next time - since I hear it does not hurt as much the more you do it. Will update after the second time.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have owned this now for over a year now and I definitely recommend this to everyone. It gets less painful the more you use it and it leaves your body hair free and so soft. You definitely have to exfoliate regularly to prevent ingrown hairs. If you go a long period of time with out using this though, and switch to razors, the first time you use it again will be just as painful as the very first time! I definitely love this product and what it does for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month.  It&#x27;s my first time epilating, and I was also afraid of the pain, but other than a slight occasional pinch when it pulls the longer hair, the pain is neglible.  That little pain is well worth it compared to the smoothness and time my legs stay hairless.  I used Nair first and then epilated as the hair grew back over the next week so that I eased into it. I dropped the roller head and went to the small guard on the 2nd time. It works better that way. The only drawback, which is why 4 stars not 5, is that it doesn&#x27;t work as well on underarms for me. You have to keep the epilator at a 90 degree angle to your skin and that&#x27;s very difficult with a body part that curves and has hair growing in 2 different directions. I have to use the roller head when I do my underarms, without it the epilator grabs skin, and it just doesn&#x27;t get the hair as well. I&#x27;ve used the regular shaver also.  It works, but it&#x27;s just like any other shaver.  I&#x27;ve yet to try bikini line, but probably will once I get the underarm part down.</li>
    <li> It is wanderfuuuuuuuuuuuuuul! i love it....it has pain but after useing it for a year..you can never use other methods becuase you keep thinking what a stupped way!!!</li>
    <li> It truly removes hair so it does what it is suppose to do; you do have to go over the skin more than one time for it to fully work though. It is a bit noisy, like I couldn&#x27;t use it in the middle of the night without annoying my apartment neighbors. And it is also a bit painful even when I use the top that is suppose to be less painful, despite the description. Still it is way less messy than wax and much cheaper because I don&#x27;t have to buy refills for it or anything.</li>
    <li> Great product, picks up even the tinest finest hairs and the darkest coarse hair.... would recommend it for anyone</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator 3 weeks ago &amp; absolutely love it!  It earned a 4 star rating for one tiny reason - you have to plug it in, there isn&#x27;t a rechargable battery.  Other than that, it is fantastic.  I was always afraid of epilators because of the idea that it rips your hair out from the root.  Then I realized that it probably wouldn&#x27;t be any worse than getting waxed.  I was right, it&#x27;s actually far less painful than getting waxed (and far less expensive).  I don&#x27;t have to use the epilator as often as I would have to shave.  I love the little light - it really helps me to see what I&#x27;m doing.  I would definitely recommend this epilator.  It&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This is a tough sacrifice for vanity and an alternative to shaving and chemicals, I have sensitive skin and bail-wire hair. This is a great, natural alternative to chemical products and razor burn. Get ready to bite on a bullet.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for a ton of different epilators, I added this one to my amazon wishlist and promptly forgot about it.  I was looking at Target, saw it in the aisle, and decided to get it.  This is the only negative thing I have to say, that I got it there and not here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now I&#x27;ve been a shaver.  I tried waxing once and decided the mess was too much of a hassle.  I was nervous about using an epilator, because of other people&#x27;s claims of how much it hurt, but I was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t very painful at all.  About the same as, or less painful than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice on my legs so far, and the first time gave me red bumps, which went away after putting some cold lotion on.  I&#x27;ve only used the epilator attatchment with the spinning massage heads though, and only on my legs, because I&#x27;m not that brave.  The shaver head that it comes with works also works very well for areas that may be too sensitive (or that you&#x27;re too chicken) to pull hair from.  The light on it is awesome for spotting rogue hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few passes to get everything, but I know for myself, I wasn&#x27;t able to wax an area just once and have all the hair gone, so this isn&#x27;t too big a pain for me.  It also only uses an AC adapter for power, which might make it inconvenient for travel, but works fine for me.</li>
    <li> After hearing so many great reviews (and reading them online as well) I decided to buy the Silk Epil. It definitely hurts for the first few times you use it, but then the pain lessens, and it is highly effective at removing hair. I was thrilled with the results at first, but after a few weeks I started getting ingrown hair, which has never been a problem for me before. I bought a \\&quot;Bump removing\\&quot; lotion, which helped a bit to lessen the ingrowns, but I ultimately stopped using this product because of the hassle of trying to deal with this problem. too bad-- it is a great product, and I was so happy to not be balancing on one foot in the shower anymore, trying to shave! I may try it again, but it was an expensive product, and ultimately not worth the trouble for me. OH-- and I don&#x27;t recommend it for bikini line: It is WAY to painful for that!</li>
    <li> i used the emjoi epilator with two heads and this cannot beat that product.More effort in same job now.The extra covers for skin massage and trimming are unnecessary.The light feature is good. 3 stars because it serves the purpose.</li>
    <li> I use to have one of the original epilators and it finally died....this new one is so much lighter and the light in it makes it so easy...If I knew how good this was I would have replaced my old one sooner.</li>
    <li> I am not going to rehash what everyone else has said about this product.  Yes, it is painful at first, but does get better over time. Also, you have to be a masochist to do your bikini line or underarms with this product.  That said, it does what it is supposed to and leaves everything smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.    My main complaint is that the Type # isn&#x27;t specified.  Yes, you do receive the Silk Epil Xelle Model 5270, but the type # is 5395 (at least that is what arrived at my door).  This seems to be an older, or out of country model.  Braun has no information listed on their website about this this particular product (with same Model &amp; type number).  Their newer Type numbers come with more attachments (including one for your face and smaller areas).    DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE/CHIN: you will likely rip off skin as oposed to hair.  I am currently trying to contact Braun to ask if they offer alternate head attachments for this product.</li>
    <li> Not exactly painless, but much, much better than the epilator i had in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first because of the reviews talking about the extreme pain it caused them. When I first opened it up and plugged in the device, the loud noise it makes is very daunting. But to my surprise, it was not that bad. It&#x27;s bark is definitely worse than its bite. I had some long hairs one my legs that I neglected from waxing, and so first I used the shaver attachment. My legs felt all gross and stubly which I havent experienced in a long time. I then got to work on my legs, and it feels like a slight stinging sensation. Waxing is way more painful than this, and the upside is you don&#x27;t get the stuble from shaving. I recommend holding your skin taut, to ease any discomfort you might experience and for god&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t epilate on long hair because then it is going to hurt.....badly.I would recommend this to everyone who is sick of shaving and the ingrown hairs and the messiness and pain of shaving. I love my new epilator. The head with the massaging rollers isnt going to get the very short hairs. For those you are going to need the advanced head. But overall, the best method for hair removal I have used. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This epilator is the best I ever had.  It keeps the pain low and it works very very well.  I love the different attachements that make it easier as well.  Really easy to clean and use.</li>
    <li> This thing is a torture device if you body hair is any stronger than a down. It is very effective though if you can sustain the torture it takes to depilate yourself. There is a risk of damaging yourself mentally, as the pain is unbearable :-)</li>
    <li> I got this epilator almost 2 years ago, and I use it every so often to see if it&#x27;ll magically work for me.  Two years later, still no luck.  I got it to use on my legs and I was so disappointed with the results.  I followed the instructions exactly, but it still only broke the hairs instead of removing it completely from the root (I can tell because I can&#x27;t see the rounded root of the hair it ripped out).  I wasn&#x27;t left with smooth results at all, even after doing it several days in a row.  It really is painful, but you&#x27;re ripping hair out, so that should be expected and has nothing to do with my rating.  I just couldn&#x27;t get this to work for me.  It&#x27;s a shame because it was extremely expensive.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if anybody has any tips in case I&#x27;m somehow doing this wrong, please respond to this review.  Again, this was really expensive and I hate to waste money.</li>
    <li> This epilator is a dream come true. Now I don&#x27;t have to spend all that money on waxing. It is better and the results lasts longer than shaving. I highly recommend it. Of course it misses an occasional very short hair or two but they are not obvious and can be caught if you hover over that spot.</li>
    <li> After I read so many product reviews, I decided to get this epilator. I have a few good and bad things about this epilator, but mostly good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;It gets most of my hair, so I&#x27;m practically hairless&lt;br /&gt;The light helps me see the hair I missed&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt! I&#x27;m asian and we have soft hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Saves time from plucking manually&lt;br /&gt;Pulls by its roots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;It rolls over some hair if the hair is flat</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews, and I alot on here I decided to give this one a shot. My friends used epilators to great succuess and endorsed them but I just was worried how much it would hurt. I have waxed before and in some rather sensitive areas. I think the first time I used an epilator I was expecting it to not be so bad, but it was painful. To the point I had to break it up over a couple hours before I got both my legs done. However, my legs were so much smoother and the results definatly lasted longer then any cream or shaving. So I kept using it, and the second time I did used it, it wasnt nearly so bad. I was able to do it without any serious discomfort. Honestly I think it is much less painful now, I even had the courage to deal with the bikini area! I only have had to use one of the two heads, and I have really liked the fact it has a shaving head I can use too. Overal I am very happy with my choice in this epilator and to be honest it was worth the price to give it a try. At worst it doesnt cost more then a professional waxing session, and at best you love it and dont have to buy anymore razors!</li>
    <li> I previously owned  Phillips Satinelle epilator and thought it was very good. It worked for me for years until wear off, and time to get a new one. I also tried Kenwood \\&quot;Emjoi\\&quot; model, and it wasn&#x27;t taking most of hear out.  After some research, and reading reviews, I got this epilator about a month ago and it was the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It saves a lot of time, and I thought it&#x27;s not too painful even with other epilators, but with this one no pain at all even under arms. I didn&#x27;t try the roller attachment, just didn&#x27;t need to, it&#x27;s probably only for the first time users. The light feature id great, and the best of all I can do it for probably for 1/3 of the time that it use to take me with my old epilator. If anybody looking for epilator, for the first time, of replace the old one- this model is the one to buy. It worth every penny.</li>
    <li> this products works great,  it takes a little getting used to but the more you use it the less pain you feel.  It works great on the underarms makes the hair finer each time so it isn&#x27;t so noticeable when it does grow back.     The longer you stick with it the finer the hair gets.</li>
    <li> I recieved this in the mail yesterday and was looking forward to usinig it on my arm pits and bikini area (full Brazillian minus the testies, that will get a razor!).  I was a slave to the razor each day.  I love the smooth feeling after shaving pits and bikini area.  This Braun epilator was great at removing almost all of the hairs with some discomfort. I have painstakingly plucked them out before with a pair of tweezers but what a waste of time to do each week.  I will report back soon with an update of how this works on my armpits.  I will also report back on my results on the Brazillian.  Jan 23,  Wow, I used this on my armpits and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  I think that the fold at my leg and grion was more sensitive to this removing the hairs.  I used the slow mode on my grion but used the faster mode on my arm pits.  You can look at my picture of the just shaved pits.  A little redness but no hair!  I have a few areas of stubble in my groin and abdominal area.  I am going to wait until they grow out and then use this to rid them from my body!  Aril 10    I have now taken off the massage head and now use only the advanced head.  This still is such a great way to remove hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove facial hair for a longer length of time.  It causes a little pain but its worth it not to be pulling out hair or shaving or using creams. This has been a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> I have used epilady products for years and was disappointed with the most recent product.  This epilator is excellent, works efficiently, and is as close to painless as this type of system can be.</li>
    <li> My friend had shown this product to me and since then, i was tempted to buy this product. it really works smooth on your skin.Good one for a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Directions are easy to understand and  article is easy to use.  I love this epilator.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Braun leg shaver for my wife.  She has used a similar product for years and she is very pleased with the one by Braun we just bought through Amazon.    Jack Abad</li>
    <li> I bought this machine for my wife....   and here is her review:      \\&quot;A good machine....  although it is almost the same as the previous versions.....   all the extra features are almost useless....  the lamp... the clipper head...  they don&#x27;t add anything to the original machine....   and the most important is that..........  the pain is the same....!!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I used to have an older version of this Braun Silk epil, which I used for 4 years. But after those 4 years of intense use, it was just time to change it. I went for this model, which turned out to be even greater. I am very pleased. I use it twice a week to keep my under arms hair-free. I also use it to get rid of most of my pubic hair, and it works great. Being a long time consumer of this type of product I am used to the pulling sensation of the tweezer, over the years the hair grows thiner and softer and it gets pulled very easily and pain free. If you have never used a similar system to depilate yourself, expect some pain, but if you can handle it the first couple of times, it will soon be almost painless. I highly recommend this product. I even take it with me on my trips.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty high pain tolerance but this thing hurts like nothing else. It moves waay too fast - I think if I had more control over the speed I might be able to deal with it better but there isn&#x27;t that option. I think I&#x27;ll stick with shaving.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have any complaints other than the fact that it&#x27;s loud &amp; the hair needs to be cleaned out often.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s quick, not very painful, &amp; does a good job!</li>
    <li> i recently got this epilator. i&#x27;ve never used one before, but i have tried waxing. i dont have much luck with trying to wax myself, and i especially hate having to grow it out long enough to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have 2 tattoos..and this hardly compared to the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gave it four stars because of all the attachments...its kinda overwhelming, but i&#x27;m sure after i get familliar with it, it won&#x27;t be a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it comes with massaging head, a trimmer and a convenience attatchment for people who are used to it, a cord and a bag that holds everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also...it has a pretty color! lol. the spotlight is not optional. it kinda reminds me of the light on a vacuum cleaner.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product, I had high expectations. For years now, I&#x27;ve been using an old Braun epilator that I really loved. It was effective that it pulled my hair from the roots and didn&#x27;t not leave any hair behind. I thought this new Braun epilator would be better. But when I tried it, it wasn&#x27;t able to pull my hair from the roots. Hence, it left a lot of hair still. I didn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;totally clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;totally hairless\\&quot; feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> The product works just as advertised.  I like the versatility of a being able to use it as a razor for my underarms, as well as an epilator for my legs.  I did not find the epilator to be a painful experience.</li>
    <li> This epilator is the best I&#x27;ve owned.  It removes hair quickly and the light helps to make sure you don&#x27;t miss any hair.  Like all epilator there is the slight pulling sensation, but, frankly after nearly 10 years of using one it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.  Good for legs and bikini area.</li>
    <li> I had the Emjoy and it is trying to die so I bought the Braun due to all of the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Emjoy better. It does a better job and I use it for legs, underarms and face.</li>
    <li> My friend reccomended me this item and I am also fully satisfied with the product.  High quality, long lasting, very effective for underarms(Dont use it for first time, Wax once and then before proper growth, if u use this, it is very effective to maintain)</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me since I like waxing and this would save me $$$ in waxing products. I am used to wax my bikini area and legs, but not my armpits (I shave my armpits).     As soon as I got this, I took a warm shower and exfoliate the areas I was going to use this product. I used it on my bikini area and it worked really nice as if I had waxed. The pain was horrible; it was worst than waxing. However, it was a bearable pain. Now, when I started using it under my arms, ooooooouchhhhhhh!!! It hurts like nothing else. It was very painful, but I managed to finish the job under both arms. It took me over 30 mins to do everything because I was taking deep breaths and taking breaks as well. I didn&#x27;t have a chance to do my legs like I wanted too because I was burning under my arms. It is next day and my armpits are still red and still has some hair in it. I guess I will wait a few days to get back under my arms with the epilator. I will try getting my legs done tonight.     It is not a bad product. You just need to learn how to use it and bear the pain. My friend made a good point about all this. She said using the epilator in my bikini area didn&#x27;t hurt much because I am used to waxing that area and the hair is not so thick. Now, under my arms, the hair was thicker from shaving and therefore the pain was greater. Also, if you stretch your skin as you move the epilator, the pain is also minimal.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Silk-epil X&#x27;elle at the end of June after reading many of the reviews on Amazon for this product for about 3 weeks. I decided to take the plunge and buy it, since it got such high ratings. Now, had I reviewed this product within the first week of using it, I probably would have rated it 4 stars, but I figured that in the effort of fairness, I would try it out for a full month. I have rated it a total of 3 stars -- here is a breakdown of the positives and negatives I&#x27;ve encountered thus far. Keep in mind that this is the first time I have ever epilated. I am not a waxer and while I occasionally plucked with tweezers, this is the first time I have removed hair by the roots a lot at a time.     The positives:   - The light! It was not a major selling point at the time I purchased it, but it is extremely handy. Even when I have the bathroom lights on, it can be hard to see the hairs on my legs (and I&#x27;m brunette) so this came in really handy.   - It&#x27;s not painful on the legs. Even the bikini line is tolerable, but after trying out my underarms, I know that I&#x27;ll just stick to my legs.   - It lasts about 1.5 weeks. I LOVE that I don&#x27;t have to shave every couple of days.     So even though I have a long list of negatives, I probably would still buy this (but just barely) for the price I paid of $58.43. I wish I knew if some of the cheaper epilators would have gotten the job done for less, but it&#x27;s too late for that now... so here is my list of negatives:     The negatives:   - It is very loud. I have two young kids and it is so loud that I would only consider epilating when they are not sleeping or taking naps.   - The massaging roller clip. To me it is awkward and doesn&#x27;t prevent any more pain than the efficiency clip.   - The shaver attachment. I am really disappointed with this one. Before I purchased this item, I justified my purchase by thinking that if I couldn&#x27;t handle epilating, at least I would have an electric shaver which I had been thinkingabout getting anyway. When I found that epilating my underarms was a little too painful for me, I tried using the shaver attachment. It doesn&#x27;t shave as quickly or effortlessly like I had hoped. In order to shave my underarms closely, I really had to press the shaver attachment onto the skin in quick, repetitive movements. It is SO much easier to just use a disposable razor for my underarms.   - Ingrown hairs. At first, I didn&#x27;t see any, but after 1.5 weeks, I started noticing that quite a few hairs were becoming ingrown. When I used to shave with a disposable razor, I never had this problem. In order to get the ingrown hairs out, I have had to break my skin and pluck them out. This then tends to leave a tiny scab that takes about a week to heal. This means that although my legs are mostly hairless, I have little scabs on them that make it look like I was attacked by mosquitos.   - The need to go over the same area more than once. I read the directions and held the epilator as it recommended, but I still find myself going over the same area usually at least twice. This doesn&#x27;t annoy me too much.   - I wish this was cordless. I knew it was corded, but realized that it would be so much nicer if this could be cordless with a rechargable battery. That would allow the flexibility of shaving wherever, and not necessarily where there is a power outlet.   - I also wish that there was a way of it storing the hair that it pulls out so that I could then clean the unit easily. Instead, the hairs it pulls out end up wherever -- the floor, my legs, or the unit itself.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it does exactly what is says it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I was sick and tired of having those dark shadows on my underarms from shaving so I decided to give this a try.  I didn&#x27;t want to wait forever to have the hair grow out to get it waxed.  I&#x27;ve used this product 5 times over the last few weeks and it works very, very well.  However, IT HURTS!  My husband has to do it, because I can&#x27;t.  Each time it has become a little easier, but it still hurts.  Keep in mind it&#x27;s like 40 tweezers spinning at rapid speed ripping the hair out of the most sensitive part of your body by the root, it&#x27;s going to hurt just a little.  Be prepared, buy the cream too.</li>
    <li> After reading dozens of reviews on this product, I decided to try it out.  After an hour, I got as far as my knees, and couldn&#x27;t go any further because it really hurt, and the process took so long to try and get all the hairs.  The worst part wasn&#x27;t the hair being ripped out... the worst part was the month of insane itching after using it on my legs -to the point of scarring (and yes, I did moisturize everynight).  I was going to return the product, but decided to give it another shot.  So, the second use, still itchy, but by the third use, which was done this week... my legs are for the most part itch-free.  Also, I still have to shave on top of using this product as the little hairs aren&#x27;t picked up, and I want to be smooth.  So, it may be cheaper to just stick to a razor.</li>
    <li> 9/8/08: after reading all the great reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;ve used it under my arms and on my legs and I absolutely love it! When I first turned it on, I was really scared because of the sound and the fast moving teeth things but it really isn&#x27;t that bad. If you&#x27;ve been waxed before, this is no more painful than that and way cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;10/11/08: This doesn&#x27;t get my legs silky smooth so I will go back to shaving for my legs.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because my hairs are thinner now so they&#x27;re breaking instead of being pulled out by the root... but i miss that smooth feeling. I still love using this under my arms and i&#x27;ve even started using it on my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten bikini waxes before so this isn&#x27;t bad at all. it took some getting used to because i was scared (who wouldn&#x27;t be??).. but now that i&#x27;ve done it a few times, it&#x27;s waaaay better than waxing!!! i did start getting a few ingrown hairs but found that tendskin works great for that (see my tendskin review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;4/1/09: I&#x27;ve still been using this every week. I use it on my bikini area and it seems that it&#x27;s not working as well as before. I think it&#x27;s breaking some of the hair instead of pulling it out because I need to do this about once a week (still beats paying for waxing). Also, I&#x27;ve noticed I get fewer ingrown hairs so I think my skin is getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the hairs are thinner, the epilator isn&#x27;t catching them as well so they&#x27;re breaking. I&#x27;ve decided to alternate this and shaving because shaving is quicker. But what&#x27;s nice is that my hairs are thinner and lighter so if I miss a shave or don&#x27;t epilate for a week, it&#x27;s not too noticeable (doesn&#x27;t feel prickly and doesn&#x27;t look hairy).</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator, and it&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had it for a few years, but I&#x27;ve been too intimidated to use more than the shaver attachment until recently. Let me say that it&#x27;s fantastic! It does hurt...especially the first time you use it. I&#x27;ve never waxed or epilated before, so my hair was pretty thick and coarse, and it took a long time to get it all out. However, I did my calves about two weeks ago, and the hair is just now starting to come back in. I used it tonight to get rid of the little hairs that were starting to grow back, and it didn&#x27;t really hurt at all! The rollers that are on one of the epilating attachments really help to numb your skin and make epilating less painful. I think this product is fantastic--it fits nicely in my hand, the built in light helps me see all the little hairs, the bonus shaver attachment is great--it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This will pull hait out. Randomly it will do so. That way you have to go over the same spot over and over. OUCH!    Very painfull way to pull hair out. I would rather use electrolysis as it will finish it to the root. This won&#x27;t kill the folicle. And the pain isn&#x27;t worth it.    The trimer works great, and the shaver get&#x27;s things very smooth. Very handy for that. If you don&#x27;t mind the maintenance it does a good job for the price.    However, if you want to get rid of the hair, you can find home versions of electolysis that are comparable, even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Braun fan and probably bought the first model made.  After 12+ years, the port for the plug finally gave out and I decided to try the newer model.  I can&#x27;t assess pain, because I have a high pain tolerance and have never had any problem with tweezing.    I love the newer look, and it is SO MUCH better at pulling the hairs.  Where the old model I had to go over the area a few times to get all the hair, I only have to do 1-2 swipes to get everything.      The light is ok for just seeing the area in front of where your going, but is distracting for seeing a larger area overall.  But if you just use good lighting or sunlight, then you don&#x27;t need the light and it fades away in the background.    The only downside, is that the plastic head (that clicks over the top of the rollers to keep them from directly contacting your skin)is not very secure and pops off if you press too firmly.  I hope they will \\&quot;fix\\&quot; this in the next model, but I&#x27;ve learned how to skim lightly so it works fine.  I LOVE BRAUN!</li>
    <li> I have used an earlier version of Braun before, and this one was just so much more sophisticated. The smartlight is a wonderful feature. I used it for my hands and both hands were done in about 15 minutes. There is pain, but not much. I first used the massaging rollers option, then switched to the faster epilation- this is really good and tweezes very small hair too!     I havent used the opti-trim attachment yet, and dont think I will dare to use the epilator on the underarm area. Another plus is that it works across 110-250 volts, so there is no need for a voltage converter if you are a globe trotter. It is best that you use this product once in 10 days to remain virtually hair free.     The time consuming part is cleaning the tweezers with alcohol once youre done using it. Wish there was a dip or something that could magically get rid of all bacteria!  Overall, a good investment- A very good, quick epilator for the legs, arms and bikini line. Leaves your skin much smoother than shaving and regrowth takes time too!</li>
    <li> I was spending a ridiculous amount of time working on my legs with my old Epilady.  Based on these reviews, I got this one and I have been extremely pleased.  For me, this is painless, though I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years and this one gets even the tiniest hairs.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]    ok so im the hairiest girl in town - haha but this thing rocks! im on a system allready I do maintenance once every other day or so and then once for the entire thing about a week - some times I can go for 4 days without use - but like i said im preaty hairy.  I just use alcohol on the brush to wipe down the hair puller outers &amp; that works great.  I had to use some major ib prophen 800 mg for the first time &amp; get my head into the game but now it dosent bother me so much (I think because there was so much hair to be removed the first time it was a bit overwhelming)- what i love about this is that my bikini line (allways had to use shorts for swimming) like hardly ever grows back compaired to me shaving once a day on that stuff - soo clean so smooth &amp; the pits are wonderful to deal with (again first time was insaine but no big now)my product was complete worked great &amp; im thinking of buying one or two more just incase - mind you i would be buying the gillette machwhatever razors for days &amp; everyday would have to do the rutine - sick of that happy for this! would have used this in highschool if I knew any better! happy trails &amp; good luck</li>
    <li> For the first time using this PLEASE take some pain reliever before hand or something cause its going to sting a bit... once you do it once, the hairs come back wayyy thinner and softer... and it does not sting hardly at all... I know - seriously I had godzilla legs before this... i would shave and literally the same day get a shadow/ stubble... arrghh!! Now just as product says, hair is gone for weeks... when it does grow back it is fine and soft...sometimes i dont notice and I have to do a quick run through because the hairs that grow back are so much thinner its hard to feel them...  Additional suggestion sometimes if hair grows a little ingrown, you may need to use an exfoliating scrub.. i did this as well and my legs stay hair free and soft like just shaved for weeks.. and yah... loud like other reviewers said but its an epilator hellooooo and who cares it works well and is very reliable.    update i bought this in 2009... well its 2010... unit is still working and legs are still non-godzilla status... still love it and will never shave again...</li>
    <li> This thing is really loud! I think it&#x27;s seriously damaging my hearing. But it seems to work pretty well. The one problem spot I have is my knees. I think the hair grows in a bunch of different directions so I have to keep switching the position of the epilator. It hurt pretty bad the first time I used it, and the inner knee area is still the most sensitive spot to epilate. But it&#x27;s gets easier. I like the light on the front of it. It helps a lot. And I like the regular shaver attachment that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I borrowed this from one of my friends.  I was skeptical at first.  She had told me how it hurts and how it wasn&#x27;t picking up her hair (she has fine hair).  I let my hair grow out for about 3 weeks.  When I first started, it did hurt, but after a little bit, I got used to it.  You do have to take little breaks, but after rubbing your skin for a minute, it feels better.  Make sure you start out with the massaging head.  It does make a difference!  I had to shave after I used it, but its been 3 days and I have absolutely no stubble.  The trimmer attachment is also helpful for personal grooming.  If the smoothness lasts a while, I will definitely be investing in this product.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Other good reviews for this product helped to make up my decision on this product.  I was hesitant with all the too-good-to-be-true commentary, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was true.  Its the best time saver purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my legs at the beginning of last summer, and at first I loved it. I have very dark and fast growing leg hair and just hours after I would shave my legs they would start to feel prickly. After using the epilator my legs finally felt smooth and I was really excited. I used it about every other day until winter when I decided that it was a little to time consuming and I went back to shaving.     Well, now I really regret ever using the epilator, my legs are covered in red spots where the hair has become ingrown and some spots are infected. It looks awful, almost like I have chicken pox all over my calves. I&#x27;m glad that this epilator is working for some people but if there was even a chance that this would happen to someone else I definitely could not recommend it!</li>
    <li> Well at first everything was a bit painful but to be expected. The second time barely hurt and the third time not at all. Some sensitive areas pinch a bit. Hair grows back in stages so that might explain why it is less painful - less hair to epilate. Overall this is a great thing to use especially for women that have problems shaving. I was one of those and I am NEVER shaving again. There is a slight problem with ingrowns but if u use a scrub regularly u can get the hair out and that is suppose to pass after a while so will see. I am rather positive about this item.</li>
    <li> After reading review on many epilator machines, I settled on this one.  The epilator is relatively inexpensive, ergonomically designed, the attachments are handy and it comes with a bag to put everything in after use, the light is very helpful in finding the hairs, and there are no annoying batteries to replace.     I used it on my legs first and was able to finish both legs in about 40 min.  In the future, it won&#x27;t take me as long since I was going really slow this first time trying the epilator out.  It&#x27;s great bc unlike shaving, it doesn&#x27;t leave little black dots where the hair used to be.  Your legs won&#x27;t feel as smooth as if you just shaved, but they stay relatively smooth for weeks instead of getting prickly in two days.  Besides, you can always do a quick shave after for super smooth skin.      I did both underarms in 15 min and unlike waxing, it got every single hair and there was no bleeding from the hair follicles.  I think this machine does really well with thicker hair.  The hair on my legs is fine and so I missed a few here and there, but the results on the underarms were fantastic.    The only thing is that I would not use any of the epilators on the face, even the ones \\&quot;made\\&quot; for use on facial hair as they seem to cut more strands of hair than pluck.  Other than that, I&#x27;m ecstatic about this new find.  It will definitely save me tons of $ on wax and shaving equipment.</li>
    <li> I bought this little number mostly because I had grown tired of bikini waxes. While there are certainly a few pluses to this epilator compared to waxing (your hair can be shorter, at home use), this little machine&#x27;s revolving tweezers are more painful than a bikini wax.  This baby is also rather intimidatingly noisy and scary when you first turn it on; it doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence about putting it anywhere near your lady-parts. I found that the first epilation was by far the worst, but that after that initial shock-and-awe hair-removal the pain was way less.  For me the result was just as good as a bikini wax.    The pain for leg-hair removal was negligible and it does make a big difference regarding how frequently I need to shave my gams. All in all a good investment- just be prepared for some wincing.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I just used it for the first time and it really is VERY painful however, it pulls out ALL of the hairs at the root.  At the recommendation of other users I took a hot bath beforehand and used the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting--the regular setting is much more effective but I couldn&#x27;t bear the pain.  My only hope is that with time and multiple uses it won&#x27;t hurt as much.  I hate shaving and this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I am of German descent.  If I shave with a razor, in 5-8 hours (or if I get a chill), I will have a \\&quot;five &#x27;o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; on my legs.  I can normally go maybe 2 days, tops, before the new growth is obvious enough that I can&#x27;t get away with wearing a skirt to work.  Let me say this - I am NOT a waxer.  I was genuinely terrified of the potential pain of systematically ripping out every hair on my leg.      The Braun epilator is absolutely awesome!      First, the scary.  I won&#x27;t lie.  The first time you use it, it will hurt.  Try to keep the roller perfectly perpendicular to the surface area you are rolling across.  It helps if you roll backwards and forwards across each area a couple of times.  If you have worked on one area of your leg for too long, try giving that area a \\&quot;break\\&quot; for awhile and move on to your other leg.  Using the included freezer bag thing helped to numb the areas a little at first, but after a while I figured it was easier without.  Mostly, you&#x27;ll just have to grin and bear it the first time you epilate.  But you can get through it!  A note: I&#x27;ve found that it helps to pull your skin taut as you epilate.  The areas that are easiest for me are those areas where the skin is closer to the bone, contrary to what you might think.  It&#x27;s the more \\&quot;fleshy\\&quot; areas, like my thighs, that are awful.  I still don&#x27;t epilate my thighs, for that reason.  Not only is my skin there more sensitive, but the hair tends to be softer and have a tougher time ripping out up there, which probably contributes to the pain.  But, that being said, I am not a terribly athletic person.  I suspect that if you&#x27;re toned, you&#x27;ll do fine.      Once you&#x27;re through the initial trial run, the next times you use it, it will just get easier and easier.  Now it&#x27;s like using an electric razor, with an only slightly annoying plucking.    Don&#x27;t set your expectations too high.  Keep in mind that your hair is constantly growing in cycles, yadda yadda.  So don&#x27;t expect your legs to feel smoothas a baby&#x27;s behind after your epilate.  There&#x27;s always going to be some stickery growth that is too short to yank out just yet.... but the good news is that it&#x27;s too short to see at all.  I don&#x27;t care so much about feeling perfectly smooth, I just want to be able to wear a skirt to work, or go to the pool, etc. without having to shave every single day.  Goal accomplished!    Here are all the reasons I love my Braun epilator (wow, I should really do an infomercial....) :  1. I epilated on Monday night.  It&#x27;s now Friday night, and I still can&#x27;t see the growth!!!  I wore short shorts today.  2. The light is quite helpful.  It&#x27;s nearly impossible to miss any hairs.  3. Once you&#x27;re used to it, it goes pretty quickly.  4. No razor burn!  If you have pasty white skin like me, you might have a little redness.  This is why I use the epilator at night.  Then I put a little lotion with aloe on my legs.  In the morning - good as new for a week!  5. No more buying razors, except for my armpits and very sensitive areas (using the epilator there would just be masochistic, in my opinion).  I have effectively gone from buying razors once a week to once every 3-4 months.  6.  I can appreciate a well-designed product.  Fits into your hand very well and is comfortable.  And the sparklies are preeeetty! ^_^  7.  Well worth the price, when you consider that a really good electric razor will cost you around $80, and if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;d have to use that every single day.</li>
    <li> I needed to buy another epilator because my older one Silk-&amp;eacute;pil was bought in Europe and only works there. I was happy with my older one and really thought it did a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;Until I got THIS Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil epilator, and all I can say is WOW!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My older Braun left bumps ALL over my legs, this one DOESN&#x27;T. I was able to do my legs in HALF the time it took to do them with my older model. I LOVE the light feature, it really helps you to see the hairs I normally would have missed. The massage rollers in my opinion really DO make the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have used a epiltor for a few years and am desensitized to the discomfort, this system (to me) it pain free. In fact for me I was able to do my upper thighs as well. Something I could NOT do with my older system. I don&#x27;t think it would be that painful for someone that was not used to the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system is a great buy and if you have been previously using a epilator then this system will seem like a dream.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES it,she had a different one for about 7 years.She could not find one like it,a friend had this model.My wife thought she would try it.She likes it much better than the one she had before.Better job.</li>
    <li> this product is the best you have no idea how much money i have to save now</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and have had to stop using it because it was just too painful.  I tried every method to make it less painful and nothing worked.  I tried doing small sections and taking breaks, big sections, taking pain meds, rubbing, etc.  Nothing worked.  I had red spots that covered my legs for days after using.  I am going back to regular waxings.  They hurt less and the pain and redness goes away in about a day.    The light is nice and the electric razor part works well.  It would be better if it was battery operated so you didn&#x27;t have to haul out an extension cord every time you wanted to use it.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous after reading all the reviews, but decided to go ahead and give it a try. I really didn&#x27;t find it unbearably painful at all! Nor do I have chicken bumps which is a surprise since I always got them when using an electric shaver.    If I had tried to do an entire leg in one run I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d feel differently, for me stopping for a few moments after every pass was the trick, then after 2-3 passes as I become familiar with the sensations. Sure, this means it took longer than shaving, however this will reduce over time and I don&#x27;t have any nicks like I usually end up with using a disposable razor or pain and bumps afterward like I do with an electric shaver.     I should probably also point out that although I was very careful to maintain the 90 degree angle I did barely touch the skin (no pressure at all) and moved slowly up my lower leg for each pass. I have no clue if those that complained of unbearable pain or injury were using a different technique or if I&#x27;m just lucky... My hair grows in thick (I certainly qualify for ape-legs if I don&#x27;t do something about it) however each strand is thin/fine (the hair on my legs is a red-brown) and my skin is sensitive and very very pale if this makes any difference (hair coarseness and/or thickness seems to somehow be relevant from other posts).</li>
    <li> I purchased it 5 years ago. Still works and in perfect condition. It does the job, doesn&#x27;t hurt much when applying on my legs and arms. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product.</li>
    <li> What can I say?It&#x27;s a bit painful, it&#x27;s a bit loud and time consuming but it pulls the hair out,it&#x27;s not sticky or wet, I can use it practically anywhere.Hair grows back thinnerand less quickly.I think I&#x27;ll get cordless next time!</li>
    <li> Still going strong with weekly use five years later</li>
    <li> This Epilator is amazing.You can use it even,while charging.It works perfectly.It is small and the light is very helpful.I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is really a nice product. It tweezes all your unwanted hair. I use it underarms and on my legs. It hurts a lot when you try it for a first couple of times. But later you&#x27;ll be used to with it. This is way too nicer than shaving machine but still can&#x27;t compete waxing:) I have been using it for three years now. It still works smooth.</li>
    <li> Great option if you do not like to shave or wax. Easy to do and will leave a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> I had this epilator for 5 years before I finally had to replace it. It only started slowing down because I was epilating my legs while wearing socks, and it snagged on an elastic from my sock which tangled it up. Even though I thought I pulled all of the elastic back out, it just didn&#x27;t work right after that. But for $54, that&#x27;s ~$10/year vs however much I would have spent on razors and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have loved this epilator since I got it. The light is very convenient for seeing all of the hairs. I never considered buying an electric shaver, but the shaver attachment has come in handy when I didn&#x27;t expect it to. I&#x27;ve never really used the efficiency head. The massage rollers also help to prep your skin before they get plucked. When I&#x27;m not careful while getting the arm pit area, it sometimes snags on my skin, but I think that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an awkward angle with loose skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it works well and is able to get a lot of short hairs easily. It leaves my skin feel very smooth, and even the hairs that grow back feel fine as well and take awhile to grow back. I usually do not see any hair regrowth for at least 1.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love my epilator. I tell people I haven&#x27;t shaved in at least 7 years and they freak out, but then I soothe their crazy minds to tell them I epilate. After I explain epilating they freak out again thinking I&#x27;m crazy, but hey, I used to use tweezers and pluck out each and every armpit hair and would occasionally do the same for my legs... this epilator invention is genius for crazies like me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still pluck, but the epilator makes large areas much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this, it needs to be kept in mind it should be used as if it&#x27;s waxing treatments. I was doing it whenever I&#x27;d get hairy, which is like every three days, and it was pretty much as often as shaving. I was all annoyed that I was hairy beast woman even when pulling hairs out from the root, but then managed to hold out a couple months long enough for the 2-weeks to see if it would make a difference. It really did! I now epilate the 1st and the 15th of the month (give or take a few days if I can&#x27;t handle the itchiness and the *doink doink doink* of hairs when it&#x27;s cold) and I stay relatively smooth for at least a week. When the hair grows in, though I can feel them all freak out when it&#x27;s cold or I&#x27;m getting out of the shower, the hairs are so fine they aren&#x27;t visible to any normal person. It helps that I&#x27;m 2 feet from the ground, so any freakish man looking at my legs deserves to see the yeti fur, but in any case after 7 years of this, yeah, what I was saying, the hair is mighty fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m struggling with this epilator.  As mentioned by others, it&#x27;s true that epilating is not a pain free option for hair removal, but I think the pain is minimal on the legs and not bad on the underarms.  It&#x27;s more painful than waxing for all areas, but particularly the bikini area, and takes much longer.  I find that it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hairs out cleanly, so I&#x27;m left with some broken hairs that create stubble.  I do use it on the bikini area (although some areas are really painful) and I&#x27;m getting a lot of ingrown hairs which I never get with waxing.  Other reviews have said to persevere, so I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries, but I&#x27;m not ecstatic about it - it&#x27;s just a cheaper option than salon waxing and less messy than if you do home waxing.</li>
    <li> Reviews I read elsewhere were somewhat mixed on how much it hurt - I&#x27;m happy to report I found it not painful at all.  However, members of my family who have not given birth beg to differ.    It is very handy, especially the ability to shave your hair to the right length for epilation.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed in how fast my hair grows back (I have to epilate every week to approximate shaving twice a week) and maybe that will get better with time.  That&#x27;s the only reason it gets 4 rather than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and i am very much satisfied with this. Worth for money.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The little light is an absolute must in an epilator, and it gets most hair on the first pass.  The discomfort is minimal once you do it a few times.  I you can wax a body part you will love an epilator.</li>
    <li> I shaved every 2 days and my armpits got darker and darker over the years without me noticing. Now, I&#x27;m embarrassed to even raise my arms. I wish I could wax but the money to wax was so expensive and would accumulate over time. My friend recommended me to buy an epilator which she bought hers at a salon for much more. I went to amazon, purchased this epilator and my mom and I tried it together. We were jumping up and down in excitement as we saw the darkness go away and my hair grew back thinner and lighter under my armpits. They were no loner itchy and scratchy and annoying like when I just shaved. You know how men have 5&#x27;oclock shadow, well that was my armpit. Thanks to this epilator revolution, I don&#x27;t have to ever shave in the tub again, but epilate on my bed and then read a book. It hurts like a B*********!!!! But the results outshine the pain. Love yah and good luck purchasing!</li>
    <li> I was nervous about getting an epilator because of all the pain people talked about.  I finally got sick of shaving and decided to try it.  I did it on my legs first and couldn&#x27;t believe it!  Sure you could feel it, but it was nothing like I expected.  It kind of feels like getting a tattoo!  I don&#x27;t think I would describe it as pain!  I did also do my underarms and bikini area.  They were painful, but nothing a determined woman can&#x27;t get through!  It is worth it if I don&#x27;t have to shave for three more weeks!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because I was tired of constantly shaving and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on waxing. I got thought the pain of using it alright(it&#x27;s about on par with getting a tattoo), but post epilation I had 2 different types of negative skin reactions. First, despite a rigorous course of exfoliation every hair on my calves became painfully ingrown to a degree I had never experienced.Second,the sensitive area on my upper thigh broke out in an obnoxious rash that has taken a month to heal.   This type of negative experience may be due to sensitive skin but I would recommend that anyone whose skin is temperamental steer clear of this product.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase.  I use to wax but this is better than waxing.  It takes half the time of waxing and it gets more hair out than waxing.  Also great for traveling, it&#x27;s small and you can take it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I recieved the epilator and decided to return within the same day. I bought this because I wanted longer lasting smooth skin. I have blonde hair, but I read some reviews saying that it worked on blonde hair, but alas, no. I ran it repeatedly over the same spot, but it didn&#x27;t lift the hair. The pain wasn&#x27;t too bad (but maybe that&#x27;s because it wasn&#x27;t working?), and I really liked the smart light, but I could never imagine using it on the bikini area. Definite cons - the the noise! and the short cord. It would have been even better if it was a wet/dry type one (and if it worked on blonde/soft hair)</li>
    <li> i would recommand this product ,it works fast and its painless, it saved me lots of money getting my boddy waxed every month, its pretty quick and lives the skin smooth and hairless, the only problem is that it leaves red dots for few days after removing the hair and causes growth of hair under the skin which the wax didnt.</li>
    <li> Braun 5270 is a great epilator. My first epilator, so had lots of expectations. It delivers what it promises; although it sometimes causes ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years and still have yet to do it without slicing and dicing myself, unfortunately I have extremely sensitive skin so the creams were not an option either so I started searching around and found this contraption.    I had to drink some courage but finally tackled my legs, my son was laughing at me but I got through the entire process in about an hour.  Every woman knows that stublie feeling within 24 hours, and it&#x27;s gone!  It does take some practice to get all the little hairs but I used it for a second time today and it barely hurt at all.  So I figured I would try my arm pits as well, this HURT! But again you build up to the pain and it&#x27;s not bad.  I spent the rest of the day telling everyone to feel my pits, they&#x27;re sooooo soft!!!    Well worth the money, I love it.  The redness goes away pretty fast too.  My only complaint is that it has to be plugged in to use, it should be cordless!    Good luck!</li>
    <li> This will respond to the question as to how well it works for men.    I have been regularly removing my chest hair by waxing, but, since waxing always leaves a few hairs behind, I&#x27;d always have to follow up for a few days, as time allowed, to finish up with a pair of tweezers.  Since time is at a premium these days, I wondered if this thing might be an effective alternative. I just tried it today, and man! I hit the jackpot! I was done in about five minutes, and cleared just about everything away.  Previous postings made reference to pain -- in my case, I felt NO pain. The sensation was definitely odd at first, then not noticeable at all. I was able to really press it close against my skin to get at the tiniest hairs. The only difficulty I experienced was around the nipple area.  Mine are definitely very sensitive, so much so, that even when I waxed, I tended to leave a few hairs around it to minimize the possibility of injury to them with the wax strips. I was being very cautious, at first, but once I got a sense of how the thing would be effective in that area, I proceeded to effectively remove those, as well. More effective than waxing, in a lot less time, and no pain. Outstanding!</li>
    <li> I received my epilator in the mail today. I decided to try it out on my arms first (because I had just shaved my legs yesterday). While it hurt at first, I either my arm became numb or I just got used to it. This was MUCH less painful than when I got my tattoo on my ankle. :) I was able to remove the hair on both forearms in about ten minutes. 1-1/2 hours later and the skin on my arms still hurts, but it is bearable. It feels somewhat like a slight sunburn.  Even though I was using this in our bathroom right by the ten vanity bulbs, I&#x27;m glad that the Braun epilator 5270 has the bright light because it let me see all of the hairs that I couldn&#x27;t see with our regular lights.  The cord was long enough to give me room to move around a little and it is very pliable so that it didn&#x27;t get in the way while using the epilator.  Cleaning the epilator after using it on my arms was pretty straightforward. I was AMAZED to see how much hair it had collected.  There are still  some shorter hairs to remove on my arms but I had already planned on using the epilator tomorrow on my arms again as this was sort of my \\&quot;trial run\\&quot;.  In a few months&#x27; use, I think this will have paid for itself because I won&#x27;t be buying replacement blades for my shaver. Now I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my leg hairs to grow long enough to use this on them. :D  Would I recommend this to my friends? Yes!</li>
    <li> Love this epilator.  Much better than shaving or waxing.  I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> This gets 4 stars because it was advertised as painless, but is anything BUT. This thing stings. But its effective. If you can stand it, it works well on the bikini area too. And it comes with a handy electric razor attachment to trim any areas you don&#x27;t want to epilate. Three things to remember when using this product: Exfoliate, Exfoliate, Exfoliate!</li>
    <li> I have to say it hurt a lot because I haven&#x27;t used an epilator in four months, but I was very shocked to see HOW GREAT this product is, it really takes all the little tiny hairs out, VERY SURPRISED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping, I got it in 4 business days, I live in Seattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase one of these after trying one of the older Epilady models years ago. To my surprise, though, it did not hurt at all. The first time I used it I did both legs, both underarms and bikini area. The only problem for me is that it seemed like I had to go over my legs several times before they were silky smooth. Maybe the hair needed to be a little longer for a better grasp? Also, it is easy to clean and store. I am glad it is corded because I probably would have went through several batteries last night. And best of all Good-Bye to Razors!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd epilator I have owned.  The first was an Epilady which I recently broke. I ordered this as a replacement.  Little did I know that my life was about to change.  What a difference!  I used to have to take an analgesic and a glass of wine or two before I would even consider epilating my legs.  I seriously had to talk myself into it.  It was almost as painful as waxing.  Now, epilating is almost pain free and this prodcuct takes less than half the time to use.  The areas that are terribly sensitive for me - my ankles, knees, shinbone area, and upper thigh were so painful that even after the wine I would grit my teeth and have to power through.  I just used the Braun for the 2nd time and it was so easy, quick, and pain free.  The Epilady would grab my hair and only partially pull it out - resulting in unnecessary pain and having to go over the same hair several times.  This caused the whole process to be frustrating, time intensive, terribly painful, and I would end up with ingrown hairs.  This product is fabulous.  I don&#x27;t mind epilating at all now and actually almost enjoy it! I am sure the novelty of pain free epilating will wear off, however, this product is an answer to all my needs and I am delighted to have found it.  If you are new to epilating, this will be uncomfortable at first but once you are used to it and your hair comes out more easily (this happens over time), you will find that this doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a previous model that was worn out from over 10 years of use, and wish I had bought it much sooner.  The improvements over older models are terrific.  The Smart Light really helps you see the \\&quot;strays\\&quot; and the rollers that are meant to make use more comfortable really do help. It&#x27;s also a lot quieter than my older model.  I haven&#x27;t used the shaver much, because with performance this good there&#x27;s no need.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Braun Silkepil X&#x27;elle is a great epilating device.  Its so pain free that even I have been using it for some time.  When I moved to the US, I tried finding it in regular stores but I could not get it.  Thank you Amazon for your help.  The best part it that the heads of the device which I had previously from the middleeast were suitable for the american model as well so now I can use the large head from Braun 5270 and the smal head for facial hair (from my previous device) on this model of Braun.  Very highly recommended for epilation.</li>
    <li> I think the other reviews have mostly covered the epilation side of this, but: It really isn&#x27;t as scary as it seems. I&#x27;d heard from a few people who&#x27;d previously tried epilating that it&#x27;s excruciatingly painful, they all gave up on it almost immediately after they bought it, &amp;c. And i&#x27;m not great with pain myself, so i was nervous.    But it&#x27;s not that bad. It does hurt, i can&#x27;t deny that, but it&#x27;s tolerable. The best way i can describe the sensation is this: When i was younger i would steal my father&#x27;s electric shaver to use on my legs, and since i didn&#x27;t know how to use it very well i would push it too hard into my skin in an effort to shave closer. I pushed it so hard that i could feel the blades on the other side of the grill nipping at my skin. That&#x27;s what epilating feels like.    I do have a few pain-management tips if you find that it&#x27;s too much:    1. Take some ibuprofen or naproxen 15 minutes before starting.    2. Stretch your skin taut, as far as it will go (don&#x27;t hurt yourself obviously). This is especially helpful around the calves.    3. (And this is the most important one!) Don&#x27;t be delicate! You will probably feel the urge to take quick little nips and then pull the epilator away -- don&#x27;t do this, it just makes it hurt more (plus it takes longer). It seems counter-intuitive, but keep it in contact with your skin the whole time. Do one little spot at a time, in tiny circular or back-and-forth motions, and when it&#x27;s completely finished move slowly to the next spot.    OK, aside from the actual act of epilating:    - The epilator feels fine in your hand. It seemed bigger in the picture to me than it really was, so if it looks really chunky to you too, don&#x27;t worry.    - It hasn&#x27;t got a battery, it will only run off the mains. The cable it comes with is probably long enough for most people, but if you&#x27;re like me and your tub is on the opposite side of the bath room from the wall socket (and you don&#x27;t want to get hair all over your floor), you might need ashort extension cord.    - Contrary to the other reviews, i have found the shaver attachment to be extremely poor. I am not a regular user of electric shavers, but i have tried a couple over the years, so i feel i have a basis for comparison. This one is just awful to the point of being useless. It will trim the hairs, eventually, so they&#x27;re short enough to epilate, but it will take AGES (it&#x27;d probably be faster to use cuticle scissors...). It will NOT get close enough to do the job of a normal shaver.    So if you&#x27;re thinking to yourself (as i was), &#x27;oh hey, this is a sure thing, even if i don&#x27;t like the epilator i&#x27;ll still have a perfectly good shaver!&#x27;, you should probably rethink it. It&#x27;s fine if you just want the epilator, but don&#x27;t factor the shaver into the equation at all, because it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on the different Epilators I finally chose the Braun 5270.  It has the best reviews by far.  For me, unfortunately, things did not work out as I had hoped.  I had waxed before the Epilator so I thought pain would not be an issue.  IT IS !!!  The Epilator REALLY hurts and I do not have thick hair.  Also I noticed that no matter what attachment I use I do not get a complete shave.  Little tiny micro hairs remain and after going through such an ordeal that is pretty frustrating.  I can not say don&#x27;t purchase this but I will say do not have great expectations.   Hope this helps future buyers</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this epilator for about a month now, and i really love it! it really does save me time. i can tolerate the pain and i find this epilator to be pretty much perfect except it doesn&#x27;t pluck all the hairs in one go. i pretty much have to go over the same area a couple times. other than that, i really love it! especially the built in light. i would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I find that this is a great product in concept. For me, however, the pain is just too much.    Pro: My underarm and bikini area was so smooth for almost two weeks.     Con: I found that it didn&#x27;t hurt much on my legs, but didn&#x27;t leave them feeling as smooth as a razor does.    Although, I gained some pain tolerance, the reward was just not enough for me to continue to use this product. Back to the razor for me, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it very much... she says it&#x27;s very convenient and easy to use and it was not much from my pocket :). Additionally it came in 2 days with prime free shipping. So I would say, \\&quot;Its cool\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Let me start this by giving my stats: I have very fair skin and very dark hair (dark brown/black hair). I also have sensitive skin. I bought this for the same reason everyone else did: to never shave again. I was intrigued by the promise of being hair-free for weeks at a time. And also thought the idea of this being less and less painful was a plus. Well, sadly, I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected. I have have been using this product for three weeks now (every day at first, then every other day), and here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened (from top to bottom):    Underarms - I suffer from \\&quot;the shadow\\&quot; and thought this would be a good way to get rid of that. Wrong. The first time I used this it was way more painful than waxing and caused my underarms to bleed in every spot the hair was pulled from. Needless to say, I have gone back to waxing.    Forearms - I also suffer from dark hair here. The removal is painful and causes red spots where the hair has been pulled out. But it does remove that \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; that shaving left behind. I do have to use it daily, and I have been using it for 3 weeks. Apparently, I have hair growing constantly. But, on the plus side, I do not have ingrown hairs.    Legs - this was the major disappointment. The first time I used this, I only used it on my lower legs and knees. It was so painful, but it did pull out hairs. My legs were so splotchy from where the hair had been removed. So, I decided to only use the epilator on my lower legs for one week, then move onto the thighs. (Never intended to use it on the bikini line...ouch!). So, I used it everyday for a week, and still hair kept growing. It has been three weeks now and hair is still growing everyday like I had never epilated the day before. I tried using it on my thighs but it was too painful for me to handle. The one thing that was nice at first is my legs didn&#x27;t have that dark undergrowth that shaving can leave. However, I have noticed this past week that half of each of my lower legs are covered in ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s really bad. Even my husband couldn&#x27;t believe it. I do exfoliate in the shower, so I can only assume the epilation has caused it. (I did some research and found out that epliation does cause more ingrown hairs than shaving or waxing.) So, I will go back to shaving my legs.    Feet and toes - No problem here. Minor pain and the hair actually stays gone!    Overall, not worth the money. I will continue to use it on my forearms and feet/toes. The pain has never improved and is just as painful as the first day I used it. I can say if you epilate at night, the splotches are gone by morning.  I hope this product works better for others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item exactly 7 months back. I wanted to fully test it before I write a review.    In three simple words - I LOVE IT!!    I already had a Braun Epilator (older generation) but I wanted an epilator which worked in the US voltage conditions.    After reading all the reviews I was deciding between Panasonic and the newer Braun epilator. I ended up choosing this one as \\&quot;known devil is better than unknown\\&quot;. I couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice!     First and foremost, what I noticed is that this is much quieter &amp; efficient than the older generation. Secondly, this epilator has light (\\&quot;SmartLight\\&quot;) on the button where you push-to-start. This helps me tremendously when I want to remove fine hairs in a low light condition (evenings, nights, bathrooms etc.). I had read that there were couple of reviewers/ users who disliked it or never found it useful. That wasn&#x27;t the case with me, at all! I was wary of this statement but took a chance anyway. Now my hands feel as if they never had any hairs at all! No more seeing random hairs when you stand in the sunlight!    This also comes with 2 attachments - one for fine hairs and one for coarse hairs (shaving attachment). Depends where you have what! It also comes with two speeds. For me, speed 1 is good enough. Speed two is if you want it gone faster. It also comes with the EfficiencyPro clip (the blue part on the attachment which cushions when you epilate). I found that this helps in angling the machine in such a way that skin doesn&#x27;t get trapped in the tweezers.    Compared to my older generation Braun this one gets the job done in half the time and much less pain! I would recommend this to everyone without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> I am incredibly glad I decided to purchase this product! The Braun epilator catches every hair, is relatively painless (used on legs, at least) and is very easy to use. The light is also perfect for illuminating as you go. For me, the results last ten times longer than shaving, and the hair grows back thinner. However, I would advise that you invest in a good product for reducing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product and start using it. And it worked great in the beginning. The pain was a little strong at start, but it got better with each use. I even did my underarms and bikini area!    However, 3 months after using it weekly it started to take longer to epilate each leg. Two weeks later I notice it wasn&#x27;t grabbing any hair. It didn&#x27;t matter how slow I moved it along my leg, nothing was pulled out. My only hypothesis is the hair was growing back thinner and the epilator could no longer grab it.    A call into customer service left me even more disgruntled. I was told my 60 day money-back guarantee had expired. After going through my user&#x27;s guide, nothing about a 60-day guarantee is even mentioned, so how was I to know I was under a deadline? I was told I could buy a new head for it, but it works fine for others who don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis. And I don&#x27;t want to invest any more money in a product I lost faith in.    I hope it works better for you than I, but remember if you don&#x27;t like it you only have 60 days!</li>
    <li> This little tool is EVERYTHING I expected and more!  I&#x27;ve used another brand of epilator for many years; the technology has come a LONG way!  Using the Braun 5270 is so much less painful than my old model.  I&#x27;m able to use it on sensitive areas with very little discomfort...areas that I would never have even considered using my old epilator.  I truly couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I am currently in love with it! I have a high threshold for pain so I barely felt anything when I first used it. Probably just a couple of pinches here and there but nothing too serious. I recommend this if you are looking for an alternative to waxing or even shaving.     The only problem I have with this is that it doesn&#x27;t pick up small short hairs. My legs and arms do not feel completely smooth. Hopefully after two weeks, I can feel a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of hair-removers that didn&#x27;t work and shaving.  I tried it knowing that it was going to be uncomfortable. Uncomfortable is not the  word to describe how it feels. It is PAINFUL and may leave little dots of blood behind.  It also misses some of the hair even though you go over the same area a lot!    I would not recommend this product to anyone but those with reptilian-like skin.  It is PAINFUL and DANGEROUS!</li>
    <li> Update - WHEN the hair grows back...it&#x27;s UNCOMFORTABLE! Like you can feel EVERY hair trying to pop back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 43 and noticed that the older us guys get the more hairy we get. So I wanted to remove some but I didn&#x27;t want to shave because...you can tell. Ask any woman who shaves her lip! This thing does only one thing and one thing well. It YANKS OUT YOUR HAIR! It doesn&#x27;t apologize for it either! Unlike others that pull on the same hair 4-5 times before it comes out, this Braun does it once so it&#x27;s less painful. I did the Nair for men and 2 days later...it&#x27;s back!&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve seen older guys with shaved legs and I thought It was \\&quot;kinda Creepy\\&quot; but looking back...They were creepy anyway. I have women coming up to me and rub all over me because they like the feel of smooth skin on a guy, So....That&#x27;s enough for me to keep it up!&lt;br /&gt;  If your single and can&#x27;t find any ladies out there...just do one leg and pretend there&#x27;s one next to you! (with the shaved leg!) LOL!</li>
    <li> I go over and over the same spot, in different directions, and it still doesn&#x27;t get all the hair. It gets perhaps like half of the hairs. However, this thing hasn&#x27;t broken in a couple years, so at least it&#x27;s reliable.</li>
    <li> Enough has been written about this product by others.  It works well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Lots have said how much they love this, and I&#x27;m just echoing that. This is my first epilator, and I was expecting it to hurt more, but it&#x27;s definitely bearable. Yes, some places hurt worse than others (I did try my underarms the other day, and I couldn&#x27;t do it). The bikini area hurts too, but I can handle it.  Mostly, I just think this thing is so neat. The light is great, and I like the option of the different heads and speeds.  I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this years ago.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say I HATE this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months, every 2-3 days. Not only do I have to use it as much as shaving, but it takes waaaayyyy longer than shaving! Also, my normally smooth skin on my legs is now horribly bumpy and rough! It&#x27;s NOT ingrown hairs, I&#x27;m 36 and have had my share of ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s given me KERATOSIS PILARIS, or \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; all over my legs! I&#x27;ve used the expensive after epilation creams with growth inhibitor, but I&#x27;m still having to epilate every 2 days. I seriously don&#x27;t see how other women claim they only have to use it every 3-4 weeks! Do they enjoy having hairy Yeti legs???&lt;br /&gt;The pain factor isn&#x27;t even a factor. The first time will hurt, no lie there. Maybe even the second time. But after that-not a problem. But you shouldn&#x27;t have to use it as often as I have. I&#x27;m not a hairy beast, I&#x27;m a natural blonde with fine hair that is usually envied by my friends for the infrequent times I have to shave. When I SHAVE I usually only have to shave once or twice a week. This epilation thing is a sadly different story. It just goes to show the old saying IS true- if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!</li>
    <li> Oh man....it, um.....was better than the one other time I tried it in the early 90&#x27;s, I must say. Then, it was the EpiLady, and it was basically this circular coil that ripped all your hair out without regard for severe pain &amp; possibly even bloodshed!!!     Thankfully there have been some new developments. This new Braun model I tried has little massagers that basically do a Shiatsu-like beating of the skin before using their 40 tweezer action to rip it out, and the result feels more like sandpaper or a coarse sugar scrub applied vigorously. Surprisingly very tolerable. &lt;I can&#x27;t tolerate waxing, but have gone for laser hair removal; the business went under so I&#x27;m left with tiny hairs - everyone is left with light hairs after laser treatments - and a few (30 or so) long dark grandma ones were growing back in a sea of tiny fine blonde ones.    I actually felt it more (kind of numb &amp; a little tender) AFTER I was completely done with the first leg. It&#x27;s fine now, after only 2 hours, and it lasted less than 20 minutes for me. Well worth it if the hair does indeed stay gone for a while, as that&#x27;s clearly what I was going for! :)    The industry has seen a vast improvement!</li>
    <li> As a long time epilady user, this product rules! It is faster, more efficient, less painful than my previous epiladies. It even costs less han I ever paid. I recommend this product to anyone who likes this method of hair removal. I only use it on my legs so far - maybe someday I&#x27;ll try it on other areas. The only thing I would like better is if it was cordless as I like to epilady outdoors &amp; it would be more convenient not to be near a power source. Overall it is a great product that I will use forever.</li>
    <li> Its just an excellent product.. I am regular waxer from about 10 years and I used this epilator today for the first time. I read many reviews before purchasing it and most of them said it pains a lot when you do for the first time. Truly saying it didn&#x27;t pained at all on my hands but on legs it pained a lil bit and I think its because the hair growth was lil long. I would definitely recommend it and don&#x27;t be afraid it won&#x27;t pain that much. It bearable.. So go for it and ya I find this more convenient than waxing. Thank you amazon for such a good service..:)</li>
    <li> Just used this Braun epilator for the first time, and it is excellent.  I previously had the new rechargeable wet/dry version which started having problems after just about 2 months and couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a minute.  This version though is so much more powerful, and does a much better job of removing all the hair with less passes.  I hadn&#x27;t used an epilator since the horribly torturous epilady, when I was a teenager.  The new ones are much easier and pain-free to use.  It did hurt the initial time I began to epilate again, but by the second use I was completely fine.  So much better than waxing and easy to go back in case you missed anything.</li>
    <li> My first epilator was a Braun Silk-epil.  I liked it a lot, but switched to the Emjoi.  I loved my Emjoi but they stopped making the exact model (of which I purchased two over the years).  I have been using one or the other of these devices for approx. 10 years now.  One of my Emjois quit recently, so I needed to purchase a new one (I keep one at work and one at home).  As I said, they quit making the exact model of Emjoi, so I had to do some research.  I purchased the Braun 5270 after reading about it.  I like it a lot.  It is a fast epilator.  It works a little better than the Emjoi, but it has a tendency to pinch my skin in the more sensitive areas (like bikini line and underarms).  Yes, I use it everywhere!  This kinda bugs me, but it works so well everywhere else, I&#x27;m learning to be more cautious.  This is why I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5.  If it didn&#x27;t pinch, the light would make this unit a 5+.  I&#x27;m getting a little older and my hair is blonde.  I&#x27;ve been epillating for so many years that my hair grows in very fine and is hard to see.  I used to need my reading lamp (and my reading glasses) to get all of the hairs.  I still need the glasses, but not the lamp.  The light sillouettes (it actually puts a little halo around the hairs) the hair so I can see them all.  It&#x27;s the best feature!  I do recommend this unit, just be careful of the pinching.  If you are only going to use this on your legs, this is definitely the unit for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased a less expensive brand - Revlon - from a television shopping show.  It did not work as well as the Braun and within weeks after getting it the bearings in the swivel arm began to fall out.    The Braun is far superior to any other models I have tried.  It is better made, hair removal is cleaner and closer to the skin, has a light that helps you see the area you are working on.    I strongly recommend this product - Braun has been making razors and epilators for a long time.  They have the history of being tried and true producing quality products.    Do not waste your money on any other epilator--Braun may cost a little more initially- you will save more in the long run in money and time.</li>
    <li> First, let me start off by saying that compliance on feedback is extremely difficult (unless the product is outrageously fabulous or garbage), so the fact that 700+ people have actually come on here and left feedback is telling.  The fact that 700+ people bought it and it has a user rating of 4.5 is outstanding and statistically powerful.  Okay, enough with the numbers, once you get past the difficult stuff (more on that shortly), it&#x27;s a very effective product and well worth the 50 bucks I paid (less than one session for a brazilian).  The &#x27;difficult&#x27; stuff would be: 1) It really is pretty painful (and I thought I had high pain tolerance) but you do get used to it little by little 2) The bikini area is definitely the most painful 3) you have to keep the gadget moving in strokes because if you stall to long in place it tends to grab the skin 4) keep the skin taught!!  (otherwise it won&#x27;t grab) 5) Ladies, not good if you have upper lip hair...way to bulky to get in there 6) I read a lot of people on here that said do this after a shower...well I beg to differ.  Actually, doing it after the shower gave me insane razor rash.  In my experience, the after shower stuff makes it worse.  So in summary, it is a really great alternative to laser treatment or waxes.  Get it!</li>
    <li> Although the process of epilating is painful, I am going to keep using this product based on the reviews of others.  The first time I used the epilator, the feeling was not like anything I experienced before.  Now I know what to expect, so it seems that I am tolerating the feeling much better.  The first time I used the product my legs weren&#x27;t smooth like I had thought, so I am wondering if the hair was pulled out or just broken off.  Maybe there is a learning curve for me too.  Haven&#x27;t attempted the underarms or bikini area yet, I&#x27;m just not that brave, but I hope to get there at some point.</li>
    <li> So, all the people that said this is as bad or worse than childbirth, are correct. This thing hurts. It sucks, and the first time I used it, I could only do half my bottom leg. Luckily, my co-worker was the one who told me to get it, and she helped encourage me to finish up my legs. I wouldn&#x27;t do this in the bikini area, but I&#x27;m a hairy lady, and love it. I&#x27;ve now used it about three times, and already it doesn&#x27;t come back the same. Sure, I&#x27;ve gotten some ingrown hairs, and its a little red and bumpy after, but use lotion! Exfoliate a lot, and use lotion everyday after you shower, and it helps. To me, its worth the trouble. I have crazy hairy legs that I used to shave every or every other day and it totally sucked. With this thing, even while I wait for it to grow back out after epilating, it doesn&#x27;t seem as bad, and I still wear shorts and stuff. So, if you are hairy, and can suck it up, just think about how much cheaper this is compared to a summer of razors, or getting waxed all the time, or getting that permanent hair removal. Plus, nair sucks, and we all have to realize there isn&#x27;t a pain free way to get rid of hair unless you shave.</li>
    <li> After reading the numerous reviews on Amazon.com I decided to purchase this item. Believe what others have said before...this HURTS. It took me 20 minutes to do one leg the first time I did tried it. The second time, 2 weeks later, took significantly less time; it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad the second time. I am not ready yet to try this on my underarms or bikini area. I love that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day anymore. I last used the Epil 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m still good-to-go. My legs may not be silky smooth but what&#x27;s there is virtually invisible and surprisingly soft; unlike the re-growth after shaving. I&#x27;m loving my new Silk - epil and recommend it for anyone who is looking for freedom from the shaving routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of having to wait for my hair to grow out long enough to wax.  I prefer this over waxing anyday.    I&#x27;ll be honest:  It hurts like hell at first (but then so does waxing).  After a while you get somewhat used to it though.  I love the light on it.  It really helps you to see every little hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator; definitely better than the first.  Overall very happy with it, but the extra protective head comes loose and pops off frequently. I found that you don&#x27;t really need it and it works perfectly without it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 5370 Silk-epil Body System Epilator to replace one (not a Braun) I had for 15 years. It works Great! I love it! I did not realize how slow my old one was until I tried this one. It is wonderfully easy on the skin but works efficently. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I bought the epilator several months back and have to say it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made this year. I&#x27;m so thrilled to be done with waxing and having to let my hair grow in between waxes just to remove it again! I use the bruan about every 3 days before getting in the shower. It&#x27;s quick, easy and in my opinion isn&#x27;t painful at all. I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini area. It&#x27;s been so nice spending the summer hair free with so little effort. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> If you love the benefits of epilating, this is great addition to your beauty arsenal. I use this every 4 or 5 days and shave after to get the smoothness we all love. It last for days and is pretty painless (or maybe I&#x27;m just used to it)  The light (which I thought was a superfluous feature) actually does help you see the finer hairs.  Plus there is a shaver included as well when you don&#x27;t feel like being uncomfortable AT ALL. Happy epilating :)</li>
    <li> My advice is as follows: get this product and commit to using it for several weeks at least. You need to use it that long before you&#x27;ll reap the full benefits. It&#x27;s an excellent tool and should be used as a part of your routine- NOT as a quick \\&quot;I&#x27;m going out tonight and need a shave\\&quot; type thing. In fact don&#x27;t do that. It can leave you with blood spotting and red bumps, just like waxing can, so give yourself a night or two to recover.     Step one if you&#x27;re just getting started... Give yourself a light shave first- don&#x27;t go close, just a basic, light shave and don&#x27;t worry about being stubbly. Wait a night. I found that using the epilator for the first time was less daunting and painful on veeeeery short, recently shaved hairs and it gave me time to get used to the device. The tweezers actually go in and grab short stubble, so no need to wait for long length as with wax. Just go ahead and use it on a day or two old shave.    So commit to it. Make sure the skin is held taut and that it&#x27;s clean and dry. Do expect some pain. I personally didn&#x27;t find my legs to be very painful at all, but the bikini area...well that does indeed take some determination, especially if you intend to get really bare down there. You just have to work through the pain and make sure you hold all that skin VERY taut and safely out of the way. I went for it on the higher setting and did not bother with the lower speed at all. The result is worthwhile, especially if you get itchy razor bumps like I do from shaving.     Do small areas at a time if you need to. I was basically epilating tiny stubble and was amazed at how LONG the hairs that came out were. This thing seriously does pluck out hair all the way down, so it&#x27;s effective. Do small sections every day if you need to or go for the whole area at once. You can do it. It gets easier the longer you epilate, and no doubt your body starts producing endorphins in response to the pain. The device is a little bit loud and your hand will vibrate a bit afterward, but I would certainly buy it again. Use it everyday to get rid of various patches of stray stubble as soon as they pop up- after a few cycles all will be smooth and calm.</li>
    <li> This Braun epilator works much better than the older model I had. It seems to spin much faster and is more effective at removing the hair. I like the shaving attachment too. I took one star off because its still not perfect at removing all the hair and its very noisy too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing. I&#x27;ve done the whole shaving thing for years, but it hurts like heck to shave over stubble, especially \\&quot;down there\\&quot;. So I&#x27;ve done the waxing thing...painful, missed a lot of hairs, and hated having to grow it out for so long before I could wax. So I finally dropped the money for one of these, and let me tell you, I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else. Does it hurt...yes. But once you see how well it works, even getting rid of the hairs that were too short to wax, you will be hooked. I don&#x27;t think it was too much worse than waxing...same sensation but more drawn out. On certain parts of your body it&#x27;s more painful, like the back of my calves, \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and underarms, at times it felt like a burning sensation, but only lasted a few seconds, and the results were so worth it. It has now been over a week, and I&#x27;ve only had to \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; once. For some reason, the hair on my legs doesn&#x27;t all grow in at the same rate, and the nice thing about this is that you can use it jut like any other razor, and just do the spots you need, instead of trying to wax random spots where the hair grew back in, and unlike shaving, you wont have to worry about it for awhile. The only complaint I have is that the attachment that has the bead type massage things broke on one side. I think I was able to find all the beads that fell off, and can probably repair it myself, if not I probably wont even bother taking it back, I don&#x27;t think I would use that attachment all that much anyways....But to wrap this up...AWESOME product, no regrets what-so-ever, and if it ever quits on me I&#x27;ll buy another one in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I have had this epilator since last year and I absolutely love it! The first few times it hurt a little but now I am used to the pain.  I am an indian girl with thick black hair on my legs and arms.  I use this epilator and I am hair free for a few weeks! In between I do some touch-ups but the hair has been taking longer to grow back.  Plus its finer so even if I have some hair which I forget to epilate, you can&#x27;t notice it.  It is very easy to use and clean.  It is a bit loud but nothing that bad.  For cleaning it, I take the brush, dip it in alcohol and wipe the entire surface of the epilator.  I use a safety pin to get the hair that gets trapped inside the little holes in the cartridge that pulls the hair out.  Doing that is time consuming but it keeps the device functioning perfectly.  I have recommended it to my mom and a few friends who have all bought and loved it.  I have not used this on my face and I will not because I have sensitive facial skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest, it&#x27;s certainly not pain free, but not as bad as I thought it would be.  The results were so good.  I will be using this regularly.  It does get easier the more you use it, and it is definitely worth every penny.  I would have given it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the hurting part.</li>
    <li> It hurts a lot the first time, but after the second day of using it it barely hurt at all. If your not dedicated to using it you&#x27;ll probably quit the first time, and not get to be happy about future results. My advice is just to be patient. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good, versatile hair removal device. Once you&#x27;re used to the minor pain of the tweezing, it&#x27;s a dream. Just like waxing but with only a fraction of the cost over time. Additionally you can do this at home with a minimal amount of time. Forget shaving your legs every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating your bikini area or under arms I do not advise. The hairs there are coarser and much more committed to staying in your skin than leg hair. Subsequently, I feel like this device ends up just pulling AT them and not pulling them OUT which is considerably more painful than leg hair coming out, and also not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That being said, I&#x27;m sure some of you can take it! For these areas the shaving/buzzer attachment does a good (but not perfectly smooth) job of getting those hairs down to size. I&#x27;d say keep your brazilian wax appointments if you want to be totally smooth, but this is a great solution for everything else!</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I have ever used, but I like it. It hurts less than I expected, but I don&#x27;t think ill use it in summer because I get ingrown hairs sometimes. Not the kind that hurt and cause a pimple, just ones that the epilator cant get to but i can still see because they are slightly under the skin. I did my legs and arms with no problem, then tried my underarms and there is no way I could suffer through that. I even did a little of my bikini line which hurt less than the underarms! The light is very helpful in catching little hairs you wouldnt normally see. The electric razor attachment works extraordinarily well anywhere the epilator is too painful.</li>
    <li> The product is fine. I am kind of disappointed when I used it. I feel it can&#x27;t really get the hair out as clean as possible.</li>
    <li> O.K here is the low down on this epilator:&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;  Gets rid of hair for about two weeks (this varies by person)&lt;br /&gt;  Has a light on it so you can see all the hairs to make sure you get them all&lt;br /&gt;  Very easy to use, even for a beginner&lt;br /&gt;  You don&#x27;t have to keep buying more like with razors, creams and waxes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad&lt;br /&gt;  It hurts. Especially in the beginning. If you get through the first time pain it will be worth it. Although, the massagers on this one help&lt;br /&gt;  You have to go over your legs multiple times to get all the hairs, it&#x27;s not going to get them in one sweep. However, it gets less painful because there&#x27;s fewer hairs for it to pick up as you go along&lt;br /&gt;  Even though it can be used on underarms and bikini you have to be really brave to do it because it hurts 10x worse in these areas. Thus you might still have to shave those areas.</li>
    <li> First things first, let me mention that I&#x27;m a dude and I love this machine!  My hair is probably thicker than the women out there, and probably more prominent, but the Braun Epilator sucks it up wonderfully, with some pain I admit - but if you continue to use this thing the pain eventually goes away - because so does your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so if you&#x27;re like me and never heard of an epilator before let me tell you what this does - a bunch of rotating pluckers revolve at a fast pace and essentially rip out your hair at root level.  As you can imagine this can be a very painful experience, BUT it doesn&#x27;t have to be! There are a thousand ways to prevent (or ease) the pain and here are my ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shave with the epilator&#x27;s attachment or with regular razor first!  The epilator can grab onto tiny, tiny hair follicles! If you can see the hair you waited too long to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Epilate EVERY day!  You will always have hair growing, but after you pluck one out by the root it takes that individual hair about a week or two to grow back.  You will have other hairs appearing the next day after you use your epilator though.  It will take a couple of weeks of everyday use, but eventually all your hairs will be taking so long to grow back that you will have beautiful baby-bare skin.  ALSO - since shaving with a razor doesn&#x27;t take out the root, the hair you&#x27;ve had since puberty has had a Long time to set up shop in your skin - this means that the root is going to be fixated in place a lot better than hair that&#x27;s had to regrow after plucking.  This is why the first time users are going to have a lot more pain than the people that use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;*the red bumps first time users have will also get less and less with each use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Go with the growth - if you start the epilator in the same direction your hair is growing there will be significantly less pain.  The problem with this method is that you won&#x27;t be able to get all the hairs this way, but if you start this way you will remove some hairs and your biggest goal is to have as few hairs at one time going through the epilator&#x27;s pluckers.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all if you&#x27;re plucking 1 hair, but it starts to feel pretty intense if there&#x27;s a ton going through it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Epilate right after bath or shower - a body that&#x27;s just been steamed will let loose its hair follicles much easier than a dry, hard body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. For sensitive areas, pluck with tweezers first - I tried to epilate my \\&quot;Bikini\\&quot; area without plucking first and it was a bad idea.  Even though I shaved myself nearly bald before epilating, the hair follicles in my groin were so firmly rooted it was torture to mass pluck them.  So, I plucked hairs one at a time with tweezers until I&#x27;d taken out over half the growth.  After that the epilating was a breeze, and now that the hair growing there is new and not so firmly in place, I can epilate them all without much pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Develop your own technique!  Everybody&#x27;s hair is different and everybody has a different tolerance for this kind of pain.  Experiment with the epilator, but don&#x27;t give up on it.  It can truly be your best friend in the battle against unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can&#x27;t be more excited enough about this product!  I use it for my legs, arms, nipples, and groin and have the long-lasting smooth, hairless skin I&#x27;ve always wanted without ever using razors or wax.  The only downside to using this is that your skin will for sure have red bumps for a few hours after you it in some areas.  I&#x27;ve noticed this decrease significantly as I continue using it though (probably because my new hair growth is less rooted) but I still see them occasionally, especially on my arms but almost never on my legs.  They can also be avoided by using some of my pain-decreasing steps, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, boys and girls!remove some hairs and your biggest goal is to have as few hairs at one time going through the epilator&#x27;s pluckers.

    <li> Based on all the positive reviews, I decided to get the Silk-epil to see if it was any better than my Emjoy Optima and it&#x27;s not. It was a big disappointment. Whether using it on the epilator setting or on the shaving setting, it misses the majority of my hairs which makes it a waste of time and a waste of money. And I&#x27;m not new to epilating, so I know how to use one and what to expect via results.    It could be that I got a defective product but some how I don&#x27;t think so. My advice is to skip this one and go for the Emjoy Optima.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and not painful. I really enjoy having it. I did get some ingrown hairs with it initially but after a few uses the number greatly decreases.</li>
    <li> I hate long reviews so let&#x27;s keep this short and to the point.  I had originally purchased the Emjoi epilator and was not pleased because it did not pick up all the hairs, so I exchanged it for the Braun and was quite pleased.  It removes all hair.  It&#x27;s somewhat painful the first time you use it, but the results are worth it and by the second time it doesn&#x27;t seem to be painful at all.  It removes all the hair and legs stay smoother a lot longer than shaving.  Love it!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy and bought this Epilator for my chest, back and stomach area. I shaved, waited a several days and then had a go with the machine. Talk about pain, but it was bearable and the results were excellent. Like many others have mentioned you&#x27;ll develope a rash shortly after that fades overnight. It&#x27;s easy to see how it&#x27;s to be used, I haven&#x27;t read the instructions yet...it&#x27;s guy thing. In hindsight, I wish I had opted for the rechargable version.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the product is being more cheaply made now, but after 2 months of intermittent use and being put up in a safe cupboard (ie not dropped etc) it is not working anymore.</li>
    <li> Bought this as gift for my daughter (who really wanted one!).  She says it works great but \\&quot;Hurts so much, it&#x27;s evil!\\&quot; It is supposed to get easier as time goes by---the jury is still out on that one!</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday evening.  I immediately took it to my legs that had one day of regrowth after shaving.  I did not find it to hurt or be too loud.  It pulled out the hairs that were long enough to grab (cleaning it afterward proved that).  I did test it on some longer hairs and found those to hurt more, so I&#x27;m guessing that the longer your hair is the more it will hurt.  As someone else mentioned I did have some red bumps after, but those went away very quickly after applying some cocoa butter.  The trimmer attachment is wonderful.  I haven&#x27;t tested the shaver part yet, but so far I love it!    I&#x27;m glad to know the 1000+ other reviews on this were accurate.</li>
    <li> I have been depilating for about three years now and used to be a long time shaver.  I will never go back to shaving.  This epilator is the one I first bought and has lasted up till now...I guess they have to wear out sometime.  I may have shortened the lifespan of it by trying to go over some places I just tried to wax...but nevertheless mine conked out in the middle of my session.  The point is my hubbs ran out and got me the Remington to replace this one and it was nowhere as good as this Braun.  However if I may spare some first time users some amazing pain by recommending that you get professionally waxed before you start using this product and then use it every other day in the beginning...maybe a month or so.  It is absolute torture to use this for the first second and third times if you are hairy then you let it grow back because you are afraid to use it again.  The third time I let my hair grow back I went to a spa and got waxed then resumed my usage with the epilator..wow what a difference.  Now I epilate only every one to two weeks and it is still mildly uncomfortable but not like it was in the beginning.  So take heart brave soldiers and don&#x27;t give up.  You will love this way more than shaving because you won&#x27;t have those embarrassing prickly legs with hair stubs anymore.  Epilated legs (as well as waxed) grow out smooth and soft and fine.  Enjoy being hair free without the hassle of daily shaving.  I am going to order another one of these, loved it way more than the Remington.  Why not stick with a good thing.</li>
    <li> Few months ago, I was on Amazon about to buy another crate of waxing strips when this little product caught my eye (thanks to a well placed ad). I am so happy with it that I just had to write a review, which is not something I often do. First and foremost, it works - it is faster, easier, cheaper, less painful and more efficient than waxing. I used to wait a few weeks between waxings to let the hairs grow out in order to get more bang out of a waxing session, and this would mean having to wear long pants and avoiding pool pretty often. Well, no more - now I use the epilator for 15 minutes once a week and never have any noticeable hair. It gets every little hair, I find that even short hairs get zapped efficiently. The light feature is very helpful. In fact, I started epilating my upper legs which used to have thin hair, and now they are actually coming in thicker (or maybe I just see them better with the light). So maybe hold the urge to epilate everything in sight. In terms on pain, I found it to be similar or even less painful than waxing, but I am a long time waxer. It has a special massaging attachment and two speeds to ease you into it, but I did not find those necessary. I have to pass each area several times, but it will get every single hair. Again it is much faster than waxing and there is no mess. The downsides as other people have mentioned is that it is pretty loud so you can&#x27;t watch TV as you are epilating, and it has to be plugged in (no battery option), but in fact the cord is sufficiently long. Also I did notice a few more ingrown hairs since I started using it, but I should probably just exfoliate more often. I use it in the bikini area - and I define the bikini area as the upper thigh area up to the leg crease, I don&#x27;t go any further. It is a bit more painful and cumbersome to navigate in that area, but it gets the job done for the most part - I do have to touch up with tweezers. So despite these minor negatives, I give it five thumbs up!! Do not hesitate to buy it - it will set you free!!</li>
    <li> I just got this thing three weeks ago. Yes, using it was painful, but bareable. You have to have a great deal of patience to do your whole legs (and mine are pretty hairy). The only problem that lots of people mentioned..afterwards you get red \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;, which I found a simple solution for. I just used a wet hot towel over my legs for 5-10 min, changing it periodically and that took care of the redness. After that I used baby powder, and that also helps the skin to heal and prevents the infection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various hair removal devices for over 20 years and the Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator is one of the most efficient one I&#x27;ve used.  It removes hair other devices leave behind.  None of my other devices had a light exposing hair that is less visible otherwise. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator.</li>
    <li> I have been using the older version for about 10 years and the brand is great - it still works but without the newest improvements, not as well.  The light comes in very handy for those small hairs and you will need good light to see where you need to run it. I have low tolerance for pain and I can more than manage this on my legs - at the same time I have been doing it for years.  The first time doing it you may experience more pain then usual but it really isnt that bad and you will definitely get used to it.  I am very hairy and my hair grows back really fast on my legs and that is why I haven&#x27;t shaved them in over 10 years, I am totally dependent on this product.  I tend to still wax my underarms because for me it is a bit painful to use this product there. This product has a shaver, however, I like to take hair out by the root so I just wax.I do have a friend who has been using this product for over 10 yrs as well that uses it under her arms and she is just fine. I also tend to wax my bikini line and on those days that there isnt that much to wax, I will touch up with this product.  I am yet to use the trimmer but pretty sure its just a basic trimmer.  I am confident this is a great investment for every woman!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she like it very much. She is very happy to use this product becasue she don&#x27;t have to take the apointment from the Beauty Parlour.  It is :  Easy to Use  Money Saver  Time Saver  Ofcource Painfull equivalent to Wax    I am giving rating 4 to this product because it results in In-Grown hairs in legs which obviously doesn&#x27;t look good otherwise this Product is the best for hair removal.</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these devices since they appeared on the market a couple of decades ago. This one is by far the best. Small, stylish, does the job very well. The bright light is very helpful in getting every hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Good epilator, even better razor.</li>
    <li> Love it. Bought over 3 years ago and it is still going. Gets the really short hairs so it can be used daily.</li>
    <li> Not chargeable has to be plugged in and is inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 years ago and it still works as new. I love it. I don&#x27;t think I would find a better product.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun epilator for just under 6 months. I am very please with it, I love not having to shave every single day. I epilate once a week, the first time it took well over 2 hours to do it because of the pain and getting used to it. Now it takes an hour for both legs. In between full hour epilating I do go over small areas needing touched up. I gave it 4 stars because it would be nice if the cord were longer and if it had an attachment to catch the hairs. Other than that I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quicker then I even expected, and used it a couple of times and can already tell there are less hairs growing.  I am really enjoying this product</li>
    <li> Bought this epilator because it was so highly recommended. Back in the day of coiled epilady machines, it took me 20 min. My previous epilator was Epilady and took ~30 min. This one requires a solid hour at least... You can go over the same area over and over and over again and it still leaves hair. It doesn&#x27;t grab well the well-visible hair, let alone the small stuff. I especially hate the fact that you have to repeat an area so many times to get all the hairs  in the more sensitive areas, which by the time you are done, are all red and irritated. I honestly can&#x27;t figure out how others could have given it such high rankings. It is the worse epilator I have had. For my part, I am going back to Epilady. Good luck.</li>
    <li> It has been 6 months since I purchased this, and I am a true convert from shaving.  The only thing better would be lazer hair removal.  The first three times it hurt, badly, but the results kept me coming back.  I started by using it on my lower legs and arms, but now I use it on upper lip, chin, arms, underarms, and legs/bikini area.  If I do it every two weeks, It takes about 2 hours now, well worth it.  If I wait 4 weeks it takes twice as long because it hurts.  The longer you let the hair grow in between the more it hurts, I suggest shaving 3-4 days before you do it so its not too long, or just keep up with it.      I was hoping that I&#x27;d be on the once-a-month program like others who posted, but 2 weeks is my maximum, don&#x27;t want the hair to get too long or numerous or else it hurts that much more when you start up again.  But 2 weeks works for me and is well worth it, I haven&#x27;t picked up a razor in months.  I am caucasian with thick dark hair.      If you&#x27;re on the fence, I recommend you go for it! I went on Amazon to research bulk razors/shaving cream 6 months ago, since disposable razors and shaving cream were costing me an arm and a leg, and this popped up in the search results.  Having smooth legs for weeks at a time is worth the \\&quot;me time\\&quot; it takes to do this, and I only wish I had started when I was in my teens so that I&#x27;d be at a more advanced level by now (after a few years you only have to do this twice a year).     The product itself is wonderfully designed for a woman. The cord and plug are nice, friendly white plastic.  The item itself hardly weighs anything, and if it weren&#x27;t for my own squeamishness the time it takes would be cut in half at least.  Two speed settings, a nice bright light, it&#x27;s very nice.  Yes, it is a bit loud but that doesn&#x27;t even matter.  I&#x27;m not a Braun employee. I used to buy disposable razors and shaving cream, and now I don&#x27;t have to!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for about ten years.  I was a loyal purchaser of another very popular epilation product similar to the Braun, but the other epilator would slow down over time and not grab as much hair as the Braun.  I also found myself purchasing the other epilator every year because it just wouldn&#x27;t last.  With the Braun, I stayed smooth for two weeks and yes, the hair does grow back finer.  Epilating is really good for people who have course and, or slightly curled hairs that usually get more ingrown hairs.  With epilation, you get less ingrown hairs, and of course stay smoother longer than shaving.  You also don&#x27;t get burned like you can with hair removal creams.  It&#x27;s not completely painless, but after a few strokes, the slight pain you may feel goes away due to the massaging rollers on this product. I suggest you lay down in a comfortable area and relax before you start the epilation process.  The Braun is also one of the fastest epilators I&#x27;ve tried and the smart light helps you to see every hair so you don&#x27;t miss any. The results are worth the little discomfort you may experience.  The only slight negative experience is it did slightly pinch my skin once or twice on one epilating session, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  As a veteran epilator, the Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle gets my approval and recommendation.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a timely manner and was excited to use it. In my haste, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions which specifically state you should not put the epilator directly onto the skin. After reading the instructions and using it correctly I used it again... I love it. I did my armpits.. legs and bikini area and the hair is gone. Great product. Just remember to exfoliate after and read the instructions. Oh and Pull your skin so that it is stretched.This helps to grab the hairs and not your skin.</li>
    <li> The product came just as described and I was SO SO thankful that I had read reviews prior to ordering. I knew that it would hurt and used several of the tips others suggested. YES it does hurt a lot but the hair on my legs didnt grow back (with exception to the ones I missed) for almost 2 weeks. I know some people had trouble with their hairs not picking up but I&#x27;m very fair and have medium dark hair and it worked just fine. The arm pits are a little tricky since you need your skin to be pulled tight for it to work and wow thats where it really hurt. I would encourage you to use it at night like suggested as I did get red bumps all over my legs. Exfoliating is also super important, I still have some ingrown hairs in my under arms but in time this will go away. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and just need to take the time to do it again.   *happy hair removing everyone!*</li>
    <li> This was my second epilator....I purchased a less expensive one (by Revlon) the first time around, since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would prefer epilation over shaving. Well, I&#x27;m hooked! For those of you who have never tried an epilator, I can promise you that your first experience with one will be painful. Remember the first time you plucked your eyebrows? It hurt! But after you&#x27;ve done it a few times, your body just seems to adjust to the discomfort and it never again seems as painful as that first time. Epilating works much the same way....it hurts like heck the first time you try it, but if you persevere through it you&#x27;ll find the results are worth it. Epilation leaves your legs incredibly smooth, and it lasts far longer than shaving. Better still, there&#x27;s no picky re-growth. You&#x27;ll find that the hair that grows back is the soft, fine hair your legs once had, before you started shaving it and stimulating that tough, picky re-growth we all know and hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun epilator is a great little machine, and it has some advantages over the cheaper model. The light really helps me to see the tricky little hairs that used to get away. The Braun unit also utilizes a different tweezer design than the cheaper model. On the Revlon model, both sides of the \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; moved, opening and closing quickly to pluck out the hairs. On the Braun, one side of the \\&quot;tweezer\\&quot; is stationary and made of a tacky plastic that helps to lift fine hairs....only the other side moves to create the pinching action. Because of this design, the Braun does a better job of grabbing the hairs, especially the fine ones. I had to replace my Revlon unit when the epilator went to pieces. All in all, the Braun epilator just seems to be a more sturdy machine, and in my opinion the superior design, more efficient epilation and other features make it worth the higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my little machine! And I can&#x27;t imagine going back to shaving and those picky legs!</li>
    <li> Well, I used the product for several weeks very happily. After that, I began getting really disgusting ingrown hairs all over my legs. I mean... ALL over.     That was March 2010. It is now February 2011. I still can&#x27;t wear skirts or shorts because of how horrible my legs look. They&#x27;re still covered in ingrown hairs that can&#x27;t be cured by any amount of exfoliating, lathering in lotion (3-5 times per day). I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist and he&#x27;s given me medicated lotion. No avail. I just want my legs back!! This is a horrible, horrible device, DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product, as she had just ordered one from Amazon... actually, she let me try hers after giving me a glass of wine! Mean! ;)    Anyways, yes, there is no way around it- this business is a little painful at first, but esp. if you have already waxed a few times, you should be able to tolerate it. But I am not rating this product because it isn&#x27;t painful- it&#x27;s an epilator, ladies. This  won&#x27;t feel great!    But it isn&#x27;t anything intollerable, and I think this product does a good job of minimizing discomfort to some degree.    What I am mostly rating this product on is it&#x27;s performance, tortuous though it may be... It removes hair well. It is easy to clean and maintain,  and comes with a cute little pouch.     I also like the electric razor feature.     I was lucky that I was pointed straight to the best- my sister has been through several different models, and oh, the horror! Why go through all the pain for no gain?</li>
    <li> Definitely painful but works well overall. If you want a really clean feel you will probably need to shave after as well.</li>
    <li> I liked the smaller emjoi that I also purchased, I like the smaller one for quick removal of those pesky chin hair that appears overnight.</li>
    <li> I am happy to tell everyone that I know they should buy one of these!  I love not having to wake up earlier to shave like I used to and the weeks that I can go without doing anything is amazing.  The razor attachment is wonderful, too!    Of course, the first time was a bit uncomfortable but it&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t take it.  And once you do it, it will never be that intense again.  I do it at night and the next day my legs look great.  The first time, it took a couple of days for the redness to go away but the pain goes away very quickly.    The light feature is one of the best parts!    I hated the massager head, that actually hurts!  I use the basic attachment and I&#x27;m surprised to say that I like the faster setting.     I really consider myself a baby.  I hate pain and my threshold is pretty low but getting over that first hump was totally worth the results of having incredibly smooth and hairless legs!  No more hair follicles seen in my pores.  Go out and get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Compared to waxing, shaving and laser hair removal (which I&#x27;ve all tried) this is a good hair removal method for people who have a fairly good tolerance for pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 Years and it is still like new. Great quality product. And it does its job.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and cozy, perfect for every woman, the material is high quality and very good price. I love 100% recommended</li>
    <li> This Braun epilator is a great improvement from those I owned in the past. This doesn&#x27;t hurt as much and is very effective in removing even the short hairs. Light weight and is great for traveling as well. Highly recommended! : )</li>
    <li> I bought this product less than a year ago and have used it about 4 times. I breaks the hair off instead of pulling it out. I noticed that it did this a bit from the very start, but it was not TOO bad. It rapidly became worse, and now that is all it does. It creates the worst ingrown hairs as a result. This is on the SLOW setting (as it always has been). I cleaned it diligently (which is a real pain in the rear with this one), and kept it in good condition. None of it made a difference.  As for the pain, it is no better or worse than any other.  Sadly, I thought that it might be better than the cheap Panasonic that I was using because the reviews were so good. It looks like I will be getting another cheap Panasonic. It worked fine and lasted a few years before it died, but it very rarely broke off a hair and it DID work up to the day it died.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used an epilator and this product is wonderful! I&#x27;m used to waxing so I had no trouble with the pain. I highly recommend this; great for the legs and underarm.</li>
    <li> By reading prior reviews, I was a bit concerned with the possible pain of using this Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body Epilator.  However, I decided to purchase this particular epilator after reading several reviews and the reasonable price.  I am pleased to reveal that it really isn&#x27;t that bad.  The first few seconds, it seemed worse than it actually was but as I womaned up &amp; just did it..it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it seemed!  I even prefer the highest setting for I feel it is even a bit relaxing.  However, I do agree with a prior review in regards to using everday for a week when you first get it (to get all the fresh regrown hairs).  I look forward to seeing if my skin will maintain the softness for a few weeks or so without not having to perform any maintenance.  I feel confident that it will succeed because it gets all my hair even the fine ones (after I go over a couple of times).  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it requires detail cleaning after each use, but that is to be expected I guess.  Overall, I am completely satisfied I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend who had a Braun epilator from Europe. She could not use it because the power requirements here were different to Europe and so decided to buy one here.  The unit looked well made but on using it, did not pluck the hairs on her leg from the root but it was as painful as her European model. She attributes this to the fact that one side of the pincers was made of metal while the other side was plastic unlike her European model which had metal parts to both sides of the pincers. In less than a week, her legs were rough again unlike 3 weeks when she used her European model. She was disappointed that it did not do a good job like her European model and so returned it.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product! What everyone says about it is true...the light is brilliant, the speed is great, it fits really comfortable in my hand, not painful (I have been waxing for years), love the little massagers, and after having a rechargeable epilator I much, much prefer that this is a plug-in (plenty long cord) as is maintains constant power and is always ready to use! Would absolutely recommend this epilator.</li>
    <li> I have been very frustrated with finding a good hair removal option for a long time.  Waxing is expensive and very painful, and I get 5 O&#x27;clock shadow from shaving!!  I decided to try this epilator after seeing the great reviews, and after a dismal failure trying the No No!  I was skeptical because I had an EpiLady in the 80&#x27;s, and considered it some sort of modern day torture device obviously invented by a woman-hating man.  However, I have been very pleasantly surprised by how great this thing is, and now I love it!  Before I used it the first time I followed the advice of another reviewer (have a couple stiff cocktails, take a hot bath and shave, then use the epilator every day for a week or so).  I will admit, the first time I used it it hurt!  But not as bad as waxing and not as messy, and after the first time I swear it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore!  It&#x27;s a miracle!  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it actually feels kind of good!  My only problem with the epilator is that I cannot use it around my bikini area because I tend to get in-grown hairs (the same problem with waxing).  I also have to exfoliate really well on my  lower legs to prevent in-grown hairs, but it is amazing that after only using it for about 6 weeks my hair is already growning in much finer and is much more sparse.  Again, a miracle!  I now use it about once every week to 2 weeks with great results on my lower legs, thighs, arms, and even my face.  I have never taken the time to write a review before, but this product is definitly worth raving about!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I have only used this product once so far. I have pretty dark, course hair which may be a little too difficult for the epilator to fully remove. It does hurt. Not as excruciatingly as some people have claimed but hard to handle all at once, so expect to take a lot of breaks. The area where the hair is removed looks good, but for me there was still some prickle remaining no matter how many times I went over the area with the epilator...not sure if this will diminish over time, but initially disappointing. I think it&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;m hoping to see better results as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for nearly a month now and I am delighted with it. It is easy to use, virtually painless and the light feature is very handy. I wanted to use the unit overseas and the info before I purchased it seemed to indicate that it was dual voltage, however that is not the case.</li>
    <li> I did a whole lot of research before buying this, my first epilator. This is definitely the best one in this price range. There are others that cost a whole lot more, but the extras just aren&#x27;t worth it. The epilator removes at least 80% of the hair the first time (usually more like 95%), even when I&#x27;m in a rush. The second time pretty much removes the rest of the 20%. While it was painful the first two or three times I used it, your body adapts and now I don&#x27;t really even feel it. I&#x27;ve even used it for my pubic area, and it&#x27;s definitely more bearable than waxing. This saves a lot of time and most importantly, there&#x27;s never any stubble when the hair grows back.     If you&#x27;re weary of ingrown hairs or possible infections, just use rubbing alcohol on the area before and after epilating, and remember to exfoliate the area regularly. This leaves skin smoother than shaving does, takes less time than shaving or waxing, and I&#x27;d say is less painful than waxing or even shaving. (I&#x27;m taking into account my clumsiness and tendency to nick myself when I shave.)     I used to shave every other day and now I can go a week or two weeks before epilating. Even when I miss a day, or even a week, there&#x27;s no stubble.    The product also comes with a razor head, making it a great value.     The best part is that I can epilate dry and all the dark. I&#x27;ve even done it while studying at the computer, all without having to worry about nicking off my skin.    Pros:  two settings  built in LED light  comes with epilator head and razor head  relatively painless  no stubble  time saver  can be used dry and in the dark  built well  long cord for extended reach    Cons:  still painful   potential ingrown hairs  loud    Overall: Great value. It does what it claims very well and even has a few bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> I have dreaded getting an epilator. I was scared of the pain, not gonna lie.    But this product, after the first initial shock of the pain, helped me to ease into epilator bliss. I like the fact that it has different speeds so that wimps like me can ease into the world of epilating and can go at pro speed once we&#x27;re used to it.    Only gripe is that it isn&#x27;t cordless. The bathtub is far from the nearest electrical outlet but it&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;ll manage.</li>
    <li> I bought this like a month ago and I love it!  It epilates the hairs wonderfull!  The first day its a bit painfull, but after that its wonderfull.  You&#x27;ll have to do it daily the first week and after that like monthly and every time more far apart. It works great, even my 13 year old daughter is using it!  Wayyyyyyy better that shaving, no more rashes and smooth skin!!![[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t ramble on but I agree with every positive review.  It really works!  I do suggest shaving first and then start using it the next day.  It is way less painful on short stubble.  I don&#x27;t really think it is painful at all on my legs but I have been waxing for years so maybe I have a higher tolerance.  Not brave enough to try other areas yet.  I am now using it probably every 3-4 weeks on my legs and I know that the hair is already growing back less and less.  A razor has not touched my legs in 4 months and I have not had \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; since then.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to shaving my legs again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a while to write this review, so that I&#x27;d have an accurate assessment of my experiences.  I&#x27;ve owned my Braun for about six months now.  I bought it because I hate shaving, chemical hair removers have a horrendous smell, and even though I enjoyed the results of waxing, I didn&#x27;t like the process.  It was messy, awkward and time-consuming to do myself, or expensive to go to a salon.    It did hurt the first few times I used it, but I got used to it quickly.  I would say it&#x27;s slightly less painful than waxing, and a good deal more comfortable because I can use the epilator by touch on areas I can&#x27;t see terribly well.  I recommend holding the skin taut where ever you can, especially sensitive areas.  This gives better results and makes the process much less painful.  The results were only ok at first.  My skin was blotchy a red after the first few uses, and I can only describing it as itchy.  I kept wanting to rub my legs.  After a few weeks of consistent use, this went away completely.  Each use caused less irritation, took less time and if I for some reason I can&#x27;t use it for a while, I get less regrowth.  After a couple months, my skin was smoother than the results I got with shaving.  I&#x27;ve been using it about every other day and at first I did notice more ingrown hairs than I get with waxing (though not nearly so many as with shaving).  I countered by ex-foliating every other day with a scrubby sponge and using the Azulene Oil that came with my Parissa wax to help sooth and moisturize my skin.  This did the trick.  You could probably use any moisturizer but I like the oil a lot because it&#x27;s scentless.  [[ASIN:B001FUUB0S Parissa Azulene Oil Aftercare, Soothing &amp; Moisturizing 2 fl oz (60 ml)]]    There are a few negatives.  The light cannot be turned off/on independently of the epilator.  It&#x27;s a minor annoyance, but it would be nice for spot checking.  It is also loud, particularly on the higher setting (which I prefer).  The shaver head this comes with is useless.  I tried using it for trimming as well and had better luck using an old electric razor with an attachment.  I also do not recommend using this on hairs longer than a quarter inch, it&#x27;s incredibly painful.    All in all, I really like this epilator.  It works beautifully, the results are great, they last a long time and it&#x27;s easy to use.  All the benefits of waxing and none of the mess!</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator that I have bought. It works great, you may have to go over some spots more than once but it will eventually pull out all of the hair. The combination of epilator and electric shaver is a great bonus. It is a little loud, but most all epilators are and like the directions say exfoliate often afterwards otherwise you will get ingrown hairs. Overall, I would recommend this product. But, don&#x27;t pay the full price for it!</li>
    <li> I used the sugar-wax process for many years (Nads was my preference) and over time I did see a significant reduction in the number of hairs on my legs and underarms, and many of the hairs that grew back were finer.  HOWEVER, I got so tired of the mess, and the entire process took way too much time.  So about 3 months ago I began looking for a good epilator.  A few years ago I had purchased a Braun Silk-Epil epilator for facial hair, and it worked well for about 4 years but then stopped being effective.  So, naturally, when I began looking for a whole-body epilator I went to Braun&#x27;s website first. I read the specs about each model, and lots of the reviews.  I already knew from my waxing experience that epilating would be somewhat painful, so that did not deter me.  I finally purchased the 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator -- and I am VERY pleased!  It fits nicely in my hand, the light is soooo helpful for seeing the fine hairs.  I do use the massaging rollers clip when epilating my underarms because that is the  most tender area, and the massaging rollers do make the pain less noticeable.  I also use the massaging rollers clip when epilating areas of my face. For my legs I use the Efficiency Pro Clip which covers a larger area of skin, and it works great!  Oh, and cleaning the unit is a breeze!     I have not used the epilator for my bikini area, I still use a razor in the shower.  However, I plan to try out the shaver head for the bikini area and see if I prefer it to razor-shaving.    Bottom line:  If you are looking for a tool that removes hair quickly and easily (and with less pain than waxing) this is it!</li>
    <li> The way this product removes hair makes for the perfect recipe for ingrown hairs, bleeding, scaring.... horrible product and waste of money.</li>
    <li> I read a mountain of reviews before I took the plunge but decided to give the Braun 5270 a try and I am begrudgingly glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the results are excellent, I think arguably I get better results using this little devil than I did with waxing, they are at least as good and there is no sticky mess to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for real, I don&#x27;t understand why companies that sell Epilators can&#x27;t stop with the false advertising, calling these devices \\&quot;painless\\&quot; or saying that the \\&quot;Unique massaging action\\&quot; makes it a painless procedure is just crazy talk.  Sensitive areas like armpits, inner thighs, bikini area, the first time you epilate will feel like the worst torture that a human being could endure.  I had to bite down on a soccer mouthguard to prevent myself from screaming or clenching my teeth to the point of breaking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why then, why do it?  Well, as most reviewer say and I&#x27;ll agree, after the first time it gets much, much better and in fact, IMO is less painful and troublesome than waxing and the ability to do it while watching tv is pretty nice.  It&#x27;s a convenient device and avoids the hassle and expense of a waxing appointment or a messy home waxing.  And if you&#x27;ve had the super smooth sensation after a good wxing, you know it&#x27;s just better than shaving, so you have to deal with a little pain to get that best possible look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both waxing and epilation provide a drastically smoother result than shaving but have a chance to leave you with more ingrown hairs.  So, read the instructions and do not skip the moisturizer and definitely begin using exfoliating scrubs as directed.  I have actually had fewer ingrowns or red bumps using this Epilator than I did with waxing or shaving, but I have been vigilant in exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it with the understanding that dear lord it hurts the first time, I give it four stars because they should not say it is painless or less painful or anything of the likein the advertising, and it is a little loud.oud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated waxing because of the skin damage caused from excessive peeling. This is my first tweezer style epilator and would recommend this to ANYone tired of shaving and lacking the patience to wax.     First off is to point out that, yes it will hurt like waxing. If you&#x27;re not used to it that is. Mentally and physically, you adjust to it so the first time will be the worst. This is always the case with hairs that haven&#x27;t been tweezed before. Just like the eyebrows, you&#x27;ll eventually hardly even notice as the folicles adapt.    Tips for first timers:  - I highly recommend using plenty of moisturizers after your first couple times, especially if you experience retaining redness.   - Keep the area clean before and after to avoid ingrown infections. I use a mini peel exfoliant every shower and lotion up afterwards. I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown and trust me when I say I have VERY sensitive skin.   - Keep the heads of the epilator clean! Use rubbing alcohol and the provided brush.  - Music and wine. Or a vaporizer if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a short while, so bear that in mind when reading this. I&#x27;ve been happy so far with the epilator part of the product. I&#x27;m accustomed to pain since i wax frequently so that hasn&#x27;t been an area of concern for me. It IS a bit louder than I would have liked it, but that&#x27;s not a major factor for most people. The only problems i&#x27;ve been having with the epilator thus far are some of the ingrown hairs i&#x27;ve been getting (on my legs only---my arms and underarms are fine and i haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere else).     My BIG area of concern however is the shaver head of the product. It is absolutely awful. It doesn&#x27;t get anything at all, coarse or fine hairs it just misses them. The ones it does get are not taken anywhere near the root. Using a dull 3$ razor is more effective than this. I was disappointed since i was hoping to use it as a shaver as well (for those times when epilating just takes too long!), but that function of it is largely useless.    if, however, the shaver head is just a bonus feature for you and you&#x27;re really interested in the epilator, i&#x27;ve been happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I am an epilator newbie - this is my first one, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I can only say that I am pretty happy with the purchase, even though it was pretty painful for a while.  Using it is about as simple as anyone could ask, and the product comes with several ways to remove the hair, including a decent shaver and different heads to reduce pain, which are moderately effective.  Let&#x27;s face it: you&#x27;re pulling hairs out at the roots.  There is no painless way to do this, but if you do it immediately after a hot bath or shower, it&#x27;s a bit easier, and after a while, if you use it consistently, the hair does come in a bit thinner and sparser.    I have very pale skin and very dark hair, so shaving is pointless for summer.  I hated waxing because of the expense and the pain of the hot wax plus the yanking and tweezing, and the need to plan ahead, plus I got in-grown hairs pretty often.  With the epilator, I can remove hair when I want to, and the cost has already been easily made up, for how many times I would have had to get waxed at a salon for $25 a pop.  I still get hairs that grow under the skin, but they are not as deep under as with waxing, for some reason, so they don&#x27;t cause painful bumps, and I can get them out easily.    Pros: convenient, good time and money saver, attachments that reduce pain, still better than hot wax    Cons: painful to some extent, some broken hairs with the attachments (this is reduced by a lot if you can take the attachments off.  This took many months for me to be able to do.)</li>
    <li> works great - I LOVE not having five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much less pain than the epilady that I had back in the 80&#x27;s ( that I was still trying to use, even though it HURT)</li>
    <li> I bought this back in 2011 and it is still going strong!  I was a little worried because (as far as I can remember) I had read somewhere this model wasn&#x27;t as good as another, but it is perfect!  I hate shaving and this definitely cuts down on the frequency of having to shave/epilate.  It is a little noisy, but I just turn on the TV and epilate away.  It is easy to clean if you brush it out after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my legs and underarms and while it is a little painful, the rollers help.  After using it for awhile, you get kind of immune to it, plus your hair grows back finer so it is also less painful then as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is a big help when trying to see where you may have missed on your legs, especially the backs of your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a really great purchase.</li>
    <li> Very Good Product, I recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I became a mom and wanted a way to cut down on the time spent shaving my legs.  This fits the bill.  You just plug it in, go over your legs kinda like an electric razor, then brush it off with the brush it comes with and you&#x27;re done.  My legs have never been softer.  I used to have stubble almost right away after shaving.  My legs were never soft.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with pain and I&#x27;m the world&#x27;s biggest weenie when it comes to pain.  Of course you are going to feel it but it&#x27;s no big deal.  The first time I used this was right after a hot shower and shaving my legs.  I used it every day for 7 days.  Then every couple of weeks thereafter.  Now I have soft legs AND more time to spend with my baby!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Every girl needs an epilator to epilate their underarms especially!  My armpit hairs grow right after a shave! So i always had to shave everyday -.-  But after I epilate it, the hairs don&#x27;t come back for at least a week! Its amazing!     The only downside to this is that it hurst like hell, every time i do it! if i do it everyday i might get used to the pain, but it hurts like hell especially the first time! Just go slow, ice pack the area before you start, and take pain reliever before using it.   Also it makes a really scary sound (as do all epilators) that makes you believe that it&#x27;ll take your skin off with the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t i promise!  I suggest putting the epilator on the palm of your hand, and you&#x27;ll believe that this is no scary torture device! it will simply massage the palm of your hand! and it makes you more at ease with it.     I also use it on my armpits, arms, legs and occasionally my bikini area. But i really like this epilator because it has a very white bright light that shows any unwanted hairs - a feature that not many epilators offer. I bought this epilator a year a go, and its still going strong! (:    Its a love hate relationship with this device. It hurts like hell, but gives you such beautiful results that you can&#x27;t do anything but go back to it.</li>
    <li> If you never use this before, imagine use a tweezer to pull hairs. The difference is this is 100 times faster but 100 times more painful because the motor driven roller has built-in mini tweezers. It is common sense. But again, if you have a hign tolerance to pain, it is cheap and can pull where it goes. I gave it three stars due to the pain to the point I quit using it at all.   Also, the tweezers need to make contact with hairs to pull. So this is good for hairs longer than 2 mm.</li>
    <li> Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;It is very, very good. I am happy with the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;My expectations justified</li>
    <li> Hi, I bought this product in 2010 and even though I know  that the guarantee does not apply since I think it only covers the first year, I would like to complain about its quality. My Braun 5270 Xelle Silk-Epil Epilator Model: 5395 had been acting weird for the past few months (slower than usual) even though I clean it fully after every use and today it did not even start! I bought this  product thinking that Braun was a top brand and that my money would not go to waste, but it was not my case. If I were you I would try to find a different product that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun Silk-epil for the last 5 years.  Although my old one was still working I decided to try a new model to see if it had improved over the years.  Wow! The new Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle is awesome. It removes hairs with little more that 1 pass whereas the older model took many strokes for the same result.  It removes hair much more comfortably - I like the idea of 2 different heads for areas that need a little more TLC.  The light is a really nice touch and the look and feel of the epilator is A+.  A winner in my book.</li>
    <li> this was the type of  epilator i was searching for. this is having excellent performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could. This device has been a lifesaver for me. I am too much of a chicken to go to a salon; however, with a little trial and error, I&#x27;ve learned to do the epilation everywhere, even on bikini and underarm. My smooth skin gives me so much confidence, and it does not hurt a bit anymore.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are a chicken like me, follow my instructions instead of the manual, provided you are willing to invest a lot of time initially. I said initially, because, after a couple of months, the pain will subside and you&#x27;ll be able to do it any way you want, while watching TV or lulling your baby to sleep. (Yes, the sound does soothe the baby! Consider that an unadvertized perk.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So here is how to start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) Take a long, hot bath. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) Shave. If you are persistent, that&#x27;s the last time you ever will. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3) Use SilkEpil on just shaved skin. Yes, there will be hardly any results, but there won&#x27;t be any pain either, and your muscles will relax; it&#x27;s important to get into the habbit or relaxing while epilating, reduces the pain greatly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4) Repeat next day (except, of course, no shaving). Heck, repeat later same day. You will achieve the results gradually while staying within your comfort zone as far as the pain goes. Do it every day until you feel in control, then gradually reduce the time interval between epilations to up to a month. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5) When you begin feeling pain on one leg, switch to the other. Somehow that reduces the pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6) Use long, quick strokes until you are comfortable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;7) Holding the device so that it rotates in the direction of the hair growth makes the process much more gentle on you and more time cosuming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;8) If you feel like giving up at any point, remember the 2nd epilation will be nothing like the first; the 3rd will be a breeze.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the product, my only wish is that it was cordless.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(Oh BTW, don&#x27;t let my nick fool you: I AM a woman ;-) )</li>
    <li> I have tried it a bunch, but can&#x27;t get over the ouch factor enough to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> used these for years but frankly phillips is better</li>
    <li> This Braun Epilator has tiny little metal slots that rotate very quickly to essentially pluck all of your hairs out. It came with a convenient carrying pouch and it was rechargeable so that was a huge plus not having to buy batteries. My wife got it in search of what every woman seeks, a better solution to shaving very frequently. Plucking lasts a lot longer. Other epilators on amazon have more metal slots to pluck hair or spin faster. The more and faster, the less painful and less passes it takes. I decided to get this one based off reviews. Some reviewers say you get used to it. One word to describe this product is pain. It successfully plucks the hair on the skin, but it is challenging holding this up to your skin knowing the pain you are going to receive. It leaves a trail of sheer redness as if the skin was chemically burned. If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t even bother buying this because it will tear it apart. She has never gotten used to it and would rather stick to traditional methods, as the pain from this was supposedly indescribable. It is a 50/50 gamble if you buy this epilator, or any epilator for that matter.</li>
    <li> I have never tried any other epilator, and I was a bit hesitant about its efficiency. But this product is great at pulling out hair, and much less painful than waxing. It says if can be used on other areas besides the legs, but I haven&#x27;t had the guts to try it. It&#x27;s quick and lasts for a couple of weeks. It leaves legs feeling smooth.   &lt;br /&gt;Drawback: if you are not carefull, you will get ingrown hairs, and they are a pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> Xmas present, and worth a try. I tried this everywhere except on my face, which I will never do. Underarms, bikini and legs. On the legs, just a tingle. Underarms, reasonably painful, and bikini, very painful, however, I heard from a friend that it is only the first time it hurts so bad. Afterwards, powdering sensitive areas helps with the redness and we will see how long before I need to do it again but overall, a great product so far, I am impressed that it actually works. Give it a try, if you are a brave person!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I really liked to be able to depilate my legs, vs shave.  My skin is softer, after 4 weeks of use the hair grows thinner, it is painless and easy to do.  I highly reccomend the Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator it is totally worth its price. &lt;br /&gt;BB &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I just got this and yes, like everyone else indicated the cooling glove and a certain attachment are not part of this kit. It is sort of painful, like a waxing, only a little worse. The hair removal is quick. Also, I noticed that many of the hairs are removed on the first pass over the skin, which was great. I didn&#x27;t want to go over my skin multiple times for skipped hairs, so this product is nice! The light and the blue sparkles on the design are pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> Buy this product for me was a good choice, it works excellent, but if your hair is very thin, this epilator doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I used another depilator for many years and was no longer worried about the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; since I liked the results. BUT, this epilator is FANTASTIC. It is painfree to use! I am sorry I waited so long to buy it. It removes even the small, fine blond hairs around my knees. The light is great and helps so much to see the hairs especially on the back of my legs. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.  It is painful to use the first couple of times, but after that it is much better.  One use a week or less seems to do the trick and there are no red irritation marks or stubble like you get with shaving.  I wish I had used this years ago and I will never go back to shaving.</li>
    <li> The Silk-epil epilators come in different sets - the number (  example 5100) tells you what should be inside the box ( once you open there is a manual that lists different attachment combinations , with numbers). I got mine in Bed Bath and Beyond ( nb 5170 , if I remember well ) and it comes with :an attachment for the beginners ( massaging one, plus a head with less twizers - that is very useful  you dont get too many hair out , but you can get used to the \\&quot;funny\\&quot; feeling and the pain lever ), regular attachment, and one for the best effects (most painful combination, the best working one; with this one I can depilate my legs in 20 minutes and the results are awsome) and one more thing cool pack - I still use the cool pack after the depilation.     When it comes to the pain level - there is no way that pulling out hair is not going to be painfull. You can make it better by taking a very warm shower or tub before the depilation ( be carefule if you have heart problems ), I would not recommend putting any lotions on the areas that you are going to depilate nor before neither after hair removal ( putting any lotion after can cause irritation and an ingrown hair problem ) .     If it gets to be too painful - shave the rest and depilate in two days.   After 3 months of using the silk-epil twice a month I can say that  I would recommend it to anyone .   I know that some sets come with the attechments for the face hair removal, I bought the attachment seperate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (a different version) for about 3 years now and it&#x27;s pretty good, definitely beats shaving every other day.  Trust me, I&#x27;m quite hairy.  It&#x27;s not the perfect product but very good.  My hair don&#x27;t come back for about 2-3 weeks. Small ones start to come out though but I can get away with those and if you keep up, I guess one wouldn&#x27;t have that problem but I get lazy.  I don&#x27;t use this product on bikini area because it&#x27;s too painful, instead I use wax.    In summary, it&#x27;s worth buying this product as it&#x27;s better than what&#x27;s out there for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This little epilator is the BOMB!!!  (It&#x27;s good, lol).    I recommend having professional waxing done before using it.  Otherwise, the first time using this machine can be uncomfortable.  If it is used to maintain a waxing it is a breeze - and can even be far more comfortable than shaving for those with razor sensitivity!  If the epilator is used for clearing hair for the first time, every time it us used thereafter will be a more pleasant experience by far.      A nice bonus feature is the attachable Braun shaver with a trimmer attachment as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good shaver. And the most useful thing that this shaver has is the \\&quot;smartlight\\&quot;.......</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product that I have ever purchased. I was going to buy the \\&quot;As seen on TV\\&quot; product but because of the reputation of Braun, I figured that if a product like this is going to work I will try a name brand with a reputation first. Boy, was I ever pleased!I haven&#x27;t used a razor or shaving cream since and I don&#x27;t think I will ever need them again. Not only does this product remove hair from the root but it also comes with a shaver attachment for the too close to pluck hairs. So actually you are getting two great Braun products in one.</li>
    <li> This being the only epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, don&#x27;t expect an unbiased review.     I think the product itself is great. I personally have terrible skin allergies which make it absolutely painful to shave, and because this epilator uses ceramic discs and removes a lot of ingrown hairs, it&#x27;s almost completely made my problem disappear. Which is great.    That being said, the very first time you epilate will be painful. I have thicker hair than most women who epilate, and the machine ends up breaking quite a few hairs instead of pulling them out. So I do epilate every few days or every day. But I literally drank five shots of slivova before engaging in any first behavior with the thing, and it was still painful and still took me upwards of three hours.    All that in mind, I recommend this for anyone who has any problem with shaving. After your first time, it&#x27;s so much easier (and you can use it without showering) and so much more effective than shaving. The Silk-Epil has a light on it which I think is great (I can epilate without having to be in really good light, which makes it more versatile). And it comes with a shaver, if you&#x27;re too scared to do bikini and armpits with the epilator (and you should be).</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected, but it is not for the weak : )  I am thrilled that I have it but no lie, it is not comfortable. However, neither is a trip to the salon and this is WAY more cost effective and better!!! Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum : ) smoother... Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love my Braun Silk-Epil epilator. I bought this new model to update my old machine after 4 years with me. It is great for traveling!</li>
    <li> If you want to stop wasting your hard earned dollars on hair removal products that don&#x27;t work, then this is the purchase you want to make.  It is by far the best and quickest hair removal product I have ever used.  If your can tolerate a little discomfort in getting rid of unwanted hair, like most women do, then buy it and save yourself a lot of time and aggravation.  It is not a permanent hair removal system, but it is the second best most affordable do-it-yourself method and beats daily shaving, stinky harsh chemical removal creams and messy sticky waxes.  The epil is top notch.  I have used it on my legs, bikini line, feet, hands and even the chin area.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ANOTHER BRAND EPILATOR THAT DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB AT ALL AND IT WAS NOT A CHEAP BRAND SO I CHECKED OUT ALL THE REVIEWS AND THEY SEEMED TO RAVE ABOUT THIS ONE SO I GOT IT AND I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH IT. IT DOES LEAVE SOME STUBBLE BUT NOTHING LIKE THE OTHER BRAND DID. I JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH TV WHILE USING IT. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO SHAVE EVERYDAY AND IT IS NOW DAY 4 SINCE I USED IT AND NO NEW HAIR GROWTH. AS FAR AS IT BEING PAINFUL I HAVE A HIGH TOLERANCE TO PAIN SO IT DID NOT BOTHER ME AT ALL. NEEDLESS TO SAY MY OLD ONE WENT IN THE THE TRASH.</li>
    <li> I love this, its a little more painful than waxing because I&#x27;m doing it myself and its slower but I can do it once a week and at home whenever I need it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now on my legs and I really love it and don&#x27;t have to shave.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]  After cutting my ankles with a blade, I started falling back on my electric shaver. But, the electric didn&#x27;t shave very well even though new, and made my hair grow in faster and more coarse. I decided to try epilating my legs again. I&#x27;d tried about 20 years ago, but couldn&#x27;t take the pain, so this gentle removing system really caught my eye. I read the reviews and got tons of great tips that really helped: exfoliating first in a warm shower &amp; opening the pores, (yes, I had a glass of wine the first time-but only the first), making sure to hold it at 90 degrees, cooling/closing the pores after, waiting 30-60 minutes then moisturizing. This turned out to be the greatest product and best buying decision!  It was a little painful the 1st time only on a couple of tender spots, but overall very tolerable. The 2nd time was easier, the 3rd a breeze. Those massaging rollers really do help, and after 2 months I&#x27;m already down to epilating my legs only about every 3 weeks. The hair is coming in slower, thinner and lighter. No more shaving for me-what a time saver!  I highly recommend the Braun 5270 to anyone who&#x27;s tired of shaving or waxing, but is concerned about if it will hurt too much.  A final note-the page I saw said there was a \\&quot;cooling glove\\&quot; enclosed, but it wasn&#x27;t in the package. Braun said this glove NEVER came in the 5270 model and has been discontinued for all their models, so don&#x27;t expect the glove. For now, I&#x27;m using a substitute. This gets an A+++!</li>
    <li> Other reviews have addressed how well this product works, and I concur (this is my fifth epilator and by far the best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first epilator and you&#x27;re not a regular waxer, you need to be prepared.  The first time you use it will hurt like hell, and you may want to just try to do small patches to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the pain will lessen over time for two reasons.  The first is that your hairs don&#x27;t grow in evenly, so the more often you use it, the fewer hairs you will be pulling out at any one time.  And second, it seems that after a while it just hurts less.  Maybe the nerves in the hair follicles get worn out.  But after a few years, especially on my legs, I can barely tell it&#x27;s doing anything, nothing more than a little sensation of yanking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hang in there, it&#x27;s worth it.  No paying for waxing and no need to let your hair grow so the wax will work.  No prickly stubble from shaving. And since the hair seems to grow back thinner or softer, no big deal if you don&#x27;t feel like epilating all the time.</li>
    <li> This epilator is great, it&#x27;s my first one. It hurts much at the very beginning, but then less and less. There is also a shaver head that can cut longer hair and leave just the lenght to epilate. I found the light rather useless. Im so happy to have it :D</li>
    <li> I got everything as advertised, including the little bag. The attachments don&#x27;t seem to stay on very well, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.     I find that I have to go over and over and over a spot before all the hair is gone. And yes, it hurts; but you can experiment and find a time of day/the month when it&#x27;s less painful, and maybe even take some ibuprofen in advance to take the edge off! I use this for a while until I can&#x27;t stand the pain anymore, then I shave the rest, gradually using this more and more. It&#x27;s great for the bikini line, but not for the (ahem) more sensitive bits, unfortunately.    Also, to deal with the irritation, I found something at Duane Reade called Bikini Zone, that has Lidocaine. Still, the irritation takes more than a day to fade for me. I haven&#x27;t tried any other depilitators, but I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
    <li> For someone that has never used an Epilator, this is very painful.  I took the advice of some other reviews and tried to use it right after showering and it was still very painful.  The pain did decrease a lot when I used it a second time.  If you prefer a very smooth, freshly shaven feel on your legs, this doesn&#x27;t cut it.  The hair was gone after using it, but my legs just weren&#x27;t super smooth.  This is a good product if you can&#x27;t shave for an extended period of time, so I&#x27;ll probably suffer with the pain occassionally when shaving won&#x27;t be convenient.  The trimmer and electric shaver feature, along with the built-in light make the product worth the purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I use to have an Epilady back in the 80&#x27;s and it must have been made originally for use in torture sessions. It was head with a moving coil, like a long, tiny slinky. I don&#x27;t know if it worked I could not get past the screaming pain. I chucked it and vowed to never, ever put myself through that kind of misery again.    Now, fast forward twenty years later. Despite my previous vow, I decided to take a chance on the Braun 5270. I was pleasantly surprised. It was nothing like that first, skin peeling horror. However, my tolerance to hair plucking pain is pretty good, so this may not be the same for everyone. It was a stinging I could stand and where the hair was fine and not too long, it was actually like a massage.    When I tried the beginner attachment it left too much stubble. The lower setting also seemed less comfortable then the higher setting. The advance setting still was not getting all the hair. I went for the gusto and put on the expert attachment, on high. It seemed to be the least painful and it took off hair and peach fuzz all around.    I would suggest for longer hair, you clip it first with the razor. Longer hair hurts like a bugger. Also, I have to say I did not do much of my lower legs, but I did do my thighs. Course hair (from shaving) does hurt more. I will try epilating after a shower and I am sure it will do the trick. I do know that after the first epi-session, the stinging is not as bad.     BTW, the light is a great edition. What a fantastic idea.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to keep my private parts a bit more groomed.  What I found is that it works fabulously for bikini areas, BUT I have not yet been able to get up the bravery to use it in the really private parts!  ADVICE: shave the area first and then as the hair grows back in, start using the Epilator.  I promise, this will make your hair removing adventure in your bikini region much more pleasant.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] This product is one of the best and hassle free items. This is the first time I have used an epilator as I used to wax earlier, but loved it from day one.     With the right way of using it, it is not painful. There is a tingling sensation, but then looking at the soft skin its worth the effort. Make sure to apply moisturizer after epilation.     The product has a very stylish packing, which even my husband loved and it also has a small bag to put in all the contents and nice to carry too. The product was delivered bang on-time and absolute value for money.     I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> very convenient to use, however little slow and makes a little too much noise :)  But still a great buy</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you, this hurts. It hurts less the more you use it and the shorter the hair is, but still is not painless. I just wanted to get that out up front. I do like this epilator and I think it does a good job. It gets all but the finest of hairs. I do recommend it to friends and family. Price is very good also. I do wish you could turn the light off sometimes. I even use it on my underarms, very ouch! had to do it in steps the first time. Hint dont wait more than a week to redo them, or it hurts just as much as the first time.</li>
    <li> I love it, after I saw how many five stars this machine has, I decided to give it a try, I was struggling to find the perfect hair removing method, did try waxing and shaving even thought about laser, but now I am so happy that I it, it even takes the tiniest thin hair, pain is ok, not too bad at all.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this as a replacement for my Emjoi Gold Caress.  I had used the Emjoi for about 5 years, but for several months I noticed it&#x27;s motor seemed to slow down and it wasn&#x27;t doing as good a job getting the hairs out.    I was really pleased with this product.  My Emjoi may have been as good at getting the hairs when I first got it, but this product may be even better.  It seems to get even the finest hairs.  Pain isn&#x27;t a problem, since I&#x27;ve been epilating for years now, but I did notice pain where my old unit had been missing hairs.    I&#x27;m very happy with it, and would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> After not having removed leg hair for well over a decade, I had them professionally waxed.  The procedure cost $115 and the result lasted less than a week.  So I bought this epilator, and it works well.  My legs stay clean for a couple of weeks, and there is not much discomfort (though I have little discomfort when waxing as well).  I have not had any problems with having to re-do areas, I keep the epilator perpendicular to the skin and barely touching, as in the directions, and I go slow.  The biggest problem for me is that the unit gets quite hot after a while, so I can&#x27;t get both legs done at once.</li>
    <li> Hello prospective buyer!    I bought this product only a month ago and it is amazing. I had been postponing purchasing this for over a year, and now i regret it. I really didnt have to go through all the difficulties before. This is a wonderful product that i recommend every woman needs. I know people say that it makes a loud noise, but thats negligible once you use the product. I wudnt say that it has a downside at all. Its a great investment.</li>
    <li> I have been using various types of epilator products (the ones that yank the hair out by the root) since 1989 with limited success.  The latest version I have, prior to using the Braun 5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator, is a optiMax Emjor.  Out of the various products I have used in these past 19 years, the optiMax Emjor was the best at removing the hair, but even then, it left a lot behind.  Pain is not a factor for me - I am someone who enjoys getting tattoos and I had a 10 pound baby with no pain killers, so pulling the hair out by the roots is no big deal.      All of that has changed with the Braun 5270 Silk-epil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator.  I used it for the first time last night and had NO underarm hair leftover.  This has never happened before with these types of products.  The only time I have had no hair under my arms was either when I shaved, or paid a pretty price for waxing.  Even with waxing, it didn&#x27;t last very long since the hair grows back at different rates.      I love this device.  I recommend it, wholeheartedly.  Since I no longer shave (two years!), found waxing too expensive and time consuming, and don&#x27;t like the smell of the hair removal creams, this is the best device \\&quot;since sliced bread.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I used to have the old version (I used it a lot) but this one has a new feature and I love it.</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life, I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs every single day.  It was very painful to use at first, but I got used to the sensation.  And it has been worth it.  Now I only have to use it once a week, if that, and shave the occasional stray hair.  My shower time has been cut drastically, and in the long run this little guy is gonna save me money on razors and water.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.  (As is my husband, no more evening stubble to contend with!)</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever! I highly recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I would wax the first time before you use it. Then a few days later use the epilator. I have used it all over with great results. There were a few hairs on my lip I continually tweezed, and I&#x27;m sure I was breaking them off not getting the root. Hence growing back quickly. Now the Silk epilator gets the root and they are slower to grow back and much thinner.    You do have to be careful about stretching the skin smooth in some areas. Under arms, behind knees, and lip area, but with practice you can do it. This epilator is so much better than the old ones. The light was a stroke of genius. Now when I epilate I only get a few hairs. It is well worth the money.    Please give it a try!</li>
    <li> I bought an epilator years ago and was very disappointed.  Last year I bought an \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; epilator and though it had one tweezer head, I could tell that the idea was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no expectation, I bought this one.  Background: I have a very hairy face.  I&#x27;m not talking fine facial hair.  Bleaching does no good--it just gives me white hair instead.  Nair is useless, so my only alternatives are constant tweezing, shaving, waxing or epilating.  I did the first three for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this epilator.  Although some people don&#x27;t like the little light, I find it helpful sometimes.  Regardless, the actual tweezer heads are wonderful.  Nothing is perfect, and I still have to use it more often than I would like, but that&#x27;s the fault of my face--not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is tough after years of waxing, so I notice minimal-to-no discomfort.  I tried it under my arms and it definitely was painful and not worth it, so I&#x27;ll stick to shaving there. Same with the bikini area (but I would try that again).  For my face--it&#x27;s fantastic.  My under-chin area is finally touchable, as is the rest of my face.  What I really like is that I can literally do it five minutes before leaving the house--and my face isn&#x27;t red.  If I were to tweeze, it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much that I&#x27;m tempted to buy another \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; anything happens to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT in 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would say that I still really like it.  I&#x27;m using the same one, almost six years later.  It&#x27;s used often--one to two times a week--and it&#x27;s still a great unit.  I still wish I&#x27;d purchased another one at the original price I paid (very inexpensive).</li>
    <li> Alright, so I will admit it up front---I have a love/hate relationship with epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the tender age of 12 or so, when I firmly told my mother I want to be hair free and demanded a razor, she instead gave me an epilator and told me that with coarse hair such as mine, shaving would be futile. After lots of tears I decided that NO, I will be just like everyone else in school and razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving through my highschool and college years, I have come to the practical conclusion that yes, momma was right and with hair like mine---COARSE, THICK,UGLY--razoring is futile. My hair grows out by midday and it&#x27;s just plain nasty. So I have returned to the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few months, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that I can go a week without the need to epilate, but alas--the ingrowns. They&#x27;re there, there ugly, and there are a lot of &#x27;em. But I&#x27;ve decided the ingrowns I can handle, the shaving everysinglefreakingday, I cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit keeps me hair free for about a week or so. The light whihc I thought at first was gimmicky, I&#x27;ve grown to love; also, the trimming head is something I use quite often. The pain isn&#x27;t as bad as I remember it being from when I was twelve, and the ingrowns I am HOPING to get rid of by using Tend Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this were cordless, I would give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I only review things when I really, really love or hate them, and this one definitely falls under the &#x27;love&#x27; category. I have waxed and epilated for a couple of years now, and the epilator I was using just never seemed to get those tiny hairs. You know they&#x27;re there, but can&#x27;t find them until your legs are highlighted in the sun and look like giant, hairy caterpillars.  The little light on this thing really spotlights those hairs- and the tweezer heads actually GET THEM! I tried it on the 40 head attachment, on high speed, with the massage roller dealies, and I didn&#x27;t think it hurt at all. It tickled a little bit at first, though. This is by far the best epilator I have ever used, both for being painless and getting the most hairs/highlighting them. I recommend it to anyone looking to stop shaving or waxing.</li>
    <li> So I got this braun 5270 silk-épil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator and it was alright at best. It does its job. And pretty fast too, I can do both full arms and underarms in about 20 mins.     What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that my hair growth is thicker than normal. I&#x27;ve been waxing for over 8 years and my hair had become very fine, especially on my arms. I could go 3-4 weeks without waxing and my arms looking bad. After I started using this epilator, my hair grows back much thicker and is more noticeable during regrowth. Same with my underarms and legs. Another thing I didn&#x27;t like, is that I seem to be getting a lot of ingrown hairs now. Which isn&#x27;t a great thing.    Overall its fast, easy to use, not very painful, and easy to clean.    Negatives: you need to keep it corded or it wont work. Which sucks if you&#x27;re not near a power source.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after seeing so many highly rated reviews and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad of an investment either.  The product does what is says and I like it very much so far.  And while there is some pain when your hair is being yanked out, it goes away in a second and you are left with smooth skin.  And while Ive only used it twice, Ive noticed you kinda just get use to it and the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; becomes expected and its more of a very small discomfort / prickle and really isn&#x27;t an issue anymore.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because its not cordless and there the little hairs that get yanked out kinda fly everywhere or build up in the little gadget.  So after each use, you have to take the head attachment off and clean it out with the included mini brush thingy.  Just good upkeep practices to keep the lil guy running, takes like 2 minutes. It&#x27;s a good investment if you are too lazy to shave/cut yourself every other day and its quick too, prob less than 10 minutes for both legs if you do a pass every 4-5 days or so.  Im im pretty sure ill work into a nice routine after a few more weeks &#x3D;o)</li>
    <li> The Braun Epilator has freed me from shaving daily.  I can now wear shorts everyday without having to worry about shaving first. My first experience with the epilator was a little uncomfortable but with each use it became less painful and I love that I am no longer a slave to my razor.  I can now say good-bye to the irritation associated with shaving. The hair on my legs now grows in very light and barely visible. I recommend this product whole-heartedly!</li>
    <li> From the beginning, I knew that ripping the hair out of my body would be painful.  I expected that.  What I didn&#x27;t expect is that all those hair folicles would also get inflamed and turn into ingrown hairs (even when I followed all the directions).  I stopped using this when I was getting a new scar on my legs (from deep ingrown hairs) every time I tried it.  Using it on my neck and chin I looked like I had razor burn.  I&#x27;m not even going to go into bikini line.  For now, I&#x27;m back to shaving my legs and using [[ASIN:B000BJ1HA2 Gigi Brazilian Bikini Wax Microwave Kit]] for my neck and chin.    I hoped I could use the shaver for a while, but it dulled quickly and got really back clogged with baby-fine hairs.  This product barely made it 6 months in the house.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This is the best and least painful epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. The light is fantastic.  I was worried because I had been using another top brand for the past 10 years, but this epilator is much better than my last, more expensive, epilator. This epilator does not accidentally catch your skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I started using Braun silk-epil 10 years back. And it still works. But that was 220V, which I couldn&#x27;t use here in the U.S. So I decided to get a new one. Someone recommended me emjoi, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try as I&#x27;m getting a rechargeable one with the price of braun silk-epil. Emjoi left my skin with too many ingrown hairs and it didnt even feel smooth. It left me with a really bad impression. I immediately returned the product and got a braun silk-epil. And its still the best in my opinion. About the pain.. any brand will cause the pain when ur hair is plucked. Trust me, there is no way you can have less pain when doing this. Only way to ease your pain is do it as many times as you can.</li>
    <li> This was replacing an older model - at least 10 years old.  I love the way it works and this model has a light.  Love the product and recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product so far, no issues.  It has worked very well on coarse, quick growing hair.  I have sensitive skin but treatment was not too harsh &amp; your skin becomes used to it, less sensitive each time.</li>
    <li> my wife seems to be at pain while using it but that she wants :)  she likes it and it works well for pulling hair out of the face, legs, etc</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now instead of shaving my legs.  It has never made my legs feel silky or smooth, the way that shaving did. It cannot remove the very short hairs that irritate me the most, but it does remove the longer, visible growth.  So if tiny stubble doesn&#x27;t give you problems, then this is a good product. But if you&#x27;re looking for great smoothness, stick to shaving or another hair-removal method.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my fiancee, who tends to forget to shave. She had mentioned that she might try it so I bought it for her. Initially it was extremely painful for her and she could only do her legs. She can now do her underarms and bikini area (still hurts, but is hurting less as she uses it more). She only shaves once a week if she remembers... but her legs stay smooth. Thank god. :)     She insisted that I try using it on my leg when she started using it. I didn&#x27;t seem to think that it really hurt. More just a pinching sensation. I&#x27;m not sure though. I am a guy and never shave my legs so maybe the long hairs made it less painful...?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but if you follow the directions precisely and trim your hair short to a 1/8 stubble and exfoliate, this thing works wonders. I did my dark, coarse hair bikini line and three weeks later -- smooth and the hair that&#x27;s growing back is finer and lighter! Amazing that the advertising on the box meets and exceeds expectations. Exfoliate a lot and use crushed aspirin in distilled water to soothe the bumps and visine to take the red out. It didn&#x27;t hurt me much, but I really exfoliate so that might be the reason why. However, I did my underarms and that really smarted. Worth it though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for my wife and giving her impressions. I bought this for her for Christmas 2008 and we of course tested it to make sure it worked. I was a bit worried after reading the reviews, that she might not be able to tolerate the pain. But she handles full body waxing without any problems so I figured it&#x27;s worth a shot.  We tried the head with the little prickly rollers as well as the head with the flat piece and the flat thing works better for my wife. Her biggest thing is it tickles her. We tried it on her arm first she barely noticed it, then we tried it on her leg and she felt it was a bit ticklish and then on her back, she squirmed a lot as it tickled her. The flat head tickles her less and grabs more hair. Then we tried it on her face, well that proved a bit more painful, so it took like 5 minutes to do her face, including sideburns. I figured ok, maybe it&#x27;s not working very well..... no pain, no gain, right?!  So I tried it on my lower leg.......  Ok, well, THAT was a bad idea! I have very hairy legs and pretty long hair besides and Yes it works, and yes if you have long thick hair it hurts. My wife has a lot of fine hair so for her it&#x27;s easy to use and being used to waxing she didn&#x27;t think it was working but she could sort of feel the hair being tweezed. But the hair needs to be wiped off as this just throws the hair out of the unit. So a few bats with a dry towel and surprise no hair! Yes you do have to go over a spot a few times and I now wish we had bought the Braun SE7280 instead, as it looks like it would be easier to use on her back. I myself own a Braun 9595 razor and use it daily and love it. This Braun 5270 Epilator is the same rugged quality as my $200 Braun Razor.  If you have thick hair this is probably going to hurt, so the suggestions about getting the hair short and then using this seem like a good idea. But for my wife this is a breeze to use and no pain at all. Of course if you have very dark hair and light skin you can lookinto Laser Hair Removal but this is much cheaper and seems to work great and it&#x27;s pretty quick except on her back. Of course I might not be doing her back right. I have a hard time waxing her back as it is. This is much much easier than waxing her back and much faster.  So she loves this and now it&#x27;s boxed up until Dec 25th. But my wife, a Filipina, Highly Recommends this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my Emjoi OptiMini Epilator died after only about a year. I found on Amazon that this is a common occurrence. This Braun removes much more hair, although it is slightly more uncomfortable. I suspect that is because it works better. It isn&#x27;t painful. The light is awesome. Previously I would have to inch up to a specific part of the mirror in my bathroom to see what I was doing. Now I can epilate almost anywhere. I use it on my chin as well as the traditional areas. It is too big to use on you eyebrows. Yea! I am free.</li>
    <li> I had an Braun silk-epil Epilator for the past 7 years and I just love it....The new one I got Braun silk-epil X&#x27;elle Epilator is as amazing as the old one but simply better....I strongly recommend it...</li>
    <li> As a woman with PSOS and excess facial hair, I have tried many methods of removal, but I finally found one that seems to work really well and doesn&#x27;t have the downside of shaving or having to have the hair grow out for several embarassing days before it will work.  I took the advice of the reviewer \\&quot;Mark Twain\\&quot; and I think it was excellent.  Hot bath, exfoliation, shave, then beginning to use the Braun that day.  Then use it daily after that (or until you don&#x27;t need it daily, I presume) I exfoliate with Boraxo Hand Soap (people always freak out when I tell them this, but it is wonderful.  I have used it on my face and body for over 30 years.)  I use it with an exfoliating hand mitt.  For afterward, I have mixed my own brew of witch hazel (with aloe or not), about 40 generic aspirins that dissolve, except for a little big of coating grain that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Then, I put on 1% hydrocortisone cream for redness.  I have only had two ingrown hairs (fingers are crossed).  It really does hurt less and less as you go on, though my upper lip is still a bit tender.  Even that is getting better.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is my third epilator-type product and I love it.  I have been using one for several years with excellent results.  The most difficult part is getting started, as it can be painful the first use especially in areas where the skin does not have much muscle underneath. Dedication to consistent use is rewarded with the best results.  I would not recommend it for use where the skin is loose such as the face and underarms.  Each time you remove a hair, the regrowth is softer and gradually grows back more slowly.  After months of use, there is little regrowth.  However, I wish it were cordless or at least had a longer cord, as I have to use an extension cord.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, albeit uncomfortable. It is like being tweezed a hundred times over, although the more you do it, the less uncomfortable it is. It does not have the rough skin side effects of shaving and the inconvenience of waxing. I use it most often on my chin and legs. Hell it also has a bonus interchangeble shaver head. I have not been as bold as to try it on my underarms and bikini line yet though. After a couple of uses it has more than paid for itself. And I am glad that I purchased it. I use it a couple of times per month.</li>
    <li> Extremely easy to use, and does a superb job.  It is small and very well designed to fit easily in the palm of your hand, not like my previous one, which was difficult to hold.  The built-in light is very effective, making it much easier to see one you have \\&quot;missed\\&quot;.  Well done Braun!</li>
    <li> This is INCREDIBLE. My skin is really sensitive, so I couldn&#x27;t shave very often, otherwise my skin would get all bumpy and red and gross. This epilator gets every hair, and it grows back lighter and finer. I thought the massage thingy was sort of just a gimmick, but it actually does work. It sort of counteracts the pain of the tweezers, which really isn&#x27;t even that bad. I had never waxed or epilated before, and although it took a little getting used to, the pain wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I had heard people make it out to be. It took a long time to do at first, even just doing my legs, but since the hair gets finer it goes a lot faster after that. Since there are different hair growth cycles, I did have to epilate a few days later, and I often times have to do \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot;, but it lasts for weeks.   So basically, this is freaking brilliant. Definitely worth the money. Get this.</li>
    <li> Good product.  It does exactly what it says.  It&#x27;s a bit loud though, so much so that I can&#x27;t hear the TV when I try to distract myself from the pain it inflicts.  Also, the pain cannot be underestimated but once you get through it (it took me 4 days to complete 2 legs), it does not hurt nearly as bad.  I gave 4 stars because of the noise and it does not always catch all the hairs on the first, second, third pass so I have to watch closely for stray hairs it misses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m serious. If they wanted to get admittance out of prisoners of war this sort of device would be what they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I knew pain, I&#x27;ve had broken arms, I&#x27;ve had deep cuts, and terrible sun burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ho-ly-crud this dominates all those pains. It&#x27;s like a thousand tiny creatures yanking at your soul via every little hair you have (even ones you can&#x27;t see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh it works...don&#x27;t get me wrong...but you will feel like a feathered chicken by the end of the whole ordeal.</li>
    <li> I heard really great reviews for this, but to be honest, I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied. I was ready for the pain, that wasn&#x27;t really a big deal. But if you are thinking about buying this product because of the little rollers; DON&#x27;T-they&#x27;re useless and scratch your skin. Also, it felt like it was cutting the hair rather than actually pulling it all the way out, because I have had to use this everyday for nearly two weeks and my legs are still not completely smooth. The shaver is useless as well, even if I went four-five days without shaving, I&#x27;d still be smoother than I would with that thing. I&#x27;m really not impressed-I expected a LOT more out of this than what I got. The reviews were what persuaded me into buying it, but I was very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I got one from Bed Bath and Beyond, then I bought this one because it was cheaper, the quality is good, but I didn&#x27;t like the packaging, it lack the brush to clean it, and I didn&#x27;t loke the bag comes with it, usualy Braun has very nice leather bag. bit it works fine, I may go back and buy one from BB&amp;B.</li>
    <li> Met all and above my expectations. Not painful at all, maybe it is just me used to it.   Thanks</li>
    <li> This epilator just does the work. It gets the smallest, faintest hairs and pulls them out effortlessly (and mine are small and faint as I&#x27;m not particularly furry :) ). It is the least painful epilator I&#x27;ve ever tried (especially when you put on the rugged head). Its bright light helps to spy the sneakiest of hairs. It&#x27;s just fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]]</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous to purchase this product.  It sounded scary, reading the description of the hair removal process.  The first day - it took a little time to get used to because it felt like tiny pinches every time the epilator went up and down my legs.  However, it&#x27;s one of the best investment ever!  It works amazing and I highly suggest it to all you amazon.com customers.  Throw away your shaver and shaving cream, you&#x27;re wasting your time!  Instead of shaving everyday, I use the epilator about every 1.5-2 weeks!</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator I&#x27;ve used since the 80&#x27;s Epilady with the rotating coil, which was torture!  This causes very little if any discomfort on my legs.  I would recommend using the ice pack before and after using it on the underarms, but again, discomfort was minimal and I had no irritation afterwards.  I&#x27;ve never waxed, so this was a big switch from shaving.  I think it&#x27;s a great product, and I graduated to the advance tweezer head almost immediately.  The light is a big help at getting those hard to see hairs.  It&#x27;s a little noisy, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> Yeah, it epilates...but I found that it would grab my hairs and my hairs would break in the middle instead of being pulled by the root.  What a disaster.  It hurt like a mofo too.</li>
    <li> This had been one of my favorite purchases ever made! I recommend it 100%, it won&#x27;t disappoint you.. K k</li>
    <li> I just want to add, this model is discontinued. The supplier obviously has a few left, thus doubled the price. I bought this model for $64.00 last winter. The upgraded Braun replacement is the Braun 5280 for $63.00 (search for it). Its pink in color and comes with an ice glove.    As for the epilator, I am a guy and I epilate my stomach and groin area. I&#x27;ve been shaving for years and dealt with years of itching, ingrowns, and pimples. I have tried all the creams but shaving just doesn&#x27;t cut it.     At first, it took me a few days to epilate my regions. It was the most unbearable pain one can imagine. I promised myself 3 months to try the product.  Now at eight months, its a breeze. It still hurts, but not bad. It takes me about 30 minutes now to epilate, as the hairs come out much easier and less painful. The hairs also do not come back as full, thus its a breeze.  I epilate probably once a month now instead of shaving daily. Its the best purchase ever.    If you buy an epilator, read the reviews and get an idea how to numb the pain. All I can say is give yourself 3 months before you quit.</li>
    <li> Unlike shaving, when using the epilator the hair grows back thinner and much slower.  It is less messy than waxing and cheaper than laser hair removal.  I really love this product.  Would have given it five stars but it is pretty time consuming...</li>
    <li> The starter attachment and slower setting make it easier to get used to the sensation. The light creates a backlight so you can see any spots you&#x27;ve missed.</li>
    <li> Excellent except for the shaver head which wore out too quickly</li>
    <li> Good deal! Is still working after 4 years.</li>
    <li> This has been okay in using and removing the hair.  However, it takes a little more effort in removing the more stubborn hairs on my face.  I am not totally sure I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> Love the light... you are able to see all the hairs that you would miss otherwise.</li>
    <li> This has held up great. I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year. The light is awesome. I had trouble seeing when I didn&#x27;t have a lighted epilator.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a couple years. Works great.</li>
    <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t need to be reviewed again, unless you have the pain tolerance of someone coming out of Guantanamo Bay, you will try to suffer few it a few times until the panic attacks make you realize it&#x27;s just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I use it as a trimmer and that works fine. But it&#x27;s a lot of money to trim some pubes.</li>
    <li> Writing this review after using it for more than two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Epilator setting can remove even the shortest hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;2) The mini light is really helpful when I&#x27;m in a not-so-well-lit place, or on some camping trip where there is no light.&lt;br /&gt;3) Epilating does hurt a lit bit initially, but I think the roller design is really helpful in reducing the pain. The good news is that in two years, it has stopped hurting almost completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) The epilator does not remove very very thin hair. It&#x27;s hard for it to grasp those.&lt;br /&gt;2) The razor is not as good as I expected it to be. It&#x27;s painless, but sometimes there are really, really small hair &#x27;stuble&#x27; still left, especially if you have thick and long hair growth!</li>
    <li> No more waxing in the salon.  You can use this every week and you will always look perfect! I recommend to wax in a salon or with someone before using this and then keep it as a maintenance so this way you can use eat easier and lest painful.  2 years with it and can&#x27;t travel with out it. First time will be painful but then you just get used to it</li>
    <li> I have really coarse, dark hair and I get tired of waxing, shaving etc.  So this gives me another options. Doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore that waxing it and really works well after waxing to get the strays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for like 7 years now, and still works amazing. At first it hurts but your body gets used to it. I&#x27;ve used it on my legs, underarms, and a little bit on the bikini area. It has saved me money, from using shaving creams and razors.</li>
    <li> If you are used to waxing or using epilators, this is a very good product.  Only good for legs though not bikini area.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for almost 3 years now. I do not miss the waxing bills (ive saved thousands), or the mess (waxing at home), or the irritable shaving (bumps, cuts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can deal withe initial pain, you will swear by this. It no longer bothers me. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Ouch!  Ouch!  Ouch!  Ouch! Ouch!!!!  Did I mention ouch?  This is one of the most painful things I have ever experiences and it didn&#x27;t even get all the hair.</li>
    <li> I hear no screams of anguish coming from our bathroom when Mamma uses this thing, hence I think it is working as advertized..</li>
    <li> This has proved itself to be a great little product.  I bought it several years ago, and it is still working good as new.  I use it on my lower legs and chin/neck.  I found the pain was a little too much for me on my thighs, so I still shave those, but I now only have minimal regrowth on my lower legs, mostly fine, almost invisible hair. I have to retouch them about every two weeks in the summer, about once a month in the winter. You do see a little of the bumpy redness for a few hours, but it goes away.  In the long run this is easier and cheaper than waxing.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator. I got it a few months ago and it works very well. It gets smaller hair that other epilators will not get. I like it much better than the emjoi optima epilator I had. It&#x27;s much gentle so it hurts much less...once you use it on a regular basis it does not hurt at all.  &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t start with long hair; shave first and then begin to use the epilator. The only reason I give it a 4 is because it&#x27;s not cordless otherwise it would definitely be a 5.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Good speed, the light is not very convenient and unfortunately can&#x27;t be turned off, not completely painfree, but close, a bit loud, but most epilators are, definitely improved performance compared to the previous Braun systems.</li>
    <li> Best epilator I have ever used, and practically painless compared to others!</li>
    <li> This works well. I have not had any problems with this product. It does its job. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Considering I&#x27;m the 90th reviewer of this epilator, there isn&#x27;t much to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said. Leaves your legs smooth for weeks, no worrying about being prickly a couple days after shaving. I particularly like it for my bikini line because it doesn&#x27;t give me the razor bumps that I used to get with shaving. Even better, it somehow gets those pesky ingrown hairs that are impossible to avoid, no matter how you remover your unwanted hair. And it picks up even the shortest hairs that have just poked through the surface of the skin. It&#x27;s also a great size, very portable, especially since it comes with a handy little carrying bag. And the smartlight is ESSENTIAL. It spotlights even the tiniest, finest hairs. Overall, I am very happy with this product, and despite the price, it is well worth it because think of all the $$$ you&#x27;re saving on razor cartridges and shave cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 8/1/12**&lt;br /&gt;My epilator just died after 5 1/2 years. Time to buy a new one!</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of eliminating the bumps and pain of shaving. I have a very high tolerance for pain and this was excruciating.  I would definitely recommend waxing at least once before you try this.  The whole point was to save some money so I did not wax my legs before trying this.  It seems to have left the same pattern of red bumps that the razor would, but I rubbed on some pure aloe gel right after using the epilator and it helps calm the skin somewhat.  The epilator does not seem to take to lighter hair; it removed all the darker hairs on my legs but left behind the thinner blonde ones.  I can tell that there&#x27;s going to be a need for round two in a day or so to remove the rest of the hair.  Bottom line, I would give this 3.5 stars, it does what it is supposed to but if you can afford waxing that is a much quicker, less painful alternative.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s a reason there are over 200 reviewers and this product has a nearly 5-star rating. i was an epilady user for nearly 20 years before it finally died. i loved the epilady and couldn&#x27;t imagine my life without it. i&#x27;d tried nads and waxing as well. but when my epilady died, i only looked for another epilady. then, my sister suggested a braun. she&#x27;s on these beauty forums and users had raved about the braun epilators. i read many reviews on the 5270 and couldn&#x27;t really believe what they were saying about it. it was delivered to me just last friday and i absolutely love it. it gets even the littlest hairs that i had to grow out for the epilady. and despite the slightly intimidating noise it exerts (sounds like you&#x27;re really doing yard work), the heavy vibrations disguises any pain i might be feeling. well, that&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve experienced thus far.     i&#x27;ve used it on my legs, arms and underarms. i was a bit overzealous with the underarm area that it caused slight bruising. one word of advice, be careful in those areas. you really need to make sure your skin is stretched out and firm otherwise, it will pull and pinch the skin, in a bad way.</li>
    <li> It has a high price tag......  Functionality is same as other brand.......it is okay.  I would say get a cheaper one cuz all it will be doing is pulling out hairs and getting hurt....</li>
    <li> I have dealt with excess hair for 25 years. It started on my Chin and got worse. Then I had dark hairs on my arms as well. I was constantly shaving and very self conscience. I was always afraid of someone noticing I shaved. 8 years ago I had laser treatments and spent a small fortune which helped but by no means got rid of the hair as I was told it would. That place shut their doors one day and I was left without the promised results. All I knew to do was constantly shave and hope it wasn&#x27;t very noticiable. The hair on my chin and down under was coarse and black. I decided to try the Braun even though not much was said about using it as I needed to. The first time I used it I had not shaved the hair for 30 hours. That left enough growth to grab it with tweezers so I thought this should to. I am not going to say it did not hurt because it did. Especially the first time because there is so much hair. I pulled the skin as others suggested and kept going anyway. There was some bleeding and you could see hair it pulled out on the mirror and such. When I grabbed all I could with it my face was red and a little bumpy. I used a after cream as suggested and by the next day it was just a little red. Due to my work schedule and the fact you have to let it grow more then you want to be seen at work I waited a couple days, didn&#x27;t shave it that night and used it again. This time was easier but still hurt. I noticed a great improvement in being more hair free with softer skin then I had in a long time there. Since I do it every Sunday and Wednesday where each time it picks up new growth due to the stages of hair growth but now after just 2 weeks today and using it 5 times it has gotten most growth and I no longer worry about people seeing that I have a 5 O clock shadow. It is gone and for me this is a answered prayer. For the first time I am not afraid for my husband to kiss my chin or caress my face around my chin and neck. I used it today and it was pretty much pain free since there wasn&#x27;t much to grab. I also do my arms and my Bikini area and it leaves the softest skin. On those areas the first time was the worst, not to bad since. I love this product and can&#x27;t say enough how it has changed my life. Ladies if you have coarse hair like whiskers you have to get rid of, this is the best. Anywhere you can grab hair with a tweezer you can use the Braun. A purchase I don&#x27;t think you will regret.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun epilators for over 5 years and thought it might be time for an upgrade.  The extra tweezers on this model make doing my legs a snap (so much faster and easier!)and the light really helps me focus on the area I&#x27;m epilating.  I&#x27;ve even used this on my upper lip and it works great! (Though this is probably not advisable for beginners, I used the Braun facial Silk Epil for many years and have no problems doing it. I think that facial model was discontinued a while back).  While this is fantastic for legs, I must say I prefer my old Silk Epil Eversoft 20 tweezer model for my underarms and bikini area because it doesn&#x27;t have as many tweezers and isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;grabby\\&quot;, so I&#x27;m keeping both. (Although maybe I just need more practice with the new one).  I must have saved thousands of dollars on waxing over the years by using Braun epilators. I highly recommend this epilator!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have had this years ago!!!  I&#x27;ve tried every method of hair removal available, this is far and away the best!  Far less painful than waxing, more practical than shaving.    Within an hour of first getting this I had done my legs, arms and face.  It is very fast and works right into my regular routine.  I noticed that it worked best on 1-2 day stubble after shaving.    Tip: Use a loofah sponge to reduce ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I will rather take the one time pain of using this epilator, than deal daily with razors, bumps, itching and burns. Please remember, however, that the pain is relative to each person&#x27;s perception and sensitivity. For a good reason I can take a lot of pain without a blink, but that is my subjective measure. On the other hand, this unit seems to produce much less discomfort than my old, spiral type, epilator.   Pain issue aside, this is really the best corded epilator/trimmer/shaver I can find on the market. Does a great job from face to foot, quickly and cleanly. I even use it for a quick touch up of my head hair line. With a regular use the re-growth becomes slower and weaker. For the beginners it is important to use it several times during the first about two weeks. That is to catch up with hair re-growing after previous shavings or other treatments. Once your body is free of hair, a touch up now and then is all you will need for a long time. Each consecutive treatment is less painful and less irritating, until you come to a point when the treatment feels more like a massage than hair removal. I even did my armpits - with a lot more discomfort (pain) than any other part of the body, but oh boy!, was it worth it. Not a single ingrown hair or bump like after shaving, no chemical irritation from lotions, no pealed skin cells from waxing. Just remember to use plenty of good quality moisturizer directly after the treatment to prevent skin redness and tingling. More sensitive skin will need several hours, maybe even a day or two to \\&quot;cool off\\&quot; before public appearance. It is very important to clean the unit VERY often - works and feels better. The cord is plenty long and the light is very useful. All the little attachments are very handy, especially for the initial treatments. Trim longer hair before pulling it - it is more effective and less irritating. Don&#x27;t shave unless you absolutely must - hair after shaving grows back stronger and darker. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This product gives excellent results, leaves your skin silky-smooth. But i would suggest for the stage when the hair starts to grow back, you should have a skin solution that prevents ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> loved this product..a little painful at first i admit..but if u concentrate on the end product..then u wont mind the millions of tiny pinches..2nd time was a smooth experience..also the light is a big help..will definitely recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> this is my first epilator.  i am not very sensitive to pain, and i find it comfortable to use.  i recommend epilating once a week and exfoliating daily.  as i read in other reviews, the spotlight is very helpful and distinguishes this one from its competitors.   plus braun is a great, reliable brand; i&#x27;ve been happy with all of their products that i own, including this one.</li>
    <li> This product works great. Remember you are doing an unnatural act buy pulling out hairs by the root. In most areas of my body it wasn&#x27;t painful. But other areas it was somewhat painful. It does the job I wanted it to. Very satisfied overall</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for getting rid of unwanted hair in the pubic area, I haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere else. It is definitely worth the money! The light is absolutely necessary and all the attachments make it very versatile. Would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Quickly noted, it IS painful. I use this product between waxing every few months to stretch my $.  I have to take breaks and am red after, but it is a great product and does what it claims.  The light is great!  I use in the shower stall before I turn it on and all the hairs fall in there.  I bought mine at Target.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to epilation so naturally I was worried about the pain.  It did hurt for the first few minutes but gradually got better.  It is definitely worth the pain because instead of shaving every other day, now I can go a few weeks without worrying about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the intention of using it as a replacement for shaving and am pleased with the overall results.  I have fine, sparse (but dark) hair and this works well for me.  The pain is quite a shock at first even for me, a person with a high pain-tolerance but as my hair has gotten finer the pain has lessened significantly.    The best:  it works especially well on the underarms.  I find that I can go for a week and a half without seeing stubble as opposed to the next day with shaving.    The good:  the replaceable attachments are great for buzzing other body hair and have liked this feature for my arms and bikini area.    The semi-good:  works so-so for the legs.  Of course, ingrowns have become more common and I haven&#x27;t found an exfoliator I like yet.  Per the reviews here, I will assume an exfoliator will alleviate this problem significantly.  I find my legs are not so much softer as they are less \\&quot;hairy looking\\&quot;. I usually epilate then do a good shave.  The shave lasts about a week then.    The bad:  the pain.  Get ready for it, but by no means should this deter you from purchasing this.  Like I said, hands down its worth it for the underarms alone.    Note:  this will not come in the sparkly blue with pink on button.  Mine came entirely blue.  No biggie.  Definitely get this.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am use to a clean look after waxing, the pain is not too bad, the only complain I have is that it still breaks hairs so it still leaves stubb look, like you have shaved.  the broken hair grows ugly.  But over all it is good on a pinch if you don&#x27;t have time to wax.</li>
    <li> I regularly get a leg and brazillian wax once a month which would cost me about $140.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am a regular waxer, not a whole lot of hair grows in every month so this epilator works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I mean: It&#x27;s still painful like waxing, but waxing is faster so waxing is better for that reason. So, I can&#x27;t imagine having never waxed and then trying to epilate my leg! My advice would be to not shave for at least 4 weeks, get waxed, and as the hair grows back (when it&#x27;s the right length) go ahead and epilate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my first time epilating hurt to the point where I thought I couldn&#x27;t continue, BUT I kept doing it and my skin went a little numb and it just didn&#x27;t hurt as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as far as the brazillian and me trying to epilate down there...well let&#x27;s just say I got as far as my bikini area, butt, and between the cheeks. For some reason the butt and in between the cheeks don&#x27;t hurt. So, I&#x27;ll still pay for a brazillian but that&#x27;s only $60.&lt;br /&gt;And who knows, maybe there is a numbing spray out there and I will eventually be able to do everything myself!</li>
    <li> Allright 1st off I have never tried an epilator before. I have done waxing , shaving and nair.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this product is the best solution for guys looking to get rid of unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving gave me razor bumps and ingrown hairs and the results lasted only for a day.&lt;br /&gt;Nair was the same thing ( ingrown hairs ).&lt;br /&gt;Waxing is just too mesy and can be kind of hard to do by yourself in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;This epilator works just fine and the results lasted for a solid week before I had to go back and re epilate.&lt;br /&gt;The special massage head does help to reduce some of the pain and the built in light helps make sure you don&#x60;t leave any stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;My advice for you men looking for a better alternative to shaving or waxing would be this product.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I myself found usefull :&lt;br /&gt;1  There is pain involved. So if you are a wuss don&#x60;t bother. But cmon now if a sexy lil gurl can do this why can&#x60;t you ???&lt;br /&gt;2  Wash skin with warm water before epilating to open up your pores making the process a lil easier.&lt;br /&gt;3  This is NOT an electric razor so don&#x60;t use it the way you would a razor. SLOW steady strokes making sure you let the machine get all the lil hairs. If not your going to end up with a lot of strays.&lt;br /&gt;4  After you are finished epilating I recommend you use PRINCE REIGNS INGROWN HAIR SERUM on the epilated area.&lt;br /&gt;5  Exfoliate your skin,  this can be done easily while in the shower with a luffa make sure you scrub really well to get rid of all the dead skin to help minimize any ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;6  If possible epilate before going to bed. This way you allow your skin to heal while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;So yeah it does hurt but the end result is worth it. After a while you get used to the pain involved. The best way to describe the pain if your wondering would be that same feeling you get when your leg has fallen asleep and starts to get all the lil needle prickling sensesations.&lt;br /&gt;The most painfull areas I found where around the belly button and around the knee.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps any of you guys wondering if this is for you or not.eview helps any of you guys wondering if this is for you or not.</li>
    <li> I got my epilator yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  I&#x27;m not going to lie to you...it hurt!  The first few passes on my legs had me holding my breath and breaking out in a sweat.  But as the remaining hairs became more sparse, the discomfort reached a much more manageable level.  I truly believe that future uses will prove less painful or even painless, especially if the product is used regularly to pluck out hairs as they come in. I even got up the nerve to do my underarms and bikini area!  All areas are a bit red right now (I just finished) but not a whole lot worse in the bikini area than after I shave, so I am positive it will clear up shortly. The best part...my legs are wonderfully smooth and should stay that way for a lot longer than if I had shaved them.  It makes a little pain worth it in my book!    As for those who think that this epilator is simply breaking off the hairs, I know for a fact that this is not the case.  The hairs I found on the ground and in the machine were at least twice as long as the growth on my legs, indicating without a doubt that they were pulled by the root.    So after my very first use (and a fair amount of pain) I am still going to recommend this product! I look forward to being \\&quot;shave free\\&quot; and yet smooth and glorious all summer long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used braun epilator for the past 8 years, they are the best way to epilate as I personally hate waxing/shaving. I got this one couple of years back. Epilator is the quickest and hassle free product that lasts for years. It only pains slightly, once you have used it few times, its really no big deal. The light is a great addition to this version. Only negative point is the sound it makes, if that can be reduced then great.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, fast growing hair on my legs and have to shave every day.  Getting sick of doing it every day I thought I&#x27;d try this technique.  Thought about waxing but went this route.  I did my homework on which ones were reviewed as the best and bought this one.  OH...MY...GOD!!!  This thing really does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I couldn&#x27;t force myself to finish the job from the pain.  The little strips that I could get done all the way looked great, but there was just too much pain.  There was no way I could finish the lower leg let alone move to the more sensitive areas like the upper thigh or bikini line. I suppose it&#x27;s not the machine itself&#x27;s fault, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again.  Like I said it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do but if you can&#x27;t handle the pain, save the $70.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is painful at first, but with continued use, the pain is gone. It is totally worth the money...I was surprised to find that it actually works. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to remove hair...while the hair removal is not permanent, it has drastically reduced the number of times I have to shave a week, which is very nice. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The epilator works great and the attached light is very helpful for finding stragglers. The bonus razor attachment is very nice too. My only complaints are that it can really hurt with thick hairs and it causes ingrown hairs where my hair is finer, like on my legs. I got this for my armpits where I always have razor burn from regular shaving. The epalator causes red bumps on my underarms at first, but they go away by the next day... and the hair was gone (for the first time) for 2 weeks. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this product -- and I thank whomever reviewed it in the past saying it&#x27;s important to exfoliate the skin in between using... because those ingrowns can be tedious.   To be honest, I&#x27;ve taken to using a standard callous remover for heels and rubbing that over my legs to get rid of excess dead skin, and that seems to do the trick -- for me.   I love this thing. I&#x27;ve used it (and others like it) for several years now, and have found that you can either wait the six weeks to get hairy, or use it every week or two to keep maintenance. Up to you!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I used it on my legs and arms last night and it was fantastic.  I does take a while to finish four limbs (two and a half hours) I&#x27;m new to the process so I hope that eventually it&#x27;ll be much faster.  I would suggest doing it inside the tub (with no water) that way the hair doesn&#x27;t get all over the floor.  Lets see how long it I&#x27;ll be fuzz free.  I noticed that if I prepared my skin with the beginer head, I could tolerate the advanced head for finishing and getting all the stray leftovers.  I wish you happy Epilating!</li>
    <li> This product is really good... It helps remove even the short hairs... Very easy to operate and also the work gets completed in a short while sitting at home rather than going to a parlor for wax.</li>
    <li> Wow... I really scored some points with my wife when I purchased this thing.  She previously had another brand epilator that she seemed very happy with. It held up pretty good, but finally died after about 3 -4 years.  She mentioned it to me so I took a look at it and it was truely beyond saving.  I took it upon myself to save the day and checked out numerous different brands and models before selecting the Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator for purchase.  I was a little leary about doing this as my wife is sometimes hard to please, especially when it comes to buying her \\&quot;lady-things\\&quot;.  I got a pretty good price from Amazon.com and the order arrived in just a couple of days.  She used it that night and the verdict came in and it was very positive.  She told me it was so much nicer than her previous epilator and worked much faster.  She remains thriller with it and I have benefitted from that in many way (of which I will not discuss on a public forum).  Needless to say, I am giving this a five star rating.  I think if my wife were writing this she would try to give it at least six stars.  A very nice product that very much lives up to what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything, waxing,shaving,threading, u name it I&#x27;ve done it.  I used this product first time yesterday and it works miracles. Its much faster than waxing and gets even the tiniest hair out. the results are awesome... I would recommend this to anyone who has serious problems with hair growth. I was a little scared to use it, since alot of the reviewers said it hurts, and I admit it does, but just like waxing your body gets used to it after a few times.</li>
    <li> Let me start saying that I did not acquire this item for myself but for one of my nieces. She made a concious decision based in all of the details of the product and comments from the users. She seems to be comfortable with her choice and is currently using the device.    It&#x27;s actually me who has some reservations about this kind of things; I am sorry but, how come in the 21st century is possible to find somebody who claims that \\&quot;beauty hurts\\&quot;? Is this really necessary? Have we not learned anything during the past 20 centuries about needless methods such this one?    I do not pretend to be self sufficient (or too much anyway), but certainly I prefer to devote 10 more minutes every morning to myself instead of saving those minutes at the expense of suffering or pain in any way it may come.</li>
    <li> This epilator is definitely a keeper.  I&#x27;m a girl and I have facial hair, especially in the chin area. I used depilatory creams or waxes before I decided to try an epilator.  Other epilators gave me razor bumps and had trouble removing some of my facial hair.  This one works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I will continue to use my razor for my underarm area but I definitely give this product two thumbs up for facial hair removal.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my Braun, I no longer shave in the shower.  This results in less wasted water and less drying out of my already dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light in this device is great if you are on a mission to pull out each and every visible hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things to realize about this method of hair removal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hairs are always growing in on different cycles.  Even if you epilate to the point of silky skin, there will always be a series of new hairs ready to appear, even though the ones you just pulled out will be gone for six weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This product cannot work unless the hairs are grown out far enough to be grabbed and pulled out.  This is not so much an issue for legs as it is for underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the Braun is not responsible for either of the above two factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with my Braun, largely because showering no longer seems like a chore in terms of shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product yesterday after extensive research and I must say it is fabulous. I was a little frightened by the mention of pain so many times but thought I would try it out and the pain is minimal and is really only prominent is certain spots. The variety of attachments are incredibly useful. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> PAIN:    The product description is very misleading. Using this is by no means &#x27;painless&#x27; nor does it feel like a &#x27;massage&#x27; where the rolllers &#x27;glide over the skin&#x27;. Don&#x27;t be gullible, ripping out hair from the roots cannot be such a pleasant and relaxing experience.    The level of pain depends on where you&#x27;re using this.. I had no problem doing the lower half of my legs/arms; the upper halves hurt a little more; underarms hurt quite a bit depending on how taut my skin was (tauter hurt less); and I will probably never try the bikini area again.    I&#x27;m sure it will hurt more/less depending on each person&#x27;s waxing/shaving history, on the thickness/fineness of the hair, and your level of tolerance for pain.     RESULTS:    Unless all of your hair grows at the exact same rate, you probably won&#x27;t have perfectly smooth skin for &#x27;up to 6 weeks&#x27; as claimed. However I&#x27;ve found that the porcupine/cactus-like feeling that comes with stubbles growing back after 3 days, is significantly reduced. Also, fair skinned people with dark hair don&#x27;t have to worry about the leftover roots showing through from under the skin after shaving. It&#x27;s an added value for people whose hair color is much darker than their skin&#x27;s.    You may have to do a quick shave or epilate or pluck for maintaining the near perfect hairless skin; straggler hairs are bound to appear for most people.    USAGE:    It is pretty loud for its size and I wouldn&#x27;t use this at night where there are people sleeping nearby. It&#x27;s probably almost as loud as my hair dryer.    Sadly there is no depository for the plucked hair so your floor/bathroom can get rather messy. Don&#x27;t use this on carpeted floors.    I love being able to epilate at my leisure in the comfort of my own bathroom. And if you pay to get waxed regularly, this epilator will pay for itself over a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This Epilator is the best one I have seen and used and the light is a plus.  It lets you see everything.  I have been using this item for almost a year now.  You have to go over the area several times to get all the hairs.  Pulling hair out hurts, but you get used to it in time.  What I have found out and it&#x27;s very frustrating is my leg hair grows back in a week or less.  My legs are NEVER smooth, they are bumpy.  I get ingrown hairs that I have to get with the tweezers, which leaves red sore looking marks all over my legs.  My legs looked better shaving, smooth and nice looking, though I had to shave every day.  This you use once every 4 days.  Some of the hair, but not many have gotten thinner, most have gotten thicker.  My legs are really ugly now, with ingrown hairs, sores from digging out ingrown hairs, and I have pain every 4 days.  The pain is from the ingrown hair when you wear pants and it rubs against your legs.  It is very uncomfortable and I try to exfoliate before using the epilator to get the hairs out so my legs will stop hurting.  Why am I still using this?  I am hoping that some day my hair on my legs will stop growing if I pull them out by the roots long enough.  Though my boyfriend wants me to start shaving again, so I can have smooth legs again.  This product is the best epilator you can buy, but their are problems with using it like I said above.  It works great for my daughter who has always been embarressed about her hairy arms.  We use the shaver that cuts the hair short, not pull the hair out, and my daughter is no longer embarressed about showing her arms now.  So there is other uses for this product.  I just wish I could be more happy about how it is on my leg hair.</li>
    <li> I was used to wax, but this is much better. No mess and it works all over the world! (Dual voltage)&lt;br /&gt;Love it and recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this 10 years ago, and the razor head just stopped working last week. Up until then, the machine has worked amazingly. Super high quality product and a really good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator in April 2007 - it was my first epilator, so I didn&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to at the time. At first I thought it worked decently well - I hated having to shave every day and the idea of only having to epilate only once every couple weeks or so appealed to me. The problem with this epilator is that it would take me well over an hour to get both of my legs done. Also, I had tons of ingrown hairs, which I bought several different creams/lotions to help remedy (without success). I was determined to continue epilating, though, to avoid having to do that daily shave. In October 2011 I decided to try the [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]] and for me, this one was leaps and bounds better. My epilating time was cut in half and even though I still have some ingrown hairs, there are not nearly as many as I had with the Braun epilator. Based on my experience, I would recommend the Emjoi over the Braun.</li>
    <li> I always used a braun epilator. They are great but this time Amazon disappointed me as I received a faulty piece. I had ordered one for my travel purposes and had carried it new. I didnt get a chance to open it while I was here. It never worked. The plates were not aligned well (probably) as it kept getting stuck and didnt pluck hair really well. I stopped using it immediately. I didnt have a chance to return it as I was travelling. I am sure Amazon will take better care in shipping products. Please be careful with what you receive and check your order as soon as it arrives.</li>
    <li> Of course it hurts (above the knee - below the knee there is no pain or discomfort). But it gets out the leg hair with little effort. I have tried others, not as good. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it does work good, but to be honest its too painful for me to use and so I went back to shaving. Maybe one day will do laser had removal. Maybe its just I&#x27;m too sensitive to this kind of pain. I was really hoping this product would work for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have never waxed in my life or used any epilators/razors on my legs and arms before. This is my first epilator and I bought it after my sister recommended it. It was painful for first few uses as I am not use to that pain. No pain if yuu just use razor head. After use your skin becomes very smooth and silky. I love it. But make sure you use it the night before or over the weekend as I had some red spots that were gone the next morning. Also, you need to visit the spots more than 2-3 times to get rid of all the hairs but if you use epilaor then you are good for 2-3 weeks. As far I am happy with the product but it is little pricky.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an epilator. Everyone who had tried one in the past told me it would hurt badly, but i was pleasantly surprised. This removed almost all of the hair on my legs with very little pain and it is easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> I must admit I was skeptical, but I am now very pleased to report that it does work!    When used initially, it stung like the devil, due to so much hair that needed removal. I would say that I got about 90% of the hair on that pass. Did it again the next day, and got the rest.  Since then, 3-4days pass before a few hairs have resurfaced that need treatment. And now, these \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot; only have a minor sting. FAR less than the first two times.   I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night...and wow! Anyone who rates this product poorly because of pain needs to evaluate what they should have expected. Can we say 40 tweezers? It is pulling hair out of your body...shouldn&#x27;t that tell you it&#x27;s going to hurt?    I took the advice from one of the other reviewers. I took a couple allieve PM&#x27;s, took a very hot shower and scrubbed the areas with a rough loofah...then I tried it. (ok, tried it the night before, did my arms and was ok...then my legs. Couldn&#x27;t make it through.) It helped sooo much! I was able to get both legs done-thighs and calves. I even got near the bikini area...and was OK. My legs aren&#x27;t completely smooth yet, I&#x27;ll do it again in a couple days to get the hairs that were just way too small (hair grows at different rates). I do want to say, though, it got hairs I couldn&#x27;t believe were long enough...so much better, and cheaper, than waxing!    Great product if you have REALISTIC expectations! Bring on summer!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this epilator and I love it.  It works very well, does not hurt that much (except for underarms and thighs, if you are used to removing hair from the root), and is not messy.  The smartlight is also very convenient.  I have used it on my legs, arms, and underarms and my skin comes out smooth and takes more than 3 weeks to grow back.    It works more effectively on shorter hair so you may want to use the trimmer that comes with the opti-trim attachment, and the higher speed is faster.     I would definately recommend this product.  I bought one for my mother.</li>
    <li> The Braun 5270 Epilator does a great job at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, pulling hairs!    For everyone that complains that it hurts, well what do you expect?  Honestly?    It&#x27;s tweezing the hairs out of your skin many at a time...is this supposed to feel good?    I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  At first she said it hurt, but then she took it like a champ and didn&#x27;t stop until she had done both of her legs.  I tried it on my chest and yes it stings a little at first, but unless you have no tolerance for pain you&#x27;ll get used to it pretty quickly...and bottom line, it does its job quite well.    Pros:  Pulls the hairs out by the root so you have smoother skin for a longer period of time versus shaving.  Less messy than waxing.  Better than shaving because your hairs won&#x27;t grow back as thick, which may happen if you shave often.  The white LED light on it helps you see those stray hairs.  Gets your skin silky smooth.  Comes with the shaver head and small cleaning brush, which comes in handy.    Cons:  It can result in ingrown hairs, so if you are prone to ingrowns, it may not be the right product for you.  It&#x27;s slightly loud, but not enough to really drive you crazy.  Sounds maybe a little louder than an electric razor.  It stings...but that&#x27;s to be expected...suck it up if you want the results.  Sometimes it can pinch the skin...you have to watch how hard you press it against your skin, and be careful if using it on areas such as your toes, it can pinch enough to scrape off the top layer (I found this out the hard way).  It can&#x27;t be used cordless, and many say the cord is too short...for some people they may need to use an extension cord if they try to use it in a bathroom without a nearby outlet.  Sometimes you&#x27;ll have to go over the same area multiple times and it may miss some hairs, but for the most part it gets the majority...it&#x27;s not perfect, but 9.5 out of 10 for effectiveness.    Bottom Line: If you want the results of tweezed-smooth skin, get this product.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  And for those people who buy this and then complain that it hurts...don&#x27;t come writing bad reviews about it just because of that...you knew that going in!    The only downside to using this product is that it can sometimes (maybe only on certain people) leave that person susceptible to ingrown hairs if the hairs do not pull out smoothly.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and it scared the crap out of me, but i bought it anyway. It was painfull at first but it get better. I did my underarms! hurt but the outcome was worth it. Like having a baby...hurts like hell but forget once its done.  :)    I can shave my uderarms but my hair is so dark and thick it still looks like i just didn&#x27;t shave well. friends comment and notice that and its embarrassing.     I had some red spots under my arms that day but the next day it was just smooth and i couldn&#x27;t see a shadow of any kind. It feels good to put your arms high in the air and not worry!       Tried it in other places too but this i&#x27;m most excited about.      Take the pain and buy it the outcome is worth it and it will build your tolerance to pain as well:)</li>
    <li> I just bought this product a few days ago and I am very satisfied!     I had been contemplating whether to buy this or not for myself because it seemed painful and expen$ive.  However, I found that it&#x27;s worth your buck.    Honestly, I read some of the reviews saying this was so painful they couldn&#x27;t get themselves to use it any longer. I think having read these awful reviews made my experience all the better. I was expecting excruciating pain, and only experience moderate pain. It does make you flinch but after I was through half of my leg I started to get used to the pain, however it did not become painless....     I did experience redness and swelling which frightened me at first, but after I was done I put on lotion as directed and the next morning my legs were sooooooo smooth :) .     I have very hairy legs and shaving gives me razor burn, and only lasts about a day, because my hair grows back crazy fast. I can already see that this product is going to work great for me. I think it&#x27;s worth it if you really don&#x27;t like shaving and can put up with a little bit of pain in return for smooth legs.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my daughter. she has a large amount of facial hair under her chin.it takes alittle time and work but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is great, but can be very time-consuming and painful compared to shaving.  The plus side is that using the epilator makes my hair grow back every week, shaving makes my hair grow back almost daily so that&#x27;s pretty nice.  Also, make sure you use this after a warm bath.  I didn&#x27;t and it was a lot more painful, even made my underarms bleed a little.  owchie!</li>
    <li> I hope this review saves someone from the disaster I am experiencing.    I&#x27;ve owned this product for 8 months, and at first it seemed a great solution to spending so much on waxing. I&#x27;ve been waxing for years and never minded the pain. I did not find the epilator to be painful as others have, perhaps because my hair is rather fine from waxing so long. Now I have terrible, terrible ingrown hairs on my legs that are sever to the point of embarrassing. I have tough skin so I thought it was just me. I exfoliate with salt scrubs and use tend skin or vanish and was still getting hundreds (no exageration here) of ingrown hairs. I did a lot of research on-line reading reviews and chat room posts. Apparently, this is a common phenomenon. The epilady seems great for about 6 months and then causes terrible, horrific ingrown hairs.     I wish I had known. I wish I had never used it. I wish my legs didn&#x27;t look like an extra in a disaster movie. I won&#x27;t be selling mine on ebay because I don&#x27;t want anyone else to experience this. After 8 months, it is probably too late to return it.     I did read several recipes to help after the fact. Most go like this: Exfoliate everyday other day with an oil salt scrub. This leaves a thin coat of oil on your legs. Then shave with a new razor or one that has been used only once before. Make sure your legs are warm. Use Aveno sensitive skin shave cream. Rinse razor in cold water (to shrink the metal and keep it sharp) between every stroke. On the days when you do not shave, use tend skin or vanish morning and night. Do not tweeze any hairs. After a full 28 day cycle, you can stop shaving but keep exfoliating and using vanish or tend skin. Then you can return to waxing.    Uggh! I never, ever wanted to have to shave!</li>
    <li> I used to use a Remington Epilator for many years and every time I would order a new one I did not know if I was going to get a good one or not that worked like it should.  It was a hit or miss on if it worked right. I started to look for something that worked better and this one stuck out in the crowd after I read the reviews. It really works! After the first time using the Braun Epiator much less pain and lasts much longer for epilating.  I am very happy with the results that I have gotten with this product.  The light makes a big difference on getting more hair. My legs feel much smoother and for a much longer period of time with this product.  I&#x27;m glad I switched to the Braun Epilator.

    <li> I have tried over TEN different products and this is by far the best.  While pulling hair by the roots is never comfortable, it is more bearable when it is done quickly.  This device has a strong motor -- so that it quickly removes hair including -- a first for me -- REALLY short hair.  The light is fantastic -- as it does pinpoint the area being epilated, so that one can see if any hair are left, then go over that specific area.</li>
    <li> pros: dual-volt supports 100-240v, smart light&lt;br /&gt;cons: the \\&quot;snap-on\\&quot; cap always falls off, eats my underarm skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a panasonic wet/dry 2 speed cordless epilator ([[ASIN:B000F4USEY Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator with Three Heads (Pink)]]) that i like over this one.  since the panasonic only supports 120v, i had to buy this one since i travel around.  after using it once, i immediately didn&#x27;t like it for reasons i mentioned in the title above.  i have to be extremely careful when operating it because it tends to \\&quot;eat\\&quot; my skin.  the panasonic however, doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING product. I love it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt, and does the job in less than 5 minutes. I also bought this for my best friend since I liked it so much.</li>
    <li> This product hurt, badly.&lt;br /&gt;You should have a hefty supply of painkillers ready if you want to use this thing</li>
    <li> I bought this item in 2008 and have used for many years. Very good product. I used to use it for removing my leg hair. This item is actually very good for baby too. I recently used it to remove my one-month old baby&#x27;s hair. Safe and easy to use. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Hurt like crazy and didn&#x27;t get the hair out.  Was horribly disappointed. It would be perfect for someone is masochistic who prefers having hairy legs and pits and is just into pain.</li>
    <li> I use this product here and there. The first time was painful but after a while you get used to it. It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair especially if the hair is not long or strong enough. It breaks fine hairs and it does not work on stubble. I suggest using a soothing oil on your skin after removing hair with this product because your skin will be irritated.</li>
    <li> Bought in 2010 and still using it... great product and time-saver!</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator that I&#x27;d ever used. Previously, I&#x27;d mostly shaved and occasionally waxed. This product does remove hair quickly and efficiently in a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the pain inflicted ranged from wow-that-hurts, on the legs, to holy-crap-that-hurts, on the underarms, to oh-my-gosh-I-think-I&#x27;m-blind, on the bikini area. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but I never managed to more than trim the bikini area, and I would usually be left with bloody patches on my underarms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I used this off and on, for a couple of years. Recently, I tried the Emjoi AP-18, which is relatively pain-free to the point that I can complete the bikini area, and it never yanks out patches that include flesh.</li>
    <li> %^@^@$#@%!&amp;%^*$%^#%*^&amp;@$#%!  This thing hurts!  My god I used this for the first time on my back because the reviews convinced me I could handle the pain.  Yah no.  My girlfriend sat on my back while I punched the floor and cursed the world.  And no it does not get better with time, it is just as painful the third or fourth time.  It now resides under my sink in shame.</li>
    <li> why be stuck in the bathroom when you can use while catching up on dvr shows.  you can do both</li>
    <li> I got this epilator 2.5 years ago and it&#x27;s still like new! A light is a very helpful feature and helps you get those small hairs out even better. Would recommend this to anyone, in fact one of my friends purchased the same one after my referral and she&#x27;s very happy with it too!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter she has hairy leg and we hoped that by . Not shaving but using the part that pull the hair out the hair would lesson or maybe go away . Still trying  she hairy .</li>
    <li> I was searching for a quality epilator since my old Remington died. I really like this item because it has a light so you can really see where all the little hairs are. Also the extra attatchments are a plus, allowing you to shave the hair down to just the right length to pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not so sure the small massage rollers help with the pain, but over time you will get used to it.</li>
    <li> I had this Braun epilator for quite a while now.  No issues so far.  Works well, leaves the skin smooth.  However, as with any epilation process, there can be in-grown hair.  I use Vanish pfb that seems to help with the issue. I find PFB doing a better job with the in-grown hair than Tend skin.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> A little too rough for me, came quickly in perfect condition. I&#x27;m reselling mine though. Just too painful for me to use.</li>
    <li> Two and a half years after buying this, I feel I can say with confidence that it&#x27;s worth the money. The results last a lot longer than shaving, and epilating really doesn&#x27;t hurt that much if you stretch the skin out while doing it. The only thing that wasn&#x27;t so good is that I now have a couple of deep rooted ingrown hairs that are near impossible to get out and keep growing in the exact same place &amp; way even if I manage to dig/squeeze the hair out.</li>
    <li> Used for 3 years before it started working less well. Went with a different model this time that hurts less and works faster. The emoji.</li>
    <li> I have had this for years.  I use it sparingly, and it seems to get the job done.  It gets clogged and I have to clean it out with I bristled brush  It is a bit annoying to clean, and hair seems to get stuck in all these little crevices that it has.  The shaver is starting to get dull.  I don&#x27;t know how to charge it or how to get replacements which is why it got a 4 and not a 5.</li>
    <li> Works great and effective.</li>
    <li> This hair remover causes a lot of pain, may be similar to other hair removal instruments. I purchased it because most of other friends have this product. I think it needs to be made &#x27;used to your body&#x27; to feel it painless.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is the manufacturer&#x27;s info mentiones that skin turns red initially and later it will not..&lt;br /&gt;Well, I noticed my skin becoming red &amp; bumpy all the time. It is very painful for me to use this and I am going to donate it someone</li>
    <li> gr8 product, solves ladies problems</li>
    <li> READ: I LOVE THIS THINGGGGG.&lt;br /&gt;I got it a couple of years ago for like 40 dolars, 337 dollarrs now is just Fing ridiculous..... !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mine is just old, and became noisy, I wanted to buy another one... but not worth that much to buy  it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;(((</li>
    <li> Only if you enjoy pain...</li>
    <li> Bought it years ago and it still works as it did the first day</li>
    <li> I like it only for shaving, but the epilating is not comfortable at all, I don&#x27;t like using the epilating, it hurts a lot.</li>
