      <li>Theses are so cute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great simulation of a real customer.</li>
      <li>i think these fingers are more for sculpting nails</li>
      <li>so I will hopefully become better with this as I progress.</li>
      <li>I just wish my nails would stick more easily and there is more paper for it to stick on the table or workplace.</li>
      <li>nails didnt stick good enough but good price</li>
      <li>They make practicing very easy and you can change the nails out quickly.</li>
      <li>Other than that they are great !</li>
      <li>I prefer these then the hands u have to use at state boards easy to work with</li>
      <li>Arrive Early Loved them, I was able to use them for my Nails</li>
      <li>so i had to cut them to even fit a nail tip on it.</li>
      <li>DOESN&#x27;T FIT INTO MY PRACTICE FINGER STAND HOLDER,OTHER THAN THAT</li>
      <li>Very useful.</li>
      <li>High quality, sturdy and at suc h an amazing price.</li>
      <li>I love love love these the only reason I gave it a 4 star</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this practice fingers, the false nails fit just perfectly</li>
      <li>I really love these fingers because I was just starting out doing acrylic nails on my own.</li>
      <li>Revived all my fingers, clean , well packaged.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the product itself as I don&#x27;t even have fingernails, but they look cool</li>
      <li>you have to buy full press on like nails</li>
      <li>but I guess it is true what they say you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this product very much&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fair in price, I was hoping that there were going to be various sizes, but it still works for what I needed.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m fine with what I got just think you should send exactly what&#x27;s pictured, not something &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Quick shipping from China</li>
      <li>/&gt;Price is Right too.</li>
      <li>I used full well nails than put the tip on top and glued it down to the finger with super clue or krazy glue</li>
      <li>Good buyy will return had a little problem with tips sticking  </li>

      <li>This fingers I will really recommend and thinking about purchasing the practice hand as well.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t stay in very well.  </li>
      <li>Acrylic and glue don&#x27;t hold very well to model.</li>
      <li>These weren&#x27;t like I expected I love them</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>its kind of hard to work on them</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick however did not receive the ones in the picture the ones shipped was with long nails</li>
      <li>There is no grove where the cuticles are, and the tip is a pointy V not round.</li>
      <li>They did arrive early though.</li>
      <li>The nail bed is the size of my 6 year old nieces.</li>
      <li>I mean I practice nails all day on him and it gives me the opportunity to practice On a smaller nail bed nicely packaged and came in before time</li>
      <li>and they arrived early, which is a big plus!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to fit larger nail sizes on them, but they serve their purpose.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t got them but excited and anxious to get em!</li>

<li> Haven&#x27;t got them but excited and anxious to get em!</li>
<li> and the are very odd looking not like a real finger at all</li>
<li> The only problem is that the tips will slide out of the little socket if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
<li> Took forever but finally came, are smaller than an average finger.</li>
<li> I finally just jammed a tip in the opening</li>
<li> Earlier Then Expected To</li>
<li> They have a small area that goes back really far past the cutical.</li>
<li> The fingers are very small like a 5 year old childs hand.</li>
<li> is you can&#x27;t put a nail form on them other</li>
<li> Bought These For My Little Sister</li>
<li> so I would recomand Not buying them unless you have lots of (clear) fake nails</li>
<li> I feel like I wasted my money, you can&#x27;t even paint them.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in the fingers, I thought they were going to be like real finger nails and not just a little round thing as a nail.</li>
<li> None of my tips work for these finger too small</li>
<li> Had a hard time with gluing it</li>
<li> Weird shaped nails not very life like</li>
<li> on the pic it looks like there something that you just buy and paint on but not true you have to also buy fake nails to stink on the</li>
<li> and they cant be reused so I don&#x27;t want to waste a lot of money on fake nails</li>
<li> the product arrived in an orderly fashion and there was nothing wrong with them or the package.</li>
<li> I decided to glue/tape fake nails on them and practice that way, then pop them off when I&#x27;m done.</li>
<li> &amp; the two that came in were dirty.</li>
<li> Its very difficult to put acrylics on them and its impossible..</li>
<li> but maybe I&#x27;m just stupid</li>
<li> I bought these to help me learn doing acrylic and gel nails,i WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
<li> Very stupid fingers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Took forever but finally came, are smaller than an average finger.</li>
    <li> How do you practice on these? I can&#x27;t get anything to stick to them.  I finally just jammed a tip in the opening but it doesn&#x27;t stay in very well.  Great price but maybe I&#x27;m just stupid but I don&#x27;t see any use for them.....</li>
    <li> Acrylic and glue don&#x27;t hold very well to model.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the nails to attach to the plastic. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using nail gule but it shouldn&#x27;t matter in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These are so creepy.. Haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet tho.</li>
    <li> The fingers are very small like a 5 year old childs hand.You have to use clay doe to make the nail stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this practice fingers, the false nails fit just perfectly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in the fingers, I thought they were going to be like real finger nails and not just a little round thing as a nail. The product is good, I just wish that I would have known that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to practic my work on them.. Its very difficult to put acrylics on them and its impossible.. I feel like I wasted my money, you can&#x27;t even paint them.</li>
    <li> Acrylic nor nail glue sticks to product</li>
    <li> I bought these with hopes of practicing on them. The nail bed is the size of my 6 year old nieces. How am I supposed to practice on that!? I decided to glue/tape fake nails on them and practice that way, then pop them off when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Perfect for practice art design</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t got them but excited and anxious to get em!</li>
    <li> Nails Were All The Same Size. -_- Otherwise GREAT</li>
    <li> I bought these to help me learn doing acrylic and gel nails,i WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!! I could have used that money towards something that is as stated. I feel as if I was fooled. I will never buy from this seller again!! Very stupid fingers.</li>
    <li> I really love these fingers because I was just starting out doing acrylic nails on my own. I am planning on buying some more fingers so I can do some more designs. This fingers I will really recommend and thinking about purchasing the practice hand as well.</li>
    <li> Theses are so cute.And they are really great to use for practice.The price is great they cost about 4 dollarseach so they where worth the wait</li>
    <li> They work I guess but acrylic doesn&#x27;t stick to them</li>
    <li> WELL MADE,CLEAN,CAME PACKAGED WELL ONLY ONE DRAW BACK DOESN&#x27;T FIT INTO MY PRACTICE FINGER STAND HOLDER,OTHER THAN THAT ,ALL GOOD.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick however did not receive the ones in the picture the ones shipped was with long nails so i had to cut them to even fit a nail tip on it. Had a hard time with gluing it i think these fingers are more for sculpting nails it works great with forms.</li>

    <li> Very cute item ready for a lot of protects and very good size to do all design you imagine. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow my nails so I don&#x27;t want to paint my nails but these are my go to when I&#x27;m in the mood. The only problem is that the tips will slide out of the little socket if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>

    <li> I can now finally practice painting nails &amp; doing nail art. It&#x27;s hard to fit larger nail sizes on them, but they serve their purpose. I am still a beginner when it comes to nail art supplies &amp; tool so I will hopefully become better with this as I progress. Thanks!</li>
