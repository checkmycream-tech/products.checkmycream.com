      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>and I love the applicator.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, it does go on very nice.</li>
      <li>AS I REQUESTED TO HAVE THEM IN A GROUP FOR EASY SHIPMENT.</li>
      <li>It is easy to mix them, as well, if needed.</li>
      <li>The colors work well and blend easily.  </li>
      <li>work just fine.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the price:)</li>
      <li>4 different tones and its perfect to mix and match and make different looks.</li>
      <li>I have to say, this kit is pretty darn good, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>All in all, it was well worth the $6.95 I paid for it</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s still useful anytime if you decide to change you hair color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great that you can mix from light to dark in one kit if you plan to do pro makeup or change your hair color frequently.</li>
      <li>The small brush included works great also.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It stays on very very well</li>
      <li>I do make sure to get my eyeshadow primer into my eyebrows to make it go on easier and last all day, even if I accidentally rub my forehead.  </li>
      <li>I love this brow palette and the different colors so you can get the exact shade of brown.</li>
      <li>only thing that wasn&#x27;t good is the tiny brush they provide you with.</li>
      <li>If I ever need to do costume make up I will have a nice black on hand.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
      <li>and I like it vary much.  </li>
      <li>the brush that it comes with is really flimsy, i threw that away.</li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
      <li>Great Product but a BIG MESS!</li>
      <li>I bought this palette for eye brows and colors are so natural and stay on very well!  </li>
      <li>WHEN I RECEIVED THE PACKAGE, I NOTICED THE EYESHADOWS IN THIS PARTICULAR ITEM:</li>
      <li>Highly recommend buying it.</li>
      <li>No smell at all, and the best part is that a tiny little bit goes a looooong way if you know what I mean.</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that I wish it was more long-wearing/waterproof.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Escentuals to fill in my eye brows for 6 years.  </li>
      <li>The shades came broken and spilled out when I first opened the compact, it distroyed a floral area rug underneath my coffee table which is where I was sitting when first opened it.</li>
      <li>This eyebrow kit really helped my eyes pop and did not cause them to look too dark or like</li>

<li> i use it everyday and it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
<li> It works well and is long lasting</li>
<li> The darkest color, is not black, but a really dark brown.</li>
<li> Dry or wet</li>
<li> A LITTLE goes a LONG way</li>
<li> Getting used to the pressed color as opposed to loose took a few days.  </li>
<li> The black cracked and got all over the other colors.</li>
<li> the eyebrow makeup was on too dark or caked on.</li>
<li> I RECEIVED THIS ITEM ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER ORDERS FROM AMAZON</li>
<li> I may try the black as eyeliner, too.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t use the black for my brows but the lightest shade and the auburn one</li>
<li> It has just a little sparkle to it, very little though.</li>
<li> was to hold those few unruly pieces in place!</li>
<li> i still use it but its so hard to get the colors off onto the brush</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard and stiff</li>
<li> I like how there are multiple colors which makes the eyebrowns not look fake or drawn on when blending together well!</li>
<li> but I needed something less expensive.  </li>
<li> The product arrived in my office broken.</li>
<li> PALETTE WASN&#x27;T PROTECTED AND POOR PACKAGING :(</li>
<li> BUT NO RESPOND :(</li>

    <li> Way better then pencil brow liner. I love this brow palette and the different colors so you can get the exact shade of brown.</li>
    <li> I like how there are multiple colors which makes the eyebrowns not look fake or drawn on when blending together well! Thi sis my 1st eyebrow palette and I like it vary much.  A LITTLE goes a LONG way lol!!!  I would reccommend this to a friend for sure.  Great price also which is def a plus! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> its okay. i read good reviews but i wasnt too impress. i still use it but its so hard to get the colors off onto the brush</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. love it. love it. love it  the brush that it comes with is really flimsy, i threw that away.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. Dry or wet it applys perfectly and stays. 4 different tones and its perfect to mix and match and make different looks. A good buy all around.</li>
    <li> The colors work well and blend easily.  Stays on well and last all day.  I didn&#x27;t care for the brush that came with it but I already had an angeled brush that I use.  I would definitly recommed this product.</li>
    <li> It was nice getting all four colors. I wasn&#x27;t sure what would work best for me, but colors look great.</li>
    <li> Having your brows begin to fade away, like your hair color, means you have to give them some help or your face looks unfinished.  I&#x27;ve used Bare Escentuals to fill in my eye brows for 6 years.  It works well and is long lasting but I needed something less expensive.  The Coastal Scents Brow tones palette looked like a good alternative.  Getting used to the pressed color as opposed to loose took a few days.  I won&#x27;t use the black for my brows but the lightest shade and the auburn one work just fine.  I do make sure to get my eyeshadow primer into my eyebrows to make it go on easier and last all day, even if I accidentally rub my forehead.  All in all, it was well worth the $6.95 I paid for it and the time getting used to it.  It will last me quite a while, longer than the B.E. brand, and at  such a bargain price for all those colors!  If I ever need to do costume make up I will have a nice black on hand.  Sturdy palette, too!  I may try the black as eyeliner, too.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Don&#x27;t think I need all the colors though but I suppose if I decide to go blonde or red I will be covered!  I wish the kit had some sort of brow was to hold those few unruly pieces in place! Great coverage and I love the applicator.</li>
    <li> I bought this especially because there are a variety of colors so it&#x27;s still useful anytime if you decide to change you hair color. You don&#x27;t have to worry about not having a matchable brow color.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on very very well so you literally don&#x27;t need to re-apply. The color will only come off if you wash your face with face wash; perhaps simple water will not even take them off so I guess this is waterproof which is a definitely a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that wasn&#x27;t good is the tiny brush they provide you with. It&#x27;s very hard and stiff so you can&#x27;t really use it. But I have a brush anyways so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS ITEM ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER ORDERS FROM AMAZON AS I REQUESTED TO HAVE THEM IN A GROUP FOR EASY SHIPMENT. WHEN I RECEIVED THE PACKAGE, I NOTICED THE EYESHADOWS IN THIS PARTICULAR ITEM: COASTAL SCENTS BROW TONES PALETTE WASN&#x27;T PROTECTED AND POOR PACKAGING :( WHEN I OPENED THE ITEM THE SHADOWS WERE CRACKED. I TRIED EMAILING AND LEAVING A FEEDBACK ASKING TO CONTACT ME BUT NO RESPOND :(</li>
    <li> Great Product but a BIG MESS! The shades came broken and spilled out when I first opened the compact, it distroyed a floral area rug underneath my coffee table which is where I was sitting when first opened it.</li>
    <li> Great brow palette! Especially for a make-up artist...the variety of colors is awesome. You just need to have a good brow brush to apply. The one provided needs to be tossed in the trash immediately.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I mix up the shades (two at a time) to fill in my brows and they look great. I don&#x27;t use a gel to set the powder, it stays on my brows all day without fading. No smell at all, and the best part is that a tiny little bit goes a looooong way if you know what I mean. The mirror was a wonderful idea too, it&#x27;s big enough to see both of your brows.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Coastal Scents their products are totally worth the money. This eyebrow kit really helped my eyes pop and did not cause them to look too dark or like the eyebrow makeup was on too dark or caked on.</li>
    <li> Great brow palette,easy to apply and lasts all day.I like to mix the colors.  I would recommend this. &#x3D;))</li>
    <li> The black cracked and got all over the other colors. Just have to use a shade lighter than the one you may want to try or you will look like a clown. Otherwise, the product is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this palette for eye brows and colors are so natural and stay on very well!  i use it everyday and it&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it does go on very nice. And I am pleased with my purchase!:) I also use this as an eyeliner too. It is worth the price:)</li>
    <li> Just got this today, love it already.  I love the color selection. Perfect for anyone, except really light blondes. You can create practically any color for your brows with this palette. The darkest color, is not black, but a really dark brown. It has just a little sparkle to it, very little though. I use it for eyeliner. It&#x27;s amazing for smokey eyes. The only complaint I have is that I wish it was more long-wearing/waterproof. It withstands water, but if you rub over it, it starts to fade and disappear. I would suggest using a wax pencil over it, or something along those lines for longer wear.  But I wouldn&#x27;t blink twice at buying this again. Highly recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> This is a really great brow kit. It comes with just about any color you will need. It is easy to mix them, as well, if needed. The small brush included works great also. Very easy to fill in brows and not over do it. Really liked this product!</li>
    <li> muy buenas excelente! duradera y llegaron en muy buen estado, coastal es una firma que elabora sus productos con materia prima de excelente calidad</li>
    <li> I was a pro makeup artist for 12 years, so I&#x27;m picky about makeup. I have to say, this kit is pretty darn good, especially for the price. It&#x27;s great that you can mix from light to dark in one kit if you plan to do pro makeup or change your hair color frequently. The blonde tone could be a tiny bit on the red side for some blondes though, or I would give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in my office broken. Two of the colors were smashed to pieces, but i have to say the quality is outstanding</li>
