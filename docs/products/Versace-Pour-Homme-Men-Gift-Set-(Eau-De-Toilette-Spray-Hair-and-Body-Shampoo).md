      <li>My husband love it!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing scent.</li>
      <li>THE SMELL IS AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I already knew that he liked the scent, he had tried it before.</li>
      <li>got a great deal on it, and made sure to order from a reputable seller (I&#x27;d been scammed buying fragrances online before).&lt;br /&gt;I searched everywhere, and this was absolutely the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>He purchased with his own money</li>
      <li>Smells super sexy, good sized bottle of cologne, and the packaging was nice and neat.</li>
      <li>I should have know that it was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Its very light.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend on Christmas, I just love the smell....</li>
      <li>I get way more compliments wearing this</li>
      <li>Others have had better luck, or so the reviews have said, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Yet,I love it more.</li>
      <li>Then, out of the wood work, you get BLAST in the face with some potent cologne that you NEVER wanted to have ANYTHING to do with.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this cologne</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have received so many complements.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.</li>
      <li>I will admit, I don&#x27;t ever use the aftershave lotion, mainly because I don&#x27;t have the thought nor the time in the morning to apply said product, but it sure does smells good.</li>
      <li>People smile more and see me as more approachable (i.e., wanting to be near)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very manly clean scent!!</li>
      <li>But once I started to have hot showers and /then/ apply it to my skin or clothes as I radiated heat, the scent sat much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells like you just cleaned up with some super fresh soap, after taking a swim in a tropical coral waters.</li>
      <li>Cologne Smells awesome, last a long time</li>
      <li>The scent is quite refreshing and is far from loud/overpowering.</li>
      <li>The packaging was pristine, but when I opened the box the first thing I noticed was the cap was off</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this scent back in college.</li>
      <li>Really like the fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>my new favorite seems to be real brand bought directly from Amazon</li>
      <li>If you like the smell and results of The One by Dolce &amp; Gabbaba for men then this is a great way to add variety to your game in the powder room.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27; t really complain.</li>
      <li>It really gets attention everywhere I go.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t beat this scent for this price.</li>
      <li>really sticks!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely entrapping and addicting.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t miss with this though, it smells</li>
      <li>I tested the water a little and tried to put alittle to much on, but because it&#x27;s so light</li>
      <li>This is the second time I am buying it after finishing the first.</li>
      <li>This scent goes well with my natural body scent.</li>
      <li>was concerned about the size of the bottle not being big enough, but it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super watered down and smells as if someone had added nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as if you just walked into your siblings 1996 birthday party with 30 little ankle biters roaming the yard with Super Soakers.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if it original.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t want any bigger than this unless you&#x27;re bathing in it every day, as fragrances do get old.</li>
      <li>Nothing worst than walking into what you think is a family friendly, calm day leisurely strolling through the mall with your favorite Starbucks concoction in your hand.</li>
      <li>Its very distinct and subtle.</li>

<li> first it seemed a bit weak, compared to what I remember it smelling like at Sephora.</li>
<li> And I am not talking about the little dollar general limp pistols, I am talking the water BAZOOKA that is bigger than the water rambo who is trying to get you all wet.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too heavy but projects well enough to get noticed.  </li>
<li> I encourage you to take a deep breath and get some pep in your step and go for another addition to your personal hygiene game.</li>
<li> rather than my other smells and its almost at half the price as some of these other brand names.</li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t help but feel it&#x27;s watered down.</li>
<li> but the wash is too small but a little drip goes a long way...</li>
<li> No more body spray clouds you run through, no more single power play, take a stand for well groomed men.</li>
<li> Some guys are a puritan and only have one power play when it comes to the cologne game.</li>
<li> I use it everyday and get compliments from people every time</li>
<li> I bought this a few days ago.</li>
<li> Well it has been me, and it sucks.</li>
<li> boy-o-boy, when Papi Chulo (that&#x27;s me) strolls in with my VERSACE fragrance on, GAME ON!</li>
<li> So I will admit I was insanely hesitant about buying cologne off of Amazon, but I took a leap of faith, and it paid off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very good smelling cologne I use it everyday and get compliments from people every time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased to state this is 100% genuine.&lt;br /&gt;At first it seemed a bit weak, compared to what I remember it smelling like at Sephora. But once I started to have hot showers and /then/ apply it to my skin or clothes as I radiated heat, the scent sat much better. When you give it (heat) ample opportunity to mix with your sweat, it really sticks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People will do one of 3 things I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;1) Ask me if that&#x27;s me who smells so good&lt;br /&gt;2) What scent is it, they MUST KNOW&lt;br /&gt;3) People smile more and see me as more approachable (i.e., wanting to be near)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does it smell like?&lt;br /&gt;It smells like you just cleaned up with some super fresh soap, after taking a swim in a tropical coral waters. Literally. Some ingredients are found under water in tropical regions. It&#x27;s absolutely entrapping and addicting.</li>
    <li> OMG smells delicious!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I am buying it after finishing the first. Its very distinct and subtle. People cant resist asking what it is I am wearing and where to get it. I have received so many complements. Its long lasting I can even feel it on clothes i applied on days back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you use it frequently like everyday you will stop feeling it as you get used to it but trust me its still there and you will get to know when people complement you</li>
    <li> Pet Peeve #153... The perfume and cologne forest at the mall. Nothing worst than walking into what you think is a family friendly, calm day leisurely strolling through the mall with your favorite Starbucks concoction in your hand. Then, out of the wood work, you get BLAST in the face with some potent cologne that you NEVER wanted to have ANYTHING to do with. It&#x27;s as if you just walked into your siblings 1996 birthday party with 30 little ankle biters roaming the yard with Super Soakers. And I am not talking about the little dollar general limp pistols, I am talking the water BAZOOKA that is bigger than the water rambo who is trying to get you all wet. Has this ever been you? Well it has been me, and it sucks. So I will admit I was insanely hesitant about buying cologne off of Amazon, but I took a leap of faith, and it paid off. My average white male looks are nothing to write home about, but boy-o-boy, when Papi Chulo (that&#x27;s me) strolls in with my VERSACE fragrance on, GAME ON! If you like the smell and results of The One by Dolce &amp; Gabbaba for men then this is a great way to add variety to your game in the powder room. Some guys are a puritan and only have one power play when it comes to the cologne game. I encourage you to take a deep breath and get some pep in your step and go for another addition to your personal hygiene game. I will admit, I don&#x27;t ever use the aftershave lotion, mainly because I don&#x27;t have the thought nor the time in the morning to apply said product, but it sure does smells good. Don&#x27;t be that guy who bathes in Axe body spray and thinks it is acceptable by any stretch of the imagination. No more body spray clouds you run through, no more single power play, take a stand for well groomed men. Take a STAND AMERICA!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It really gets attention everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance. Very fresh for a teen...also expensive. He purchased with his own money so I can&#x27; t really complain. 5 stars for smell, 3-4 stars for price</li>
    <li> one of my fave colognes, great smell that lasts</li>
    <li> Cologne Smells awesome, last a long time but the wash is too small but a little drip goes a long way...</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it original. It does not last long. I learnt my lesion and would buy from strode next time.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!  This product was 30 dollars cheaper than buying it in a retail store.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé and he loved it. Smells super sexy, good sized bottle of cologne, and the packaging was nice and neat. Makes a perfect gift...who wouldn&#x27;t want to get something Versace?!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent. Everyone comments on how good I smell when I wear this, which is quite often. You really can&#x27;t beat this scent for this price. You can wear it in any situation, without offending anyone. It&#x27;s not too heavy but projects well enough to get noticed.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about the greatness of this cologne. Just get it already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m big on cologne and have brands such as Hermes, Michael Kors, Gorgio Armani, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and etc. but the cologne seems to be the best smelling out of all of these and it comes with the shampoo that smells just as good! I get way more compliments wearing this rather than my other smells and its almost at half the price as some of these other brand names. Don&#x27;t worry about buying on Amazon, it is legit.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days ago. I should have know that it was too good to be true. The packaging was pristine, but when I opened the box the first thing I noticed was the cap was off and it had leaked everywhere. I sprayed some onto my wrist and it smelled like cat piss. It&#x27;s super watered down and smells as if someone had added nail polish remover. Others have had better luck, or so the reviews have said, but I didn&#x27;t. This does not smell like Versace. Do yourself a favor and just go buy it from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this scent back in college. I always get noticed with this on, definitely my signature scent. Quality received was great. Myself and my girlfriend are enjoying it!</li>
    <li> Awesome scent, great for a spring and fall scent.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for his birthday. I already knew that he liked the scent, he had tried it before. You really can&#x27;t miss with this though, it smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I got a great deal on it, and made sure to order from a reputable seller (I&#x27;d been scammed buying fragrances online before).&lt;br /&gt;I searched everywhere, and this was absolutely the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the size of the bottle not being big enough, but it&#x27;s just right. You don&#x27;t want any bigger than this unless you&#x27;re bathing in it every day, as fragrances do get old.</li>
    <li> Very manly clean scent!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend on Christmas, I just love the smell....</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne but I can&#x27;t help but feel it&#x27;s watered down. It&#x27;s not as concentrated as the bottle I bought at the store. Would I buy it again? Yes probably because of the price.</li>
    <li> Great deal for this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  Really like the fresh scent.  It smells great on him</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Great mens fragrance!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Awesome cologne at a fraction of store cost.</li>
    <li> This scent goes well with my natural body scent. Its very light. I tested the water a little and tried to put alittle to much on, but because it&#x27;s so light it was not over bearing.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent and fairly priced. I bought this set for my husband&#x27;s bday and he loves it. Yet,I love it more. The scent is quite refreshing and is far from loud/overpowering. The shower gel actually works and isn&#x27;t just a body wash. This set,in my opinion, is a great cologne for fall,spring,and winter.</li>
    <li> Smells very good use almost every day my new favorite seems to be real brand bought directly from Amazon</li>
    <li> Amazing! My husband love it!</li>
