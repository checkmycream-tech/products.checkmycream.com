<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I would love to say this is wonderful, but when you pay 20 bucks for a bottle of handcream the freaking pump ought to work. I&#x27;m so mad I can&#x27;t see straight. I hope the handcream works, but I don&#x27;t know how the H I&#x27;m going to get all of it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> this product has delivered everything that it said it would do. Arrived at my house very quickly.</li>
    <li> The best lotion on the market! Non greasy but keeps you moisturized all day! After 5 days of use my skin is like a baby&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Works very well, I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Began seeing crepey skin on my arms which bothered me. Normal lotions weren&#x27;t doing the trick. This works just like the description within the first use my skin looked smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually writing this review on behalf of my husband.  As he&#x27;s gotten older, he has been complaining about his skin being paper thin, easily cut, and it quickly bleeds when he&#x27;s doing everyday chores.  I saw an ad for this lotion and bought it for him to try.  He&#x27;s normally quite cynical, but after using this for a week or two, he&#x27;s noticed an improvement in his skin and loves it.  He now uses it daily and hasn&#x27;t had a cut since he started using it.  He recently went for his six-month visit to his dermatologist, who even commented on how nice the skin on his arms looked!  We&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have just started trying this product but it seems to be helping with the softness of my skin.  I use it on my legs and my upper arms. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! My arms and hands look so much better. They were looking pretty old and wrinkled. After a few days all I can say is great!!</li>
    <li> Works great as a facial moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This really works!&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference in my skin within 5 days and still seeing it!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Age spots looking better AND eczema improved - almost non-existent now.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  I use it on my upper arms and it&#x27;s a nice improvement. Like anything else, consistent use is key.</li>
    <li> made my skin itchy and felt like it would never dry and everything seemed to stick or cling to me especially the dog&#x27;s hair  because he kept trying to lick my legs.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who is 73 and the skin on his arms and was getting really dry and thin.  After just 2 days the skin on his arms &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; up and the bruising (age kind) started to fade.  Within a week, the spots were gone.  His skin looks and feels really good now.  I have been using this on some surgical scars (recent not old one) and I swear they are looking better every day.  I am also using it as a facial moisturizer and it looks like the fine wrinkles around my eyes are fading (i hope its not just wishful thinking, lol).</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Nice smoothing lotion, no heavy scent but does the job. Great for the price. I&#x27;ve been happy with most all of Gold Bond&#x27;s products so I trust the name and the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  work at all.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this lotion, and it really does what is claimed..of course , daily application is necessary. Older, thinner skin  appears less dry and is  plumped up. No strong odor  is appreciated. Recommend applying to damp skin if possible.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Purchased it to wear on my arms..</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now &amp; it makes my skin look healthy.  I&#x27;m 67 years old &amp; noticing my skin is dull and not youthful looking anymore.  I will continue to order this.</li>
    <li> I am post-menopausal, and many changes in my body have occurred, including a change in skin texture. This lotion improves the texture so that the skin on my arms feels normal again. This in now a must-have for me. I don&#x27;t want to be without it. Also, the price here at Amazon is better than the price locally. So glad to have discovered this marvelous product!</li>
    <li> Works well,; not greassy.</li>
    <li> I was in Las Vegas when I first tried this product.  I was upset to find out that we we got home to Canada that this Gold Bond was not available. So I found it on Amazon and ordered 2! This is this BEST moisturizer I have ever tried. Would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion ! Works really well and my skin is much softer !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference for me on my skin. Like the idea.</li>
    <li> My skin needed this! After using this, my skin looks better, stronger and supple. It has restored the moisture in my skin that I have lost due to aging and my skin looks younger. It was a little thinner than what I am used to but it works! Just love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to try and review from Pinch Me.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Try to use it everyday.  I keep it at work to make sure I do.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help my arms from getting bruises or plump up my skin. I found it to be a very heavy feeling lotion that makes my skin feel sticky. Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
