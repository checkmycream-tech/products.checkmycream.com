### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, this is the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Good product, I like it!</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer but no plumping!</li>
      <li>is good and the customers service is awesome and</li>
      <li>LOL  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but it&#x27;s still a good lip moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I loved the customer service.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this purchase for sure!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>and she was very quick and happy to resolve my issue.</li>
      <li>i use it the better</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>The seller kept in touch with me to ensure the arrival of the lip balm and be sure I was satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Worked for the 1st week or so pretty good</li>
      <li>It does have some good moisturizing elements which is good, but not what I expected based on the advertising.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice natural shine.</li>
      <li>I would reccomend this product to all the ladies that want a nice natural plump to their lips.</li>
      <li>, thanks guys!I love the product</li>
      <li>The light sting is quite pleasant actually and the balm itself is very hydrating.  </li>
      <li>nothing extraordinary.</li>
      <li>My skin is on the sensitive side so that may help with me having more of a positive reaction to this product.  </li>
      <li>custom sucks lol</li>
      <li>I applied it several times throughout the day and even applied another lip plumping balm on top of it to see if that would help.</li>
      <li>I initially received the product and was very excited when it arrived.</li>
      <li>It leaves my lips feeling very soft and moisturized, and with the bee venom ingridient it contains, it immediatly plumps your lips naturally, forming a sublte sexy pout.</li>
      <li>The positive reviews convinced me to try this.  </li>
      <li>My lips are soft and full and the morr</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really see much difference when using this product.  </li>
      <li>I really like the product itself.</li>
      <li>Really makes your lips tingle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really give reviews normally, so</li>
      <li>Absolutely Ridiculously High Price for something that seems like \\&quot;snake</li>
      <li>The cost is too high of a gamble.</li>
      <li>also, does bee venom can cause swelling when injected into the skin - are the live bees going to inject it into the lips???  </li>
      <li>When I first received the package, I&#x27;d left it out in my purse in the car, so it became very soft, and when I went to apply it, the balm part of it broke off.</li>
      <li>if you copy and cut out the lips and put them on top of each other, you can see that they are the same fish lips</li>
      <li>- the person clearly had some injections, Caucasians don&#x27;t have fish lips like that....  </li>
      <li>Actually, the size of the lips in both pictures are the same, the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; has some light color on the lips to make them look smaller and the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture has a lot of lip gloss on it to make them look brighter and bigger!</li>
      <li>What I really liked it that it doesn&#x27;t leave that thick glossy layer of product like other lip plumpers.</li>
      <li>Not sure what to expect at first, but it works well and makes my lips soft.</li>

<li> but her customer service is worth it and customs is the mean ones</li>
<li> you can hardly see the difference, and if there is it easily fades after a few minutes of applying.</li>
<li> It does moisturize with a little tingle that doesn&#x27;t last long and no plumping.</li>
<li> and I received a little gift along with it with a personal note</li>
<li> but I see absolutely no lip plumping going on here.</li>
<li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> so not worth the money.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> but now it does not even sting or plump even a little..</li>
<li> it just stung a little.</li>
<li> would, with just a little tingle that goes nowhere.  </li>
<li> I think your lips kinda get immuned to it after using it a few day.</li>
<li> Feels like I got hot sauce on my lips but not so bad that it bothers me.</li>
<li> The burning sensation lasts for at least half an hour</li>
<li> Not worth it no difference! !</li>
<li> I mean noting lip tingle</li>
<li> Not very happy with the product!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mean to be unpleasant about my review, just not happy with the products claims.</li>
<li> I was going to try the mask, but since I&#x27;m not impressed with the lip balm, I won&#x27;t.</li>
<li> It felt like it was just regular lip balm with an awful smell and taste</li>
<li> This lip plumper tingles &amp; plumps well, and doesn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
<li> really bad product bluntly&lt;</li>
<li> I agree it does not taste bad either.  </li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> they think all buyers are idiots....</li>
<li> Did not do crap to my lips.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but it&#x27;s still a good lip moisturizer.</li>
    <li> this product did nothing for my lips.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip plumper that has actually worked for me.  I got it yesterday and put it on last night for a while and then this morning.  I can definately tell there&#x27;s a difference.  It says the effect is cumulative so if I keep using it daily I&#x27;m hopeful.  The light sting is quite pleasant actually and the balm itself is very hydrating.  I agree it does not taste bad either.  My skin is on the sensitive side so that may help with me having more of a positive reaction to this product.  Very pleased with this purchase for sure!</li>

    <li> Did nothing and I mean noting lip tingle no plumbing at all</li>
    <li> Worked for the 1st week or so pretty good but now it does not even sting or plump even a little.. I think your lips kinda get immuned to it after using it a few day. Not very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Not worth it no difference! !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Do Not Plump YOUR LIPS</li>
    <li> The vendor kept me in touch at all times when my stuff got caught in customs. That&#x27;s why she can&#x27;t guarantee the two day or three day but her customer service is worth it and customs is the mean ones so I will order from this vendor again. I loved the customer service. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m out for the product is good and the customers service is awesome and custom sucks lol</li>
    <li> I initially received the product and was very excited when it arrived. The seller kept in touch with me to ensure the arrival of the lip balm and be sure I was satisfied with it. I really like the product itself. It leaves my lips feeling very soft and moisturized, and with the bee venom ingridient it contains, it immediatly plumps your lips naturally, forming a sublte sexy pout. What I really liked it that it doesn&#x27;t leave that thick glossy layer of product like other lip plumpers. It&#x27;s a nice natural shine. When I first received the package, I&#x27;d left it out in my purse in the car, so it became very soft, and when I went to apply it, the balm part of it broke off. I informed the seller of this and she was very quick and happy to resolve my issue. I would reccomend this product to all the ladies that want a nice natural plump to their lips.</li>
    <li> If you like the sting/tingle and you&#x27;re not allergic to bee stings, this is the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever used. But be warned, if you kiss someone on the lips, if even a peck, they will tingle too!</li>
    <li> Really makes your lips tingle. Can feel them plumping. Others have had no luck with this product but I love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing except burn my lips! Good moisturizer but no plumping!</li>
    <li> It stings and maybe moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t plump your lips at all. I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t a pain to do. I don&#x27;t really give reviews normally, so I don&#x27;t mean to be unpleasant about my review, just not happy with the products claims.</li>
    <li> Works well and I received a little gift along with it with a personal note, thanks guys!I love the product</li>
    <li> It felt like it was just regular lip balm with an awful smell and taste</li>
    <li> Makes my lips tingle but I have not noticed them getting fuller.</li>
    <li> Not enough venom.  Act just like a regular lip gloss would, with just a little tingle that goes nowhere.  All hype no sting.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!!! My lips are soft and full and the morr i use it the better my lips look</li>
    <li> Not for the price!!!  My results weren&#x27;t noticeable it just stung a little.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see much difference when using this product.  It does have some good moisturizing elements which is good, but not what I expected based on the advertising.</li>
    <li> The positive reviews convinced me to try this.  Feels like I got hot sauce on my lips but not so bad that it bothers me. The burning sensation lasts for at least half an hour but I see absolutely no lip plumping going on here. I applied it several times throughout the day and even applied another lip plumping balm on top of it to see if that would help. Nope.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles, but was hoping for some improvement.  Absolutely Ridiculously High Price for something that seems like \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot; in a lip balm. I was going to try the mask, but since I&#x27;m not impressed with the lip balm, I won&#x27;t. The cost is too high of a gamble.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to expect at first, but it works well and makes my lips soft. Good product, I like it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. It does moisturize with a little tingle that doesn&#x27;t last long and no plumping. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> No it did not plump my lips just stung a lil</li>
    <li> I love this! I can tell a difference as I wear it each day and use it like chapstick and even before bed. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> This lip plumper tingles &amp; plumps well, and doesn&#x27;t taste bad. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> dont wast your money. tingles for 10 seconds than gone along with any plumping. so not worth the money.  really bad product bluntly&lt;br /&gt;lies about what it does.</li>
    <li> nothing extraordinary. you can hardly see the difference, and if there is it easily fades after a few minutes of applying.</li>
