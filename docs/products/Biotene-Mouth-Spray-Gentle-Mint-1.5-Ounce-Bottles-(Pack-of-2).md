### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the taste/smell is great, too!</li>
      <li>Awesome, or it would be if it didn&#x27;t also have Acesulfame K.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>When I saw \\&quot;#1 BEST SELLER\\</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best prices and best delivery system.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for it.</li>
      <li>This product is the best on the market</li>
      <li>Biotene is a very good product but the spray does not give the relief the gum gives.  </li>
      <li>Would not recommend this product but the biotene gel works great and has no flavoring.</li>
      <li>This is a great item.  </li>
      <li>The spray is inferior to the cough drop in terms of effective time, but perfect for night use because you can use it without fully waking.  </li>
      <li>Because of medications I take that dries out my mouth, this product has been of great help to me in keeping my mouth moisturized.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s great:  </li>
      <li>The best I can say about Biotene is it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
      <li>The Oasis spray works a lot better, lasts longer and has a very pleasant taste.</li>
      <li>Good idea to have the travel spray sizes.</li>
      <li>It also taste&#x27;s good and freshens your breath.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
      <li>Btw, if anyone has any recommendations for good alternatives, I&#x27;d love to hear them in the comments section for this review!</li>
      <li>Not that effective</li>
      <li>I am thrilled that I have discovered the Biotene line of products.  </li>
      <li>I now carry this in the glove box so it is always handy.  </li>
      <li>The Biotene gel toothpaste is nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Biotene products contain a unique LP3 enzyme system that works very effectively to get the saliva flowing and treat the dryness.  </li>
      <li>Taste is good, easy to carry around in purse.  </li>
      <li>but you do , kinda like beer. :-)</li>
      <li>Will be buying more when I need it</li>
      <li>difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sleeping much better and longer.</li>
      <li>The price is better than in pharmacies around us, the delivery is in time.</li>
      <li>I love xylitol</li>
      <li>And, if they were able to improve the taste, I would still be put off by the fact you have to shake it before you use it.</li>
      <li>within an hour or two I&#x27;ll be tempted to use more.  </li>
      <li>I do not believe them to be at all safe.    </li>
      <li>So the next best thing was to order some from Amazon.com</li>
      <li>Excellent product for night time use or after meals if you are a Sjogrens sufferer or have chronically dry mouth.</li>
      <li>I keep the bottle on the head of my bed and can reach it easily.  </li>
      <li>so I go through the bottles of this stuff very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I find the mint flavor to be very mild.  </li>
      <li>Strong aftertaste like mentholated cough drops.  </li>
      <li>I liked the spray very much.</li>
      <li>All Biotene products are very good for someone dealing with dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>Before I go out to start my day I use 5 sprays of this product and am fine for over 6 hours.  </li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD FOR SOMEONE THAT HAS A VERY DRY MOUTH.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m dealing with clients and having to talk a lot, it&#x27;s wonderful to have this as a little refresher and</li>
      <li>During waking hours I use sugar free cough drops but would probably choke to death on one if I fell asleep with one in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found the Oasis to be more effective and better for travel because the bottle is a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product helps my dry mouth problem, a good company for those who need the products....which are many.  </li>
      <li>I liked the first bottle very much but it began leaking so could not take it on trips.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product for people with dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>Only those who have lost all sense of taste would ever call their mouth spray a good product.</li>
      <li>and I find that by using the full system it is now fully under control.  </li>
      <li>liked the taste; works about as well as the gum re the dry mouth problem; stimulates saliva and is a bit better than the gum</li>
      <li>The Biotene has a nice taste and is easy to use in the middle of the night.</li>
      <li>Two stars based on convenience... otherwise save your money, get your butt outta bed, and get a quick drink of water.</li>
      <li>and this spray has made such a wonderful difference in my daily life.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to figure out how to get the spray to work on this new bottle.  </li>
      <li>This product does a good job fighting dry mouth and was recommended to me by my dentist.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say each individual bottle lasts a week at most...and at 8 dollars a bottle (from my local pharmacy, the only store in the area that carries it), that adds up to 32 dollars or more a month or 384 dollars or more a year in mouth spray, which is much more than I want to pay, no matter how good the product&#x27;s relief is.    </li>
      <li>He tried other brands and this one works the best and tastes better than other ones he tried</li>
      <li>but so worth it.  </li>
      <li>My suggestion to people with dry mouth is to get either gum or candy (Sugarless or not) to chew on and suck on to create their own saliva.</li>
      <li>It is very important to note that you are treating a medical condition if you need this product.  </li>
      <li>I also use the Biotene mouthwash which is very gentle.</li>
      <li>But, a quick swish and drink of water seems to relieve the dry mouth better and for longer.</li>
      <li>this moisturizing spray adds the final step to give me healthy saliva each and every day.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used several Biotene products and like their moisturizing gel, so I bought this product as well, but have not been as satisfied.</li>
      <li>I keep this in my purse and various bags and love it...</li>
      <li>Works great for alleviating dry mouth when drinking water is not possible.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great non-sugar sweetener that avoids what I see as the MANY pitfalls of ANY artificial sugar.  </li>
      <li>The Biotene should last longer, but is not as convenient to carry in pocket or purse, nor is its use as discrete if needed during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oasis has a very mild minty flavor and a more generous spray so one spray is enough for me.</li>
      <li>It does do the job so it may be worth a try for those who aren&#x27;t completely satisfied with other brands, but I&#x27;ve settled on Oasis for all around use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied since it has corrected my problem-just a few drops on my tongue before bed did the trick.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and convenient size if necessary to caarry with you.</li>
      <li>The bottle is large, and it never occured to me that perhaps I needed something during the day.</li>
      <li>It works great initially but the effect lasts less than an hour for me.</li>
      <li>It really works and is an affordable solution.</li>
      <li>I have used it before and the price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>really works.  </li>
      <li>I find that chewing gum before bedtime produces real saliva.</li>
      <li>HAHA</li>
      <li>I find the spray does not have the fresh flavor the gum offers.  </li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>This Biotene spray has more of a thin gel&#x27;ish texture than a pure liquid spray and a less appealing flavor to me--seems rather medicinal instead of refreshing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come out in a spray - it comes out in a strong single stream and doesn&#x27;t cover the inside of my mouth the way I need it to.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m a healthcare professional, so I say this with first hand knowledge).</li>
      <li>After reading the box and my first taste of it, it went directly into the trash.    </li>
      <li>Your salivatory glands have been shut down and need to be stimulated again to produce healthy, moist saliva.  </li>
      <li>My better half</li>
      <li>B002KAOAUE Biotene Mouth Spray)]], or the [[ASIN:B002KAO7Q6 Biotene Dry Mouth Gum]] which is sugar free.</li>
      <li>I recently had a back procedure and wasn&#x27;t able to drink or eat anything</li>
      <li>All Biotene products came highly recommended to me by my dentist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I keep one on my nightstand and use it every night and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;ve sampled most all dry mouth remedies.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d provide more details, but there are none, it just plain does nothing.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m *very* sensitive to their taste and some of their effects), so I double-checked the ingredients:  along with the xylitol is Acesulfame K.  </li>
      <li>I have tried just about all the available dry mouth moisturizing products and this is definitely not my favorite.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The drug reps frequent dental clinics, providing patient samples and God knows what else to the dentists.</li>
      <li>AS FAR AS WHERE TO SPRAY IT</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I keep this in my purse and various bags and love it... When I&#x27;m dealing with clients and having to talk a lot, it&#x27;s wonderful to have this as a little refresher and the taste/smell is great, too!</li>
    <li> If you suffer from dry mouth or bad breath, this product can help. It really works and is an affordable solution.</li>
    <li> I sprayed it one time in my mouth and immediately felt sick to my stomach.  In all fairness to the product I tried it again.  Yuk is all I can say.</li>
    <li> Unlike some of the other negative reviewers on here, I actually like the taste of the Biotene Mouth Spray; I find it both soothing and subtle and have no problems with it at all.  It feels great to use when you have a dry mouth (as I often do due to medication) and provides much-needed relief, especially since I developed all sorts of horrible cavities before using this stuff because of my constant dry mouth, so no problems there either.  What I do have a problem with is the fact that it just doesn&#x27;t last very long...within an hour or two I&#x27;ll be tempted to use more.  I also find that I need 5 - 8 sprays in order to truly get relief (although that may just be due to a rather extreme case of dry mouth) so I go through the bottles of this stuff very quickly.  I&#x27;d say each individual bottle lasts a week at most...and at 8 dollars a bottle (from my local pharmacy, the only store in the area that carries it), that adds up to 32 dollars or more a month or 384 dollars or more a year in mouth spray, which is much more than I want to pay, no matter how good the product&#x27;s relief is.    I haven&#x27;t tried any of the alternatives yet (none of the stores around here carry any) but it looks like I&#x27;m going to have to switch to something else that lasts longer or is less pricey because a bottle a week of Biotene Mouth Spray is just too expensive.  Btw, if anyone has any recommendations for good alternatives, I&#x27;d love to hear them in the comments section for this review!</li>
    <li> All Biotene products are very good for someone dealing with dry mouth.  They are  a little expensive but are worth the extra $$ for the relief they give.</li>
    <li> I use a C-Pap machine for apnea, which dries my mouth terribly during the night; sometimes, even using the humidifier.  This seems to do the trick, and lessens that dry mouth.  I&#x27;m about to buy my second bottle.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended biotene because I complained of dry mouth at night. I&#x27;m very satisfied since it has corrected my problem-just a few drops on my tongue before bed did the trick.</li>
    <li> The mouth spray is the first Biotene product that I was not totally delighted with. It works great initially but the effect lasts less than an hour for me.I have extreme dry mouth so maybe that has something to do with its lack of duration. But all the other dry mouth Biotene products are 5 stars for me! Especially the gel and the liquid.</li>
    <li> I feel tricked.  The blurb above says, \\&quot;Sweetened with xylitol\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s great:  I love xylitol:  it&#x27;s all-natural, low-calorie, and has a low GI (Glycemic Index).  It&#x27;s a great non-sugar sweetener that avoids what I see as the MANY pitfalls of ANY artificial sugar.  I detest them.  I do not believe them to be at all safe.    Which brings us here:  to this \\&quot;xylitol sweetened\\&quot; product.  Awesome, or it would be if it didn&#x27;t also have Acesulfame K.  It does.  My better half and I bought these to take to work, so when they arrived, we opened them immediately; she stuck hers in her purse, I left mine by the door.  I thought I detected some artificial sweetener of some sort (I&#x27;m *very* sensitive to their taste and some of their effects), so I double-checked the ingredients:  along with the xylitol is Acesulfame K.  Why in God&#x27;s name a company would use such a healthy sweetener in combination with something so horrible, I&#x27;ll never understand.  Anyway, I&#x27;ll be sticking exclusively with Xlear/Spry products from now on.    Shame on you, Biotin.  Sadly, since the packages have both been opened, I probably can&#x27;t even return them for a refund.    Horrible product, misleading description.  Stay away.</li>
    <li> This product is mouthwash in a spray bottle.  If you have dry mouth at night a glass of water will give you the same relief.  I find that chewing gum before bedtime produces real saliva. I was looking for a product that would last in my throat for hours.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the CPAP machine I use at night sometimes dries out my mouth and I thought this would give relief. The Biotene has a nice taste and is easy to use in the middle of the night. But, a quick swish and drink of water seems to relieve the dry mouth better and for longer. Two stars based on convenience... otherwise save your money, get your butt outta bed, and get a quick drink of water.</li>
    <li> Not that effective I would say.as my title says, I purchased this product and used it for about a week. the taste  although not the worst is not that pleasant and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It also did not work that well to resolve the dry mouth problems. I would say it would work for a couple of hours and then the treatment would have to be repeated. My suggestion to people with dry mouth is to get either gum or candy (Sugarless or not) to chew on and suck on to create their own saliva.</li>
    <li> This form of Biotene (spray) beats the others (gum, gel, mouth wash, etc.) both in taste and ease of use.  Keep one next to the bed and one in the car.  Amazon has the best prices and best delivery system.</li>
    <li> Works great for alleviating dry mouth when drinking water is not possible. I have used Biotene prior to medical procedures when drinking water is not allowed. I I have a lot of problems with sinus congestion and sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with a dry mouth. Rather getting up to drink water, I keep a spray bottle of Biotene on my night stand and a couple of sprays fixed me for the rest of the night. Only problem is the price is high for the amount in the bottles.</li>
    <li> This product is the best on the market it last longer than the Biotene dry mouth mouthwash.  It&#x27;s small enough to carry in my purse and it keeps my mouth moist for hours.  I recently had a back procedure and wasn&#x27;t able to drink or eat anything so I used the mouth spray prior to the procedure and didn&#x27;t have that nasty taste in my mouth.  It also taste&#x27;s good and freshens your breath.      My medications make my mouth so dry I sometimes start choking and this spray has made such a wonderful difference in my daily life.  Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about all the available dry mouth moisturizing products and this is definitely not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It has an unpleasant taste and lasts for about an hour, so for me it is pretty useless, just a waste of money. The Oasis spray works a lot better, lasts longer and has a very pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> The product does relieve mouth dryness and some may prefer this taste and texture, but I prefer the Oasis brand for a couple of reasons.  I&#x27;ve found the Oasis to be more effective and better for travel because the bottle is a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several Biotene products and like their moisturizing gel, so I bought this product as well, but have not been as satisfied. This bottle is quite a bit larger than the Oasis spray (1.5oz vs 1oz).  The Biotene should last longer, but is not as convenient to carry in pocket or purse, nor is its use as discrete if needed during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oasis has a very mild minty flavor and a more generous spray so one spray is enough for me. This Biotene spray has more of a thin gel&#x27;ish texture than a pure liquid spray and a less appealing flavor to me--seems rather medicinal instead of refreshing.  It does do the job so it may be worth a try for those who aren&#x27;t completely satisfied with other brands, but I&#x27;ve settled on Oasis for all around use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people with dry mouth.  I have difficulty with dry mouth and that can cause your teeth to rot.  I use this at night before I go to sleep and if I wake up with a dry mouth.  Use it in the day time also when my mouth gets really dry and water doesn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled that I have discovered the Biotene line of products.  I have had moderate to severe dry mouth for years due to medication I take and never fully understood what it was and how to handle it.  There is a huge difference between merely having a dry mouth where water or moisture will put you back to normal.  Water does not help the condition of dry mouth.  Your salivatory glands have been shut down and need to be stimulated again to produce healthy, moist saliva.  Other dry mouth symptoms are sores in mouth, pain when brushing etc.  I had all this.  I would wake up in the middle of the night with mouth so dry that I could not sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene products contain a unique LP3 enzyme system that works very effectively to get the saliva flowing and treat the dryness.  I use the entire Biotene system - toothpaste, mouth wash and this moisturizing spray.  Dry mouth is a serious condition and I find that by using the full system it is now fully under control.  Before I go out to start my day I use 5 sprays of this product and am fine for over 6 hours.  I also definitely need it before going to bed and now sleep straight through.  Constant water by my bedside is not necessary.  Biotene products are a little pricey but so worth it.  It is very important to note that you are treating a medical condition if you need this product.  If you are only using the spray and don&#x27;t think it is working then use all the products as I do.  Dry mouth is serious and it takes a couple of weeks once treatment begins to really see results.  It has been over 2 months for me now and all mouth discomfort is gone and this moisturizing spray adds the final step to give me healthy saliva each and every day.  But remember the condition of dry mouth does not go away and must continuously be treated.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I started suffering \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; several years ago, due to prescription drugs.  It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;ve sampled most all dry mouth remedies.  The Biotene products have helped me considerably, especially the mouth spray.  It&#x27;s  in my purse, next to my bed, in my car, &amp; next the chair where I watch TV.</li>
    <li> Every bottle I&#x27;ve bought has this same problem: the sprayer gets clogged. So there is only instant relief if I unscrew the cap and pour a dab on my tongue.</li>
    <li> Biotine works as well as other products I have used. Easy to use and convenient size if necessary to caarry with you.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom who has her salivary glands destroyed after radiation.  She says it changed her life, she can swallow her food now without fear of choking. I would recommend it to all patients who had radiation in the throat/mouth area. The price is better than in pharmacies around us, the delivery is in time.</li>
    <li> My use of the spray is strictly at night.  I have dry mouth problems all the time and wearing a CPAP makes it worse at night.  During waking hours I use sugar free cough drops but would probably choke to death on one if I fell asleep with one in my mouth.  This spray use is strictly at night when I have the CPAP on.  The spray is inferior to the cough drop in terms of effective time, but perfect for night use because you can use it without fully waking.  I keep the bottle on the head of my bed and can reach it easily.  The bottle is not as convenient for daytime use as cough drops or candy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Whoever thought of this - congratulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works.  Good idea to have the travel spray sizes.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD FOR SOMEONE THAT HAS A VERY DRY MOUTH. THE TASTE ISNT BAD EITHER. ALSO YOU CAN GIVE IT TO SOMEONE THAT HAS BAD BREATH AND JUST TELL THEM THIS IS FOR DRY MOUTH PEOPLE WHO TALKS TO MUCH. HAHA</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth as a side effect of medication that I am taking. The Biotene gel toothpaste is nice. The Biotene mouthwash takes some getting used to, but if I rinse with it before bed, it does help me through the night. But this mouth spray is AWFUL. The taste is just horrible.     And, if they were able to improve the taste, I would still be put off by the fact you have to shake it before you use it. Since I have a bed mate, this is not a selling feature. I don&#x27;t want to wake everyone up when I have dry mouth ... I just wanted something to keep by the bedside to help. This is not it. After reading the box and my first taste of it, it went directly into the trash.    Would definitely NOT recommend. My lowest rating.</li>
    <li> and I have easier time sleeping and little trouble at the dentist since using it, hygienist sees improvement…dry mouth at night will give you dental problems, avoid with this product!</li>
    <li> Some of my medications make my mouth very dry, and sometimes when I sort of become aware in the night, I just reach up on my bookcase bed, get my bottle of this spray, and use it.  I also had my husband keep it for me to use as I was coming out of anesthetic with surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  Sometimes I can get it locally at Walgreen or Wal-mart, but sometimes neither of them have any.  So the next best thing was to order some from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely nothing except taste bad.  I&#x27;d provide more details, but there are none, it just plain does nothing.</li>
    <li> When I saw \\&quot;#1 BEST SELLER\\&quot; I could not pass this claim by without warning others this does NOT apply to their dry mouth spray. IT IS AWFUL!!! Read the reviews of other products before wasting your money. The ONLY reason Biotene has achieved this is a direct result of advertising. The drug reps frequent dental clinics, providing patient samples and God knows what else to the dentists. (I&#x27;m a healthcare professional, so I say this with first hand knowledge). The best I can say about Biotene is it&#x27;s just OK. When Walmart started stocking the Biotene spray I bought 2 bottles. MAJOR mistake! This stuff is so awful I called the company to inform them of my opinion on the taste: like chewing on dirty sweat socks! I also returned the 2nd, unopened bottle for a refund. The opened bottle was thrown out. Only those who have lost all sense of taste would ever call their mouth spray a good product. ***NOTE: Biotene sensitive toothpaste and mouthwash (the green bottle tastes better) are fine, but still rate as just mediocre when it comes to effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviewers who complained about the taste.  I find the mint flavor to be very mild.  I tried a drugstore house brand and it was AWFUL!  Strong aftertaste like mentholated cough drops.  I&#x27;ll stick to Biotene from now on.  I have dry mouth from diabetes and medications.  This stuff is a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  If you are not allowed to have much liquid in your diet, your mouth gets very dry.  This product really helps keep your mouth moist so that your craving for water or other liquid is lessened.</li>
    <li> i was encouraged by my dentist years ago to try the Biotene Mouthwash, and did so, but found that the dry mouth symptoms returned after a few hours. The bottle is large, and it never occured to me that perhaps I needed something during the day. My wife keeps hard candy in her purse for when her mouth gets dry, so I began using it as well. My dentist was horrified when I told her and she said to stop any candy, ever, and use either this [[ASIN:B002KAOAUE Biotene Mouth Spray)]], or the [[ASIN:B002KAO7Q6 Biotene Dry Mouth Gum]] which is sugar free. She told me about the salivery glands and the LP3 enzyme that stimulates saliva production, and gave me a sample bottle, which I used as soon as I got to the car. I now carry this in the glove box so it is always handy.  I&#x27;ve found the spray is meant to be an in-between measure, to be used after brushing in the morning, then the [[ASIN:B000GGKQAM Biotene Mouthwash]], and after having used the [[ASIN:B003XIXH38 Biotene Oral Balance Gel, ]]gel at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line is, this is an interim measure, not a solution. You must use as an adjunct to regular use of the toothpaste, mouthwash, and night time gel. This combination will do the trick if your dry mouth is not the result of a chronic medical condition.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry mouth due to two very drying medications I cannot live without. All Biotene products came highly recommended to me by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chew the gum, use the mouthwash and toothpaste and also use the mouth spray and gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry mouth, you are a serious risk for increased cavities, bad breath and as you know, sometimes embarrassment when speaking to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water intake is key as well as cutting down on caffeine, and using products like these. After 4 weeks I can tell you that as an RN, it delivers on its promises.</li>
    <li> Biotene is a very good product but the spray does not give the relief the gum gives.  I find the spray does not have the fresh flavor the gum offers.  I only use the Biotene gum now.</li>
    <li> This product works instantly; but doesn&#x27;t last long enough. It does help, however; so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and on dialysis.  I really suffered from dry mouth.  This spray as well as the mouth wash has made a big difference.  It refreshes you mouth and can be carried in your purse for those times that you can&#x27;t get to a drink but are seriously parched.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out in a spray - it comes out in a strong single stream and doesn&#x27;t cover the inside of my mouth the way I need it to.</li>
    <li> It does everything it claims. Makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sleeping much better and longer. I&#x27;ll definetly continue to use it.</li>
    <li> this product helps my dry mouth problem, a good company for those who need the products....which are many.  I will continue using their products...happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job fighting dry mouth and was recommended to me by my dentist.  He knows what he is talking about.</li>
    <li> I keep this by my bedside so that during the night I can spray the Biotene allowing me to get back to sleep.</li>
    <li> I liked the spray very much. and it help my dry mouh a lot. My mouth felt refresh after using it.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have a bottle of this on our night stands. We both take meds that make our mouths very dry, so a few squirts of this in the middle of the night does the trick.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This product has an unpleasant after taste,  I would not recommend this.  It does do it&#x27;s job but the after taste ruins it.</li>
    <li> Taste is good, easy to carry around in purse.  Seems to do what it states it will and is a no brainer to use.</li>
    <li> liked the taste; works about as well as the gum re the dry mouth problem; stimulates saliva and is a bit better than the gum</li>
    <li> I have used it before and the price was reasonable. I would recommend it to a friend. Will be buying more when I need it</li>
    <li> I use this when I am sick or when I go hiking to prevent dry mouth/ throat. It works really well. It doesn&#x27;t taste toothpaste minty, but the taste only lasts a little bit anyways. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for night time use or after meals if you are a Sjogrens sufferer or have chronically dry mouth. Taste takes awhile to get used too,  but you do , kinda like beer. :-)</li>
    <li> Because of medications I take that dries out my mouth, this product has been of great help to me in keeping my mouth moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Water just doesn&#x27;t do it so thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry mouth at night due to a medication I&#x27;m taking. The lack of saliva wakes me up several times a night. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for it. I keep one on my nightstand and use it every night and recommend it highly. I also use the Biotene mouthwash which is very gentle.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from asthma problems, that cause him to have dry mouth from the medications.  He especially needs it at night and keeps by his side of the bed to relief the dryness from his meds.  He tried other brands and this one works the best and tastes better than other ones he tried</li>
    <li> If you have dry-mouth, from chemotherapy or some other reason, these small spray bottles are terrific to take along in pocket or purse.  I also recommend the Biotene mouthwash, Biotene toothpaste. Costs a lot less thru Amazon than at the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  I liked the first bottle very much but it began leaking so could not take it on trips.  I have not been able to figure out how to get the spray to work on this new bottle.  Please help.</li>
    <li> Not very affective and has bad aftertaste.  Would not recommend this product but the biotene gel works great and has no flavoring.</li>
    <li> DOSN&#x27;T LAST VERY LONG BUT IT&#x27;S CONVENIENT TO CARRY IN POCKET OR PURSE&lt;br /&gt;TAKES A LITTLE PRATICE TO USE AS FAR AS WHERE TO SPRAY IT</li>
