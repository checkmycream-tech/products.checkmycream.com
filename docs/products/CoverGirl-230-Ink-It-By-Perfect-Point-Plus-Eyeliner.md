### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Cover Girl&#x27;s Ink It Perfect Point</li>
      <li>and it was still awesome.</li>
      <li>So I figure I&#x27;d make the best of it.  </li>
      <li>I found that the best solution was to hold it on my lashline until it warmed up.</li>
      <li>best pencil eyeliner ever, doesn&#x27;t smudge and works amazing!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>This is a great deal at the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Does have great staying power.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have my eyeline drip or wipeoff - this has staying power!</li>
      <li>greatly impressed, it takes a bit to apply and you don&#x27;t get a smooth</li>
      <li>and I suppose that makes it good</li>
      <li>I used mine until it ran out, and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so good.</li>
      <li>The unique design of this liner is the BEST.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The product goes on very smoothly and makes a good line, even when dealing with creased lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great eyeliner for those that want a pen with a fine point.  </li>
      <li>I rather liked it.</li>
      <li>I feel like I need to put a lighter on the tip to warm it up for application.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is the absolute perfect solution.  </li>
      <li>I am a novice though, so those of you out there that use this a lot, this crayon kind of approach might just be your thing.</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;Eyeliner 101\\&quot; on the product page, CoverGirl suggests rolling the tip between your fingers to warm and soften it.</li>
      <li>(Reviewed by my wife, Lynn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking for the perfect eyeliner that will stay put and make a decent line on my \\&quot;mature\\&quot; (think wrinkling) eyelids.</li>
      <li>loved how the eyeliner glided on so easy.  </li>
      <li>What I did find out was that it smeared very easily.</li>
      <li>Great, eco friendly and healthy eyeliner.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best Eyeliner Ive ever tried.</li>
      <li>If you can apply it right, it looks very nice.</li>
      <li>It looks great, stays really well, and I would buy it again.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>This comes out of the applicator blunt and squared off, more like a crayon than eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love it, but I just didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
      <li>I have been using eyeliner for many years</li>
      <li>The only covergirl product I&#x27;ve ever truly been impressed with is the lash blast mascara, everything else in this brand line is garbage.</li>
      <li>Has become my favorite eyeliner.</li>
      <li>This makeup promises alot and it has a nice rich color to it.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;perfect point plus&amp;#34; liner had some issues with smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy with the new Ink It!</li>
      <li>Ink It By Perfect Point Plus Eyeliner, Black Ink, 0.006 Ounce]] is OK, but it depends on what kind of skin you have.</li>
      <li>This one is pretty good.</li>
      <li>I want to look good consistently.</li>
      <li>My favorite use for it was to line my lower lashline as it could easily be &amp;#34;smoked out&amp;#34; and there was no issue with skipping in that area.</li>
      <li>Nice clean lines, smooth application, works like a pencil but is often mistaken for a gel.</li>
      <li>And I love that it never needs sharpening, which means the point is always precise.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to control and sharpens automatically with a click/turn of the pen.</li>
      <li>For me, this easy to practice with than the gel/liquids….</li>
      <li>This product makes a very bold line.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Instead of being easy to just wash or wipe off, it just continued to smear everywhere.</li>
      <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t easily come off, it does not smear to under my eyes or run off my lid if I sweat or accidentally touch or rub my eye.</li>
      <li>easily sometimes&lt;br /&gt;-Pulls/</li>
      <li>Easy breezy eyeliner application with this CoverGirl 230</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of easy.</li>
      <li>I am impressed with how well i stays on even after i slept with it one night; the next morning it looked exactly how i had put it on the morning of the day before.</li>
      <li>just fine</li>
      <li>cause its by far the best i&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I am still a huge fan of Cover Girl cosmetics, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this product.  </li>
      <li>It is absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>I found it to go on smoothly with no irritation to my eyes or my contacts.  </li>
      <li>If you want a smudged line, I would recommend getting this, but it you want that precise liquid liner look, buy another product.</li>
      <li>and it was soooo smooth and the color is just what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, nice soft application, and waterproof - everything I&#x27;ve been looking for in an eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I saw this in CVS and got SO excited because I&#x27;ve been looking for a gold liner that doesn&#x27;t have flakes of glitter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is even better because the formula doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge--even in hot weather or blinking ect....</li>
      <li>Now, the smeary liner actually provides a relatively pleasant smoky look,</li>
      <li>I use kohl on the inner bottom lid, this does apply there but not as good as kohl for coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like it, the pencil is so fine and accurate.</li>
      <li>a public figure\\&quot; (don&#x27;t ask--it isn&#x27;t that interesting)  for a full day without being able to check my makeup.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get it off with soap, I need an eye makeup remover product and I tend to run out of those quickly.</li>
      <li>Super Skinny Eye Marker, Carbon Black,1.1ml .  </li>
      <li>gave it three stars because even though it isn&#x27;t what I originally wanted, the color payoff is right.  </li>
      <li>have to say that I much prefer an old fashioned kohl pencil, much more smooth and precise.</li>
      <li>I think that you need to learn to work with it &amp; its a good eyeliner that will stay on for a long time!</li>
      <li>The liner removes easily with a gentle swipe of a washcloth.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best black covergirl eyeliner.</li>
      <li>After reading about this eyeliner in a magazine(waterproof and great for tight lining the eye) I went and bought it.</li>
      <li>The result is a clean, crisp line that does not smear at all.  </li>
      <li>you want to go for the full expense of treating yourself to a super long lasting, non creasing eye liner, because you are a famous superstar and have to look good 24/7 for the fans and those pesky paparrazzi, just mortgage your house and choose Bobbi Brown&#x27;s gel eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s precise, easy to control, and lasts a long time too, and then comes off fairly easily with makeup remover.</li>
      <li>When this new eyeliner became available, I was so excited.</li>
      <li>As a precise liner this doesn&#x27;t work for me, but as a smudged line I really like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a pencil liner, but soft, so that it makes a smudgy line.</li>
      <li>This is far darker and smoother than many eyeliners I have tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricier, but worth it.</li>
      <li>By its name I assumed this would be a very smooth thick application, maybe it would use a bit more of the product than usual but result in an excellent line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the product tends to migrate pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is affordable, reliable, and usually has great variety.  </li>
      <li>you want a pencil liner that&#x27;s dark, even, and staying, this is a good product.  </li>
      <li>The self sharpening feature is great and I will not go back to regular eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I do have to be careful to use a light touch, though, because otherwise I look like someone took a Sharpie to my eyes. :)</li>
      <li>it kind of reminded me of drawing eyeliner on with one of those dry</li>
      <li>The one from L&#x27;Oreal goes on very smoothly but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
      <li>am just a person with very easily creased eyelids who really dislikes that extra line I get from eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, what I&#x27;ll say is that I&#x27;ve never in my life met an eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge or crease over the course of the day.</li>
      <li>If you just want a lightweight stick liner to thow in your purse, I would have to say that this one is not my first choice.</li>
      <li>They can be used in so many ways to create such drama and spark to your eyes.  </li>
      <li>on the rims (which means, that it should hold up pretty well in water).</li>
      <li>At times it would also skip and require you to go over the same area more than once.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was because the first one that I bought kept breaking off, it could have been the summer heat because I&#x27;ve had three more since and never had the issue again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading about this eyeliner in a magazine(waterproof and great for tight lining the eye) I went and bought it. Sorry to say that this eyeliner does not having any staying power and my eyes end up in a big black mess.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> so good. best pencil eyeliner ever, doesn&#x27;t smudge and works amazing!!</li>
    <li> I got this in charcoal ink.. I have mixed feelings about this eyeliner. Its a little hard to work with it, given that the tip can break BUT it does last!! I am impressed with how well i stays on even after i slept with it one night; the next morning it looked exactly how i had put it on the morning of the day before. I think that you need to learn to work with it &amp; its a good eyeliner that will stay on for a long time!</li>
    <li> By its name I assumed this would be a very smooth thick application, maybe it would use a bit more of the product than usual but result in an excellent line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is anything but. It is hard, takes a couple passes, and uses a few millimeters of the product to just get a solid line. I feel like I need to put a lighter on the tip to warm it up for application. It is almost like trying to apply a colored pencil to your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item in stores and do not suggest anyone else to.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing! It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t budge. I even wore it in the pool in and in 100+ degree weather and it was still awesome. This is my new go-to eyeliner!</li>
    <li> On the plus side, this eyeliner gives me a nice, dark line and stays put.  That&#x27;s really the end goal of eyeliner for me, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, application is a little difficult.  I have to apply the line in short strokes instead of one smooth, flowing stroke.  Also, the design could be better, because you can&#x27;t click the tip back down.  If you&#x27;re like me and twist too much tip up at first, then you&#x27;re out of luck.  While the eyeliner didn&#x27;t smudge over my lid, a little did rub off on my fingers, even after it should&#x27;ve been set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a decent eyeliner, does the job as I said before, but it&#x27;s definitely not going to replace any of the eyeliners already in my arsenal.  For a thin, smooth black line from a twist-up pencil I recommend Tarte emphasEYES.  It&#x27;s pricier, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this eyeliner pencil. On the plus side, it&#x27;s very dark and lasts all day (and even the next day, unless you remove it). On the other hand, I couldn&#x27;t get the self-sharpening to work for me at all. The tip stayed blunt and rough, which actually made it a bit painful to apply. I wanted to love it, but I just didn&#x27;t. But it wouldn&#x27;t be an awful choice for someone who&#x27;s interested in beauty on a budget.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of easy. In fact, if it is not easily done, in terms of make-up, I am not likely to use it at all. While I really like gel or liquid, sometimes that is just messy. I like this eyeliner because it requires enough pressure to apply that an accident slip of the finger does not get it all over the place, but it still applies relatively easily. In terms of thickness though, I still prefer liquid. I am a novice though, so those of you out there that use this a lot, this crayon kind of approach might just be your thing. For me, this easy to practice with than the gel/liquids…. Nice dark color too.</li>
    <li> I hate it, I cannot even get to go on, It the plastic part scratches my eyelid and it breaks off and nothing gets on my eyelid!! Awful!!!</li>
    <li> When first applying the liner it pulled on my upper lid so there was an issue of having to pull and hold the lid down for a smoother application. At times it would also skip and require you to go over the same area more than once. After managing to get the desired look it would stay on all day and never smudge. My favorite use for it was to line my lower lashline as it could easily be &amp;#34;smoked out&amp;#34; and there was no issue with skipping in that area. Overall it is a decent lower priced waterproof liner with no huge faults.</li>
    <li> Not very soft, pencil isn&#x27;t retractable, and does not go on very smoothly. The name implies it&#x27;s super dark... I&#x27;ve used better. I&#x27;d recommend Silkissima or Scandaleyes before this product for dark, smooth eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This is far darker and smoother than many eyeliners I have tried. If you apply it very carefully, it really looks like a black marker drawn on your eyes. It&#x27;s precise, easy to control, and lasts a long time too, and then comes off fairly easily with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, nice soft application, and waterproof - everything I&#x27;ve been looking for in an eyeliner. I just wish it was easier to remove. I don&#x27;t get it off with soap, I need an eye makeup remover product and I tend to run out of those quickly. It&#x27;s nice to not have my eyeline drip or wipeoff - this has staying power!</li>
    <li> I have always had an issue with my eyeliner giving me raccoon eyes within a few hours. I wear it on my upper and lower lids, and I have allergies that make my eyes water. I have Tried EVERYTHING! This is by far the best Eyeliner Ive ever tried. Its even on my eyes in the morning when I wake up (on the nights I dont wash my makeup off)... I have def found my go-too liner. I hope they never take this eyeliner off the shelf, cause its by far the best i&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I saw this in CVS and got SO excited because I&#x27;ve been looking for a gold liner that doesn&#x27;t have flakes of glitter.  So I bought it and took it home.  Much to my surprise the \\&quot;ink it\\&quot; liner is actually a pencil, I was soooo disappointed but this was my fault for not reading the package, I guess.  So I figure I&#x27;d make the best of it.  I tested it on the back of my hand and it was soooo smooth and the color is just what I wanted.  I was super excited because I usually hate pencils, but it seemed super smooth, I went and tried it on my eyelid.  The ad says it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;skip, drag or pull\\&quot; I find this a total lie!! It skips, drags and pulls, the only way I can get it to go on smoothly I have to pull my eyelid out.  Or else I can&#x27;t get a smooth line, which is just annoying.  It&#x27;s super smooth on the back of my hand, but trying to get it onto my eyelids is just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because even though it isn&#x27;t what I originally wanted, the color payoff is right.  The product DOES stay put all day once I do get it on my lids and I should&#x27;ve read the packaging.</li>
    <li> It is black, it is a twist pencil product and it works moderately well.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t kohl and isn&#x27;t soft leaded or smooth to apply but does allow for a little purposeful smudging.&lt;br /&gt;But once on it stays and I suppose that makes it good value.&lt;br /&gt;Not greatly impressed, it takes a bit to apply and you don&#x27;t get a smooth line.&lt;br /&gt;As I use kohl on the inner bottom lid, this does apply there but not as good as kohl for coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I much prefer an old fashioned kohl pencil, much more smooth and precise.</li>
    <li> (Reviewed by my wife, Lynn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking for the perfect eyeliner that will stay put and make a decent line on my \\&quot;mature\\&quot; (think wrinkling) eyelids. Seeing a name like Cover Girl&#x27;s Ink It Perfect Point Plus, I was hopeful that if not tattoo- like, this product would have some staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, what I really like: the pencil design that allows the pencil to sharpen itself automatically. The little sleeve that surrounds the point keeps it sharp all the time, without any effort on your part. The product goes on very smoothly and makes a good line, even when dealing with creased lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product tends to migrate pretty quickly.  Now, the smeary liner actually provides a relatively pleasant smoky look, just not the one it&#x27;s supposed to.  Also, the rate at which it tends to smear seems to vary rather widely and even with two weeks&#x27; worth of trial, I have not found any discernible pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I love the design of this product and its wonderfully sharp point,  I doubt I will purchase it again unless I can find a solution to the smearing problem.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s long lasting, and easy to apply. It&#x27;s the only liner I use anymore.</li>
    <li> Easy breezy eyeliner application with this CoverGirl 230 Ink It Point. Simple to stick in your purse and go too!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is terrific.  The point draws a precise, fine line, which is what I prefer, although you can go more dramatic if you choose.  The liner removes easily with a gentle swipe of a washcloth.  I was a little hesitant about using the black (I generally prefer to use brown) but the thin line looked great.  I recommend it, and will be using it from now on.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best black covergirl eyeliner. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now, the black is very dark and goes on smoothly. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was because the first one that I bought kept breaking off, it could have been the summer heat because I&#x27;ve had three more since and never had the issue again.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is very similar to one that I already have from L&#x27;Oreal.  The one from L&#x27;Oreal goes on very smoothly but doesn&#x27;t last all day. The cover girl version is a bit harder to apply, like a hard pencil versus a soft leaded pencil, but it does stay on without smudging significantly longer.</li>
    <li> My biggest problem with mascara and eyeliner is that it&#x27;s difficult to find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge. I have tried CG&#x27;s regular self sharpening eye liner and didn&#x27;t have any problems with it, but this kind does smudge a little. The self sharpening feature is great and I will not go back to regular eyeliner. Toward the end it started coming out even though I hadn&#x27;t twisted it, which ended up wasting some of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using eyeliner for many years and I have to say that this is a step up from pencil as far as quality and not having to sharpen it. But it does have its pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;You twist the applicator to get the pencil out But once you twist out too much you can&#x27;t twist it back in, so it ends up breaking off and that is a waste. When applying this I find that it is very thick and waxy, so I have to press on my eyes a bit to actually apply the liner and once it’s on I cannot get it off! I wash with soap and water and it leaves a raccoon mask, maybe actual makeup remover could get it off just fine but I wasn&#x27;t using that at the time; the next morning I had remnants on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not like how thick and waxy this feels, I can feel it on my eyelids during the hot weather (I live in FL). Since it doesn&#x27;t easily come off, it does not smear to under my eyes or run off my lid if I sweat or accidentally touch or rub my eye. And it is very dark, almost like liquid eyeliner which I do like. If you can apply it right, it looks very nice. But if you make a mistake here or there, it’s very hard to remove without smudging it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this eyeliner. It looks great, stays really well, and I would buy it again. I thought that it was easy to apply, although I see some other reviewers had trouble with that.</li>
    <li> I like a thin line along my eyelashes. This comes out of the applicator blunt and squared off, more like a crayon than eyeliner. Admittedly I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t bother to try and shape a point, but I don&#x27;t think I should have to. Even though I tried to use the edge of the blunt &amp;#34;point&amp;#34; I still ended up with a wide line covering nearly half my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried to remove it. My make-up remover did nothing. I had to scrub with soap to get this stuff off. I thought I was going to be stuck with a black eye. Again, I don&#x27;t think I have to work that hard to use make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever get around to shaping a nice point, at least I know it will stay on when I go swimming.</li>
    <li> The [[ASIN:B00C67ED30 CoverGirl 230 Ink It By Perfect Point Plus Eyeliner, Black Ink, 0.006 Ounce]] is OK, but it depends on what kind of skin you have. If you have an oily eyelid, this probably is not a good product for you. It is difficult to apply because it cakes up as soon as it touches the skin. People with dry eyelids looking for a soft eyeliner might find this to be more useful.</li>
    <li> From the product name and description, I expected that this would be an ink/gel/liquid eyeliner, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s more like a pencil liner, but soft, so that it makes a smudgy line. I was able to make a very thin line, but it wasn&#x27;t solid. As I went over it to make the line darker, it became wider, and still wasn&#x27;t solid. I don&#x27;t know how they achieved the cat eye look that&#x27;s on the product page. I couldn&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the \\&quot;Eyeliner 101\\&quot; on the product page, CoverGirl suggests rolling the tip between your fingers to warm and soften it. That works, but it made a mess on my fingers. I didn&#x27;t want to stop applying the liner because that would have defeated the purpose of warming it, so by the time I finished, the liner was set on my fingers and I had to use makeup remover to get it off. Without warming the liner, it did drag on my lids a bit. I found that the best solution was to hold it on my lashline until it warmed up. Then it went on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its favor, the liner did last all day for me with no smudges or creasing, although I am very careful not to rub my eyes when I&#x27;m wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mixed review. As a precise liner this doesn&#x27;t work for me, but as a smudged line I really like it. If you want a smudged line, I would recommend getting this, but it you want that precise liquid liner look, buy another product.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product makes a very bold line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s kind of hard to control -- the point is not very fine, and there is no way to sharpen it to a fine point. It was very difficult to apply it right along my lash line.&lt;br /&gt;- Once I had applied it, I couldn&#x27;t smudge/blend it to where I wanted it. It stayed PUT.&lt;br /&gt;- It is freaking impossible to remove! Seriously. I used eye makeup remover, and it did nothing. Waterproof is fine, but having to walk around the next day looking like a raccoon, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this. But if you want a bold black line that won&#x27;t go away even when you want it to, this is a fine option.</li>
    <li> I always struggle with getting crisp black liner.  Pencils make it hard to get close enough to the lash line, and liquid and gel seems to clump my eyelashes, ruining my mascara.  This eyeliner is the absolute perfect solution.  It is small enough of a point that it gets very close to the lash line, without depositing in my actual lashes.  The result is a clean, crisp line that does not smear at all.  And I love that it never needs sharpening, which means the point is always precise.  This will be a permanent addition to my make up bag!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an eyeliner person...like if I could only take one piece of my make-up kit to an island in the middle of nowhere...it would be eyeliner. This one is pretty good. First, what I&#x27;ll say is that I&#x27;ve never in my life met an eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge or crease over the course of the day. This is not that eyeliner either. However, it stood up very well...well enough that I would purchase it again. The applicator is a little unique...as you turn the eyeliner up it comes out of a secondary clear plastic tube that fits within the larger black tube...which was interesting (I assume that&#x27;s the self-sharpening aspect). Additionally, the way it goes on is different...it kind of reminded me of drawing eyeliner on with one of those dry felt pens. I rather liked it. It did smudge over the course of the day...there wasn&#x27;t too much creasing, just a tiny bit. And even though I scrub my face down every night I could still see traces of it the next morning...on the rims (which means, that it should hold up pretty well in water).</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Does have great staying power. (I can sleep in it for a while and it hardly budges)&lt;br /&gt;-Good color&lt;br /&gt;-Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Non irritating (I wear contacts)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Breaks easily sometimes&lt;br /&gt;-Pulls/drags at eyelids during application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will spend the extra money on a liner that is gentler on the lids to apply. I hate feeling like im damaging such a sensitive area of skin...if this one didn&#x27;t drag or pull I would be totally sold and in love with it. &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;This one will stay just a back up I suppose.</li>
    <li> love it, but it smudges so bad!</li>
    <li> This makeup promises alot and it has a nice rich color to it.  Unfortunately, it still smudges and gathers around the corners of the eyes if you have oily skin and also in any humid weather.  Such a shame because I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeliner for those that want a pen with a fine point.  Has almost a &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; for the pen portion that&#x27;s a little plastic piece, that make it go on easily to the right place.  Stays all day. Has become my favorite eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great, eco friendly and healthy eyeliner. Check out the EWG site for ratings - this rates well.</li>
    <li> This product is no better than a pencil. When I saw that it was an INK eyeliner I expected liquid. Nope. Still a soft solid makeup. Because of this it &amp;#34;skips&amp;#34; over wrinkles and is hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is if you extract too much of it, you can&#x27;t retract it. You&#x27;re stuck with the amount you turn out, so hope it doesn&#x27;t fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like it, won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m middle aged and probably not the target audience for this eyeliner. However, after a bout with cancer and chemotherapy, I lost my eyebrows completely and also my eyelashes are much thinner and lighter, even after a couple of years. This eyeliner is pretty serious stuff, but applied with a very light hand, I find it works well to help camouflage those problems for me. I do have to be careful to use a light touch, though, because otherwise I look like someone took a Sharpie to my eyes. :)</li>
    <li> CoverGirl is always a name you can count on and this eyeliner is no different.  I found it to go on smoothly with no irritation to my eyes or my contacts.  However, it didn&#x27;t last as long as other eyeliners I&#x27;ve used and I had to re-apply a couple of times throughout my day.  The product is a little dry when you first start using it, but as it wears down, it becomes softer.  Will continue using it, but probably won&#x27;t purchase again in lieu of Maybelline&#x27;s Master Drama or Loreal&#x27;s black eyeliner.</li>
    <li> If you want an inexpensive black eyeliner with lots of cool impact, I reccomend instead:&lt;br /&gt;NYX Super Skinny Eye Marker, Carbon Black,1.1ml .  I used mine until it ran out, and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every eyeliner out there.&lt;br /&gt;This is due to the fact that I love make up and also because I have, at times, had to appear in public \\&quot;as a public figure\\&quot; (don&#x27;t ask--it isn&#x27;t that interesting)  for a full day without being able to check my makeup. I need eye makeup I can count on! I don&#x27;t work as a clown in these public instances and as I am pretty vain I want to look good consistently. Just telling the truth here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to go for the full expense of treating yourself to a super long lasting, non creasing eye liner, because you are a famous superstar and have to look good 24/7 for the fans and those pesky paparrazzi, just mortgage your house and choose Bobbi Brown&#x27;s gel eyeliner. It is absolutely fantastic. You will wear out before it does. Trust me!&lt;br /&gt;However, If you just want a lightweight stick liner to thow in your purse, I would have to say that this one is not my first choice. I would go for Nyx.&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a spokeperson for Nyx.&lt;br /&gt;I am just a person with very easily creased eyelids who really dislikes that extra line I get from eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional thing I noticed with this liner is that is isn&#x27;t all that intensely black.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really BLACK black, look for another liner.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
    <li> No more farting around with the organic eye-pencil I&#x27;ve been using - this is the way to go. Clean, sharp, easy for making all-day lines without the smudging I&#x27;ve been accustomed to. Usually by the end of the day all my eyeliner has migrated to the eyelid crease - this smudged up nicely for a smokey look but then actually lasted all day. This is a great deal at the price. The smaller tip means WAY less breakage than other pencil-type products I&#x27;ve used. The only thing I would say is with the tip being THIS small, you are going to have to make several passes to get a nice thick line. Perhaps if you&#x27;re looking for a thick line, a marker-style eyeliner is more practical.</li>
    <li> This one goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t clump like other eyeliners tend to. The only problem is it tends to smear really easily, hence four stars.</li>
    <li> First of all, Cover Girl is my usual go-to brand of make-up.  It is affordable, reliable, and usually has great variety.  When this new eyeliner became available, I was so excited. I am a huge fan of eyeliner.  They can be used in so many ways to create such drama and spark to your eyes.  Even if I don&#x27;t want to pull out all the make-up, I at least wear eyeliner and/or mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved how the eyeliner glided on so easy.  I have seen others comment on this product stating that it skipped or dragged, but I never had this problem.  What I did find out was that it smeared very easily. If you barely touched it or shed one small tear, this stuff was smearing all over the place.  It wasn&#x27;t long before this eyeliner gave the raccoon eyes that you usually get with mascara.  Even though it smeared easy, it was hard to get off with makeup remover!  Instead of being easy to just wash or wipe off, it just continued to smear everywhere. It was a mess and time consuming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am still a huge fan of Cover Girl cosmetics, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this product.  Give it a pass and find a different eyeliner to use.</li>
    <li> I love, is maintained for a long time and no need tweaks</li>
    <li> I work 12 hour night shift and eyeliner used to be my biggest enemy. Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has worked nights knows that it&#x27;s impossible to not rub your eyes at some point. Usually that leaves a mess. Usual long lasting makeup brands boast an 8 hour wear time, which sucks for 12 hour shifts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner lasts. Rubbed eyes, long hours and still looks like I just put it on. If I forget to take the makeup off it doesn&#x27;t even wipe off on my pillow case. It is cry proof sweat proof and comes off easy with just a little soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. Nice clean lines, smooth application, works like a pencil but is often mistaken for a gel.</li>
    <li> My wife has weighed in with her review of this item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name implies that this is a liquid liner, or at least could substitute for a liquid liner... but it&#x27;s not, and it can&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a pencil liner that&#x27;s dark, even, and staying, this is a good product.  But this is no replacement for a liquid liner!</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s a self sharpening pencil, I am a fan of the pencils, but it seems deceiving to call it &amp;#34;Ink it&amp;#34; The point hasn&#x27;t broken on me during use yet which has always been my big complaint of pencils and other self sharpening pencils.  The color is a nice dark and saturated black and it does last all day on me, but it&#x27;s not impossible to get off at the end of the day with a liquid face wash or simple makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner, it goes on smooth, and is very sharp when applied, it stays on all day, and is a very rich black, the only complaint is it breaks very easy with very little pressure, so I ended up buying another because I went through the first pencil so fast. I really like it, the pencil is so fine and accurate.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my usual eye liner and in a rush purchased this one with it&#x27;s catchy &amp;#34;ink it&amp;#34; name assumed it would be creamy or at least a glide on, easy to use alternative. Boy was I totally wrong! This thing is CRAP... With capital C - R - A - P. It pulled on my eye lid, hard to blend, and to top it off the tip kept breaking off!! It&#x27;s not smooth AT ALL, I don&#x27;t understand how this thing even mimics an &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; appearance or application. Total waste of money. The only covergirl product I&#x27;ve ever truly been impressed with is the lash blast mascara, everything else in this brand line is garbage. Super disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Thank you Cover Girl!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wear liner on the lower part of my eyes. I have used the &amp;#34;perfect point plus&amp;#34; CG liner in black onyx for many years. The unique design of this liner is the BEST. It is easy to control and sharpens automatically with a click/turn of the pen. The KEY is the FINE  tip.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I tried the new &amp;#34;Ink It&amp;#34;----shown here.&lt;br /&gt;It is even better because the formula doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge--even in hot weather or blinking ect.... The &amp;#34;perfect point plus&amp;#34; liner had some issues with smudging.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy with the new Ink It!</li>
