      <li>I am beyond pleased.</li>
      <li>Just made sure to use my gloves and not get it on skin</li>
      <li>I tried so many things.</li>
      <li>For me, the treatment has lasted more than 2 weeks.  </li>

      <li>If you apply this product, be sure to wear gloves as directed.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, I always have to pay extra at the nail salon for callus remover....</li>

      <li>and I made sure to tell my mom about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At last, this is the best product I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Great product, really works well, but you still need to keep up with it on a weekly basis.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
      <li>The callous remover did not hurt my good skin as another reviewer experienced, but I was very careful after reading her review.</li>
      <li>Surprised since this product had great reviews.  </li>
      <li>For $5 more I can add the callus removal treatment to my monthly pedicure, but I&#x27;m cheap</li>
      <li>Love love love this and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>As for the callus, it ate right though that and made it very easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>my feet turned out baby smooth.  </li>
      <li>I used a bowl shaped double-ended metal cuticle remover, which is available through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and my feet feel so good and soft.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t usually review things, but this one was too good not to!!</li>
      <li>and she was so excited when she saw the skin roll right off!  </li>
      <li>Great duo to exfoliate and moisturize your dry skin!  </li>
      <li>Not bad tears mind you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She went to the store and bought a half dozen pairs of sandals and is excited to show her feet off all summer and is happy that upkeep is going to be a breeze.</li>
      <li>With this stuff, three minutes and a quick rub in the shower with a pumice stone, my calluses are 80% gone.</li>
      <li>so I quickly ordered some and had it delivered overnight.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing one more treatment in a couple days and they will be completely gone.</li>
      <li>I bought the colossal micro planer that is shown below, and the two work beautifully.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You need a good scraper, like a sharp edged spoon.  </li>
      <li>I did not use the microplane rasp again because my feet were wet and it works best on dry feet.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is really nice for dry elbows as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You might have to be more conservative if you have deep cracks, as this is a powerful acid-like product.  </li>
      <li>I even tried Sally Hansen cuticle remover, which sort of worked, but it was really too mild to do the job.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything special, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy duty - it just works LIKE magic!</li>
      <li>This will now be a regular beauty treatment for me because I love</li>
      <li>After using this product my feet feels so soft and smooth</li>
      <li>I wonder where all theses positive reviews are coming from?</li>
      <li>The eliminator works very well</li>
      <li>the price is extremely reasonable.  </li>
      <li>This worked very well for me.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I was very self conscious.</li>
      <li>I had no negative effects at all.</li>
      <li>Make sure you pre-soak your foot for several minutes and then experiment how long you should leave on the product, then scrape away.  </li>
      <li>I was almost to the point of going for a professional foot care and pedicure, but I didn&#x27;t want anyone to see my feet!</li>
      <li>First of all, I got cheaper price online in comparison with local retails.</li>
      <li>Also, be careful, this makes your feet super slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Alright so I am 20 years old and since I can even remember I have had like flaky, cracked feet.</li>
      <li>It completely ate through the calcium build-up in my shower that nothing will get rid of.</li>
      <li>Living in Vegas for 15 years, I have tried everything to keep my feel looking soft because we wear sandals year-round here.</li>
      <li>She has used every cream and glorified cheese grater that had come onto the market promising results, but they&#x27;ve always left her disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had it since I was young.</li>
      <li>Modified graters, battery operated sanders, and \\&quot;rasps\\&quot; were either too fine to do the job or left my skin very rough.  </li>
      <li>I used a microplane rasp first on my DRY feet, just on the callouses.  </li>
      <li>but apparently the damage was already done.  </li>
      <li>No scheme bare foot or wear sandal anymore.</li>
      <li>It really sucked, Usually I&#x27;ve heard this from older women</li>
      <li>Used the dry heel eliminator after that and used that product every night thereafter to retain my baby soft skin!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t remove ALL of it at first, but over the next week she used it a few times and has been showing off her \\&quot;new\\&quot; feet since.  </li>

<li> Left it on for 3 minutes after soaking my feet for 5 minutes (right after my shower), then wiped off and used a wet pumice stone to remove the dead skin, following with a thorough cleansing of my feet.</li>
<li> /&gt;You do have to be careful to only get it on your dead skin or it will really irritate your skin.</li>
<li> I had tried every cream and gadget that I could find to get rid of the dry cracked skin on my heels and outer big toes</li>
<li> so I let it go too long and have to start all over again ...</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t even have to leave it on very long at all</li>
<li> The only issue is if you do not wear gloves or be very careful, you will burn your skin.  </li>
<li> I used the dry heel rub on my feet without gloves.</li>
<li> and I just use a purple pumice thing (that you can get at Sally beauty supply) to slough off the dry skin.</li>
<li> My heels are moderately dry and scaly, so I needed just one application.  </li>
<li> This was easy to use, but a bit scary due to other reviews.  </li>
<li> You only use the callus remover occasionally but you will use the lotion everyday - do buy the three-pack!</li>
<li> So technically  I paid for half  of a bottle,  </li>
<li> Amazed at how the eliminator removed the very rough and dry skin from my feet then used the lotion and put on socks.  </li>
<li> The liquid is pretty thin, so I only applied a small amount at a time.  </li>
<li> I left on for 3 minutes, use my Mr. Pumice to slough off the dead skin</li>
<li> I do recommend this for softening up callused feet, but do be careful where you apply it.</li>
<li> Just be careful.</li>
<li> Be careful standing/stepping in the tub because your feet will be extremely slippery!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  It might work for you.</li>
    <li> Great duo to exfoliate and moisturize your dry skin!  Amazed at how the eliminator removed the very rough and dry skin from my feet then used the lotion and put on socks.  Best stuff I have ever used and the price is extremely reasonable.  Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every product on the market.  Modified graters, battery operated sanders, and \\&quot;rasps\\&quot; were either too fine to do the job or left my skin very rough.  The callus scrapers with the blades in them can be risky to use and don&#x27;t remove the dead skin evenly. I have also tried all kinds of creams and lotions that promised to soften the feet.  I even tried Sally Hansen cuticle remover, which sort of worked, but it was really too mild to do the job.  At last, this is the best product I have ever used.  It met my hopes and expectations, and I couldn&#x27;t wish for more.  My heels are moderately dry and scaly, so I needed just one application.  You need a good scraper, like a sharp edged spoon.  I used a bowl shaped double-ended metal cuticle remover, which is available through Amazon.  Make sure you pre-soak your foot for several minutes and then experiment how long you should leave on the product, then scrape away.  You might have to be more conservative if you have deep cracks, as this is a powerful acid-like product.  You will be truly amazed at what comes off.  For me, the treatment has lasted more than 2 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t like the accompanying lotion, as it smelled awful and was very sticky. After one use, I chucked it not the trash.</li>
    <li> The liquid  was all over  the inside  of  the bag before  I opened  it. So technically  I paid for half  of a bottle,  it looked  like someone  opened it and didn&#x27;t  close it correctly,  I would  return  it, but I don&#x27;t  feel  like  going  through  the return  process</li>
    <li> It does work as described.  I used it once but am reluctant to use it again.  It is probably  best used with another person applying the product. My experience  indicates if you accidentally get it on good skin, it will eat good skin as well.  This happened to me and it took a week for my body to repair the damage.  I did rinse well but apparently the damage was already done.  As for the callus, it ate right though that and made it very easy to remove.  Just be careful. If you can NOT see the callus area well definitely get someone to help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying everything on my calluses for around 17 years.. With this stuff, three minutes and a quick rub in the shower with a pumice stone, my calluses are 80% gone. I&#x27;m guessing one more treatment in a couple days and they will be completely gone. I&#x27;ll come back and update after a second treatment. The lotion is really nice for dry elbows as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually review things, but this one was too good not to!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical before I bought because I just didn&#x27;t think anything would work as well as the stuff the pedicurist uses but this stuff is AMAZING!! You don&#x27;t even have to leave it on very long at all and I just use a purple pumice thing (that you can get at Sally beauty supply) to slough off the dry skin. I will definately be buying more!</li>
    <li> This callus eliminator is amazing. My feet always look horrible and stained from walking barefoot around the house. My heels look like a  baby&#x27;s now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work without using a buffer or planer on you feet. I bought the colossal micro planer that is shown below, and the two work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful to only get it on your dead skin or it will really irritate your skin. Also, be careful, this makes your feet super slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area  in the shower where I rested my foot while it was working, was eradicated of the calcium buildup. It completely ate through the calcium build-up in my shower that nothing will get rid of. This product is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my calluses.</li>
    <li> Living in Vegas for 15 years, I have tried everything to keep my feel looking soft because we wear sandals year-round here. Not even regular pedicures work as well as this remover and lotion combination! It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything special, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy duty - it just works LIKE magic! You only use the callus remover occasionally but you will use the lotion everyday - do buy the three-pack!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I always have to pay extra at the nail salon for callus remover....not this time! If you apply this product, be sure to wear gloves as directed. After using this product my feet feels so soft and smooth and I&#x27;m able to touch my husband without hearing him say, move that grater....thank you callus eliminator.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me me.  I used it several times through the summer.  I let it sit on my feet for 10 minutes and then used a pumice and I didn&#x27;t feel it helped removed the dead skin.  Surprised since this product had great reviews.  I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to have good reviews I used it and noticed nothing changed. I was not very impressed and would never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great products! Easy to use, pleasant smell too.</li>
    <li> Great product, really works well, but you still need to keep up with it on a weekly basis.  The only issue is if you do not wear gloves or be very careful, you will burn your skin.  I got an unbelievable burn on mine from this product.  So pay attention when applying it.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that the bottoms of my feet could be used to make a pair of cowboy boots.  This stuff worked... my feet turned out baby smooth.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not good at keeping it up so I let it go too long and have to start all over again ... so end up repeating the process.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not bad tears mind you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I was a little girl my mom has had the nastiest feet, yellowed cracked heels that made her embarrassed to wear sandals. She has used every cream and glorified cheese grater that had come onto the market promising results, but they&#x27;ve always left her disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing about my moms heels I&#x27;ve always kept good care of mine and when the skin started to get thicker than desirable I started looking in beauty supply stores for something to fix it, when I came across this product.  The results were wonderful for me and I made sure to tell my mom about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a recent trip to northern Michigan to see my mom I found out she still hadn&#x27;t tried this product (for fear of disappointment) so I quickly ordered some and had it delivered overnight.  I used it on her feet and she was so excited when she saw the skin roll right off!  It didn&#x27;t remove ALL of it at first, but over the next week she used it a few times and has been showing off her \\&quot;new\\&quot; feet since.  She went to the store and bought a half dozen pairs of sandals and is excited to show her feet off all summer and is happy that upkeep is going to be a breeze.</li>
    <li> I used the dry heel rub on my feet without gloves. My feet &#x27;moulted&#x27; for about a week after two applications, and became softer. At the same time I was totally puzzled about my hands peeling! I never connected the two until I was describing this wonderful product to my daughter. Anyway, don&#x27;t use it on any sore, cut, or otherwise inflamed part of your feet. I have RA nodules on my feet and this actually burned that area. I do recommend this for softening up callused feet, but do be careful where you apply it. And wear gloves!</li>
    <li> Alright so I am 20 years old and since I can even remember I have had like flaky, cracked feet. It really sucked, Usually I&#x27;ve heard this from older women but I&#x27;ve had it since I was young. I tried so many things. I was afraid to get my toes done in fear of the nail technicians talking about how bad my feet were. I would pumice my feet and lotion them nightly but that alone never worked. Then (singing angels) I found this! I just used it once. And duuuude! It&#x27;s like magic in a 4oz bottle! I am beyond pleased. Works like a gem! If I could post a pic I would!</li>
    <li> happy, satisfied users of this product. The Callus Eliminator works as promised; soak the callused foot in water, put the product on the callus, ( I use a cotton tip,) wait the time directed and file the callus away. It removes approx. 80 to 90% of the callus. Then, baby your feet with the Heel Eliminator cream.  A perfect duo for feet problems.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had tried every cream and gadget that I could find to get rid of the dry cracked skin on my heels and outer big toes but this product finally got rid of it!!! I am ecstatic! I was almost to the point of going for a professional foot care and pedicure, but I didn&#x27;t want anyone to see my feet! I was very self conscious. I had no negative effects at all. The callous remover did not hurt my good skin as another reviewer experienced, but I was very careful after reading her review. Left it on for 3 minutes after soaking my feet for 5 minutes (right after my shower), then wiped off and used a wet pumice stone to remove the dead skin, following with a thorough cleansing of my feet. Used the dry heel eliminator after that and used that product every night thereafter to retain my baby soft skin! Love love love this and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> For $5 more I can add the callus removal treatment to my monthly pedicure, but I&#x27;m cheap and so I bought the stuff to do it myself at home.  It works just like the stuff they use at the nail salon.  This will now be a regular beauty treatment for me because I love my flip flops and nasty looking heals is a result of that!  This was easy to use, but a bit scary due to other reviews.  Just made sure to use my gloves and not get it on skin I want to keep.  One thing that I want to point out is that there was a piece of plastic in the cap that was very difficult to get out, especially while I had my gloves on.  But once I removed it, I was able to get the cap to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.</li>
    <li> For me it was waste of money, because it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I wonder where all theses positive reviews are coming from?</li>
    <li> First of all, I got cheaper price online in comparison with local retails. The eliminator works very well so make sure DO NOT apply on good skin. It lasts about two weeks and my feet feel so good and soft. No scheme bare foot or wear sandal anymore. By the way, u need a good foot file. I use Microplane one. Heel Eliminator makes the callus grow back slower. They are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for me.  I hadn&#x27;t been keeping up with my pumice in the shower over the winter so my callouses had built up.  I used a microplane rasp first on my DRY feet, just on the callouses.  Amazing how well that thing works.  Then I soaked my feet in the tub for about 10 min.  Using gloves (same ones I use to color my hair) I applied the callous remover liquid just on my heels, ball of foot, and big toe callous.  The liquid is pretty thin, so I only applied a small amount at a time.  I left on for 3 minutes, use my Mr. Pumice to slough off the dead skin and then I used soap to wash my feet thoroughly.  Be careful standing/stepping in the tub because your feet will be extremely slippery!  I then decided to use the product immediately again as my callouses were pretty bad.  So I applied the callous remover liquid again.  I did not use the microplane rasp again because my feet were wet and it works best on dry feet.  I was extremely happy with the results!  My husband said my feet felt like a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
