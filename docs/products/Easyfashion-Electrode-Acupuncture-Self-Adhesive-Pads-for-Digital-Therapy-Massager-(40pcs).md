### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What a cheap price and it even works!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great price for these pads.  </li>
      <li>Great device.</li>
      <li>Not as sticky as the set that came with my unit but for the price are a great deal.  </li>
      <li>I am quite happy with these snap on replacement pads for my Tens.</li>
      <li>cheap and works awesome</li>
      <li>A good buy for the price.</li>
      <li>We will use these and buy more!</li>
      <li>Nice to have extras of these.</li>
      <li>Am very pleased I bought a pack of 2 at walgreens for $19.99 and for about 5 to 9 I got packs of 40 more</li>
      <li>Would order more when I ran out.</li>
      <li>Why pay more when these works so well.</li>
      <li>They work, but not as effectively as the original ones that came with my set, even when I use the gel which is supposed to make it do so.</li>
      <li>fast shipping good quality for price</li>
      <li>/&gt;To prolong its life span, make sure you use some alcohol to clean te body area before you stick these pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worked fine.</li>
      <li>The backs are vinyl instead of fabric which seems cheap</li>
      <li>I was excited to find these on Amazon, and after receiving them I am excited to find they are better than the ones that came with the main unit!  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m sure they will be fine since i bought some like them recently</li>
      <li>I would recommend spending the extra money to buy the better pads as you get multiple uses out of them and they stick much better.</li>
      <li>I hope do more business in future,</li>
      <li>The metal buttons that should snap into the lead wires are too large.</li>
      <li>These pads work with the unit, but don&#x27;t stick very well.  </li>
      <li>but actually works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>They stick well for several uses, and perform exactly as they are supposed to.</li>
      <li>Overall its a good value, but if your device uses almost full power for the ones you use now, you may find these not effective enough to apply the same pressure.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on these cheap imitations.</li>

    <li> My wife bought the device from a sale at her work and we were concerned that the unit only had 2 pads.  I was excited to find these on Amazon, and after receiving them I am excited to find they are better than the ones that came with the main unit!  We will use these and buy more!</li>
    <li> Function well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticky surface will eventually loose it stickyness due to the natural oil off the skin surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prolong its life span, make sure you use some alcohol to clean te body area before you stick these pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Or you can buy some electrol gel</li>
    <li> Not compatible with the Omron unit as described. The metal buttons that should snap into the lead wires are too large. There is no way to connect them to the unit.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these cheap imitations. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Worked fine. Great device.</li>
    <li> Not as sticky as the set that came with my unit but for the price are a great deal.  The last well enough through several applications.  The backs are vinyl instead of fabric which seems cheap but actually works pretty well.  A good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> The adhesive is poor.  Very difficult to apply and keep in place.</li>
    <li> Fits any standard &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; or TENS type portable units. Why pay more when these works so well.</li>
    <li> What a cheap price and it even works!!!!! Would order more when I ran out.</li>
    <li> These pads work with the unit, but don&#x27;t stick very well.  Only getting one use out of them.  I would recommend spending the extra money to buy the better pads as you get multiple uses out of them and they stick much better.</li>
    <li> cheap and works awesome</li>
    <li> i sent these to my daughter and she received them when she was told they would be there. she hasn&#x27;t received the tens unit yet because it isn&#x27;t due for a while yet so she hasn&#x27;t used them. i&#x27;m sure they will be fine since i bought some like them recently</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on these and was a trifle concerned. I am quite happy with these snap on replacement pads for my Tens. I will buy them again. I hope they don&#x27;t change their quality before that!</li>
    <li> Nice to have extras of these. Doesn&#x27;t work well in the heat if you sweat. Otherwise stick well, and can be reused a few times before needing new ones.</li>
    <li> Am very pleased I bought a pack of 2 at walgreens for $19.99 and for about 5 to 9 I got packs of 40 more</li>
    <li> They work, but not as effectively as the original ones that came with my set, even when I use the gel which is supposed to make it do so. Overall its a good value, but if your device uses almost full power for the ones you use now, you may find these not effective enough to apply the same pressure.</li>
    <li> Great price for these pads.  They stick well for several uses, and perform exactly as they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> fast shipping good quality for price I recommended thank you I hope do more business in future,</li>
