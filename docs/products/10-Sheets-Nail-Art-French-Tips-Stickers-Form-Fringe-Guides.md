      <li>They are more curved than the ones I normally find which I love...</li>
      <li>than I thought , but cool.</li>
      <li>Product is very strong, only good if you are going to use directly on clear nails.</li>
      <li>the sticker ripped the original polish right off with it.</li>
      <li>Make sure to apply it to the back of your hand first to remove some of the stickiness before applying to your nails, and make sure the edges are secure.  </li>
      <li>Overall, LOVE!</li>
      <li>i was happy with the way it had a light stick... hard getting in the crease of my nails</li>
      <li>def well worth the price.</li>
      <li>but it was worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>The price is just right for what you get.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not using the right polish</li>
      <li>If you place this stickers on polished nails, it will peel the nail polish right off.</li>
      <li>They are a bit small for the thumb but otherwise are great.</li>
      <li>These little stickies work great, and really easy to use and actually stay put on the nail.</li>
      <li>I have paid more for just one pack locally.</li>
      <li>Many weeks later and product is yet to arrive.</li>
      <li>I love doing french tips .</li>
      <li>Love these french tip guides.</li>
      <li>They will last me a while, but I&#x27;m purchasing more when I&#x27;m out again.</li>
      <li>, so this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>If they go on straight, then it is possible to get a good French tip on the nail.  </li>
      <li>They arrived much faster than I had thought too.</li>
      <li>These also don&#x27;t really stick.  </li>
      <li>If not the polish will seem underneath them and your line will not be straight.</li>
      <li>These stick on very well.</li>
      <li>These are really arched</li>
      <li>The curve is very drastic on these so there not that helpful.</li>
      <li>When these finally arrived, I was excited to use them, but because the curve is so high, the ends</li>
      <li>they are not as long and just barely fit across my thumb.</li>
      <li>but really you get french manicure, the chevron design, and a third one that looks kinda like the chevron but more curvy.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have them pressed down well.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect high quality guides though.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t interested i trying to send them back.</li>
      <li>when i put my first layer of polish on and then put the stickers on to do the french manicure &#x3D;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that will affect her using that sheet or not, but it looks ok to me.</li>
      <li>a happier note, the 1/3 of the product that I can actually use works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Oo wow... 10 sheets in just $2.</li>
      <li>It took almost 6 weeks to receive them, since they came from Asia directly</li>
      <li>but of your nails are wide they look funny.</li>
      <li>Exactly what i expected.</li>
      <li>One package gives you 3 full manicures with a few guides to spare.</li>
      <li>it just swoops down making the design tip a little more upside down smile instead of french tip curve.</li>
      <li>Even on clear nails you will be left with glue residue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got these weeks after I ordered them.  I used to use the Sally Hansen stickers, which I really liked but couldn&#x27;t find anymore.  When these finally arrived, I was excited to use them, but because the curve is so high, the ends don,t even reach the sides of my nails.  I definitely got what I paid for.  The Sally Hansen ones had a lower arch, and extended past the sides of your nail.  These also don&#x27;t really stick.  I&#x27;ll need to find an alternative to Sally Hansen and these.</li>
    <li> I ordered these nail art sheets and i got skeleton hand hair clips instead. Scared the hell out of me</li>
    <li> Saves a lot of money from expensive nail salon visits and the ability to freshen nails as often as you like!</li>
    <li> Really love these. I tried them last night and worked great!. They arrived much faster than I had thought too. Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely do business with this person again.</li>
    <li> I like to do french tips in all kinds of colors. These make a nice crisp edge. They seem to be just sticky enough.</li>
    <li> What I received looks just like the picture in the listing. They look like they&#x27;ll fit any nail size. There looks to be around 50-60 in each sheet, and 10 sheets so these should last my wife awhile. The price is just right for what you get. She&#x27;ll be able to do her nails maybe 50 times with this set. They came well packaged except for one sheet that was folded over. I&#x27;m not sure if that will affect her using that sheet or not, but it looks ok to me. I would recommend this as a nice cheap gift for someone who likes doing their nails, or just for yourself.</li>
    <li> waste of time, don&#x27;t bother buying them. They won&#x27;t stick to anything. Poor purchase</li>
    <li> Work for some daze nails but of your nails are wide they look funny.</li>
    <li> Pros! Price. Lots of guides .&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not fully cut away from the above or below guide. Somewhat annoying to detatch them from one another.&lt;br /&gt;Too sharply curved on the sides so instead of a slight gradual curve it just swoops down making the design tip a little more upside down smile instead of french tip curve. Would be ok if it were for my fingernails (which most people yse them as this) . but on toenails (why i got them) thats a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall...not to bad. Ill use them. Ill just snip the sides off and make it work.</li>
    <li> i was happy with the way it had a light stick... hard getting in the crease of my nails but that was cause i was being lazy LOL but over all i liked this product it was shipped in good time. def well worth the price. go to sallys and you will see that this is a deal!!</li>
    <li> took for ever to get here. there are a lot and they work great. My toes now love me more.</li>
    <li> I love these nail stickers! The ones you buy in the store just aren&#x27;t curved enough to get the look I want. These are perfectly arched and look like I just came from the salon! I would give it 5 stars but sometimes the stickers are a little hard to rip a part. Not really a huge concern though. Overall, LOVE!</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that all the stickers would be the single curve traditional French nail tip design. Instead, a third are a v shape and the other third are a curved point.  No thanks.  It was a good price, but 2 thirds of this product are headed directly for the trash :(</li>
    <li> These took about 2 weeks to get. They have a greater curve to them than the Sally Hansen ones. I like that better. They stick great. Good purchase. All the guides are the same style.</li>
    <li> These are great for home manicures. They are a bit small for the thumb but otherwise are great. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;m terrible at free hand french tips on my self. At least when it comes to painting my right hand. I had tried this technique when I was in my teens with poor results. The trick is to wait until your base color is totally dry before applying. Then after you have painted the tips wait until that polish is totally dry before removing the guides. As long as I take the time to line them up right I get a perfect french manicure every time! One package gives you 3 full manicures with a few guides to spare.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I thought they would be. Maybe I&#x27;m not using the right polish but they don&#x27;t give the french tip I expect. Shipped faster than anticipated, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them in the past, but at times we&#x27;re hard to find in our small town. These stick on very well. There is also two other styles included. The price is amazing. I have paid more for just one pack locally. Shipping was faster than expected. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this seller.</li>
    <li> I never thought in my wildest dreams that I could do a French manicure. Using these tips stickers makes the job easy and flawless. I was amazed how beautiful my manicure looked like. A salon&#x27;s look!</li>
    <li> Got these sooner than expected which is always a plus for items shipping from China or Hong Kong!  I got 10 individual packs, each has one sheet of 54 tip guides.  They are more curved than the ones I normally find which I love... I have small nail beds and find that the ones I have don&#x27;t cover the corners where it curves down.  They also seem to stick much better and I get a much cleaner sharper line than I do with the other ones. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the stickers peeling off my base coat because I stick them on clean bare nails, use base coat and the two coats of white at my tips only, then remove the stickers and finish off with base coat all over and then the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Will def purchase again - cannot go wrong especially when you get soo many for cheaper than 2 sheets here in the states AND they work better!</li>
    <li> These nail tip guides came in on time but are smaller that I would like.  I have been having issues with my local walmart being out of the guides so I ordered some...they are not as long and just barely fit across my thumb.</li>
    <li> It is preety nice and gets the job done. Good for its price recommend this product for starters. Good product</li>
    <li> Initially received only half the order. Contacted the seller and was promised the other half. Many weeks later and product is yet to arrive. Product is very strong, only good if you are going to use directly on clear nails. If you place this stickers on polished nails, it will peel the nail polish right off. Even on clear nails you will be left with glue residue.</li>
    <li> when i put my first layer of polish on and then put the stickers on to do the french manicure &#x3D; the sticker ripped the original polish right off with it. and i let it dry over night before doing the french part:( and they curved a little too much for my liking</li>
    <li> Love these french tip guides. Easy to apply and easy to peel off. Make sure you have them pressed down well. If not the polish will seem underneath them and your line will not be straight. If they are on correctly you will have a great french manicure. Found them easy to use.</li>
    <li> These little stickies work great, and really easy to use and actually stay put on the nail.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me. They are not easy to apply, they stick to the undercoat and can peel it off. I tried numerous ways to apply these, but the color either bled or the stickers wouldn&#x27;t come off without peeling off part of the nail polish.</li>
    <li> The curve is very drastic on these so there not that helpful.</li>
    <li> My package contained the arrow and pointed tips, which was not what is described in the listing.  I&#x27;ll have to throw out 2/3 of the product sent to me but it&#x27;s not worth the shipping to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a happier note, the 1/3 of the product that I can actually use works pretty well.  Make sure to apply it to the back of your hand first to remove some of the stickiness before applying to your nails, and make sure the edges are secure.  This didn&#x27;t create a perfect line for me on my nails but I don&#x27;t expect them to.  I just wanted to skip the trouble of having to do it freehand, so this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Just as described in product description.</li>
    <li> Everything went fine, cheers</li>
    <li> I love these tip guides, i cant do my tips manuall so these are perfect. This is my second time ordering them so yes I will order them again, as soon as I run out, they stick in place very good and peel off perfect.</li>
    <li> Love &#x27;em, love &#x27;em, love &#x27;em! So many sheets! They will last me a while, but I&#x27;m purchasing more when I&#x27;m out again. Very nice and easy to do.</li>
    <li> They make it appear as though you are going to get ten sheets of french manicure guides but really you get french manicure, the chevron design, and a third one that looks kinda like the chevron but more curvy. I read other product descriptions before I bought them though that stated this fact so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when they arrived. They are a bit difficult to apply at first but I think with practice it&#x27;ll become easier. I love the results! It makes it so much easier and faster to paint cute nails!  They were shipped from China so if you only buy American products these are not the nail stickers for you.</li>
    <li> I like the product and the delivery was speedy.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what i expected. Great cheat to a PERFECT french!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother ordering this product. The tapes are not shaped properly for finger nails and I just ended up throwing them all away after I got them. It didn&#x27;t pay me to return them, they  were garbage. It took almost 6 weeks to receive them, since they came from Asia directly so I wasn&#x27;t interested i trying to send them back.</li>
    <li> i ordered the zig zag/chevron style stickers n got french tip! sigh!</li>
    <li> as described,  timely delivery  spot on.  will buy again!</li>
    <li> These are really arched and I like them that are straighter.</li>
    <li> Oo wow... 10 sheets in just $2. Definitely gonna buy again.</li>
    <li> These are not very sticky. They&#x27;re ok for the price. Don&#x27;t expect high quality guides though.</li>
    <li> I like the French nails, so I though I would save money and do mine myself at home.  These stickers are not easy to place on the nails using fingers alone.  Easier to place on the nails with a small tweezer.  If they go on straight, then it is possible to get a good French tip on the nail.  I don&#x27;t use them as much anymore since I switched to Gel nails, but I plan to keep the sheets because they are a good bargain for the price.  The longer your nail the easier they are to place.  Very short nails pose a problem with placement.</li>
    <li> Even when your base coat is fully dry it peeled it off. I don&#x27;t use cheap nail polish either. To me, it&#x27;s too sticky.</li>
    <li> This deal is perfect. You get a lot for a little bit of money. They work really good. I bit my nails off again so i haven&#x27;t been able to use them more than twice. But I will not run out anytime soon. Each pack comes with about 40 strips, and the order came with 10 packs. SO i got like 400 strips!</li>
    <li> The item was as described,  but it took a month to receive it</li>
    <li> They are too small for use...total waste of money. The stickers don&#x27;t come off the page without ripping and when they do they don&#x27;t have enough adhesive to make a seal so when you polish it runs under the sticker. It looks like they were made ten years ago and pulled out to be put on sale. I don&#x27;t like bashing people but I must be honest.</li>
    <li> I love doing french tips . Theses allow me to werar my favorite trend over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;Thinner than I thought , but cool.</li>
    <li> they work well enough. I find that even if I push down on the stickers some don&#x27;t really have a hard seal and can get slightly off. but with a qtip and some acetone it cleans off</li>
    <li> I am all thumbs and these helped me get perfect my French manicure looking awesome.  They took a while to come but thats because it&#x27;s coming from China but it was worth the wait.  It did arrive when they said it would,  and I was happy I purchased these when I saw the amount I got!  This will last me a long time and I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> it leaks under the strip.tryed it several different ways not inpressed with using it.</li>
