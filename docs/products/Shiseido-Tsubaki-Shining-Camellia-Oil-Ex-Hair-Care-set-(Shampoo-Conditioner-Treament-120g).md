      <li>I just cnt stop using this wonderful brand&#x27;s products</li>
      <li>And they all smell so good!</li>
      <li>This wonderful product makes my hair feel so much better, I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it!</li>
      <li>The trio sold together was a great value at the price I paid.</li>
      <li>I came across this shiseido hair set and saw good reviews for the shampoo alone</li>
      <li>Thank you for very fast delivery and excellent product!</li>
      <li>Anyway,I really love its smell!</li>
      <li>Love the treatment!</li>
      <li>Used this shampoo in Okinawa, LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it!</li>
      <li>I purchased this set and immediately fell in love with how good it smells.</li>
      <li>The smell was nice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years now and it is really the best shampoo for my hair.</li>
      <li>plus that store is about 1.5 hours&#x27; driving from my apt.</li>
      <li>.. smells nice too..</li>
      <li>I think this shampoo/conditioner would be better for someone with over processed or bleached hair.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Yet the conditioner is better than the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love it and cannot imagine my life without it.</li>
      <li>really love it</li>
      <li>For a long time I was buying suave and inexpensive shampoos getting the best bang for my buck.</li>
      <li>After I used the shampoo and conditioner my hair felt silky smooth.</li>
      <li>worth it!</li>
      <li>You feel like you need a daily conditioner and the super strength conditioner isn&#x27;t as good as kholesteral.</li>
      <li>make your hair really bright and shine, it&#x27;s so easy to make the bubble and so easy to clean the bubble, the smell is super good, i purchase the white one in real store last year, this one is much cheaper online.</li>
      <li>Because i found my hair turn to be oily so quickly after using it....</li>
      <li>now i dont use oil to tame my fly aways.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with its nice smell and it solves my problem with dry, frizzy hair as a Chinese girl.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the blue set, makes no difference than the several dollars super market one.</li>
      <li>One thing I need to mention is, if your hair is pretty oily then I dont recommend you to use this product.</li>
      <li>Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and soft.</li>
      <li>It left my hair so nice and soft.</li>
      <li>There were no more fly aways and my hair fell naturally with the layered cut I have.</li>
      <li>Smell is very luxurious.</li>
      <li>They shipped fast and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner was very hydrating</li>
      <li>I had bought Wen because I have really damaged hair but it didn&#x27;t do much and it was too pricey.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t substantially better than any other shampoo.</li>
      <li>Just as good if not better than Redken&#x27;s All Soft, and a hell of a lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>In order to not use too much conditioner and to make sure I distribute it evenly, I mix a little in a bath bucket with some water and then pour the diluted conditioner over my hair.   </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product from this seller.</li>
      <li>Ever since I killed my hair with a perm I haven&#x27;t been able to find something that does this.  </li>
      <li>I have coarse Asian hair and it makes my hair feel so smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>leaves hair very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>And it does make your hair soft!</li>
      <li>I also purchased the matching \\&quot;hair water\\&quot; which as far as I can tell is kind of a weak hairspray/febreeze/refresher for your hair.</li>
      <li>thats not too poofed out, its also soft  </li>
      <li>Oh wow..</li>
      <li>I love this product,my hair is thick  </li>
      <li>I saw exactly the same products in a Chinese supermarket/grocery store.</li>

<li> The treatment bottle is unseal ,and there are only about half bottle.</li>
<li> I decided to try this because my hair was very dry and unruly.</li>
<li> $30 not well spent.</li>
<li> It smells like when you get your hair done at a salon minus the price!  </li>
<li> i dont find that it weighs down my hair neither...</li>
<li> my hair was so dry and damaged from heating tools before i used this shampoo+ conditioner!!!!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the blue set, makes no difference than the several dollars super market one. Yet the conditioner is better than the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Oh wow.. this stuff is just what I&#x27;ve been needing! I color my hair on a regular basis, and since it is long, the ends are frizzy, but thankfully not split. This wonderful product makes my hair feel so much better, I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it! Just as good if not better than Redken&#x27;s All Soft, and a hell of a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product,my hair is thick  And these give me enough bounce and body thats not too poofed out, its also soft  and  manageable now i dont use oil to tame my fly aways. I got it on time and well packaged. Would highly recommend this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner was very hydrating but it left my hair flat and oily. The smell was nice.  Perhaps if used separately it might not leave hair so oily.  I think this shampoo/conditioner would be better for someone with over processed or bleached hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using Shiseido hair care products since i was 15 in China. It has been quite lots of years. I just cnt stop using this wonderful brand&#x27;s products even i am now in U.S.A.    I saw exactly the same products in a Chinese supermarket/grocery store. They&#x27;re about 45 dollars. This item is cheaper than the one i saw in the grocery store plus that store is about 1.5 hours&#x27; driving from my apt. So it&#x27;s just simple to buy the item online!    Anyway,I really love its smell! And it does make your hair soft! One thing I need to mention is, if your hair is pretty oily then I dont recommend you to use this product. Because i found my hair turn to be oily so quickly after using it....</li>
    <li> I purchased this set and immediately fell in love with how good it smells. I have coarse Asian hair and it makes my hair feel so smooth and silky. In order to not use too much conditioner and to make sure I distribute it evenly, I mix a little in a bath bucket with some water and then pour the diluted conditioner over my hair.   I also purchased the matching \\&quot;hair water\\&quot; which as far as I can tell is kind of a weak hairspray/febreeze/refresher for your hair. I spritz it on when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and it&#x27;s awesome!   I only wish Shiseido made a matching body soap, lotion and perfume because I want to carry the scent story through the day.   I like the way the White (for dry/damaged/colored) hair smells too.   If you wait around New Years, you can usually purchase all three products in a discounted gift set in Japanese supermarkets like Nijiya, Marukai and Mitsuwa.</li>

    <li> Used this shampoo in Okinawa, LOVE IT!  If you like hydrating Biloage, you will like the conditioning properties of this line.  Smell is very luxurious.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I will purchase again once I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
    <li> make your hair really bright and shine, it&#x27;s so easy to make the bubble and so easy to clean the bubble, the smell is super good, i purchase the white one in real store last year, this one is much cheaper online. worth it!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t substantially better than any other shampoo. You feel like you need a daily conditioner and the super strength conditioner isn&#x27;t as good as kholesteral. If it gets in your eyes it stings</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to enhance my hair in any way. Made my scalp itchy after one use and dulled my hair. $30 not well spent.</li>
    <li> Thank you for very fast delivery and excellent product! Love the treatment! Shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean and soft. And they all smell so good!</li>
