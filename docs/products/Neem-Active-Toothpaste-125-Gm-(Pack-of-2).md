    <li> This exact one is my favorite toothpaste  EVER.</li>
    <li> Great NATURAL toothpaste!  Nice taste, too.  No warnings on this product label which is good.  Friends have switched to this.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is ok but not as good as the last Neem toothpaste I got! I don&#x27;t care for the Minty taste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is so reasonably priced and dos a good job. I will buy it again and tell others.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is wonderful. I just went to my dentist , and I was surprised to find out I am great!! I feel comfortable with this toothpaste!!</li>
    <li> Marketing Hype. The ingredients have Parabens (found in breast and other tumors) and SLS, no thanks...wiser consumers know better by reading labels.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of good to be said about Neem, and I thought I had used this particular product previously without any issues; however this time I began having sore throats daily, stomach upsets and painful gut my husband read the label and to my surprise it contains the harmful, all natural ingredient, \\&quot;carrageenan. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this I encourage you to do the research.&lt;br /&gt;You may want to start here: [...]</li>
    <li> keeps most of the plaque away between cleanings</li>
    <li> I recently found out about Neem Toothpaste while watching the Dr. Oz show, and decided to give it a try.  It has a good taste, but it&#x27;s also great in fighting gum disease.  I floss my teeth regularly, and work hard at keeping my mouth clean, and my breath smelling fresh.  Although I&#x27;ve just been using Neem for approximately 6 months, I got a glowing report when I went to the dentist for my regular checkup.  It&#x27;s definitely worth your giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Neem toothpaste is great to use. Neem has so many good benefits for our bodies and keeping healthy teeth and gums is a priority at our house! Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing! It tastes great and makes my teeth fell really clean. My kids even love it! Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product --- you only need a small amount  to feel the results. Taste is fine too.</li>
    <li> Everything about this paste is great. Its taste greaaat. What I like is that it prevent sensitivity, no plaque and it leave a lasting taste in you mouth.</li>
    <li> I was brushing my teeth and noticed blood in the sink.  Switched back to Crest and no more bleeding.  Threw the product away.</li>
    <li> Feel super clean after brushing...</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and he is hard to convert to anything. I have had to start buying more often and in bulk 2-3 at a time so i don&#x27;t forget to buy it and let him run out.</li>
    <li> I love it .and my dentist  always  let me know how good my teeth look, thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1LIKE HOW IT CLEAN,</li>
    <li> Nice flavor, even the kids like it. Leaves your mouth fresh and minty without the burn. Will buy again soon</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever! I suffered with dry mouth, not any more. 👍</li>
    <li> Love it, very pleased</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great. Love the taste and my mouth is healthier since I have been using it. Even my dentist has commented on it. I also use the mouthwash. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my teeth feeling like I just had them cleaned</li>
    <li> We really like this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s mild and seems to do a good job of cleaning.  I recommend it and have re-ordered.</li>
    <li> I purchased this &#x27;Neem&#x27; tooth past and another one at a local store in Tucson.  This one is more like a commercial toothpaste that you see everywhere.  I would tend to think there is a very small amount on Neem in this brand compared to the other I purchased.  In using the other brand,  your mouth/ teeth feel really clean.  This one does have a better taste and the price is about one half of what the other product is.</li>
    <li> Been using it regularly for couple years. Good for those with gum issues.</li>
    <li> This delicious toothpaste improves the condition of your mouth.</li>
    <li> i will forever use this product, i also have the mouthwash as well. I had been suffering from really bad breath but not anymore and my teeth are so much whiter and clean feeling my gums are now pink and no more bleeding. i really like this product!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! My teeth always feel like they just got cleaned by the hygenist!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this toothpaste</li>
    <li> Great product. Much easier on my mouth than regular toothpaste. No cavities.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of Neem toothpaste because of its taste compared to other brands. It&#x27;s minty but doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth and doesn&#x27;t taste of Neem leaves. My visits to the dentist since using Neem (over two years) have been for check ups only. No cavities, no sensitive teeth, my gums have stopped receeding, my breath is constantly fresh, no aftertaste and the freshness lasts.</li>
    <li> I was all excited after hearing so much about Neem only to be dupe I really feel as a customer Sucker punch by the same old fluoride and laurites which should not be in there when Neem has all the properties that is needed for a healthy oral care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for non-fluoride and non laurites this is such deception as far as I am concern the Neem in there must not be of a good quality if they have to add chemicals!</li>
    <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz and thought I would give it a try. It just takes a pea size of toothpaste to do the job. It has a good foam and taste. No bad breath in the morning. My 2 ten years old even love using the neem. It has whitening their teeth and helped the bad breath of on of them.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product after watching an episode on Dr. Oz.  The active ingredient neem oil is supposed to be great in fighting tooth decay and gum problems so I decided to test it out.  My last dentist appointment was October 2013.  I used this product at least once a day - every day.  When I went to the dentist recently (May 2015) my dentist found no new cavities or gum issues.  No more drug store toothpaste for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a year.This product is allot better for you then other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!  Just a small amount really cleans very well and makes a lot of foam.  I will definitely make another order soon.  Also, very prompt shipment and customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> Need to re order  really good product</li>
    <li> This is miracle tooth paste from india using the neem plant. Keep to the original formula and you will have happy teeth. It is mild,so does not burn your tongue. Use tooth picks as well to pick out hidden debris. Last time i went to the dentist he said, &amp;#34;whatever you are doing,keep doing it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the quality and the package (was broken when arrived).</li>
    <li> The reason to use this toothpaste is it keeps my teeth much cleaner. Last time I had my teeth cleaned they were amazed over how much less plack I had. I will be using it from now on! I heard about this on Dr. Oz!</li>
    <li> toothpaste smells great</li>
    <li> I like this because it is organic and neem works great!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a natural toothpaste with No Flouride. This was recommended but when I got it I noticed it had Flouride in it. Other than it not being what I expected the toothpaste cleans nicely</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever!!</li>
    <li> Simply amazing in reducing inflammation and bleeding of gums. I used Crest/Toms/Colgate toothpastes in the past 20 or so years. Whenever flossing and brushing, my gums would bleed. After about a week use of neem about 2-3 times per day, my gums and teeth feel better and there is ABSOLUTELY no bleeding. Don&#x27;t think my teeth have become whiter but they feel great.</li>
    <li> Taste great,best tooth paste for plaque or mouth sores wish more people knew about the healing effects go neem bright white teeth as well.</li>
    <li> I never had a toothpaste that worked so well. In fact, I don&#x27;t let paste at all. I always bought gel when I could find it. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands and just was not happy with the results. However, I was watching an episode of Dr. Oz and someone was on his show singing the praises of Neem. At that time I had a little pain on the left side of my mouth but no money to go to the dentist. I started using Neem and the pain slowly subsided. That&#x27;s been 2 years ago and I still haven&#x27;t seen a dentist. Neem has natural anti-inflammatory properties and it really works!</li>
    <li> I have had bad gingivitis for a long time ,on and off, this product seems to really help.i also take neem pills and use the cream,,I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothpaste as I was constantly getting scolded by my dental hygienist for plaque. I used this paste for a couple of months before my appointment and was rewarded when she said I was now really trying to keep them clean, it showed. All I did was change to this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> love this tasty stuff&lt;br /&gt;and my dentist does too&lt;br /&gt;even my periodontist loves me now&lt;br /&gt;it is a love-fest at my wonderful dentists office</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It actually healed my gums!  I&#x27;ve very pleased.  By the time I hit the second tube, the difference in my gums was very measurable.  Wish I had found this years ago.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is not vegetarian not natural it has more flouride in it than store bought. My boyfriend and I both do not like it or the feeling it leave in ouur mouths. DO NOT waste your time. We have had all natural organic Neem toothpaste before and it was amazing. It was 4 bucks a tube but it was a drive for us. I thought that this would be just the same. WRONG Ingrediant are all chemicals!!! smaller tube, and has more flouride. I plan on making the drive and getting REAL neem toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST teeth paste product I have used so far. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Great, love it , have re ordered several times. Won&#x27;t use anything but this.</li>
