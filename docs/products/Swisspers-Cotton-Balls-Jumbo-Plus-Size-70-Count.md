<li> I now use *Swisspers other products as well.</li>
<li> I actually half the cotton balls, that way I can get two uses out of one, which doubles the product.</li>
<li> I bought these on a whim online a few months ago without hearing of the brand before.</li>
<li> this brand sells what they mean</li>
<li> can&#x27;t go wrong with these</li>

    <li> For people saying these are &amp;#34;super jumbo&amp;#34; &amp; three times the size of regular cotton balls, I really have to wonder where you were getting the microscopic cotton bolls you used until you found these. I almost didn&#x27;t buy them because I was picturing cotton softballs. These are actually normal size cotton balls very densely wound with quality material so you can manipulate them into every possible shape and they do not leave your face linty. Fantastic value &amp; came very fast.</li>
    <li> I use this product in my spa. The quality is excellent (soft) and size perfect (half them for the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning ears.  I put the cleaning fluid on the cotton, then push it up with my finger.  Fits right down the ear canal and does a great job.  Dogs are comfortable with these cotton balls.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different types.  These work the best with my GSDs</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Very soft and gentle.</li>
    <li> these are very good and white cotton balls and I do like them the clean the nails and do not leave any cotton on the nails, finally I got some good cotton balls.</li>
    <li> They are just cotton balls. Pretty much the same as all cotton balls.</li>
    <li> We needed cotton balls we could put in our honey bee hives, these fit the requirements just fine.</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are very useful for many things. The *Swisspers brand is by far the best Ive used. They are quite soft and plus...and they do not break apart like most cheap brands. Both rounded sides can be used and they do not soak through so easily. also...I LOVE that they are very crisp &amp; white...not dingy or used looking. I now use *Swisspers other products as well. Thanx.</li>
    <li> I like these nice large-size cotton balls.  They are perfect for removing makeup or applying toner.  If I want a smaller size, for instance if I am removing nail polish, all I have to do is tear them in half.  This is my favorite brand and size of cotton balls.</li>
    <li> Love these cotton balls.  Soft, large and feels good.  Especially like this to remove eye makeup.  Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also good to take off excess makeup.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to write a review of a cotton ball, I thought they were all the same. I bought these on a whim online a few months ago without hearing of the brand before. I used one this morning for the first time and was surprised by how dense and well produced these are. They hold their shape and didn&#x27;t fray extensively like others. Overall, I&#x27;ll be purchasing again as a staple bathroom supply.</li>
    <li> I had not been able to find the cotton balls this size anywhere, and I was so happy to get them.  They are big enough to remove makeup, and small enough to not be a waste.</li>
    <li> These are very good cotton balls and I love the jumbo plus size. I would definitely recommend them and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> You only have to use,one maybe two to remove old polish . They do not leave fuzz on nails when preparing to &#x27;re decorate your nails.</li>
    <li> They were what they said,so much larger than store bought and great to use.The price was very good also.This is what was needed to apply liquid all over back.</li>
    <li> I love these cotton balls. I wish they have more in one bag!</li>
    <li> i love this brand the cotton balls really are JUMBO, usually when i buy jumbo of other brands they are so small not even near big let alone jumbo!  this brand sells what they mean and i truly appreciate that</li>
    <li> It is very good on this price!</li>
    <li> umm there cotton balls....</li>
    <li> Good value for the money!</li>
    <li> I love them,Since they are a good size,you do not have to use several to make one. I highly recommend them and you cannot beat the price</li>
    <li> They are what they are and exactly what I wanted.  They are 100% cotton,which is important for me since I am pcking them in 6 mil plstic bags to use as fire tinder for camping and bug out bags. Tried them with a firestriker and some magnesium starters, and the cotton balls took a quick spark and lit up very well,especially after pulling them apart to break the fibers into thinner strands. Perfect.  It is a cotton ball!</li>
    <li> These are JUMBO. I actually half the cotton balls, that way I can get two uses out of one, which doubles the product. Holds up great and absorbs very well. Also very cheap for the brand, and is truly cotton.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but wish those selling it would consider selling the bags with more of the product in them</li>

    <li> nice fluffy cotton balls. can&#x27;t go wrong with these</li>
    <li> Great cotton balls, buy them all the time</li>

    <li> These are what I ordered.  They were exactly the size that I needed and the advertisement was very accurate in the description.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these cotton balls for a long time...because they&#x27;re good, they don&#x27;t shred or mangle.  More to the point, I would like to thank Pharmapack for the absolutely excellent job they did in packaging them.  You&#x27;d think they were shipping the Hope diamond, not simple cotton balls.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy from this vendor!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; in size as described not like other brand. This one is REALLY \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot;. I use it to wipe my newborn baby.</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are great. Nice big white 100% cotton and 100% made in the USA! Worth every penny! I only have to use one to take off all of my nail polish because each cotton ball has plenty of product! Buy with confidence and speedy shipping too! 😊</li>
    <li> They are just cotton balls</li>
    <li> why woulsnt these cotton balls be rated good? lol</li>
    <li> I laughed at the ultra-strong plastic bubble package it arrived in!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. But can be purchased for cheaper at major stores. Check to see if this price is affordable for you.</li>
    <li> Advertised as Jumbo Plus Size.  Not so.  The cotton balls are the same as any cotton balls that can be purchased in stores.  I decided to return them, but the cost of postage made me keep them.  I will donate them to a charity.  I will not use them.</li>
    <li> I agree with the others I absolutely LOOOOOOVE these cotton balls only criticism is I think they are a dollar cheaper in the store...</li>
