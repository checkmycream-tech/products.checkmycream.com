    <li> This is what you need if your hair is drying because of coloring, flat iron, etc. I completely love this product. My hair is so soft, silky, and fluffy. Thanks to Amazon and the seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I used the Alfa Parf gloss and this mask works really nice.  My hair was shiny and bouncy.  I would purchase again, but I&#x27;m an avid Wen fan and only use Wen.  If you have hair that&#x27;s not damaged from coloring this product would be a knock out for you.</li>
    <li> I have colored-treated hair which has a tendency to become very dry.  I use this product once a week, and leave it on for 20 minutes under a shower cap. It conditions beautiful; after rinsing, hair is not greasy but is moisturized and silky.  Expensive, but worth it. Lovely fragrance too.</li>
    <li> I took a chance when I found this product in local beauty salon and bought it. After just one try I was blown away how soft and shiny my hair was! I&#x27;m addicted to this for life now :) it is a wonderful product, a bit higher price but absolutely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time. I used to live in Venezuela and purchased there for the first time and found it wonderful!. I moved to the US and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any store yet, so I looked for it at amazon.com 9as I usually do for all those things that I cannot find here yet) and got it. Seriously, your hair will be smoother and shinier than ever! I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair has improved after using this product. However with my type of hair I have to either blow dry it or flat iron to see the great results. Since my hair gets frizzy and you can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s healthy or not. I gave it a 4, just because it doesn&#x27;t stop the frizziness, but other than that it&#x27;s highly recommended, the scent is just like other Alfa Parfs products, fantastic!</li>
    <li> Damaged hair by colour and hair dryer gets back to life with this mask.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it regularly along with the shampoo and conditioner, you&#x27;ll see a huge difference!</li>
    <li> Combine with Moroccan Oil Hydrating Cream, half and half, gives dry thirsty hair moisture and elasticity. Let this sit on your hair for about 45 min. to 1 hour.  Then rinse and style as usual.  I do this hydration treatment after I give my hair a protein treatment.  Alfarparf is pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I loved it my hair it&#x27;s very shine and health!!</li>
    <li> Awesame. Good expectations..</li>
    <li> leaves your hair smooth and shining! and soft!  i just use it instead of conditioner</li>
    <li> excellent, I love it,</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by stylist 2 years ago.  I love how soft it leaves my hair and am often complemented on how healthy my hair looks.  It is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> Works well with Schwarzkopf products.  Leaves hair silky soft, more easier to comb through and healthy looking.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Guys, Alfaparf B.I.P. is a direct distributor in America. Please be mindful of that when purchasing their products online. These products are subject to diversion, and could possibly be tampered with or expired. Even the products that we (as stylists) see in our supply store \\&quot;Cosmoprof\\&quot; is 3 or 4 year old product, the reason is because AP terminated the distribution contract with BSG (the governing corporation to \\&quot;Cosmoprof\\&quot;) due to the diversion that was happening. I am as well a very staunch advocate to Alfaparf and believe that they are one of the most innovative, couture, and provocative haircare lines available, and are devoted to the health and integrity of the hair, &#x27;the proof is in the pudding&#x27; i suppose though. If you are interested in getting product, tell your stylist or look online at [...] for a salon in your area, there are always new salons popping up and we (Alfaparf) are growing rapidly. I firmly believe that knowledge is power, and that is why I have chosen to write this review to inform everyone to be very cautious, if you go to [...] you can see the current packaging as I highly encourage you to not buy old product...  Be well my friends :~)  J</li>
    <li> Great product. It was just what I was looking for. Product will make your hair very shiny will buy again thank you</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this mask. My hair is curly, but soft. I had this mask from Brazil and it left my hair nice and shine, this one in USA is just like any other s****. It did not move into my hair, it stays like a hard butter, could not comb it wet or dry. DISGUSTING!!! NEVER, NEVER buy this unless you want to waste your $$$. They do not accept return item after you open it, of course!! Like it or not you have to keep it!!!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Alfaparf-Semi-Diamante-Illuminating-17-17-Ounces/dp/B000TK99FS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1329257459&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5</li>
