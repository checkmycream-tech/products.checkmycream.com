      <li>Super satisfied.</li>
      <li>Had hoped with all others had written and with the much higher price than &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; type products that this would be something better.  </li>
      <li>dries relatively quick.</li>

      <li>Barrielle is such a super product I have purchased it for friends who had trouble with breaking and fragile nails-every one of them ended up buying it for themselves afterwards.</li>

<li> Hardens the nail almost instantly, and lasts a long time.  </li>

<li> As I said, my nails are healthy but with using this product they are healthier than they have ever been and grow like crazy.  </li>

<li> Definately not worth the extra cost or wait for delivery.</li>
<li> only complaint is in regards to the brush, which is only long enough to reach 2/3 of the way down the bottle.  </li>

<li> I did my nails a few days ago and after working outside they looked a bit like they needed a touch up</li>
<li> However, it&#x27;s like other polishes/hardeners that chipped and took the nail under it with it.  </li>
<li> Peeled off; quite disappointed as Barielle has a strong reputation.  </li>
<li> My nails became stronger and curved less after using this product, even after pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I typically put it on almost everyday over my color</li>
<li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s no better than Sally Hansen or other drugstore fingernail treatments.</li>
<li> I have used this product three times and seem to have trouble with it peeling off.  </li>
<li> Considered green, it is made without phthalates or any offensive odor.  </li>
<li> Two coats essie polish, one coat Barielle and no more breaks.</li>
<li> I am not sure whether it is my mails or the product.  </li>
<li> Sally Hansen Hard As Nails.  </li>
<li> My nails are relatively weak and curve upward when they grow.  </li>
<li> , I decided to experiment with Barielle, and I was disappointed with every single product I bought, including this one.  </li>
<li> but I hate using colored nail polish because it&#x27;s too much trouble to maintain.  </li>
<li> When I get towards the bottom, I have to tip the bottle awkwardly and, even then, am unable to reach the polish.  </li>
<li> Both can be used as a base and also worn over your polish.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I liked the fact that the product does not contain formaldyhyde. Otherwise, it&#x27;s no better than Sally Hansen or other drugstore fingernail treatments. I followed the directions, and waited 2 minutes between coats. Product applies easily and looks good for a couple of days. Then it began to peel off my nails. I don&#x27;t understand how this can harden one&#x27;s nails. I will buy Sally Hansen again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used a clear polish similar to this in the Barielle line but this polish is absolutely clear not only on the nails but in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The other bottle I had was not clear in the bottle but looked pinky except when you put it on your nails.  Both can be used as a base and also worn over your polish.  I did my nails a few days ago and after working outside they looked a bit like they needed a touch up so I put this over the beige Barielle polish that I was wearing.  It makes my nails look as though I just repolished them with the beige.</li>
    <li> Anyone wanting their nails to grow long and strong should use this product. I started using it about 6 years ago when I had cellophane like nails. Now my nails are so strong they are unbreakable. Barrielle is such a super product I have purchased it for friends who had trouble with breaking and fragile nails-every one of them ended up buying it for themselves afterwards. I tried alot of different products of this kind, and none of them compare. Super satisfied. (And Amazon. com is incredbibly fast and great to deal with too.)</li>
    <li> Great for nail health.</li>
    <li> I have used this product three times and seem to have trouble with it peeling off.  I am not sure whether it is my mails or the product.  I have had a peeling problem before. It has stayed on for 24 hrs so far.  That is an improvement over the first two uses. It does look nice and shiny.  I am not using colored polish over it this time...I hope it helps.</li>
    <li> Chips right off.  Do not buy, if you did, do not bother to use it. Buy Nail Tek or something else.</li>
    <li> I had only been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I have seen very noticeable improvement in my nails.  They are much stronger and healthier.  I bought this, the nail thickener, and the nail strengener cream.  They are working well together.</li>
    <li> I have used it many times and I will not be without it barbell is so good for the nails .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!!  I have used the Barielle Rebuilding Protein in the past and this is the first time I have used the Instant Liquid Nail Hardener.  I have healthy nails but I hate using colored nail polish because it&#x27;s too much trouble to maintain.  I use this just like regular polish. I put on two coats and it lasts about a week.  It doesn&#x27;t chip and neither do my nails.  As I said, my nails are healthy but with using this product they are healthier than they have ever been and grow like crazy.  I will never use anything else after using this.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use a clear polish or just to use as a base or top coat.</li>
    <li> Use to be able to find this product at the drugstore...but none of them carry the product.  This was a very reasonable way to get the product without the high charges.  Bought three bottles, two for myself and one to give away.  Great service from this company as well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many different hardeners and LOVE this one so far.  I typically put it on almost everyday over my color and I do believe that it helps strenghens my nail.....thank you</li>
    <li> If I removed the polish each day and repolished after, it might work.  However, it&#x27;s like other polishes/hardeners that chipped and took the nail under it with it.  OUCH!</li>
    <li> I have used the creams before but not the nail polish. I like the shine, it dries really quickly, and my nails are finally not peeling with the use of this along with the nail cream. If they use it on race horse hoofs it must be okay. I actually used the cream years ago and then couldn&#x27;t find it in my area. Now my nails are doing much better and not stubs anymore.</li>
    <li> Did&#x27;nt perform well.  Peeled off; quite disappointed as Barielle has a strong reputation.  Will not reorder.  Would be nice to receive a refund.</li>
    <li> My nails are relatively weak and curve upward when they grow.  I started using this product when I was pregnant as part of my more natural regimen.  The polish was thicker than other clear polishes, went on easily and covered well.  Considered green, it is made without phthalates or any offensive odor.  In fact, it smells almost citrusy. My nails became stronger and curved less after using this product, even after pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is in regards to the brush, which is only long enough to reach 2/3 of the way down the bottle.  When I get towards the bottom, I have to tip the bottle awkwardly and, even then, am unable to reach the polish.  If the company fixed the design of the bottle, I would easily give this product 5-stars.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Hard as Nails (the clear or natural tinted) does a far better job than this Barielle product for a fraction of the cost.  I&#x27;ve always used Sally Hansen and my nails were fine, I decided to experiment with Barielle, and I was disappointed with every single product I bought, including this one.  I suggest Sally Hansen Hard As Nails.  Yes it&#x27;s a drugstore product, but it works.  This does not.</li>
    <li> Actually works! My nails used to peel and chip on the ends. Now they don&#x27;t. Two coats essie polish, one coat Barielle and no more breaks.</li>
    <li> Barielle makes excellent high-end products and this instant liquid nail hardener is no exception. I have weak thin nails and after two applications am delighted with the results. Great price on Amazon.com rather than in a department store.&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B001P8OOSK Barielle Instant Liquid Nail Hardener -- 0.5 oz.]]</li>
    <li> smells decent. works great. dries relatively quick. can top any kind of polish. two coats actually does make my nails feel harder.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff for guitarists and uke players.  Hardens the nail almost instantly, and lasts a long time.  It just sits on top of the nail, doesn&#x27;t interfere with its growth.  The only thing is that it is very shiny.  Maybe they could make one that is matte?  Anyway, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product but does not seem to do the trick. It could be that it needs to be applied every day?</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this nail hardener.  When applied, it lasts about a week while doing housework.</li>
    <li> This product helped strengthen my nails after I had done a LOT of gardening.  I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> When I received it the package was smashed and there was a crack in the bottle.  I had to throw it out so I can&#x27;t rate it.</li>
    <li> That starts to chip off the next day.  Had hoped with all others had written and with the much higher price than &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; type products that this would be something better.  It isn&#x27;t.  Definately not worth the extra cost or wait for delivery.</li>
