      <li>they stopped carry at my local store and lucky for me got it here!!!!!</li>
      <li>Sure you can get it online</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>but it has mandarin as a top note</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, the giveaways are the metal top is plastic.</li>
      <li>I get soooooo many compliments whenever I am wearing it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved the scent the first time I smelled it on a store.</li>
      <li>They all smell fantastic.</li>
      <li>So rich and citrusy...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a unique fragrance that is a pleasure to wear.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
      <li>Please do not tinker with it and keep it the way you originally made it.</li>
      <li>Fortunately Amazon issued a full refund</li>
      <li>The scent was distinctly musky, NOT the scent I&#x27;ve worn for a year.</li>
      <li>Elena, from all your Tokyo Milk Dark series, No. 10 is by far the best from the whole pack and you nailed the first time.</li>
      <li>And at such a great price you don&#x27;t have to worry about using it multiple times throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It is exactly the combination of citrusy, mistery and cleanliness</li>
      <li>at first it could maybe pass</li>
      <li>I love this, and it is the second scent I&#x27;ve tried from Tokyo Milk.</li>
      <li>I wore it for the first time today</li>
      <li>Preserve it as the treasure scent and strike of genius you had with it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the different levels of floral and vanilla scents.</li>
      <li>Let me clarify, I LOVE the real perfume of this and have purchased it multiple times.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they last a super long time, but because they smell so good, I am willing to live with having to reapply throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore the scent, I just wish it lasted longer on my skin.</li>
      <li>I received this order fairly fast.</li>
      <li>The perfume I received was not the real Everything &amp; Nothing Tokyo Milk.</li>
      <li>Amazon customer service was extremely prompt and gracious addressing the issue, so many thanks to them.</li>
      <li>Much better than other brand fragrances.</li>
      <li>I smelled it in Sephora but they we&#x27;re out of this particular fragrance (No. 10)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this particular scent for a year</li>
      <li>A cross between cheap old lady perfume and musky clove.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this Femme Fatale Collection.</li>
      <li>and I needed a new bottle.</li>
      <li>They only carry this line at certain Sephora&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This is definitely more complex</li>
      <li>but I miss my old perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dark and mysterious and just fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little sweet but the tea scent rounds it out.</li>
      <li>Changing the formula just to save a few buck won&#x27;t lead you far and on the countrary, loyal fans of your scents will go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one is very subtle and does not stay with you for very long, but it does have a fresh light smell that I like.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the heavy floral or sticky sweet fragrances, but I also don&#x27;t go for the dirt-scents of my patchouli-wearing teenage years anymore either.</li>
      <li>I usually like clean, simple scents in the citrus family.  </li>

    <li> The real version of this perfume is excellent and what I wear every day. I know it extremely well. Unfortunately, the product I received was a fake, which I should have guessed bc of the price. The bottle is made of different materials, even though it looks the same. It&#x27;s cheaper, the giveaways are the metal top is plastic. and the misting aerator just sputters the liquid. can&#x27;t call it perfume bc it smells like sour orange juice. at first it could maybe pass but after one second you notice it has no notes and none of the sweetness of margo elena&#x27;s creation. Amazon customer service was extremely prompt and gracious addressing the issue, so many thanks to them.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely convinced the product I received is a fake.  It looks real, but the scent is just off and way too harsh.  The tester I tried at a store was totally intoxicating and I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing my arm.  This is not that.  I tried to return it but Amazon will not accept it.  I guess I&#x27;m stuck.</li>
    <li> Love this manufacturer of  parfumes and this one is so exotic and delightful.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, about 80% of my purchase was for the awesome bottle... but I also like the scent a lot!  I usually like clean, simple scents in the citrus family.  This is definitely more complex but it has mandarin as a top note and it&#x27;s not overpowering.  I wore it for the first time today and I still have a subtle level of scent 14 hours later.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a 3.5 for the scent and 5 for the bottle. I think for the price it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
    <li> I received this order fairly fast. However, the perfume, although package thoroughly, leaked all over the packaging. I am not returning but feel I&#x27;m starting out with 3/4 of a bottle of the perfume.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the scent, I just wish it lasted longer on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! So rich and citrusy...it meshes well with my own chemistry and body oils and lotions. I highly recommend this Femme Fatale Collection.</li>
    <li> Love this sent! Smells so good, with out being over powering. It&#x27;s a little sweet but the tea scent rounds it out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the scent the first time I smelled it on a store. It is exactly the combination of citrusy, mistery and cleanliness I was for a long time craving for. However, in my last restock of this one, I could notice that the scent changed. I do not know whether Margot Elena tinker with the formula amid the bottle changed from a matte to a glossy finish with the name of the designer engraved instead of printed. However, if Margot Elena tinker with the original formula, that would have been a horrendous and terrible mistake. Please do not change it. I am inclined to think that this was what happened, but it could also be possible that the supplier (Lucca) sold me a knock-off product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margot Elena, from all your Tokyo Milk Dark series, No. 10 is by far the best from the whole pack and you nailed the first time. Please do not tinker with it and keep it the way you originally made it. Changing the formula just to save a few buck won&#x27;t lead you far and on the countrary, loyal fans of your scents will go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate when this happens. The same happened for example with the marvelous 202 by Carolina Herrera. At one point in the newer encarnations of the scent, they modified the formula. Terrible. It was a capital sin that made me discard it as my personal go-to scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margot, please keep it the way it was. Do not change it. Preserve it as the treasure scent and strike of genius you had with it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two cents!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this particular scent for a year and I needed a new bottle. The bottle arrived (same label I am used to) and everything seemed correct until I put the perfume on. The scent was distinctly musky, NOT the scent I&#x27;ve worn for a year. Fortunately Amazon issued a full refund but I miss my old perfume. I&#x27;ll have to buy it offline and keep my fingers crossed that the scent of the perfume is as labeled.</li>
    <li> Let me clarify, I LOVE the real perfume of this and have purchased it multiple times. The perfume I received was not the real Everything &amp; Nothing Tokyo Milk. The bottle was slightly different and the smell was completely different not even close. A cross between cheap old lady perfume and musky clove.</li>
    <li> I love this line of perfume. This one is very subtle and does not stay with you for very long, but it does have a fresh light smell that I like.</li>
    <li> I have gotten compliments on this scent every time I have used it.  I love the different levels of floral and vanilla scents.</li>
    <li> My wife requested this for Christmas. It&#x27;s a unique fragrance that is a pleasure to wear. Much better than other brand fragrances. She loves it!</li>
    <li> my favorite scent...they stopped carry at my local store and lucky for me got it here!!!!! LIght yet beautiful and relaxing scent. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love this, and it is the second scent I&#x27;ve tried from Tokyo Milk. I get soooooo many compliments whenever I am wearing it. I believe they are Denver-based and you can find their products in several mom &amp; pop shops around town. Maybe in your town too!</li>
    <li> This scent is absolutely perfect. It isn&#x27;t overpowering in any of it&#x27;s tones, an extremely well balanced scent. I don&#x27;t like the heavy floral or sticky sweet fragrances, but I also don&#x27;t go for the dirt-scents of my patchouli-wearing teenage years anymore either. This scent balances all of those nuances perfectly and won&#x27;t suffocate the person in the elevator next to you with it&#x27;s potency.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents ever!  I love it.  And if was a very good price.  No complaints here!</li>
    <li> No. 10 Everything and Nothing has become my go-to scent. It&#x27;s dark and mysterious and just fantastic. I only wish it came in a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> Got a sample of the hand lotion of this scent.  Loved it and glad it&#x27;s also available as perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to track this perfume down for months! I smelled it in Sephora but they we&#x27;re out of this particular fragrance (No. 10) so I thought I would just go to a different Sephora - but no! They only carry this line at certain Sephora&#x27;s and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! Sure you can get it online but then you have to pay for shipping. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t look on Amazon sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this fragrance and it is less expensive on Amazon! Win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These perfumes are amazing quality. They all smell fantastic. I don&#x27;t think they last a super long time, but because they smell so good, I am willing to live with having to reapply throughout the day. And at such a great price you don&#x27;t have to worry about using it multiple times throughout the day.</li>
