      <li>It came and I was so pleased to have it again.  </li>
      <li>Because they stock so many brands of skin care items on air, I was lost.  </li>
      <li>Most were purchased from my facialist, but I decided to try this line after seeing it on a shopping network.  </li>

      <li>It is not a heavy cream but is good and rich, which is why I ordered the large size.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin adding moisure and softness.  </li>
      <li>I tried another brand of night moisturizer that was supposed to be new and better.  </li>
      <li>I had simply been blessed with pretty good skin until I hit my 60&#x27;s,  </li>
      <li>Fresh and just as described.</li>
      <li>Again, thank you Dr. Denese and thank you, Amazon, for having her products for a very reasonable price and quick delivery...</li>
      <li>This absorbs pretty quickly too.</li>
      <li>it is a real cream; that really works... not some bogus treatment product with no results... this is a true treatment product that proves itself worthy of 5 stars..</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time this morning.  </li>
      <li>That was where I first came in contact with the products of Dr. Denese.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know where to get first-hand opinions except on QVC, and I was aware that they had years of experience with beauty and skin products.  </li>
      <li>but it makes my face so soft &amp; smooth</li>
      <li>I have used several of the Dr Denese products, but this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face so smooth and soft..</li>
      <li>My extremely dry, sensitive 60+year-old skin looks so good --</li>
      <li>Loaded with Retinol and other skin loving ingredients...</li>
      <li>This product came several days earlier than estimated, I was so surprised how big the container is , I used it as soon as I got it , it feels wonderful,  also says u can use day time too, so</li>
      <li>Absolutely, give this a try.</li>
      <li>I have spent tons of money on other skin care lines, and this is by far the very best, especially for the money.</li>
      <li>WOW!!</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t go on as effortlessly as the Dream Cream, you have to use a little more</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find it for a few years.  </li>
      <li>Love her products, especially when you  have dry skin.</li>
      <li>I live at 7,500 feet above sea level in what is called \\&quot;High Desert\\&quot; and live in the town where the first atom bomb was created.  </li>
      <li>So, I went on the internet and found a website there staffed by her New York store.  </li>
      <li>And for Dr. Denese to have a New York skin care team at your beck and call</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and use Proactive and have no reaction combining those products and get the moisturizing I need without clogging my pores.</li>
      <li>There is some question to the cream losing it&#x27;s strength due to the open container top and should be concealed when using.  </li>
      <li>Immediate difference in this 66 year old face!</li>
      <li>Should try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My face is glowing, firm, yet smooth.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve all heard that old saw asking if hand and face creams make our skin softer, or make us think our skin in softer?  </li>
      <li>Skin so, so soft.  </li>
      <li>Works very well on my dry 61 year old skin.</li>
      <li>Not long after that, I received their reply, and to may utter amazement, they had very specifically written out a daytime and nighttime regimen specifically for me using Dr. Denese&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>I order this regularly for my 87 year old mother who swears by it.</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping I would notice even a slight tightness for firming, but after using for several weeks, I cannot really tell a difference.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry sensitive skin and have been using Dr. Denese products for years.</li>

<li> Seems to feel wet on your skin, so you know you&#x27;re getting moisturized!</li>

<li> It seems to be a decent facial moisturizer either way, but I was slightly disappointed.</li>
<li> TRULY IS A WASTE OF MONEY</li>
<li> Not too heavy or oily.  </li>
<li> That&#x27;s when I noticed the blue under my eyes and that tired feeling.  </li>
<li> Usually I am applying it in the morning</li>
<li> However, not sure I would buy it again.</li>
<li> Several years ago when I started noticing that my skin was aging, I was shocked!  </li>
<li> THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST FIRMING FACIAL CREAMS</li>
<li> I TRULY FEEL BAD ABOUT SAYING THIS</li>

    <li> Great buy, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have very dry sensitive skin and have been using Dr. Denese products for years. I use the corrector cream daily with great success. My skin stays moist with no breakouts (breakouts are a problem with other products). I would recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping I would notice even a slight tightness for firming, but after using for several weeks, I cannot really tell a difference.  It seems to be a decent facial moisturizer either way, but I was slightly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Dr. Denese firming facial age corrector is so soothing but at the same time it firms and softens your skin. I use it in the morning and at nite.</li>
    <li> I use this as a night cream and love it.  It is not a heavy cream but is good and rich, which is why I ordered the large size.</li>
    <li> Gave my skin an extra moisture barrier that created a glow on my face. Pores became smaller as well</li>
    <li> it is a real cream; that really works... not some bogus treatment product with no results... this is a true treatment product that proves itself worthy of 5 stars.. A MUST BUY11 TY DR. DENESE!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years now, and when I meet new people, they usually think I&#x27;m at least six to eight years younger than I am. Thank you Dr. Denese!</li>
    <li> I received this product also and I have not seen any difference I still have lines in the face and neck and spots no changes in anything</li>
    <li> I like it, but the container was not really full. Usually I am applying it in the morning and I feel good.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and paid much more for it. It does what it is advertised to do. Very happy with the value &amp; delivery.</li>
    <li> I used to use this cream years ago and loved it. I have not been able to find it for a few years.  I found it here and ordered it. It came and I was so pleased to have it again.  It makes my face so smooth and soft.. I can definitely see a difference when I use this.  So glad to find it again. I will order it again .</li>
    <li> This cream goes on easily. It is light and smooth. It has a very light, pleasant scent. However, not sure I would buy it again. I have mostly dry skin and my chin is still dry. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my overall appearance either. But for someone with normal skin it works very nicely.</li>
    <li> This is great cream and a good price compared to QVC.  Very happy with this product. Not too heavy or oily.  I have very sensitive skin and use Proactive and have no reaction combining those products and get the moisturizing I need without clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> This is a generous size and the product is very silky feeling and smells nice too.  Not overpowering, just a pleasant scent.  This absorbs pretty quickly too.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I can see a difference in my skin when I do not use it.  There is some question to the cream losing it&#x27;s strength due to the open container top and should be concealed when using.  It has a pleasant ordor.</li>
    <li> Love her products, especially when you  have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used several of the Dr Denese products, but this is my favorite.  Off and on over the years, I have changed face creams.  Most were purchased from my facialist, but I decided to try this line after seeing it on a shopping network.  We&#x27;ve all heard that old saw asking if hand and face creams make our skin softer, or make us think our skin in softer?  I think this cream definitely makes my skin softer, and it is in my go-to basics.  Definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream, I have been using it for about 5 years.  I usually get it from another site but couldn&#x27;t afford it and looked on Amazon and was very happy to see this product for this price!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good skin cream, and affordable. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time this morning.  My face is glowing, firm, yet smooth. Immediate difference in this 66 year old face! Absolutely, give this a try. I have sensitive skin and it feels just wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m back to Dr Denese and won&#x27;t leave again!  I tried another brand of night moisturizer that was supposed to be new and better.  Well, I found out it was a mistake to leave the Dr Denese line!  There&#x27;s just something about this &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; cream that feels fantastic on my face.  It absorbs quickly into the skin adding moisure and softness.  The cream doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy and has never caused me to breakout.  Won&#x27;t ever change brands or be without this treatment again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST FIRMING FACIAL CREAMS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT IT TRULY IS A WASTE OF MONEY I TRULY FEEL BAD ABOUT SAYING THIS BUT I SPEAK THE TRUTH</li>
    <li> This is the very best you can find for aging skin.  It gets my vote plus a 5 Star.*****&lt;br /&gt;I find the best price on Amazon for this product.</li>
    <li> WOW!! This product came several days earlier than estimated, I was so surprised how big the container is , I used it as soon as I got it , it feels wonderful,  also says u can use day time too, so what a wonderful price n product all in one day/night, highly recommend ... cant wait to start seeing the results ,, I will order again ,,, TY</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream and the super-size is great.  It took seven months to get to the bottom of the jar and I use it every day.  My extremely dry, sensitive 60+year-old skin looks so good -- have already purchased another jar of this -- don&#x27;t want to be without it!  Again, thank you Dr. Denese and thank you, Amazon, for having her products for a very reasonable price and quick delivery...</li>
    <li> Make my skin feel soft but firm and hydrated, The few lines I have in my face are not to noticiable. I get many good compliments despite of my age.  From all the creams I have usede this is the most effective for me.&lt;br /&gt; I give five stars to all the products that I tryed from Dr. Denese&#x27;s program</li>
    <li> Fresh and just as described. Works very well on my dry 61 year old skin. Very good buy. Should try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Several years ago when I started noticing that my skin was aging, I was shocked!  But, I decided to do something about it.  I didn&#x27;t know where to get first-hand opinions except on QVC, and I was aware that they had years of experience with beauty and skin products.  So, I turned to the Q.  That was where I first came in contact with the products of Dr. Denese.  Because they stock so many brands of skin care items on air, I was lost.  I decided that what I needed was someone who could evaluate for me what I needed.  I had simply been blessed with pretty good skin until I hit my 60&#x27;s,  That&#x27;s when I noticed the blue under my eyes and that tired feeling.  In the midst of all the Q had to offer, I was leaning toward Dr. Denese the more I watched their programs.  But, I still wasn&#x27;t convinced.  So, I went on the internet and found a website there staffed by her New York store.  They were there to answer questions or do just about anything to help anyone out who didn&#x27;t know beans about beauty.  I asked them if they would prepare a skin care regimen for me if I submitted a summary of myself and the environmental factors I am exposed to.  I received a quick reply telling me that they would be happy to do the best they could.  So, I wrote a letter to her \\&quot;skin care team\\&quot; and tried to include all of the factors they might need to evaluate what I might need.  Not long after that, I received their reply, and to may utter amazement, they had very specifically written out a daytime and nighttime regimen specifically for me using Dr. Denese&#x27;s products.  It wasn&#x27;t a long list of things to do or buy, but it was simply a well thought out program designed to work with my aging skin.  I live at 7,500 feet above sea level in what is called \\&quot;High Desert\\&quot; and live in the town where the first atom bomb was created.  So, because of the dryness, thin air at high altitudes, and likely exposure to radiation over the years, they designed protection for me. One of these items was this Firming Facial Age Corrector Cream as the last thing to use in the routine at night.  I am still using it, and probably will never stop.  I feel that this product is at least partially responsible for putting the brakes on the aging I was suddenly noticing.  I can tell in the morning if I haven&#x27;t used it the night before.  My skin isn&#x27;t smooth if I haven&#x27;t used it.  So, this is a no-brainer for me.  It works!  And for Dr. Denese to have a New York skin care team at your beck and call tells you a lot about her priorities as a doctor.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of all the Dr Denese products.  I have spent tons of money on other skin care lines, and this is by far the very best, especially for the money.</li>
    <li> Loaded with Retinol and other skin loving ingredients...your skin wakes up drenched in moisture. One of Denese&#x27;s holy grail products.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for nighttime!  Seems to feel wet on your skin, so you know you&#x27;re getting moisturized! I feel really good about this product!</li>
    <li> I adore the creaminess of the product but after using it for 3 weeks I have not seen any firming.  I will attest that my face is softer than before.</li>
    <li> I order this regularly for my 87 year old mother who swears by it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 3 years.  I use it at night and Dr. D&#x27;s Dream Cream in the morning. This doesn&#x27;t go on as effortlessly as the Dream Cream, you have to use a little more but it makes my face so soft &amp; smooth so I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product at a terrific price.  Been using for years and quite a noticeably difference. Skin so, so soft.  Won&#x27;t be without!</li>
