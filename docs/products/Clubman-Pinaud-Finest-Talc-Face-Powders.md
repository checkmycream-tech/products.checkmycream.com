<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent price, excellent product, excellent quality and would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I was looking for that old barbershop quality and smell from a talcum powder, and Clubman has come through in spades.  In the old barbershop days when every hair cut was finished off with a straight razor trim around the ears and back of the neck with warm shaving creme, the final act included a dusting of a terrific talcum powder, like this Clubman After Shave Talc.  This Talc can be used anywhere you need a soothing, really nice smelling  drying agent.  We all know what a great product is baby power when changing diapers, but how many adults realize the soothing feel of a quality talc in those damp areas after drying off from a shower?  I remember my grandma using a product such as this when I was a young teenager This product will be added to my list of must haves.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Just like at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> What do you expect, it works as intended. I don&#x27;t have to have an overpriced container of baby powder on my shelf, and it is practically (exactly?) the same stuff. Since starting to use a straight razor, I have come to appreciate the time men took to get &#x27;cleaned up&#x27; in the past. Talc is a nice finish once the aftershave has dried. Treat yourself, pamper yourself, no need to go all metro-sexual, just go traditional - and I mean old school traditional - and save money. I use a straight razor (hone it myself) or a safety razor (blades bought in bulk) and am saving myself money with my brush, mug, shaving soap, astringent, and talc. And I feel like my morning goes better after I take the time to put a razor sharp blade against my neck and survive! LOL</li>
    <li> Best powder I have found!</li>
    <li> Considering how long this company has been in business, I assumed that the scent of this talc would be spectacular (or at least classically pleasing, like having maybe a fresh, soapy, clean aroma. Instead, it smells stale and quite unappealing (rather similar to wet dog mixed with the cheapest cologne available). I used it on my brush to help clear the stray hairs from several people after trimming their hair, and they all turned their noses in disgust as well. Two people openly expressed their desire that I not use this product on them ever again. I wanted to like this product but it was, ultimately, overpriced fluff with a cute label. However, if you can tolerate the horrid scent, it does function appropriately as talc.</li>
    <li> Clubman Pinaud Talc is wonderful and maintains it&#x27;s classic fresh scent and old time barber shop memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t do any better than this if you really want the old time classic after shave feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PWN</li>
    <li> Great for keeping the man parts dry and fresh during the summer. That isn&#x27;t the only use but it works better than all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. Smells similar but better than the after shave lotion. Inexpensive too.</li>
    <li> I boughtt this for my husband for Christmas and he just loved it. It reminded him of the smell of the barber shop when he went with his Dad as a kid.  It has a very light aroma and is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Excellent Item. I love. I want to by another. please, offer the pack: 3 in one</li>
    <li> Makes you smell like your dad after a hair cut</li>
    <li> You either love it,or you don&#x27;t. I do.</li>
    <li> There is a reason that Clubman Pinaud has been around since 1810.  I originally started using Pinaud after shave when I went back to a traditional double edge razor about 3 months ago.  (Edwin Jagger DE89 upgrade with a iKon Bulldog handle)  The after shave work awesome and it has that classic scent that just exude confidence, and makes women smile.  Ask my wife, she loves the smell of the after shave.  So when I needed some talc, I chose Pinaud, and again it is as perfect as talc powder could be.  It works superbly, and the scent has the Pinaud edge.  If you still have pimples, go get your Brut.  If you are ready to be a man, it is time for Pinaud.</li>
    <li> Did not agree with my body chemistry.  Smelled bad after wearing for a while</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and it feels like I&#x27;m at the barbershop.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sweat much or stink, so I use it as a deodorant replacement. I love the barber shop smell. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the neck brush which uses powder in it.  I am always cutting the hair of someone and I am always trying to keep the little hairs from going down the neck of the cape.  I ordered the brush for that and decided that it might be a nice touch to actually add the powder to it.  I saw this one made just for men and thought I would give it a try, not knowing what it smelled like.  Well, it smells just wonderful!  It is definitely a masculine scent. Some colognes are overpowering but this is so subtle.  My son really liked it and noticed it left his neck very soft where I had brushed the hair off.  He will be using the powder for other places as well.  I will continue to use it when I cut the guys hair. Adding this scent to the process was a nice experience for me too!</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a barbershop this is definitely one of the most important ingredients. I love the combination of scents you smell when you walk into a barbershop. The powder keeps me dry and smelling good throughout the day. The only thing that was weird was I thought it was going to be white and it has a slight red tinge to it. Its barely noticable. But overall an amazing timeless product</li>
    <li> Received on time and was as discribed</li>
    <li> This is the classic talc powder.  Great for the neckline if you wear starchy shirts or places you like to keep dry, especially in the summer.  It&#x27;s got that classic barbershop scent right when you apply it but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  This stuff is classic for a very good reason.</li>
    <li> I have used Clubman Talc for many years. the smell brings back fond memories of the days when I had haircut at the Barber Shop and they would put on a little of this to get rid of the excess. hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, use every day after shower.  Nice dry comfort, doesn&#x27;t burn and it smells manly.  Also use regular Gold bond Ultimate - comfort with aloe (white bottle).  Tried Gold bond in spray - but be warned - the menthol will burn for a while.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say Thank You,received product in a few days,and I love this Talc powder,reminds me of the old days at the local barber shop,feels good and I love the aroma.</li>
    <li> That great classic timeless scent of an era gone long ago. Great for post haircut, or daily grooming. Wonderful smell, great in shoes too.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this in his shoes, smells great, and I never notice any &amp;#34;stinky feet&amp;#34; smell on my hubby at any time.  He says it makes his feet feel refreshed.  I especially love the scent which is the original &amp;#34;Clubman&amp;#34; scent that this wife particularly enjoys on her hubby :-)</li>
    <li> Will reorder this again</li>
    <li> Fine powder and great scent. Also it reminds of my old fashioned barbershop. Funny how scents can bring back memories.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s little more that need be said about Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman talcum powder. Naresayers will boast it&#x27;s merely glorified baby powder; more money than should be spent to &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; onesself. But the reality is that this is superb, refined powder meant exclusively for a real gentleman. If you enjoy their Clubman aftershave or Clubman hair tonic, you&#x27;ll love this as the scent is the same. Long lasting, suave and dignified as any scent could get. The powder comes in a very useable container, and truly refreshes and cools whatever part of the body it touches. No clumping occurs when using it, and that old fashioned, luxurious barbershop-powder smell lasts and lasts. Sure, this costs twice as mush as normal baby powder (a whopping 7 bucks), but the mere smell makes the extra money very worthwhile, as does the sophistication one feels when wearing it. So treat yourself to something special and unique. This is an old school brand with loyal fans that really should be passed on to the next generation (and I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s). Thanks Amazon for having this, and to Pinaud for still making this exceptional talc powder. I will certainly buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> This talc has a silky smooth feel. The fragrance is blended to smell totally unique and manly without feminine overtones.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Smell great, feel great, and use every day. My wife and I both use this almost daily and it really helps with friction and moisture rich areas!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Works great.</li>
    <li> Its Ok. Not real wild about the smell or the flesh tone color. Will probably return to using Shower to Shower Sport.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Men! Got one for the Husband and I love it as much as him. Once applied, this talc leaves a lingering, very pleasant, manly scent! Works very well as an after shave too. Highly recommended if looking for a men&#x27;s talc!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he shaves and he really likes it. I cannot comment how it really works but he seems to be please with it and he is really picky....</li>
    <li> This is a good product that gives you that fresh from the barbershop feel and it has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Clubman man since high school.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband/kids for when I shave their heads in the summer. However my two year old girl got a hold of it and decided to bless the entire house with it. What a pain in the ass to clean up. However...my house now smells FAB-U-LOUS! While it was a nice product, until my toddler gets older, I&#x27;ll probably just buy cheap baby powder until she loses the urge to dump things everywhere.</li>
    <li> Pinaud is still the most dependable brand.  Helps to keep me fresh all day &amp; dry from any prickly heat.  Best stuff on the market!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use for my swim cap so that it doesn&#x27;t stick together. Works well. I&#x27;ve had no issues and my swim cap is still in great condition after 4 months of swimming regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still kicking myself for not knowing about this talc. I grew up watching my local barber use this product and others from this same company but I spent several years looking for mens talc only to realize that had I contacted a barber supply company they could have easily supplied me with just what I was looking for. Still, I did find it, I am happy with it and I will order more when this runs out. It has a subtle smell just like it did when I was young and I had also forgotten that it was pink because this product was used on freshly shaved faces when I was a boy. I suppose there are still places where a man can get a &#x27;barbershop shave&#x27; but none that I know of out here in the boondocks. When I was a boy my father considered a barbershop shave the heighth of extravagance; in fact he treated himself to one on the day I was born.&lt;br /&gt;And probably got Clubman pink talc applied when he was done. Sometimes I wonder if we have forgotten what the finer things in life really are. Our loss.</li>
    <li> Very familiar smell-- I feel like I&#x27;m at the barber shop whenever I use this stuff. Does the job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been treated to this product for 68 years and will most likely use it when they plant me where ever that happens to be when I&#x27;m done here. My lifelong loyalty isn&#x27;t for nothing. Ask any Barber why he or she uses it. They&#x27;ll tell you that their customers have always expected it. If your Barber isn&#x27;t using it, treat him or her to a bottle with a new neck brush. They and you will be glad that you did. A little respect goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I am a die hard Old Spice Talc user.  I cannot find it any longer so I tried this.  It is ok, but not OLD SPICE!</li>
    <li> This powder works okay. I will not re purchase due to the fragrance. I&#x27;d prefer there was zero &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; but there it is. This purchase replaced Monkey Butt Powder&amp;#62; The MB is less &amp;#34;sweetie&amp;#34; smelly than the Clubman IMHO.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Thanks. A++</li>
    <li> This is a very nice talc for after shaving, but it turns my white bathmat and towels pink, so I have to be extremely careful in application. Still, with a nice barbers brush for dusting the back of your neck it is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> The best powder out there!</li>
    <li> Great barbershop smell of old, great talc.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this powder and the smell.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected, great scent, just like the barbershop you went to as a kid</li>
    <li> Love this talc, smells like a fresh haircut!</li>
    <li> The CLubman Pinaud Talc smells very good, but it is not overbearing. The scent is like a subtle version of Clubman&#x27;s aftershave lotion. My only complaint is, like all powders, it can be messy to apply. That is just the nature of powder, though.</li>
    <li> Really does a nice job in finishing up the wet shave process.  Not only does it feel great on the face but on the chest and underarms too. Even using a good brush designed for talc though, be careful, its pretty easy to get an unwanted wiff of the powder</li>
    <li> The smell of this talc takes me back to when I used to go to the barber shop with my long departed father-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best talc powder around, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> This Clubman Pinaud talc powder smells great and works well to eliminate irritating rashes. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Classic Barber Shop scent from my youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A manly, just groomed and confident about being a man scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the back of my neck post trim and shave of the hairline.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I see some people use this all over which is fine I guess but Let&#x27;s be honest, feet and crotch are the areas of attack. This product helps curb moisture and keeps chaffing to a minimum.  It gets me through an 8 hr workday just fine.  The best part for me is the smell... Classic barber shop and very masculine.</li>
    <li> Great to dust on your face after shaving.  Very light scent, cooling, soothing, and lightly covers up razor burn, nicks, etc...</li>
    <li> I smell like an  olde-time barber shop and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use to buy this from Sally Beauty Supply but it was hit or miss if they had it in stock. Amazon is my go to place for Clubman products. It will turn your undies pink if you use it &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; 😊 but it does come out in the wash. Great talc.</li>
    <li> Real men do use talc powder, and this is the one.  Wahoo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old school shaver as I use a 60 year old double edge Gillette razor and witch hazel after I shave. I have little hair on the top of my head, so I shave my head, but it leaves it shiny. I was looking for talc on Amazon to use on my shiny head and I found Clubman after shave talc. The Clubman talc has a pleasant scent and softens the shine on my bald head. It is also good to use on my face after I shave, as it covers any nicks or imperfections. I put a small amount of powder on a brush and dust my head and face. The pleasant scent reminds me of when I was a child and the barber would dust me with Clubman talc after my haircut. Clubman talc is the perfect end to to a shave.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate barber shop style talc.  One whiff and you will be transported back to an old school barber shop.</li>
    <li> Reminiscing of my childhood going to the local barber shop.  Just as I remembered, great scent and the talc works great to eliminate lingering and itchy cut hair on my face and neck.  I buzz my own hair and use the Talc with a neck duster also available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A perfect complement to the Penaud Clubmen After Shave Lotion.</li>
    <li> Hi quality and very fine Talc Powder. The scent is pleasant sort of like and old barbershop smell. Great for after a shower.</li>
    <li> Not sure if thats a good thing.....but I used to use Clubman years ago when I lived in Jersey. Found it again after all those years and now in Arizona my grown kids all say it reminds them of New Jersey</li>
    <li> Thanks to the Art of Manliness I found this powder, nice light scent that accents the Pinaud Clubman aftershave well. Works well with Old Spice as well.</li>
    <li> Barber shop fresh in my own home!!!! Cant go wrong with Clubman! Nice smell like the after shave AND hair tonic great compliment to one another (shampoo leaves a little to be desired though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THE TALC SMELLS LIKE CLUBMAN and thats all there is to say about that!!</li>
    <li> What great talc glad I got it to keep me dry I would recommend to all the price is right.</li>
    <li> Great barbershop scent, works well on any area subject to sweat and odors.  Summer comfort in those itchy areas as well.</li>
    <li> I like it, it takes me back to that old school barber smell! However, the powder tends to get caught in the cap after use. This leads to powder falling out as the bottle is moved around even while the cap is closed. This to me is a minor irritant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the barber shop scent of this product, and now with all the bad news about anti-perspirant will be using this as a deodorant from now on. Great product.</li>
    <li> We use it for our 2 year old son for his hair cutting. He HATES getting his hair cut and cannot tolerate pieces of hair on his neck. this helps a lot to eliminate the itchiness and hair sticking to him.</li>
    <li> This talc is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this talc is the smell and the smooth feel after apply this post-shave. It absorbs moisture, prevents rashes (allegedly), looks and feels great (in moderation). There is nothing like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that some people intimate that this product will stop bleeding. It does not replace a styptic pencil in any way shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said - this is the best after-shave product ever. It makes me want to shave right now.</li>
    <li> best ever. that old time smell and feel right at home. this is awesome only wish I could find the puffy brush to apply it.</li>
    <li> Great fresh talc and lightly fruity smell. Scent matches well with the [[ASIN:B00LJBMN3G Cold Label Pretty Boy Splash After Shave]]. Will continue using.</li>
    <li> Just like the barbershop, great for use after cutting your own hair.</li>
    <li> Brings out the fresh smells of the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I got tired of the smell of baby powder.  My dog ran out of the room when I opened up the bottle. Clubman smells alarmingly like, but slightly worse than, my dog&#x27;s nasty flea powder</li>
    <li> This product was everything I really expected. It has a great distinct manly smell. Everyone loves it and in the 9oz it has proved to last longer than I thought. It is definitely better than other products you can purchase at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my order!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff all over my body and it&#x27;s great.  Reminds me of the barber shop and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have used many powders for male hygiene, but this one is by far better than any talc I have used. It provides long protection from odors and keeps you dry.</li>
    <li> Good fragrance and no residues after sweating.. usually using talc leaves white patches of talc on your body esp if you sweat a lot..</li>
    <li> The best old fashion powder, it was hard to find and now I am happy.</li>
    <li> Like the smell. Good feeling. Only issue is the powder leaked out if the container is placed on its side. Maybe I got a defective bottle? But all I know. I can&#x27;t take this to the gym for after exercising (which is the reason I bought this product).</li>
    <li> I feel like i just got out of the barber&#x27;s shop everytime i put this on lov it...</li>
    <li> Love the smell its like an old fashion barber shop.  Now have an RC cola and a moonpie.</li>
    <li> Very nice product,  highly recommended</li>
    <li> Good smelling stuff, use after haircut or shave or shower or something. Doesn&#x27;t really pair with the aftershave, smells much better.</li>
    <li> The guys love this and so do the gals.  It has the greatest understated fragrance which smells so clean and classy.  No heavy perfume.  My guy loves this along with the after shave.  I even use it.  It is appealing to both sexes.</li>
    <li> It smells good, the smell is not overpowering. You feel like you just came from the barber shop and your fresh and clean. I wish the bottle was a little bigger though.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great. Easy to use flip top. Nice texture. Will continue to order.</li>
