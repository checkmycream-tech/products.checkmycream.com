      <li>It doesn&#x27;t frizz out and make me feel self concious any more.  </li>
      <li>I have had so many compliments on how healthy it looks.  </li>
      <li>And it looks completely healthy and shiny.  </li>
      <li>BOUGHT SOOO MANY STRAIGHTNING IRONS</li>
      <li>Instead of using the suggested Maxius hair products to use along with the Maxiglide, I just use my own products (light oil or butters).</li>
      <li>If you love this product.  </li>
      <li>Those who complain that the units are not straightening their hair, are obviously not partitioning off the sections to get the best results.  </li>
      <li>but i thought it&#x27;d b more.</li>
      <li>OR MAYBE BETTER THAN THE MAXIGLIDE</li>
      <li>So I did something even better</li>
      <li>I loved it the first time i tried it.</li>
      <li>THEN IT MUST WORK RIGHT!!</li>
      <li>w/ frizzy, unruly hair that easy puffs in humid weather.  </li>
      <li>I have been using hair straighteners for years, but liked the idea of a product that was not so hot (therefore, not so damaging), plus the steam option.  </li>
      <li>With Maxiglide my hair is manageable, soft, incredibly shiny and beautiful and I am getting compliments on the beauty of my hair now for the first time in my long life.  </li>
      <li>The teeth themselves are smooth, ceramic, no kniks.  </li>
      <li>AND IT SMOOTH AWAY ALL THE FRIZZ</li>
      <li>it is smooth out with out any hassel or blowdrying.</li>
      <li>Therefore, if anyone is considering to purchase this product, I would HIGHLY recommend it!!!!</li>
      <li>I ALWAYS HAD VERY FRIZZY HAIR,!!!</li>
      <li>Normally I would take up to 45 minutes, easy and not get nearly the beautiful results.</li>
      <li>I have the most luscious big sexy curls all over my head that lasts all week!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the $90!</li>
      <li>I like the wide straightning plates and the fact that for the most part it takes one pass and that section of hair is good to go.</li>
      <li>My hair is super straight and LASTS!!!</li>
      <li>So I went and ordered the Maxiglide that also came along with the Miniglide (there was a special).</li>
      <li>Dream come true.</li>
      <li>The flat plates are good too</li>
      <li>I LOVE the Maxiglide because it straightens my hair better than any hairstylist would at a salon with an old-fashioned flat iron you put on the stove.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my second straighetner from Maxiglide. I love it! I have lots of hair and its down to my lower back. I like the wide straightning plates and the fact that for the most part it takes one pass and that section of hair is good to go. My first one lasted about 2 1/2 years before one side of the plate stop warming, I think it was all the banging up against things that did it. It is large and I can see how some people might not like that, but since I dont travel with a blow dryer, this is great! I also use it with the end shine and it leave my hair shinny and looks healthy. The small teeth don&#x27;t pull my hair and the steam (when used right)doesnt burn my hair or face.</li>
    <li> This is the best, easiest result producing product out there. my hair is thin and super curly and in 20 min it is smooth out with out any hassel or blowdrying. love it love it love it</li>
    <li> I have been using the maxiglide once a week for almost two years. I no longer relax my hair. I&#x27;m saving so much time and money because I&#x27;m no longer dependent upon a hair stylist.     It takes me an hour and 20 minutes from shampoo to beautiful hair. One thing I do to keep my hair soft, shiny, healthy, and minimize breakage is my weekly conditioner. The homemade conditioner consists of one part extra virgin organic olive oil and one part raw organic honey, whisk the two together and message the creamy mixture into hair and scalp, cover with a plastic cap and warm towel for 30 minutes or longer. This keeps your hair soft and shiny. This mixture can be used on all hair type.     I always get compliments on my hair.  Go to [...]to see how beautiful my hair looks.</li>
    <li> Am African-Amer. w/ frizzy, unruly hair that easy puffs in humid weather.  After tryin multiple irons, I find this to be the only one giving long lasting results.  The Sedu is over-rated as my hair puffed one humid,rainy am after using it the previous night.  Also,a bit heavier than the typical flat iron, but I got used to handling it. As for some customers complaining of the hair loss, it is typical to lose 50 hairs per day from everyday grooming.  Also, if you use the steaming function before gliding down the hair this soften the hair minimizing any hairs that are loss.  All in all, I am satisfied with the product and the pros far outway the cons and would recommend purchasing at 100%</li>
    <li> Well i was so excited for this product, i used it and it did a good job, my hair was still frizzy even though they talked up the steam burst, it bursts your hair up if you don&#x27;t know how to use it properly and it is a lil heavy. Make sure and watch the dvd for proper instructions.</li>
    <li> I loved it the first time i tried it. works great(i did burn myself a few times with the steam)but i learned how to hold it after a few tries.I bought it along time ago and still have it today and works just the same.</li>
    <li> LISTEN PEOPLE TO SAVE YOR SELF SOME MONEY GO AND PICK UP THE CONAIR HAIR STRAIGHTENER IT HAS 25 HEAT SETTING AND WORKS LIKE U WOULD NOT BELIEVE..IT WORKS JUST LIKE OR OR MAYBE BETTER THAN THE MAXIGLIDE AND ONLY COST 15 AT WALMART!! I GOT A CONAIR AND I HAVE THE CARZIEST HAIR AND IT SMOOTH AWAY ALL THE FRIZZ AND EVERYTHING ..PUT IT THIS WAY ITS MAXIGLIDE JUST BOUT 70 DOLLARS CHEAPER!!!!!</li>
    <li> works great I love it!!!! it is a little heavy but managable took me 10 minutes to do whole head</li>
    <li> When I first saw the infomercial for the Maxiglide, I was skeptical because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work on my Black hair. But the next time I saw the informecial, there were a few Black models getting their hair done and the Maxiglide WORKED. So I went and ordered the Maxiglide that also came along with the Miniglide (there was a special). I LOVE the Maxiglide because it straightens my hair better than any hairstylist would at a salon with an old-fashioned flat iron you put on the stove. I don&#x27;t worry about having frizzy ends and with the Miniglide and I can get close to my roots and the edges. Instead of using the suggested Maxius hair products to use along with the Maxiglide, I just use my own products (light oil or butters). Once I got my Maxiglide and Miniglide, I threw my other flat irons and curling irons in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am black with mixed hair. My hair isn&#x27;t permed, but very curly.  This product straightened my hair giving me a glossy shine.  Love the product.  The only downside is that I replaced my maxiglide after a year......  Nevertheless, this is the best device I&#x27;ve used to straighten my hair, so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a skeptic of this product for a few years.  I&#x27;ve seen it on TV, and thought that they must be using trick photographs, because hair just doesn&#x27;t get that straight in one pull.  Well, I saw the product used again on live TV (HSN), and they kept the camera on the girl the whole time (they didn&#x27;t pan away), and her hair came out straight in one glide.  Now I was starting to think that this might actually work.  I decided to give it a try.  But the price of $79 was scary, because if it didn&#x27;t work, that is a lot of money.  So I did something even better, I bought the product at Linens-n-Things, using their 20% off coupon.  The coupon is usually in their weekly flyer.  So I paid 20% less, and Linens-n-Things has a 60 day return policy!! &lt;br /&gt;Now, to address the negatives that I heard about this product. &lt;br /&gt;1.  You are not suppose to squeeze the iron hard, just let it glide through your hair.  When you squeeze it, that&#x27;s when it tends to pull your hair.   You&#x27;ll see, when you try it. &lt;br /&gt;2.  I did not have a problem with the water spilling.  I&#x27;ve read other peoples reviews about this, but my product works fine.  (if your&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t RETURN it for another one when you buy it at Linens-n-Things) &lt;br /&gt;3.  Item is bulky.  I didn&#x27;t seem to notice that it was bulky.  To me it is normal.  I even straightened the back of my hair with NO PROBLEM. &lt;br /&gt;4. Cord tangles.  This wasn&#x27;t an issue for me either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  The product worked wonderful for me.  My hair was so straight and lasted for days.   When i used to blow my hair straight in the past, i would have to blow it again when I wake up in the morning.  I didn&#x27;t have to do anything for the next 4 days after straightening it with the Maxiglide.   I have THICK/CURLY/FRIZZY hair.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I saw it on an infomercial and was instantly drawn too it. So i came on here and read the reviews to make sure it worked like they showed on tv. And when i saw the reviews i was a little nervous because it is so expensive and some people don&#x27;t seem impressed with it. but i took my 20% off card to Bed bath and beyond and bought the straigtener. wow! its an amazing straigtener! whenever i straightened my hair before it was not that straight and about 10 minutes after i straightened it, it was worse then before. But the first time i used maxiglide it was like the hottest day of the year and i was outside a lot and my hair stayed straight! it stayed straight all day! wow! It didn&#x27;t really pull my hair like others noticed. I mean i&#x27;m sure it could if u didn&#x27;t comb it out or if you have  a certain type of hair. But I only had a really small amount of hair pulled out. less then if u brushed it or something. Ehh the steam option. I&#x27;m not sure it works all that well. a little steam comes out but i thought it&#x27;d b more. It is kinda big and awkward at first but it takes no time at all to get used too. Its definetly worth it if you want pin straight hair! It makes it shiny too!    ~Lisa</li>
    <li> I received the Maxiglide 3 years ago for X-mas. I have wavy,frizzy long hair that i relax about 2x a year.  It takes time to get use to using it, but once you do you will never want to blowdry or roll your hair again. It works best if your hair is clean and tangle free. I wash my hair the night before and put it  into braids or some other style that will keep my hair tangle free.  If you use a fine tooth comb to comb out your hair for each section before using the plates with the teeth you won&#x27;t have some much hair coming out. The flat plates are good too and recently i cut my hair into a bob and the maxiglide works great for this style. I only use it every 3 weeks or so because i don&#x27;t want that much heat on my hair on a regular basis. The rest of the time i wear my hair curly.  The only complaint i have is that it has a smell of burnt hair when you plug it in even if there is no hair in it. My hair smells a bit after using it but it does go away.  Also it takes a couple of hours to loose the bounce and look really straight which i like. The hair style lasts a long time even in humidity. Great product.</li>
    <li> My hair is super straight and LASTS!!! I live in Miami with crazy humdity as well.  It costs more for a one time blowdry at a salon for my curls, so I&#x27;m happy as can be.  Dream come true.</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 Maxi-glides and have always had good results with the performance.  The other people who complain about burning their hair probably have the heating element set too high.  Those who complain that the units are not straightening their hair, are obviously not partitioning off the sections to get the best results.  My hair has always come out great.  My only problem with this unit is that one side ceases to heat up after using it for a time.  The last unit that I got stopped working properly 5 days ago and the blue light just continues to blink, as one side does not heat up.  I agree that the cost of this unit is horrible compared to the reliability of it.  This company needs to guarantee their units for longer than just one year.  This last unit that I own only lasted 18 months.</li>
    <li> If you love this product.  I bought a flat iron at the mall for $120 and the handle just broke off.  I was sooo mad.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had seen the Maxiglide on HSN and decided to purchase it. I used it once and I was hooked.  I even did my daughters hair.  She loved it and she&#x27;s PICKY with her hair.  Everytime I go to the hair salon they charge me $35-$45.  Now, I can do my hair every week.  I think I&#x27;m going to start my own business with Maxiglide. LOL</li>
    <li> This products is really good, but be careful, it can pull hair out a little.  But it does straighten very well.  I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars for straightening but four stars for taken hair out a little.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS HAD VERY FRIZZY HAIR,!!! I ALWAYS TRIED FRIZZ EASE AND IT DIDNT WORK!!!I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING TO WORK.I BOUGHT SOOO MANY STRAIGHTNING IRONS AND THEY JUST FLATTENED MY HAIR MAKING IT LOOK SOOO LIMP!! &#x3D;( &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BEING VERY DISSAPOINTED I FINALLY TOLD MYSELF IF THE MAXIGLIDE COSTS ALOT THEN IT MUST WORK RIGHT!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AND YES IT CHANGED MY LIFE!!! I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS!!GREAT ONES!! MY HAIR IS BEYOND STRAIGHT PLUS THE TEETH DONT JUST FLATTEN MY HAIR THEY BRUSH IT WHILE STRAIGHTENING IT SO IT COULD LOOK EVEN!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE PRODUCT I CANT BEAR TO LIVE WITHOUT!!!IM SERIOUS!! I THANKS GOD LOL!! THAT I FOUND IT!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AND IT DID CHANGE MY LIFE!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long, curly hair and in the past in order to get it staight I have had to blow dry it straight using a clamp brush and then use a straightner on it.   Even then in the least bit of humidity it would frizz right out and look horrible.  This process usually took about 1 1/2 to 2 hrs.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got the maxi glide for christmas last year and love it.   I can let my hair dry natural, which is better for it, the night before, and no matter how crazy frizzy it is it takes only 10 to 15 min to straighten it with the maxi glide.  And it looks completely healthy and shiny.  I have had so many compliments on how healthy it looks.  Also one of my favorite things is that even in mild to semi heavy humidity it still stays straight.  It doesn&#x27;t frizz out and make me feel self concious any more.  I would recommend the maxi glide to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I am in absolute shock as to how great this thing is! I never believed it would work half as well as it did on tv, but due to the great reviews I bought it. I have to say, if this flat iron cost 500.00 I would pay it. It is so worth the money. My hair is long, thick, curly, frizzy and puffy. One gentle slide of the iron and it was bone straight and SOFT!! I only spent maybe 10 inutes and my whole head was done! Normally I would take up to 45 minutes, easy and not get nearly the beautiful results. I am so happy, especially since I have a two year old and this is such a time saver. Awesome value, beautiful results. I must say though, I like a little wave in my hair and this iron makes it bone straight, but I have since perfected how to use it to make some pretty waves.</li>
    <li> Polish decent, wirey, uncontrollable, waist length frizzy outrageous color treated hair, professionaly straightened 4 times and came home curly everytime! No relaxing worked here. Then came the infomercial. I watched and listened. Laughed and wondered. Finally broke down, I&#x27;ll try this, I&#x27;ve tried everthing else, I&#x27;ll throw it in the pile with the thousands of dollars of other things. Then it arrived, It took 20 minutes compared to 2+ hrs in the salon chair. I LOVE IT! I was on my knees praying to the maxi-glide gods! I use it everyday in one way or another. I&#x27;m buying one for a friend now, so she can get to work on time! Ha Love the maxiglide gods! Oh I read some of the other reviews, any one who gets it stuck is using too much hair, holding too tight and not following the directions. It works with any hair products too! LOVE IT! Years later I still have my hair! But I like it now... You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Maxius Maxiglide MX-597 in January of this year and I can&#x27;t say that I can recommend this product. Not because it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair. In fact, it did an execellent job at straightening my hair. And I&#x27;m African American so that&#x27;s saying alot. However, the long term consequences of using this iron is not worth it because it did take a lot of my hair out. The instructional DVD tells you not to squeeze the iron and to \\&quot;let the MaxiGlide do the work\\&quot;. I followed those directions and didn&#x27;t squeeze the iron, but the ceramic detangling pins still took too much of my hair out. I even brushed and combed all the kinks out of my hair before using the iron, but my hair still kept getting caught in the detangling pins. After using the iron once, I thought that it would be in my best interest to discontinue using it. Yes, my hair was bone straight, but at what cost? After six months of using the Maxiglide I probably wouldn&#x27;t have any hair left to straighten.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love this product. Before, I had so many bad hair days, I didn&#x27;t have a clue on how to do my hair. I bought those cheap flat irons in the past and my hair still ended up looking like crap. I used to go the beauty salon and spend a lot of money on hair cut + blow and dry. Now I don&#x27;t go the beauty salon, I save money and never have a bad hair day, thanks to the Maxiglide. If you have curly or frizzy hair like me, get the Maxiglide, it really works.</li>
    <li> I have very curly straw sized curls.  My hair is very soft too.  I use maxi glide and voile&#x27; I have the most luscious big sexy curls all over my head that lasts all week!  I am also African-Irish but mostly look African-American so I can use pomade like a Dax and Murray&#x27;s along with the maxi glide and it works as an anchor to keep the curls big and sexy and humidity resistant.  I tried this with other flat irons but it just doesn&#x27;t work.  If I was white I would do the same but use a lighter pomade like Wax   Works by Nexus.  The heat takes the stickiness out of the hair and forms the curls that last all week.  I love maxi glide...a great invention just for me!</li>
    <li> This iron is excellent, but I&#x27;m surprised that as expensive as this iron was, that it is already broken. I&#x27;ve owned it a little over a year and was extra careful with it, as you all know it&#x27;s not cheap!The dial that turns it on and sets the heat level, just broke , I always handled it very carefully, all my cheap irons last for years no problem. But it is very good otherwise and best of luck to the rest of you with yours. I&#x27;ll try the Conair one next that someone here mentioned .</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my daughter has very thick, very long (mid back)lenght hair.  I have owned two Maxiglides, and you must be very careful because they do break.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you use product in your hair (any type of oils or moisturizers etc.) it will clog in the spaces around the hot surface and be difficult to clean.  I prefer to use products in her hair because it is very, very dry.  After we use Maxiglide...my daughter&#x27;s hair looks fabulous all the way to the very edges.  The steam makes a difference.  You will notice that a good amount of hair does come out.  We developed ways to minimize that, so just be mindful of that.  We blowdry her ends before we use the maxiglide because it just makes things so much easier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about Maxiglide is that it is expensive and seems to break easily.  One of them, I dropped it and it no longer heated.  (that is somewhat understandable, although my cheap hair things have taken several falls and they continue to work).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The other maxiglide I had just stopped working.  I dont know if it was dropped without my knowledge or if the products we use in our hair created complications.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is nothing that compares with the straightening job you get...no matter how thick your hair is (and yes...that includes African Americans) your hair will look awesome, hold the press and be silky.  I just chalk it up to this...two trips to the hair salon will cost you the price of one maxiglide.  So even if I buy two of them a year, I still make out well.  For that reason, I will buy another.  It&#x27;s just convenient and cost effective and does what I need it to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maxiglide does need to drastically improve the endurance of the product.  I should not be going on my third maxiglide after just a year and a half.  If it were more durable, hands down it would get five stars.  I give it three because it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I got rid of 3 other straighteners and gave up on the chemical junk I used to put in my hair. This iron is amazing. &lt;br /&gt;This works sooooo fast ... only one pass-through needed, unless I&#x27;m doing a little flipping/waving in the front. It also holds up in 99% humidity with no gel/hairspray for help. Nothing else works like this item, and I don&#x27;t even turn it up to the highest setting. I use about a 3-4 setting, and my constantly curly/frizzy hair is straight without damage (don&#x27;t clamp down very hard).</li>
    <li> Hair type:  I have african american relaxed hair.  I&#x27;m a 4a/4b. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s good about this product:  I must admit that this product gave me the best straightened look.  And my hair feels so good afterward.  (With other straighteners, my hair always felt kind of \\&quot;fried,\\&quot; brittle.)  This also gave me a nice gloss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why I hesitate to give it a higher ranking:  They really need to address the issue about the teeth pulling out so much hair.  The teeth themselves are smooth, ceramic, no kniks.  However, when you glide the hair between the plates, it really yanks the hair.  I just kept hearing \\&quot;snap\\&quot; \\&quot;snap.\\&quot; I mean, after pre-detangling a small section over and over again with a very narrow-tooth comb, it still pulled hair out, no matter how slow I was with gliding the iron down.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, it is rather bulky, which makes it awkward to manuver.  The steam button is too far away from the handle.  If you are a teenager or someone with smaller hands, you might find it hard to hold the iron and reach to push the steam button with your index finger at the same time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you really must know how this iron works, get it out of your system and go buy it at Bed Bath and Beyond, to avoid shipping costs (and to use your 20% off coupon).    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In summary, I am hoping that they improve on this iron because it does give a good \\&quot;press.\\&quot;  But, the amount of hair that you loose in the long run, I don&#x27;t know . . .</li>
    <li> I just love the Maxiglide hair straightener.  I have had 3 of them and I am currently looking for my fourth one.  Both my daughter and I use the Maxiglide and we have long hair.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is thicker and longer than mine.  I have used other flat iron and it would take at least 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours for her hair and at least 1 hour for my own hair.  With the Maxiglide I can do her hair in 45 minutes to 1 hour and 30 to 45 minutes for me.  Plus our hair stays straight for longer than a few hours with the other products.  The only problem is that after so long the unit starts to leak and you have to replace or if you are lucky it still under warranty and they replace it.  My sister like the way it worked so well she brought one for my neice and for herself.  They are looking to replace their too now.  You have to read the instructions or you will rip your hair out.  When you first comb thru and then you don&#x27;t close them down tight as you glide the hair thru and then the second time you close down tight and straighten the hair and your are done. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE MY MAXIGLIDE. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another brand as long as there are Maxiglides.</li>
    <li> This thing is magic, I love it and have no complaints. It makes your hair straight and beautifully shiny. My hair isn&#x27;t too thick or curly, which makes it even easier to handle. It is a little bulky but you get used to it. The water leaks occasionally but it&#x27;s no big deal when I see the results on my hair. This thing works!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, and it took me forever to make the purchase because I kept contacting the company with questions and trying to check other reviews before I could make up my mind.  I bought it.  I got it five days later, and it worked.  My daughter has THICK, CURLY and NAPPY hair.  After I washed and conditioned her hair I used the miniglide.  It was a long process, but much better than a hot comb.  Especially those corny electric hot combs.  Anyway, An hour later it is puffing out a little, but it is still easy to comb.  She doesn&#x27;t mind hair combing at all now.  It didn&#x27;t give her hair a hard press, but that&#x27;s fine, because a week later her hair still looks pressed.  I&#x27;ve also found that using a decent hair cream with the mini glide will give her a hard press.  When I need a touch up this helps stretch it out.  It makes my hair look very nice.</li>
    <li> I am a  24 year old  British young lady of black Caribbean descent.  For about 15 years I have been applying the relaxer to my hair, needless to say although my hair looks great I imagine that I have been damaging my hair follicles.  When I saw the Maxiglide infomercial I was eager to purchase it when I saw the hair miracles it appeared to produce, but skeptical as I have tried similar products.  I must say that I am truly amazed! Maxiglide straightens my hair really well, and it doesn&#x27;t feel hard but in fact very silky.  I love it, and have informed all I my friends about it.  A few of my friends who are Hispanic and also have curly hair have tried it, and they all love it. However, it is important to comb your hair out thoroughly while it is wet before using it to prevent breakage.  You must keep it well conditioned and moisturize the tips when dry. I have used it twice and so far I like the results, and I hope I continue to get the same results with future use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the way I wet my hair in the rain yesterday, and would you believe that it is still straight? Maxiglide is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be excellent, because of all the good reviews.  I followed the directions. It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair. It pulled my hair. waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect, I don&#x27;t know how they do so im not going to bother looking for the right words in my vocabulary. I guess you have to try it to believe it. It came last night and I tried it on my aunt&#x27;s dry frizzy hair and it worked great! And it only took like 10 minutes. I did experience some of the pulling hair but that&#x27;s totally natural because ALL straightenners pull hair alittle bit. The trick is to just get the hang of it because it very important you have a good grip and comb your hair out. I gave it 4 stars because it can be improved and I hope it is in the near future. The size it pretty big but I guess it makes it easier to get large chunks of hair. I love the steam burst. Im writing this review after having used it this morning so my soft hair is in my eyes. hehehehehe...So it&#x27;s close to perfect and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I must say this product is amazing!  I have long, thick, curly hair.  Normally, the only time I wore my hair straight was when I was coming from the salon - I just never had the time or patience to sit and blow dry with a round brush and then spend forever using the straightening iron.  On a whim I bought this because it looked interesting...I was shocked!  My hair was completely straight in 10 minutes.  I recommend this product %l00!  It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t break your hair (as long as you comb through it first!).  It&#x27;s totally worth the $90!</li>
    <li> The product does straighten as advertised, BUT I find it very heavy and clumsy to operate and to pack when traveling.  Very disappointed with mini glide as it doesn&#x27;t heat up and straighten nearly as well as the maxi glide.</li>
    <li> I must say that I purchased this product about a year and a half ago from shop at home tv and I am COMPLETELY hooked!!!!  It is by far the best straightener I have ever used, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!!!!  Both my daughter and I have VERY curly, frizzy hair. Actually my daughter&#x27;s hair is a lot thicker, longer, and also a lot curlier than mine and because of this I use to spend a mini-fortune getting our hair done every week at the salon.  Now, I do our hair with the Maxiglide; and my daughter, who is 13, is now using it on her own to do touch-ups!  Also my hair is cut in layers and so I flip up the ends and sides to get the curls I like and it works like a charm!  It keeps hair straight for longer and a lot less frizzy than with any other product. It is a little bulky but it just takes some getting use to.  I have recommened this item to so many people and they ALL absolutely love it!  Therefore, if anyone is considering to purchase this product, I would HIGHLY recommend it!!!! Trust me you will NEVER regret it!!!!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have seen the infomercials for this product and finally decided to give it a try.  I have been using hair straighteners for years, but liked the idea of a product that was not so hot (therefore, not so damaging), plus the steam option.  My first reaction upon trying Maxi Glide was that it pulled at my hair too much.  I tried not squeezing the plates when closing it, but it still pulled at my hair.  I also didn&#x27;t like how heavy it was.  I purchased this from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and returned it yesterday.  I was disappointed that for this price the product was not a lot better, it seems as though it should range in the $20-30 range.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African-American and have been wearing my hair in a natural style since 2002.  Every now and then, I want a straight style, but don&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money at the salon or put chemicals in my hair again.  This is perfect!  The dial allows me to adjust the amount of heat I want, and I personally use the plate with the teeth to comb through my hair to straighten throughout and not just on the surface (again, my preference).  I use the miniglide in the back where my hair&#x27;s much shorter.  My hair stays straight until I wash it (about every week).  It&#x27;s definitely the best investment I&#x27;ve made in hair care.</li>
    <li> I bought Maxiglide from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acouple of years ago.  I have frizzy hair that is now mostly white and so you can imagine the countless products I have tried over the years to control the frizz and make it shiny. I tried countless blow dryers, hot combs, curlers, hot irons and nothing worked the way I wanted it to, or I found the irons too difficult to use.  With Maxiglide my hair is manageable, soft, incredibly shiny and beautiful and I am getting compliments on the beauty of my hair now for the first time in my long life.  Women my age come to me and ask how I get my white hair so beautiful- if only they could do it they could stop dyeing their hair.  I even have young women coming to me to say that if their hair looks this good when they are grey, they won&#x27;t dye their hair either.  I bought it for my daughter who refused to spend the time she needs to get her incredibly thick curly frizzy hair under control and now she uses it once or twice a week because the effect lasts several days.  Yes, it does pull out hair and after reading the other reviews, I realize I have to be more careful on the top of my head but otherwise this is the best hair product I have ever used. I wish something like this had been available in 1960&#x27;s when straight hair was all the rage and I had to suffer sleeping on giant rollers just to have my hair look presentable a day later!  Idid have to buy another one when the first one stopped working but I have one at home, one at my second home, one I take on trips with me.</li>
