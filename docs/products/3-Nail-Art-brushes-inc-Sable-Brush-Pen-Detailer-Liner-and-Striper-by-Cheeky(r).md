<li> the tips are not stiff enough to perform well.</li>
<li> Use them and wipe them with a little nail polish remover and they&#x27;re back to brand new.</li>
<li> The brushes I received only resemble the picture in the colors on the ends of the brushes (the red, green, and blue) but in no other way, and when one of the brush ends broke off in my hand before I could even get polish on it</li>
<li> It also lasts for a long time.</li>
<li> They are actually about 6 inches long and not really functional at all for doing nail art.  </li>
<li> the longest brush had bent and broken bristles, and none of the brushes make clean lines with polish or other nail art mediums.</li>
<li> Considering The Red Pen Was Missing The Tip</li>
<li> i was looking for the brushes shown in the picture where the blue one is the longest because its thinner and works better for me, however i got the set i already have where the green one is the longest :(</li>
<li> The brushes r very very flimsy... and difficult to use.</li>
<li> I bought them to replace a wood handled set of brushes that had started to wear due to having to soak them in acetone to remove the polish from the bristles.</li>
<li> I was not aware that there would be 3 packs of art brushes.</li>
<li> So I got these a few months ago but heres my review.</li>
<li> There were a few stray fibers but just clipped them off.  </li>
<li> Flimsy, raggedy, poor quality, and unbranded.</li>
<li> It was hard to use unless your polish is really thin.</li>
<li> But I Am Not Happy With My Purchase</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> Disappointing, you get what you pay for they say.</li>
<li> horrible quality...</li>

    <li> These brushes are exactly what I needed to perform my nail art. I bought them to replace a wood handled set of brushes that had started to wear due to having to soak them in acetone to remove the polish from the bristles. The plastic handle on these brushes are not affected by the acetone and the quality of the bristles are nice. Good quality, highly recommended for at home nail use.</li>
    <li> Im Sorry But I Am Not Happy With My Purchase Considering The Red Pen Was Missing The Tip So I Cant Even Use It I Will Be Returning The Item And Going Out To Buy The Pens From A Store.</li>
    <li> A very good purchase! It was wonderful to do business with the seller. The service was very good and in all aspects (price, quality etc...) this is a good value for money. I would defenatly shop here again.</li>
    <li> I was not aware that there would be 3 packs of art brushes.This made the deal all the more worthy of the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works super cool it does it job quickly and easy and without doing a mess. Perfect for doing nail art</li>
    <li> The brushes do not look the same as the picture. They have numbers instead of it saying cheeky witch is the brand. I have not tried them out yet. Hoping that they work well. Thank you for early delivery.</li>
    <li> i bought this brush set. the longest brush had bent and broken bristles, and none of the brushes make clean lines with polish or other nail art mediums. the tips are not stiff enough to perform well. would not buy these again for sure.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them but their quality appears to ne good. I love doing my own nail art. I will order them again.</li>
    <li> Alright, took forever to get here. Dont clean with acetone</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.  There were a few stray fibers but just clipped them off.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product does it&#x27;s job. It also lasts for a long time. Of course if you take care of them properly.</li>
    <li> It was hard to use unless your polish is really thin. The bristles were not all the same length and wouldn&#x27;t make a straight line.</li>
    <li> As soon as I used them the metal piece and brush came out and when I try to clean them the brush comes out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a person who always gets their nails done and sometimes I just feel like saving money and designing them myself. These brushes are great and make doing designs very easy.</li>
    <li> If you are into doing nails this is a must have staple for your inventory.  I just do mine and friends nails for fun and remember when I first started how I would by the little detail nail polishes and the brushes in them were bigger than what I needed.  These saved me.  I totally recommend them for anyone who does nails.</li>
    <li> Flimsy, raggedy, poor quality, and unbranded. Save your money and find another listing. The brushes I received only resemble the picture in the colors on the ends of the brushes (the red, green, and blue) but in no other way, and when one of the brush ends broke off in my hand before I could even get polish on it I knew that they were meant for the trash can.</li>
    <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
    <li> Perfect for beginners,I love all 3 brushes very pleased.Especially when working on your own nails.I do all my stripes with these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes looked a very good price and nice. hence I ordered them. The brushes r very very flimsy... and difficult to use. I tried to clean it after using and all the bristles came in my hand... horrible quality...</li>
    <li> These are made of plastic, and when cleaning them the acetone ate through one of them.  They work for what I got them for though.  I just have to be more careful when cleaning.</li>
    <li> They are okay not one of my best buys .. I won&#x27;t order this again . You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Good quality brushes.  I have seen this used a lot and after I received mine and used them I can see why.  I would certainly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I needed this produc  to fix my nails and I found with you exactly what I needed, good quality and easy to handle</li>
    <li> So I got these a few months ago but heres my review. Disappointing, you get what you pay for they say. I do not like it for nail art the bristles are too plastic. Also they are not think for nail art, and thats crucial! Don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
    <li> These brushes got here fast and they work perfectly! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  Use them and wipe them with a little nail polish remover and they&#x27;re back to brand new.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, easy to use make designs with. I would buy again, and I do recommend them too!</li>
    <li> they are pens without ink.. and have brushes at the end. they dont show this in the photo. they are very cheaply made and cheap looking. i have not used them yet.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price, they work pretty well. They actually arrived ahead of schedule so that was a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> Took a while to ship, but loved the product</li>
    <li> i was looking for the brushes shown in the picture where the blue one is the longest because its thinner and works better for me, however i got the set i already have where the green one is the longest :( But the seller was very prompt with delivery and the price was low enough that i don&#x27;t feel at a loss. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised but these brushes are cheap and only resemble the picture.  They are actually about 6 inches long and not really functional at all for doing nail art.  Too flimsy.</li>
