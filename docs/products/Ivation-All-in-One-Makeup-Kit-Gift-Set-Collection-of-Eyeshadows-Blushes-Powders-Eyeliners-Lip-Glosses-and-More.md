      <li>is pretty good</li>
      <li>she packed was this makeup kit and was able to easily get the job done.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s nice to have these as a back-up for a quick fix on-the-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The packaging is very nice, too, and the kit would make a great gift for both younger girls and adult women.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However super glue works wonders!  </li>
      <li>This is an awesome and affordable set of makeup that&#x27;s great for the teen who wants makeup in every color possible.</li>
      <li>The eyeshadows are colorful and most of it shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to start playing in it.</li>
      <li>best part is how small and compact it is, it will disappear inside a suitcase.</li>
      <li>Other than that great product.</li>
      <li>Super recommend</li>
      <li>Broke really quickly.</li>
      <li>I love it and would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>98 squares of soft, very fine powdered eye shadow.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very compact and easy to carry.  </li>
      <li>I had it available for the bridesmaids when they were getting ready</li>
      <li>this healthy, natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And well worth the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is so much fun to experiment with colors that I wouldn&#x27;t try if they were full-size.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary review sample.</li>

      <li>considering what all you get) and fun set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The make up is nice enough.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I received a sample product from Ivation.et) and fun set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right there makes the set extra nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;--Top levels or steps (one pulls to the right,</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t any extreme colors in these two palettes, these are more earthy and natural looking shades and they blend in nicely.</li>
      <li>For my sister is more than enough.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a brown and pink kind of girl and these colors speak to me.</li>
      <li>Everything was in tact and looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
      <li>blushes are really pretty.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Basically, this is an exact dupe for SHANY 2012</li>
      <li>palette would be a well-appreciated gift for a young lady for her quincea&amp;ntilde;era or sweet</li>
      <li>I knew something wasn&#x27;t right when I read more reviews and seen other people&#x27;s pics</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, got here jus in time</li>
      <li>The colors shown on this product page are very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The box and makeup are very well put together.</li>
      <li>The colors blend very well.  </li>
      <li>Should be more careful when packing this type of product.</li>
      <li>So whether you want a makeup kit for every day use with a ton of color options, or you need something with dramatic colors for acting/drama/theater, this set is a great choice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Opening it reveals a mirror, ten applicators, and 177 small pans of wet powders and glosses in a gorgeous range of mostly shimmery colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I actually giggled when I opened the box, pulled out the top levels, then pulled out the middle levels, which exposed the bottom levels.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like the peachy one, it gives my cheeks</li>
      <li>set is mostly eye shadows, plus a few blushes and lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>like the fact that there are so many colors, and that there is not a huge amount of each color.  </li>
      <li>There are two reds (bright red and deep red), pale pink, shimmer bronze, terracotta and kind of a peachy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Purchased this as a gift for my 11 year old niece.</li>
      <li>My 14 year old daughter is always digging through my makeup case, asking if I have eye-shadow in this color and that.</li>
      <li>I bought it for a Christmas gift, I looked it over and it looks like a professional kit.</li>
      <li>Normally she would have to take her big \\&quot;Tackle Box\\&quot; sized kit to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a pale matte pink that would go nicely with a smoky eye look, vibrant shimmer pink and a matte peachy one.</li>
      <li>When I purchase a name brand, it is usually one or two colors in a compact, and I buy a certain color to go with a certain outfit or look.  </li>
      <li>Careful, so that you know what your are really ordering here:  </li>
      <li>If the box wasn&#x27;t broken, the brushes used and one of the makeups used it get more then 1 star</li>
      <li>As she started to pull out the first tray, others hidden beneath kept coming out.</li>
      <li>Exactly the same in color and price and design as one I bought for my other daughter that was $10 more expensive</li>

    <li> Fast shipping. Great gift.</li>
    <li> when my order came in the mail, it was cracked and the makup was chipping!</li>
    <li> The box is about 6 x 6 x 2 1/2 in. and has double red rope handles.  Opening it reveals a mirror, ten applicators, and 177 small pans of wet powders and glosses in a gorgeous range of mostly shimmery colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so much fun to experiment with colors that I wouldn&#x27;t try if they were full-size.  There are so many colors of eyeshadow that it is almost overwhelming, without even considering all the combinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette would be a well-appreciated gift for a young lady for her quincea&amp;ntilde;era or sweet sixteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DBROTH provided a palette for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Broke really quickly.</li>
    <li> Some eyeshadow were broken no good</li>
    <li> This make up kit is terrible  I&#x27;m disappointed with it when we opened the box the kit was broken and damaged</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these as gifts for family members and they both loved it.</li>
    <li> Good product but the sent in bag and broke in one corner. Is fragile should send in a small box.</li>
    <li> This product arrived the next day. Everything was in tact and looks exactly like the picture.  I love it and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> the cheap plastic case came chipped, but over all it&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;m excited to start playing in it.</li>
    <li> I love it. Super recommend</li>
    <li> Was delivered earlier than expected, which is always a plus!  The box and makeup are very well put together. Nothing is missing, mixed up or out of place. I love the quality of the makeup and there are lots of beautiful colors to play with.  It&#x27;s very compact and easy to carry.  This was a great buy and I recommend it to anyone who has looked, looked again, and looked some more and couldn&#x27;t make a decision. Just do it!</li>
    <li> This is a great travel makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I went to an out of town wedding and of course she needed to do put on her makeup. Normally she would have to take her big \\&quot;Tackle Box\\&quot; sized kit to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is like a \\&quot;Clown Car\\&quot; of makeup, you assume there are just a few colors inside. As she started to pull out the first tray, others hidden beneath kept coming out. There are a total of six compartments of eyeshadow and luminizers on each side. The bottom section holds the mirror, lipstick, and brushes/applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All she packed was this makeup kit and was able to easily get the job done. There are many colors to choose from coral to fuchsia. Besides being the prettiest lady at the wedding, she was able to find the perfect color to accent her periwinkle dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is how small and compact it is, it will disappear inside a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but daughter loves it</li>
    <li> I bought it for a Christmas gift, I looked it over and it looks like a professional kit.</li>
    <li> Nice set. I needed to get some makeup for a wedding. I had it available for the bridesmaids when they were getting ready and it was great!</li>
    <li> Item broken when opened. Hinges broken. Need to return</li>
    <li> I just get my makeup kit and it arrive in great condition I just love it money will spend.</li>
    <li> Vibrant colors, great texture! Totally in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Had a broken hinge. Other than that great product.</li>
    <li> was broken when I received it</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my 11 year old niece. She was thrilled to receive it! The gift arrived on time and in tact.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent all-in-one makeup box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is an exact dupe for SHANY 2012 Edition All In One Harmony Makeup Kit. The shimmery/glossy eye shadows are quite similar in quality to Coastal Scents 88 Ultra Shimmer palette or any drug store brand, like Miss Sporty or Cover Girl. I&#x27;ve been using this kit for over a week now and have no complaints at all. In all honest, I am kind of in love with the fact that I have almost everything I need in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetics included:&lt;br /&gt;98 Shimmery Eye shadows, 70 Pastel Shimmery/Glossy Eye shadows&lt;br /&gt;6 Lip Glosses&lt;br /&gt;3 Blushes&lt;br /&gt;2 Lip Brushes, 7 Double-sided Eye shadow Applicators, Mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great make-up kit for beginners or make-up artists on-the-go. All the eye shadows are nicely pigmented and the variety of colors gives you plenty of possibilities. There aren&#x27;t any extreme colors in these two palettes, these are more earthy and natural looking shades and they blend in nicely. I didn&#x27;t notice any creasing, but I do always use eye shadow primer, so can&#x27;t tell you how they stay on without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip glosses compliment the eye make-up you can achieve with these eye shadows very nicely. There are two reds (bright red and deep red), pale pink, shimmer bronze, terracotta and kind of a peachy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blushes are really pretty. There is a pale matte pink that would go nicely with a smoky eye look, vibrant shimmer pink and a matte peachy one. I particularly like the peachy one, it gives my cheeks this healthy, natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes and applicators included in this kit are very basic ones and I think most people will prefer to use their own make up brushes instead. Still, it&#x27;s nice to have these as a back-up for a quick fix on-the-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am quite impressed with the quality of the cosmetics included in this box. The packaging is very nice, too, and the kit would make a great gift for both younger girls and adult women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary review sample.This did not affect my opinion in any way.lt women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary review sample.This did not affect my opinion in any way.</li>
    <li> The colors in this makeup are bright and bold. I love the mixture of colors. I&#x27;m a brown and pink kind of girl and these colors speak to me. The trays pull out with ease and each and every eye shadow and lip gloss are intact.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome and affordable set of makeup that&#x27;s great for the teen who wants makeup in every color possible. My 14 year old daughter is always digging through my makeup case, asking if I have eye-shadow in this color and that. I usually don&#x27;t. I use neutral colors. She&#x27;s always looking for something like violet or deep green. This set was perfect for her. Because not only does it have every eye color she could ask for, it has a TON of glosses too. That&#x27;s right there makes the set extra nice. There are a lot of sets that offer a wide color pallet of eye-shadows, but usually just a few glosses. This set has 48 glosses! So whether you want a makeup kit for every day use with a ton of color options, or you need something with dramatic colors for acting/drama/theater, this set is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Love this kit. I don&#x27;t do eye shadow like that but I am sure will practice with my kit. It has all the colors in the world, great size for traveling kit. And well worth the price. Shipping was fast, got here jus in time</li>
    <li> Welp got my package today and guess what broken!!!! The makeup wasn&#x27;t but the case it  was itself I mean what I expect when the only thing that was holding it in place was one little &amp;#34;sealed air&amp;#34; so I sent them an email asking what I could do because I need by this Saturday it was a gift and the got the order number and ive heard nothing eles from them!</li>
    <li> This gift set was to my 16 years old sister, and she loved it! the kit has all that mentioned and is so practical. The eyeshadows are colorful and most of it shiny. For my sister is more than enough.</li>
    <li> Make up came in broken.</li>
    <li> This was meant to be a birthday present to my sister but unfortunately it came broken. as soon as I opened the packaging I can already see the latch broken I gave them a shot and ordered this product anyway but now I can see why people are saying this is defective from manufacturing or maybe it&#x27;s used I knew something wasn&#x27;t right when I read more reviews and seen other people&#x27;s pics well I posed my pics too see for your self beware this crap will come broken save your money !!</li>
    <li> The colour is not vibrant as seen</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. It did arrive slightly damaged, but it&#x27;s still usable.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this and was a bit sad when the product arrived. The box was broken on the hinges, at least 5 of the make up pieces were destroted (which coated the rest of the make up), and the trays were messed up. Now this is mostly the delivers fault for not handling it well, but it was still a bit of a head ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make up on the other hand is pretty good and she seemed to like that it didn&#x27;t break her out like others do. I&#x27;d recommend the set, but it may come up damaged from shipping.</li>
    <li> Truly a color extravaganza!  I actually giggled when I opened the box, pulled out the top levels, then pulled out the middle levels, which exposed the bottom levels.  So many beautiful colors.  Careful, so that you know what your are really ordering here:  The pictures and the description do not match.  I got what is pictured.  The colors shown on this product page are very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is mostly eye shadows, plus a few blushes and lip glosses.  The eye shadows go on smoothly, evenly and coverage is good.  It does not crease.  The colors blend very well.  There are some colors that I won&#x27;t ever use, but I will use the majority of colors.  The amount of each color shadow is not a year&#x27;s supply, of course.  To give you an idea of size, each square is 21/32 square inch.  Each round is 5/8\\&quot; diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is pictured, and what you get, is this:&lt;br /&gt;--Top levels or steps (one pulls to the right, one to the left):  98 squares of soft, very fine powdered eye shadow.  The powder is not totally matte, but it&#x27;s really not sparkly either.  It is well-suited for daytime wear.  It is luxurious in its softness.&lt;br /&gt;--On the middle levels or steps:  70 rounds of sparkly powdered eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;--The bottom sections contain three blushes, six lip glosses, seven sponge applicators, two lip brushes, one simple brush for the blushes.  There is also a fold-out mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that there are so many colors, and that there is not a huge amount of each color.  From my experience, I&#x27;d rather have a smaller amount than a lot.  I don&#x27;t want my eye shadows to last \\&quot;forever\\&quot;.  When I purchase a name brand, it is usually one or two colors in a compact, and I buy a certain color to go with a certain outfit or look.  I never get through it all before I get tired of it and want to try something new.  And, sometimes, it turns out I don&#x27;t even like the color--and there goes my investment.  So, this is a fairly inexpensive (considering what all you get) and fun set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Ivation.et) and fun set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Ivation.</li>
    <li> Read the description when ordering rather than the features and details section for accuracy. The make up is nice enough. The case is tough to slide open initially and then comes off the track. It is what it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my gf and she absolutely loved it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It came broken I didn&#x27;t really like the colors. So I just ended up giving it away unfortunately.</li>
    <li> THE PACKAGE WAS VERY POOR. Arrived damaged partially PRODUCT. HINGE WAS STARTING AND SHADOWS spilled. NOW THE PRODUCT was damaged. Should be more careful when packing this type of product. I wasted my money as it was an investment.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Only complaint is that a piece on the hinge was broken making it difficult to open and close.  However super glue works wonders!  All of the makeup was intact.</li>
    <li> ordered two to give to cosmetology students in cambodia but one case came broken and upon inspection the design is just too poor and materials too cheap to use on a regular basis</li>
    <li> It has a great variety of eyeshadows, which I love the most about this product.  I can make numerous combinations between the shimmer eye shadows and the regular ones.</li>
    <li> If the box wasn&#x27;t broken, the brushes used and one of the makeups used it get more then 1 star</li>
    <li> Quite a selection.  This was purchased as a birthday gift.  Recipient was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> kinda a little bit upset because the case was broken...</li>
    <li> Exactly the same in color and price and design as one I bought for my other daughter that was $10 more expensive</li>
