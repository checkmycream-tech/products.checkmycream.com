      <li>but know that its a great product just the person I bought it from I</li>
      <li>Works GREAT...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very handy.</li>
      <li>I also received a very nice manicure set with each one.</li>
      <li>Your bikini line won&#x27;t be \\&quot;touchably smooth,\\&quot; like after a good wax or shave, but if you&#x27;re just looking to keep the hair to a minimum, this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>No pain and a fairly close shave</li>
      <li>/&gt;AND IS A GOOD FIND..</li>
      <li>I know that this is a good product, but I got a lemon</li>
      <li>GOOD RECOMMEND.</li>
      <li>as for what is not seen, which is what i took these to be for, theres nothing better!</li>
      <li>No, this doesn&#x27;t leave your skin as smooth as waxing or shaving, but it does do a good job of trimming without nicking my skin.  </li>
      <li>THANKS!!! :)!</li>
      <li>I have medium colored hair, and I&#x27;ve used this trimmer many times.  </li>
      <li>I paid more for it and it kept breaking.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought two of them</li>
      <li>I purchased this after reading many reviews.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with all the extra&#x27;s that came with my bikini trimmer</li>
      <li>I love this because of the curve.  </li>
      <li>Fast, effective, good angling.</li>
      <li>I got a bikini touch about a mounth ago, and i love the price.</li>
      <li>I did, however, find a much better product -- the epilady bikini trimmer.</li>
      <li>This item is the most dependable in this line of bikini battery operated tools.</li>
      <li>IF YOU GET MORE.</li>
      <li>Trims the bush great!I love it.</li>
      <li>It makes seeing what you&#x27;re doing better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, compact, and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD</li>
      <li>the bikini touch has a head that will turn 30 degrees which allows me to get in to my anus and gouch area easily.</li>
      <li>I was attracted to its shape and size and figured it would be easy to manneuver.</li>
      <li>Okay for fine light hair--of course, if you have fine, light hair, you don&#x27;t need to try to remove.</li>
      <li>It shaves away the hair just fine for me, you know need to know how to get to all the hair.  </li>
      <li>Good old Amazon!</li>
      <li>I love this product and feel it is worth its price.</li>
      <li>But good old amazon came thru.</li>
      <li>THIS TRIMMER IS PRETTY GOOD &amp; IS VERY AFFORDABLE.  </li>
      <li>This allows you to get into all those nooks and crannies (lol) and clips it super short.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find them any longer in the stores, so I was excited to find them on sale on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>None of the blades worked even the original that&#x27;s attached.</li>
      <li>I use it to clean up the edges on haircuts now, and getting something else to serve this device&#x27;s original purpose.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten any signs of razor bumps or cuts, and it&#x27;s perfect for really hard to reach areas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several of these kinds of trimmers and this one is by far the best - gives a VERY close shave!!</li>
      <li>So thanks,:)</li>
      <li>I like a nice clean bikini area and this product simply will not get you there.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good shaver, though it&#x27;s not as powerful as the last one I had.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what I wanted it to do and does not break!</li>
      <li>The bikini touch works for the eyebrow and upper lip and has held together nicely.</li>
      <li>and they will do something to make it right</li>
      <li>that is a year old and was looking forward to having my own that was brand new.</li>
      <li>Love this little thing - I had to replace one I&#x27;d had for years and was glad to find it here.</li>
      <li>When I went back to the store, they didn&#x27;t have this brand any more</li>
      <li>It does still work without the attachments pretty well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bikini touch for 7 years my first one.</li>
      <li>While this is true, after 1 use, the thing stopped working, even with new batteries.</li>
      <li>Only problem is the brand new one doesn&#x27;t work as good as the year old one.</li>
      <li>Like this better than the regular removers as the curve in this one makes it much easier to use and reach all areas.</li>
      <li>This is ok if all you want is to not have long hairs creeping around, but I was expecting a much smoother result, and this thing doesn&#x27;t cut it!</li>
      <li>I compared many others and didn&#x27;t feel the need to spend 40 dollars or more for other brands which were basically the same concept just made out of stonger materials.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a smart woman, so it occurred to me to think I was going to get what I paid for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ok with less powerful if I know it won&#x27;t make me bleed.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really work with the trimmer heads.</li>
      <li>( BUT ONLY OF I QUALIFY FOR A FREE SHIPPING</li>
      <li>Others brands seem to die much quicker</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worked very well for close trimming.</li>
      <li>No cream, no mess, no pain, and it really works!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect this little gadget to survive long but while it lasts it does a good job.</li>
      <li>Eventually i bought new batteries</li>
      <li>I assumed the blades were dulling and it was time for a new one.  </li>
      <li>I should of just bought it new.</li>
      <li>I had been using my Mom&#x27;s bikini trimmer (exactly the same model)</li>
      <li>This is my second one, the first lasted about a year.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d bought this at a local discount store and used it for a couple of years with decent results before I noticed it really wasn&#x27;t working as well as it used to.  </li>
      <li>When I bought this, I got it very quickly - within a few days of purchase.</li>
      <li>There are other trimmers out there and this one is just as good if not better.</li>
      <li>It works really well, especially on facial hair, like in between eyebrows, etc.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for coarse hair!</li>
      <li>This clips nowhere near as close.</li>
      <li>Could barely do my nose.  </li>
      <li>As far as what would show outside of the bikini, then yeah, you would want to shave/wax.</li>
      <li>the reason you don&#x27;t get shave-bumps is because a very short bit of the hair is left behind, which might be a problem for brunettes with very light skin.</li>

<li> This is a trimmer-so just trims hair really short, not smooth like shaving.</li>
<li> It took a long time trim a little bit of hair and it doesn&#x27;t get close at all.</li>
<li> Small job or Big job...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t find the Bikini Touch model any where because it is a much better product than some of the others out there.</li>
<li> I would be curious to know how well this works for women with dark hair -</li>
<li> I bought mine at Walgreens and have been using for at least a year on same battery.</li>
<li> And since the warranty requires me to pay for the shipping, it&#x27;s really not worth returning.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the one I bought used doesn&#x27;t cut hair if you put it against skin but if you add an attachment then it cuts. yes odd. but know that its a great product just the person I bought it from I shouldn&#x27;t of I should of just bought it new.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one called \\&quot;finishing touch\\&quot;. I thought they were the same.  They&#x27;re not. This clips nowhere near as close. Skip it for another model</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a smart woman, so it occurred to me to think I was going to get what I paid for. And I did. At $10, this trimmer was hard to pass up. I was attracted to its shape and size and figured it would be easy to manneuver. While this is true, after 1 use, the thing stopped working, even with new batteries. So, I bought a 2nd one, thinking it was a fluke. The same thing happened. I followed the instructions and did not break this product. It is a piece of junk. I did, however, find a much better product -- the epilady bikini trimmer. This product works well and is still slim in size.</li>
    <li> I like a nice clean bikini area and this product simply will not get you there. I have never used it for facial hair but I tried it for my bikini area and it was a total waste of money. It took a long time trim a little bit of hair and it doesn&#x27;t get close at all. Stubble in that area is just not acceptable...</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work from the second it came out of the box. And since the warranty requires me to pay for the shipping, it&#x27;s really not worth returning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for some time now and it&#x27;s worked very well for close trimming. The blade has dulled now and I have to search for something else. I wish there were replacement blades for these tiny wonders.</li>
    <li> This item is the most dependable in this line of bikini battery operated tools.</li>
    <li> As the reviewer below mentioned, this device neither shaves nor removes the hair around the bikini area, but instead seems to trim it down to a small point. This is ok if all you want is to not have long hairs creeping around, but I was expecting a much smoother result, and this thing doesn&#x27;t cut it! I have very dark hair, and it was still visible after trimming, plus it hardly seemed to touch thicker hairs! Where this does work quite well is on my upper thighs, where the hair is lighter and finer, but I have other things to remove hair there! All-in-all, I&#x27;m disappointed by this device and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it in place of waxing, epilating, or just plain shaving.</li>
    <li> This product was so weak.  Could not even make a dent in bikini area. Could barely do my nose.  Sellers ask us not to leave a bad review and they will do something to make it right (maybe return money or something else - I do not know) which is probably why there are not a lot of bad reviews on this product.  However, I am hoping no one else will waste their money on this product.  It really stinks....</li>
    <li> I love this product and feel it is worth its price. I bought my daughter one and she loves it as well</li>
    <li> When I bought this and brought it home, it didn&#x27;t work at all and it still doesn&#x27;t work months later, stuck with a $20. shaver that&#x27;s worthless. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> I was impressed with all the extra&#x27;s that came with my bikini trimmer BUT.... the trimmer did not work like it&#x27;s supposed to.  I had been using my Mom&#x27;s bikini trimmer (exactly the same model) that is a year old and was looking forward to having my own that was brand new. Only problem is the brand new one doesn&#x27;t work as good as the year old one. I went to return the item..... only to find that Amazon doesn&#x27;t except returns on trimmers. I know that this is a good product, but I got a lemon and I&#x27;m stuck with it....so I&#x27;m not to happy.</li>
    <li> After using the Bikini Touch, I can&#x27;t imagine why any woman would use anything else to remove unwanted hair! I use it to shave my pits as well as my bikini area. No cream, no mess, no pain, and it really works!</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. I have used the more expensive Lady Remington for bikini lines, as well as other clippers. This allows you to get into all those nooks and crannies (lol) and clips it super short. A trimmer is not intended for shaving anyways, so if you are looking for that, just shave or get a brazilian bikini wax. this gets all the way down to the root. As far as what would show outside of the bikini, then yeah, you would want to shave/wax. as for what is not seen, which is what i took these to be for, theres nothing better!</li>
    <li> No, this doesn&#x27;t leave your skin as smooth as waxing or shaving, but it does do a good job of trimming without nicking my skin.  I&#x27;d bought this at a local discount store and used it for a couple of years with decent results before I noticed it really wasn&#x27;t working as well as it used to.  I assumed the blades were dulling and it was time for a new one.  When I went back to the store, they didn&#x27;t have this brand any more and I bought a Finishing Touch model.  The Finishing Touch one is awful compared to this one!  It doesn&#x27;t seem to trim or cut anything and hair gets tangled in it and pulls and HURTS! I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t find the Bikini Touch model any where because it is a much better product than some of the others out there.</li>
    <li> THIS TRIMMER IS PRETTY GOOD &amp; IS VERY AFFORDABLE.  I HAVE PURCHASED OVER 10 TRIMMERS LOOKING FOR THE ONE THAT WILL TRIM OVER MY LIP &amp; NOSE.  THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift a few months ago, and havent stopped using it since then. It&#x27;s light, compact, and very easy to use. I haven&#x27;t gotten any signs of razor bumps or cuts, and it&#x27;s perfect for really hard to reach areas. And it&#x27;s great for travel bags!!!</li>
    <li> I have medium colored hair, and I&#x27;ve used this trimmer many times.  It shaves away the hair just fine for me, you know need to know how to get to all the hair.  If your hair is so coarse that this trimmer doesn&#x27;t work, you I&#x27;d recommend waxing!  Fast, effective, good angling.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect this little gadget to survive long but while it lasts it does a good job. This is my second one, the first lasted about a year. I compared many others and didn&#x27;t feel the need to spend 40 dollars or more for other brands which were basically the same concept just made out of stonger materials. Take care of it and don&#x27;t use it in the shower or bath and it will probablly last longer then one year. No pain and a fairly close shave; what else do you want for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these kinds of trimmers and this one is by far the best - gives a VERY close shave!!</li>
    <li> It works and wold say for the price I paid it worked for about a year.  There are other trimmers out there and this one is just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> This thing is NOT powerful.  BUT it does not nick or cut the skin, which is what I was looking for.  i&#x27;ve had a couple of products that cut me which is very unpleasant for personal grooming.  I&#x27;m ok with less powerful if I know it won&#x27;t make me bleed.</li>
    <li> I had this for about 6 SIX years and it just died on me. This is a trimmer-so just trims hair really short, not smooth like shaving. but for me, it&#x27;s just what i needed! I will be buying another one!</li>
    <li> The motor on this went out in about two weeks.  It was not a battery issue, but a motor issue, and therefor a quality issue.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!! I JST DNT LIKE THE FACT THAT I HAD A PAY A &amp;#34;SEPERATE&amp;#34; S&amp;H FEE OF $5 PER RAZOR!!! WHY ISNT ITS JST ONE &amp;#34;FLAT&amp;#34; FEE??? ANYWAY, PLEASE LET ME KNBOW IF YOU GET MORE. I THINK I ORDER THE LAST FEW YOU HAD IN STOCK ( BUT ONLY OF I QUALIFY FOR A FREE SHIPPING OR THERE IS &amp;#34;ONE&amp;#34; FEE )...THANKS!!! :)!</li>
    <li> The strongest battery operated trimmer I have ever found.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer that I have found! Others brands seem to die much quicker</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on coarse hairs.  Doesn&#x27;t remove, only trims.  Okay for fine light hair--of course, if you have fine, light hair, you don&#x27;t need to try to remove.</li>
    <li> This can&#x27;t even cut through hair. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading many reviews. It came, I took it out of the package and threw the package away. A few days went by and I tried ot use it. It did not work. Hmmm, maybe hte batteries are dead. Eventually i bought new batteries but it still did not work so I got a busted product. Not worth the chance, would not suggest this product</li>
    <li> I purchased another product similar to the bikini touch to use for facial hair removal (eyebrow and upper lip).  I did not like it.  I paid more for it and it kept breaking.  The bikini touch works for the eyebrow and upper lip and has held together nicely. I have not used it for bikini area nor do I want to. I like this product.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do and does not break!</li>
    <li> This is the only razor that I can use without getting a terrible rash.  I can&#x27;t find them any longer in the stores, so I was excited to find them on sale on Amazon.com.  Therefore, I bought several of them.  I also received a very nice manicure set with each one.</li>
    <li> I love this because of the curve.  It makes seeing what you&#x27;re doing better.I&#x27;m glad I bought two of them</li>
    <li> Use this for my bikini area..I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this product again..</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t even want to turn on.</li>
    <li> Had one that broke so ordered another 2.&lt;br /&gt;Great for nose hairs and trimming. Small job or Big job... It can handle anything and does a great job at it too.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM CAN BE USED FOR WHAT IT SAYS..&lt;br /&gt;AND IS A GOOD FIND.. I THINK IT CAN ALSO BE&lt;br /&gt;USED TO TRIM MUSTACHES ON MEN, AS WELL..&lt;br /&gt;A GOOD RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Your bikini line won&#x27;t be \\&quot;touchably smooth,\\&quot; like after a good wax or shave, but if you&#x27;re just looking to keep the hair to a minimum, this is a great product.  I would be curious to know how well this works for women with dark hair - the reason you don&#x27;t get shave-bumps is because a very short bit of the hair is left behind, which might be a problem for brunettes with very light skin.</li>
    <li> I got a bikini touch about a mounth ago, and i love the price. i bought it for one purpose, as to shave my pubic hair. i used to get brazilians but now i don&#x27;t need to anymore. the bikini touch has a head that will turn 30 degrees which allows me to get in to my anus and gouch area easily. its totally painless.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good shaver, though it&#x27;s not as powerful as the last one I had.  Maybe it&#x27;s the battery they sent me.  I&#x27;ll keep it!</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Walgreens and have been using for at least a year on same battery. It works really well, especially on facial hair, like in between eyebrows, etc.</li>
    <li> Love this little thing - I had to replace one I&#x27;d had for years and was glad to find it here. It&#x27;s very handy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for coarse hair!</li>
    <li> It works, but I wouldnt buy it again, its perfect for ppl who get like rashes from using a razzor... but I dont think its the best thing ever</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work with the trimmer heads. Maybe it&#x27;s the angle of hair coming in, but it won&#x27;t trim the hair. It does still work without the attachments pretty well. However, without the attachments it can pull at the skin a little. I use it to clean up the edges on haircuts now, and getting something else to serve this device&#x27;s original purpose.</li>
    <li> Like this better than the regular removers as the curve in this one makes it much easier to use and reach all areas.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT... I bought it for my girls❤️</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bikini touch for 7 years my first one. Just worn out! Had a hard time finding it.But good old amazon came thru.Hurryed up and order two.Trims the bush great!I love it.Will order two next month.So I never run out again and not stress over where I&#x27;ll find one again! Good old Amazon! Thank you!</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I got it very quickly - within a few days of purchase. When I received it &amp; installed the included battery, it would not work! After 5 minutes of trying to put the battery back out &amp; in, then it worked. However, even when it was on it would not trim at all. None of the blades worked even the original that&#x27;s attached. I am going to return this item and buy a different brand. VERY disappointed for sure.</li>
    <li> Did not work AT ALL. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work quite as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Very good product . Was getting it from Walmart. But they quit saling it :(. So thanks,:)</li>
