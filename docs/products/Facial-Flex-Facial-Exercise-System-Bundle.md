<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> waiting for results... and more motivation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 I&#x27;ve been using my Facial Flex for about 5 years now and could really see a difference after about 6 months.  It has tightened up my jowls and chin waddle very well.  I use it twice a day for 1-2 minutes while I&#x27;m showering or dressing so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my routine at all.  I&#x27;m using the 14 bands now and saw a big jump in appearance after a few months with them.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don&#x27;t criticize anyone who gets a face lift, but why go through the pain, hassle and cost if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> As I am approaching 40, I noticed my face sagging and wanted to derail it. I ordered this device from QVC and have been using it twice a day for a minimum of two minutes for the past year and love it. I have not had problems with lines. My jaw line has improved considerably, my cheekbones have risen and my overall muscle tone in my face has improved. I am an addict!</li>
    <li> This tightened my mouth sphincter in about 20 minutes of use, even though I look like a TOTAL borg. And I only have one hand!    MERLE DIXON FOR GOVERNOR!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks now and am now using 2 of the 6 oz bands together with will increase resistance and they last about 5 days before breaking.  I am amazed at my face, it has only been a short time but I see a little improvement and lift, I can only imagine what it will do over time.  I do 2 sets of 70 in the morning and then again at night.  Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using since I received it, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is grate! Ever since my last tooth fell out from all the crack I smoked, I have serched for some way to fill the void in my face. Well this is it! Not only is it attractive as a beauty aid, but it works to keep my ears symetrical. After only a few hours, my lips were strong enough to bite into an apple! Snapping turtles got nothing on me now!</li>
    <li> If you use this device like you are supposed to,you will see a difference in about 7 days.I don&#x27;t know why some of these reviewers are making fun of this product.If you want a facelift and can&#x27;t afford surgery(I can&#x27;t) then buy this product-it really works,you have to be consistant and use it every day.The results are amazing.</li>
    <li> I can really feel it workout my facial.muscles at first i didnt feel anything but i didn&#x27;t give up and after like the 3rd day i can tell it was working. I do 100 reps in the morning and 50today at night and it works great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ask me how I came across this product because I certainly wasn&#x27;t looking for it.  I&#x27;m 43 and I like my face just fine.  Still, we all age and like many, I&#x27;m a bit vain and am willing to fight for my right to be as gorgeous as I can at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Facial Flex on December 8th (today is the 17th) and have used it twice a day since.  First, I used the 6 oz. bands but after two days it seemed to weak for me.  Still, I noticed during the day when I turned my head left or right that my neck and chest felt a little tight.  Not in a bad way. It just let me know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the third day, I switched to the 8 oz. bands.  I was able to do about 120 reps and today I am using one 6 oz. band and one 8 oz. band.  I was going to buy the 14 oz. bands but figured I&#x27;d use up what I have first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resistance with the two bands is now perfect.  I know because when I&#x27;m doing my exercises, I can almost NOT compress the device all the way.  It feels good when I take it out.  I really feel it.  And my face and neck are already showing definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just so I wouldn&#x27;t be tricked by my eyes, I took a picture of myself on the 8th before using it and today, remarkably my jawline is more defined, my neck looks *stronger* somehow, my chin is more squared and I&#x27;m just plain pleased.  Yes, I can see myself using this product well into the future.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what 6 weeks brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great benefit it my lips.  They&#x27;re plumper, juicier and lipstick glides on with fewer lines showing now.  As a note to anyone who&#x27;s using it, take this tip: besides moisturizing beforehand, be sure to moisturize your lips, too.  I put on good ole Chap Stick in the black tube before using it to keep them supple while \\&quot;working out\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At work yesterday someone asked if I was getting more rest during this holiday season.  My face looks bright and has a glow.  A good facial scrub and a masque once a week and I&#x27;ve got my regimen down.  How easy is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about making the purchase but you just aren&#x27;t sure, take it from me.  You don&#x27;t have to be 50 or 60 to see dramatic results in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very tempted to use it more frequently but I&#x27;m sticking to my twice a day for 2 minutes.  I set the timer on my microwave and go at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO looking forward to my 44th birthday next month.  If I get results like these in just days, another full month should be incredible.  I&#x27;m taking a new picture every week just for my own proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;One more note --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after posting this that the product I have is the Facial Flex Ultra but I doubt the product is so significantly different as to make a difference in results.the purchase but you just aren&#x27;t sure, take it from me.

Amazing product!  ------------  One more note --  I noticed after posting this that the product I have is the Facial Flex Ultra but I doubt the product is so significantly different as to make a difference in results.</li>
    <li> This is the stupidest product I have ever bought. It did nothing for me. Except gave me a headache. Is this a joke? Or gAg gift? Is this patented? Did nothing for my chin or mouth. What a piece of crap! I want my money back!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The plastic device broke for no logical reason.  Cheap plastic in that manufacturing batch?</li>
    <li> Gave wife for birthday. She hasn&#x27;t used.</li>
    <li> Great product using for years</li>
    <li> The marketing is very good. But it is hard to do this every day. It takes time and I do not see any results.</li>
    <li> I received my Facial-Flex as was advertise and am happy with my purchase, I have been using it 3 weeks and already seeing&lt;br /&gt; results</li>
    <li> I was using facial execise videos, however I found it to be too time consuming and I didn&#x27;t see the results that I have hoped for. Then, I came across facial flex and decided to give it a try. I love it. Now, I am going to be 42 years old and I look like I am in my early to mid 30s. Before using facial flex, I was so concerned about my nasal labial folds which were becoming noticable. After a few weeks of using facial flex, they look like they are gone and I even got a compliment from a former co-worker that I look younger so it has to be working. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am seeing some results, I need to continue using it, hopefully for better results!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. I have some issues with TMJ and it is helping with that also</li>
    <li> Great!  Love it!  Everyone should buy this for firming up around chin and mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and I&#x27;m starting my preventative beauty regime as early as I can! A stitch in time as the saying goes...!  Anyways, it&#x27;s a simple product to use, but I felt that the 6oz and 8oz bands weren&#x27;t doing enough for me (it felt too easy and I couldn&#x27;t feel adequate tension, maybe it is because I&#x27;m younger and my face muscles are firmer, I don&#x27;t know...) so I got some 14oz bands off of eBay for supercheap and have been using them since!     Very happy with the product and the results so far and I can highly recommend this product to anyone thinking of trying it out! :D</li>
    <li> People are so immature. Yes, the product looks goofy, we get it, but leaving whole bunch of fake reviews is not funny, it&#x27;s just plain stupid.&lt;br /&gt; That being said, facial flex does work. I had a smile line that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and that was the only reason i paid $50 for something like that. Within two day, I am not kidding, the line was gone. No only that, my upper lip got fuller. It does make your face,neck and even tongue very sore at first, but just like with any other workout,you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt; I am very happy with the results and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPD. I realized I forgot to mention that I am 26 y.o. with no skin aging issues just yet. I sleep on my right side, so overtime I got a crease along the smile line. I am still using the product, along with putting a ban-aid on the sides of my mouth when i go to sleep, so I don&#x27;t get that line back. I also put petroleum jelly on the area(believe it or not it fills wrinkles in temporarily). If I forget to do my routine, the line comes back obviously, so it has to be done every day.&lt;br /&gt; I noticed that some people ordered the product based solely on my review and were disappointed with it, so I thought I&#x27;d edit it and let them know what kind of issue it fixed for me.</li>
    <li> It does work after a few weeks</li>
    <li> So far so good.. I see the difference..</li>
    <li> Just started with the product. 2 days, and I  already feel the diff!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this tool for about 10 years now...I am 55.  I also have used the Carol Maggio exercises as well as the FlexEffect program...I use a bit from each for the eyes and upper face.  It has been my experience that this tool is the best of them all...I have no wrinkles nor jowels around my lower face. (people say I look like I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s...I also eat well and get lots of sleep)  As for the upper face, there are some exercises that I use from Carol&#x27;s book and also Deb Crowley&#x27;s program, but just a few. I have no lines on my forehead, nor any lines in between my eyebrows, and I believe, thanks to these other programs.  There is no question in my mind that this device works extremely well, and I will not be without it. The science behind muscle building is solid, and the face is no exception.  I encourage anyone who is willing to put in a relatively small amount of time to purchase this!</li>
    <li> I love this face exercise tool. I am used to exercising my face by performing daily facial fitness exercises. This tool makes it so much easier b/c it targets many areas by performing just one exercise. I have been using the facial flex for 3 weeks now, changed the band strength after week 3, and I can see a difference in my face - my face muscles are stronger and the skin is a lot firmer. Very happy with my decision to purchase the face flex.Thank you for making such a smart tool!</li>
    <li> I started using this product eight years ago becuse I had noticed &#x27;jowles&#x27; and a double chin coming in fast.  Well those are long gone and everyone thinks Im 45 intead of 56! When I went to my 30th HS reunion my friends were all amazed at the way my face looks and I said: Facial Flex. This product requires commitment every day -I do it twice a day watching TV.  Is part of ones workout routine, just for the face.  If you give it the time and combine it with a good serum and skincare regime you will see a major difference. I use mine with 3 and 4 bands to increase the resistance but everyone has to find their own comfort zone.  Flex away!!!! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product coz of the rating... Now I hear that the reviews are spoof..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check this \\&quot;15 of these 5-star reviews are spoofs\\&quot;, April 25, 2011 By 42bunny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It may look like this product has a high number of positive reviews, but looking closer you&#x27;ll see that 15 of the 5-star reviews (all posted on Nov 30, 2010) are comedic, or rather, attempts at comedy. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmmm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 29th Aug 2012 - I heard from two separate friends that my lower face looks swollen.</li>
    <li> Check out this link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but I&#x27;m currently looking at various facial devices for at home use.  This one is way cheaper at QVC.  Seems to be the same thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this system for a week. Was expecting more items to come in a bundle for the amount paid.  Now I have to purchase the face cream separately.</li>
    <li> Does help to keep your facial muscles in shape.  I have been using this product for a number of years and finally needed a new one!</li>
    <li> I have been using this device twice a day, 120 repetition each time, have gone from resistance band 6 to 8.&lt;br /&gt;No results. I took a before and after picture and my face looks worse!  with all of these reviews stating they got  results in two days or a week  I start to believe they are using a different product. BIG disappointment.</li>
    <li> This works. Lines going from mouth to chin made mr look old before my time.  I drive long distances &amp; use in the car for last two weeks &amp; already see great improvements (about 50%).  I expect contined improvement in the next couple of months.  Keep the bands tight. I moved up to a the next level after first couple of days &amp; glad I did. Better for me working those muscles. Highly recommend. I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s . Arrived on time, no damage &amp; smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they cheapened it up to the degree they did but now its not worth 2 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so much WISH they would bring it back to the standard it used to be.  I still have the original one I bought way back and I&#x27;m still using it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one for my husband who is recovering from Bell&#x27;s Palsy and he couldn&#x27;t even use it because it was sticking when he tried to use as prescribed and it was horrible.  It wouldn&#x27;t slide smoothly like mine does and he hated it !  Too bad they ruined a really good invention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Dont even think about getting a Flexaway System !  When this one didn&#x27;t work out for my husband I tried Flexaway and it was WAY worse !  Since this is a review for Facial Flex,  I won&#x27;t go into it but you can&#x27;t even get your money back from Flexaway !!!</li>
    <li> Facial flex is a miracle product: it firms your face and makes you look 20 younger.  Easy to use .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is great for my wife.. she had one and wore it out .. I didn&#x27;t know where she got it so I looked on Amazon and found this one,  Just like the one she had..works great for her....</li>
    <li> very disappointed in this product. bought in March received in April, have to say i didn&#x27;t use everyday just a couple of days a week,but truthfully  about 30 days worth,,, of course the last time i used it, it broke.. it broke on the seam where the bar slides between the plastic.and of course it broke after the warranty was up.and of course the actual company that produces this thing will not honor there warranty of a year because i didn&#x27;t buy directly from them..So buyer beware it can bresk in your mouth while your using it,,,i was not hurt....and of course i didn&#x27;t think to check on retun policy till now and of course to late to return which wouldn&#x27;t hav done me any good (30 day return)</li>
    <li> It is good gadget to tone up the mid-lower face, muscles around the mouth,  jaw and neck. Skin will be firmer and less wrinkled after a few weeks. But I have expeimented  that Facial Flex is no way to be used alone. Facial exercises are absolutely necessary. The whole face must be exercised. Because, FF alone will target only some muscles, others will remain undeveloped and it will make your face look weird and unbalanced. And somehow, if done alone, it can overdevelop the muscles around the mounth, with undesirable results. So in the end, great tool, but watch out, facial exercises are a  total must.</li>
    <li> I fell my facial muscles work after the third time Using the facial flex.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m recommending the product to my friends.</li>
    <li> The concept was good, but I can&#x27;t say I noticed any results even after using everyday for more than a month.  I&#x27;ll continue for another&lt;br /&gt;month before I throw in the towel.</li>
    <li> I love how my face and neck feel after having done the exercises.  I&#x27;m starting third week with the 8 oz band, doing 2 sets of 50 reps.</li>
    <li> I got the facial exercise system a couple of weeks ago based on the good reviews and the videos.  Unfortunately I am not able to use it. Every time I try to use it I have a gagging reflex.  The max reps I have been able to do is 5!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday twice a day, I can tell after a month my cheeks are more angular. I can finally see my cheekbones and my neck fat has lessened. Overall a great product, I will recommended this to anybody.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too much work and I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice, waste of money... I can&#x27;t believe I fall for this and bought it; a laughing matter indeed!</li>
    <li> I have used this many years ago and am happy to find it again.</li>
    <li> After trying the Facial Flex I think you would really have to be dedicated for a very long time to see any results.  I can feel it pulling the mussels in the face and neck.  BUT - If you tilt you head back a little - make a really big &amp;#34;cheesy grin&amp;#34; and then pull your lips in to an O shape it pretty much does the same thing.  My suggestion is to try that for a while and if it&#x27;s helping - then the resistance rubber bands would give you better results.</li>
    <li> This works!  Love it and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without!  Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> appears to be working well</li>
    <li> I have been using this for one week now. Had to up the resistance to #14 the first week. #6 and #8 use alone just wasn&#x27;t enough. I exercise daily and follow the DVD instructions. The results are yet to be seen.</li>
    <li> I really like this device.  I can feel my&lt;br /&gt;jaw and neck getting a work out and&lt;br /&gt;I like how they feel afterwards.  I do it&lt;br /&gt;twice a day...  Keeping my fingers crossed&lt;br /&gt;for some results, only been doing it for a week now...</li>
    <li> works well, just keep at it.</li>
    <li> I tried this for one day and I think it probably works as it should. However, I have a pretty bad TMJ injury from a car wreck that no longer really bothers me. But after using this, my TMJs hurt for four days later, which triggered a bad headache. So do not buy if you have any kind of TMJ problem as it really works those joints, which I am not so sure is anatomically good for anyone if it hurt me this much. At least it does not seem to cause the joints to pop or grind.</li>
    <li> I requested the Angel Lift product and got this one instead.  This is old school compared to the Angel Lift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the Facial Flex, but the little elastic bands break  every other day, as if they were old??</li>
    <li> Works great but leaves a &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; fold and dark mark on the sides of mouth. The idea is good but I wish I can find one that I can just put inside my mouth without it putting pressure on the sides of my mouth. Also this one is small and do not target the buccal fat. This works best on muscles closer to the mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for three weeks so far, and things are changing.  My cheeks had started to look concave on either side of my mouth.  I&#x27;ve noticed that is definitely not presenting as it was, they are starting to fill out.  I am truly amazed.  I am up to 40 reps twice a day.  I really think there is something special about this product, and it certainly beats getting plastic surgery with the expense and the risks.  Very easy to use.  I would recommend getting the package with the DVD as that was very helpful.  Give it a try.  I can only speak for myself, but you may be surprised by the results.</li>
    <li> hi! i rcvd my order in good condition..so far i enjoyed using it twice a day..its so fantastic! My skin feels so firm and great..i love it! and i want to say thank you very much bec you made this facial flex..i highly recomend it to everyone who wish to make their face more lifted up and firmer!</li>
    <li> I ordered this not to make me look younger but I wanted higher cheeksbones without the surgery and looking at the way the product worked, i felt confident that I would get the results and it did so. I was looking at some of the other reviews and I am not in my 40&#x27;s+, in fact, i just turned 30. I will continue to use the product to sculpt and define my cheekbones.</li>
    <li> It may look like this product has a high number of positive reviews, but looking closer you&#x27;ll see that 15 of the 5-star reviews (all posted on Nov 30, 2010) are comedic, or rather, attempts at comedy.</li>
    <li> Very nice! I can feel my facial muscles getting firmer. Too soon to see actual results, but I imagine they will be subtle. I think this product will be more effective at slowing down the clock rather than reversing aging. This is not to say theres a problem with the product -- I just dont put much faith in anything that promises to turn the clock back. If daily use helps my face maintain firmness over the years, I&#x27;ll take that as success. Its simple to use, and the concept of it makes enough sense to incorporate it into my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t give an honest review as I have not been faithful to use it. However, it was sent and received just as promised.</li>
    <li> Wanted to return it but could not figure how. I never used it. When I got it just thought it was dumb.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend.  This began causing other wrinkles and unusual muscle development.  Cosmetrics work much better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, not enough time to evaluate but feel it will be great.  Feel tightening in the facial muscles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used facial flex for years, I gave one away, and lost another, which necessitated this purchase. With consistency and commitment you can keep a chin lift at bay! I use 16 oz bands, and twice a day, so long as I don&#x27;t slack off on doing the exercises 2x daily, I&#x27;ve kept my result for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Facial Flex for about 14 years.  I am now 62 years old. For the first month or two I didn&#x27;t feel much difference, but kept using it.  Shortly thereafter I was putting on my base makeup and I could feel a difference. There was a definite firm muscle surface and my skin felt much firmer. I&#x27;ve never stopped using it.  It takes  a minute a day to keep my face firm.  I don&#x27;t have jowls and there is no flabby skin. People assume I&#x27;m a decade or two younger than I am. If you want to stay looking your best with a firm face (and no plastic surgery) this is the way to do it!</li>
    <li> I see improvement with my facial muscles and my nasolabial folds.</li>
    <li> My wife has used these for years and finds them useful as advertised and fairly well made; until now.&lt;br /&gt;The last two she has purchased had to be returned .&lt;br /&gt;They are larger than previous models; more difficult to fit in the mouth and not made as well .&lt;br /&gt;She indicates the back and forth motion is not as smooth on these new ones and the plastic connector is flimsy and subject to breakage very easily.&lt;br /&gt;She would not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;They should return to their original design.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Great! I seen results in my third week of using it. I&#x27;m 50 years of age and I gained weight in my face and I seen this on you tube .  Like I say it&#x27;s Great you will not be wasting your money.</li>
    <li> I love the Facial Flex!  After this short time I have already seen a difference in the nose to mouth lines.  They&#x27;re almost gone!!  This was worth every penny and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend purchased this for my birthday (my idea, thank goodness).  I say it&#x27;s interesting because of how utterly ridiculous it looks when you&#x27;re using it.  You have to make sure that your upper teeth are completely covered by your upper lip and that your mouth remains in an oval shape.  The device is cradled between the corners of your mouth, and you squeeze the device inward.  You might drool.  Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be doing my facial workouts in private.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many users, at first I was skeptical, especially for the price.  The cost seems a bit high, and I felt guilty that he paid so much.  I wanted this particular kit for the instructional DVD, which wasn&#x27;t necessary.  There are a variety of videos on a popular tube site if one is interested in looking them up under \\&quot;Facial Flex Ultra\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s a simple gadget and comes with an instructional booklet.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days so I can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s efficacy, but I can definitely feel those muscles working, particularly in my cheeks and jawline.  I have no doubt that I will see results.  My main objective with this device is to tone my neck muscles.  The instructions say to lean slightly forward and keep your chin level to benefit this area, but I was feeling very little flexing there.  I felt much, much more neck muscle action when I tilted my head completely back (and less salivation).  I do as many repetitions as I can in 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews before I added this item to my wish list, and I noted one from someone who complained that the cream was spoiled.  I can confirm this by saying that the cream smells very spoiled and I won&#x27;t be using it (hence 4 stars).  The cream has a dense, waxy texture and has a light brown, bubbly appearance (according to images from the DVD, it should simply look pinkish in color and creamy).  This item was sold by Pro Therapy Supplies and fulfilled by Amazon.  It comes with a small supply of both 6 oz and 8 oz resistance bands (20 each) which need to be replaced weekly per instructions.  I found that I needed to double up on the 8 oz bands.  Replacement bands can be found both on Amazon and eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wish to forgo the DVD and cream, you can purchase this item at a lower cost here:  [[ASIN:B000K7J1PI Facial Flex Ultra]] .</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Facial-Flex Facial Exercise and  Advanced Renewal Creme! I feel like I am seeing results already.</li>
    <li> Hey, We all have our secrets....this one is Mine. I don&#x27;t use it as much as I should, so I will report any changes when I use it more often,</li>
    <li> Great I love it; didn&#x27;t use cream only once I have very sensitive skin and it felt itchy when I put it on; the facial flex I love; CD was informative and helpful.</li>
    <li> I just started using the device. Appears to work well.It is very easy to use. I can feel the facial muscles exercise.&lt;br /&gt;I will issue another review after I have used for some time and can attest to results.&lt;br /&gt;Also the cream provided with the device is outstanding. I love it.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone, I just wanted to let you know that I am a real person and this is a real review.  I have been using this little facial flex device twice daily for about a month and a half and OMG I can totally see a DIFFERENCE!  I am almost 33 and I was beginning to notice facial sagging in my cheeks (the very beginning of jowls).  I bought the Carol Maggio exercise DVD (which is great, but totally time consuming) and was looking for something else that took less time to do each day!  I stumbled upon this product, read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I am totally noticing tone in my face...especially around the mouth and jaw line. It&#x27;s amazing.  Honestly, everyone should get this mouth piece.  I do 200 exercises a day morning and night... right after I brush my teeth.  It&#x27;s convenient and it works.  Get it.</li>
    <li> Arrived before expected delivery date and was exactly as described. I have been using the facial flex for over a month now and I noticed that the laugh lines are going away....they were going past my mouth, but happy now cuz they are only a little past my nose...very pleased....now waiting to see if my forehead has results....</li>
    <li> Doing repetitions with this devise split my mouth. The Tension caused my lips to split in the corners. Let my mouth heal and tried again and the same thing happened. Useless for me.</li>
    <li> Came down with a case of shingles on my face the day I received my facial flex&lt;br /&gt;  I just started using it this past week so I guess you will have to wait</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product at all.  I see no benefit in using this product.  This might be something for a younger woman to start using, say in her thirties and make it a lifelong regimen, when the skin still has elasticity so by the time you get to be my age (56) you might see some benefit.  My skin is not as firm, therefore I find that it actually stretched my skin rather than tighten it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Facial-Flex Facial Exercise mouthpiece through Amazon last January. Used  the device regularly for a few weeks and thought I was  beginning to seeing results when inexplicably and unexpectedly the device snapped. This was particularly disappointing, not only because, for the price I paid, I was hoping to get a more durable device, but also because it broke while I was overseas for a few consecutive months.  The device&#x27;s failure in the middle of my traveling means not only a financial  loss, but also an unwanted interruption of my regimen.I won&#x27;t be able to get a refund or a replacement until I ship the damaged item back, which I cannot form overseas and international shipping coasts to get a new device are outrageous. So I regret to say that will probably never know whether the device actually delivers what it promises. What I can tell for sure is that it is very very poor quality and that customer service has been unable to provide any assistance other than an automated message.</li>
    <li> The rubber bands and the cream are expensive. Just a few bands came with my &amp;#34;total package&amp;#34; and a small container of the cream. I felt it was deceiving because a &amp;#34;total&amp;#34; package, to me, should have included more of everything, not just small sample containers.</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use. Can feel results &amp; see the results quick.</li>
    <li> i have only used it for two weeks and it broke!? I dont know what to say. I didnt even try it long it enough to see results.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t take time to write reviews, but this product is great. The DVD that comes along with it is realllllllyyyyy outdated, and they dont use the best models --- BUT the little exercise machine really works. I got lip injections 2 years ago, and I felt like my lips were drooping. I&#x27;m only 26 and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I just felt like my mouth was out of shape -- it was starting to get hard to smile! So I got this, and it is REALLY a miracle for me. My top lip plumps from it, and its getting easier to smile fully again.  I feel like my whole lower face is more toned. I even used to scrunch up on my chin a little when blowing a kiss, and now that&#x27;s going away too! Get it, it&#x27;s easy to do, and it works.</li>
    <li> After using it for a week, I can feel the changes! I tried a lot of facial product: face cream from cheap to expensive; massage cleanser; different face rollers... Among all the products I used, this is the most effctive, sustainable  healthy tool ever. Every morning I did only one set of 70 in the past 7 days. I noticed a visible change this evening! I am so happy with it! Definitly will use this tool in the furture because this is soooo easy to work on.  The cream seems very thick, but that&#x27;s no problem, I use my own facial cream. The most important part of this product is let your face get right exercise. It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> This REALLY WORKS!  Lost a lot of weight and the sagging skin, without the fat in my face created horrible aging!!!!!  I didn&#x27;t want anything invasive so tried this.  Wow! in 2-3 weeks saw significant improvement!!!  It is a bit pricy, but the results are TOTALLY worth it.</li>
    <li> but I think this may be worth it.  I am diligent about using it - I did so every day until I went on vacation, then it was less frequent, but I think it works.  Have not really had it long enough yet to tell.  My daughter has used it for years and she looks amazing at 48.  Of course I did not find out about it until I was over 65, so we&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> I saw some improvement after a week, you must follow the instructions well for it to actually work. But i&#x27;m happy to see that it did something :) going to keep using it !</li>
    <li> I just love my Facial Flex Exercise System. I have used it almost daily since receiving  it and it works like described</li>
    <li> I had owned one previously from several years ago. Sadly I lost it. This one is bulkier and does not move as smoothly. I wish I had the old one!! Made much cheaper the it&#x27;s previous version.</li>
    <li> I was excited waiting for the product to come and it took a bit longer than other products that I ordered. I watched the video online how to use it but it is very difficult to put in my mouth properly. I tried too many times still couldn&#x27;t put in the way was showed. Finally I trimmed it abit as recommend so it can fit in my mouth but when I did that it got worse. I haven&#x27;t have chance to use it therefore I really can&#x27;t tell if it works or not.</li>
    <li> seems to work but you have to use it reg</li>
    <li> so I don&#x27;t expect immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;With time it should help and certainly is non-invasive!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this beauty gadget so much, just in love with it and what it does for my face and neck</li>
    <li> I want to improve the muscles in the lower jaw and neck. Hopefully, this tool will help. It&#x27;s too early to tell yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 15 years and now there&#x27;s a new design that enables you to transport/change the rubber bands much easier whereas mine stretches the bands too much because they need to go over the wide ends so it wears them out faster for that week.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, I never really needed to worry much about sagging as I&#x27;d been fortunate to have young looks for most of my life, but now that I&#x27;m over 60 I&#x27;m seeing the turning point! ha ha So, after trying other methods that failed me, I saw this in my closet and decided to revisit it and I must say, with exciting results!  Within just a couple of weeks I was definitely seeing some improvement and my brother thought it was because I&#x27;d been on the Paleo diet, which I&#x27;ve pretty much eaten for at least a year now, so I knew that wasn&#x27;t it.  But didn&#x27;t want to fess up yet.  Since I have the earlier model, I don&#x27;t have their cream, never did.  So I&#x27;ve been using Spectrum&#x27;s Coconut Oil that makes your skin youthful again.  My jowls are starting to dissipate after about a month and the sides of my face have lifted considerably.  Even my best friend noticed after just two weeks use and I hadn&#x27;t told her anything! I&#x27;m getting her one for Christmas. Once I hit the 12 week mark, they say you should see the resounding difference, and when people ask me, I&#x27;ll probably want to tell the world because once I know about something that works well, I like sharing the good so others can too. Make sure you follow the DVD instructions and you&#x27;ll be exceedingly happy with your results.  I didn&#x27;t have the DVD years ago and I feel that if I had, I would have stuck with it for sure.  Wishing you the best results ever! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL NOTE: I wasn&#x27;t seeing results as quickly as anticipated on my neckline.  So recently, I started \\&quot;kneading\\&quot; just under my chin line (using my pointer fingers up to my first knuckle) from just under my chin working out to underneath my earlobes at the same time exercising my face to 120 reps.  (The Neckline Slimmer for 2 min. 2x-3x daily helps as well.)  Also, I doubled up on my rubber bands w/in 2 weeks, using 2 - 6oz. bands instead of the initial recommended 6oz. for 3 months as I was looking for more immediate results and got it.  Everyone&#x27;s different, so it&#x27;s your call.  I fully expect to be doing my \\&quot;happy dance\\&quot; by Christmas - hope you do too!  Yo!</li>
    <li> I have been using facial flex for 16 years.  I am 59 and people think I am 48.  It really helps to tight your skin.  In order to get results continuously you need to do it for 2 minutes in the morning and 2 at night.  Start with the less strength rubber band, go to the middle one and, finally, just use the 14oz (that is what I use - the 14 oz).  Follow the instructions from Facial Flex and always do the exercise with your chin up.  I have seen videos on the internet saying that you can do Facial Flex while you do other things and it is not true.  Stay in front of the mirror and do it for the 2 minutes.  I do not use any nightcream at all.  I always put vitamin E liquid in my lips before I do the Facial Flex. At night after the facial flex I put also the vitamin E on my face.  Facial Flex is about doing it right (2 minutes morning / afternoon without skipping).  Sometimes I let it go for a week and I clearly notice that my skin becomes not so firm.  So use it always and forever.  I know people that have done plastic surgery and who do not have the skin I have.  I am sure it is the facial flex.  Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in FEB 2013 -&lt;br /&gt;it worked well then in November Broke (the small white nob) -&lt;br /&gt;so cannot use anymore -&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return and get a replacement -</li>
    <li> Should be zero stars. Though I did NOT purchase this on Amazon, beware of this device, it causes swelling of the lower face, aggravates the jaws, creates mouth lines, and even worse - see this official report:  [...]  I suspect the good reviews of this product are fake and please read all the other reviews carefully. There are a few people really telling the truth about this. It should be taken off the market.</li>
    <li> I admit that I was skeptical when I bought this device. But after just 2 weeks or so, I can see and feel the difference. My jaw feels tighter already and the skin under my chin/neck is slowly firming... less &#x27;turkey neck&#x27; in my side profile. I&#x27;m soooo happy this actually works and plan to use it everyday. My goal is to use it 2-4 minutes twice a day, but I average 3-4 minutes once a day and when I can get a second session end - great. Tip: with each inward flex of the device, I simultaneously press my tongue firmly to the roof of my mouth and back teeth. Hope that makes sense, but when I do this, I can see the difference with the neck muscles. Not sure, but I think that might be giving me results faster. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have only had the product for a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t really review it for results. I can say that the item arrived quickly with good instructions and enough bands to get started for the first several weeks as described. The facial creme included is also a lovely quality. I am 62 with sagging around mouth and chin and smile lines deepening, so am anxious to see if real tightening will occur.</li>
    <li> Yes, I got package. Thank you so much I trust at all. Good equipment that i used a lot for exercise facial would  be great works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a facelift by any means but it is effective. I have really noticed a difference in my jawline and jowls. The exercise is super simple and only take minutes a day. Make sure that you use a lip balm and curl your lips in according to the instructions.</li>
    <li> All I can say is \\&quot;IT WORKS!\\&quot; Just follow the simple directions, takes no time at all. I am 59 and was noticing awful sagging in my neck. I noticed a difference in the jaw line quickly (2 weeks) 4 weeks huge improvement in turkey neck. I so wish I would of taken a before and after picture.</li>
    <li> Love this little device.  I have only be using it for a week so it&#x27;s to soon to see results.  My friend has been using it for two months and wow, what a difference.  Her results were the reason that I got this.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone because I had gotten one years ago &amp; loved it.  It arrived on time &amp; they were very excited &amp; said they noticed results immediately.</li>
    <li> I used this every day for several weeks. I upped the bands to the next level too. I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I have it in wrong? But I noticed no difference in my jowls or cheeks at all. I also watched a video of how to use it on QVC and I think I was using it correctly. I don&#x27;t have really bad jowls, but I&#x27;m 52 and they are there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently using this and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Use when your suppose to and see results as much as u can do like a typicall work out Saw it on qvc years ago I bought one and  my friend asked to borrow it when they saw it borrowed it forever had to buy a new one. I knew i wouldnt get it back and after being in someones mouth :) it was always sold out on qvc I knew Amazon has everything so I came here signed up just for this product love it I look fabulous</li>
    <li> I purchased the facial flex system. It arrived on time as promised.  I&#x27;m really happy with the quality of The Flex. It was much stronger than I thought, very well made. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for over 3 weeks and I can feel it working already.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the changes it will bring in 2 or 3 months.  Well I&#x27;ve always been happy with the things I bought from Amazon so I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
    <li> At first, I did see a pretty profound line on 1 side of my mouth when I first started using this product, but that was because I would pucker my upper lip, which the instructions tells you clearly not to do that. I view the DVD again to learn how to use it and the line is dramatically decreasing now. I use Collagen cream with this, and I believe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s helping the line iron out as well. I will continue using every day, no more complaints.</li>
    <li> I like the device I use two rubbers to increase resistance. What is really poor is the cream, I think Facial- Flax sent me a very old stock. The cream has a thick rubbery substance I can&#x27;t spread it on my face it won&#x27;t stick and it smells funny. I don&#x27;t recommend the cream AT ALL you can&#x27;t use it. Facial-Flax better make a quality cream rather then a cheap cream it ruin the product it self. It&#x27;s possible Facial-Flex sent me a very old stock of cream I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and like it very much. This purchase was a gift for a family member.</li>
    <li> It make sense that exercising your face is good for your face. You have to look in the mirror to make sure you are targeting the right muscles. This part was kind of tricky for me but the actual problem is that mine broke on less than a month of using it. The plastic just crumbled in my mouth. So although it was a simple way to work out your face, it&#x27;s a lot of money for a product that broke so soon. I wonder what kind of plastic they use that just crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I did not get my Facial Flex from Amazon.com, but thought I should share this info about the product. Mine broke right in half just after three weeks! This company would not refund but wants to send a replacement. We&#x27;ll see if that ever happens. Be careful where you order from. This is basically a piece of junk, although facial exercise DOES work!</li>
    <li> I purchased the facial flex ultra about 3 weeks ago.  I do yoga facial exercises so I know exercise on the face works to some extent.  After using it for a couple of days the inside of both cheeks had abrasions and hurt.  I thought perhaps I was using it wrong so I reread the pamphlet and watched the video again, but I was using it correctly.  Maybe it&#x27;s my anatomy, I know I have a small mouth.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t use this because it causes abrasions. I do think it&#x27;s a good concept.  Do they really need to make the ends of the part that goes in the mouth so big?  Did anyone have a similar experience with this? Really disappointed.  Update:  The abrasions were caused by a virus that was causing canker sores in my mouth and the Facial Flex just aggravated it at the time.  I&#x27;m using it now with no problem.</li>
    <li> I just received the Facial-Flex last week. It&#x27;s packaged very nicely and the video really explains how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how easy it is to use and I&#x27;m seeing some results already. What a deal! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have gotten this product. I&#x27;m a very passive person, and I used to have to force myself to smile and make other expressions so that I could work the muscles in my face. But with this product, all of that can change. I never have to smile again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.... will be better once I get the stronger resistance bands, but was disappointed when I realized I could have saved a lot of money and done the same exercise using my fingers in my mouth for resistance I believe and w/ a lot more resistance than the bands provided.</li>
    <li> This facial exercise does works, and I can see a big improvement in my face</li>
    <li> I can feel my mouth and jaw muscles are really working during exercise. But it&#x27;s too early to see the results yet.</li>
    <li> The facial flex is a great product and really does work.  However, the price here is for a \\&quot;kit\\&quot; which includes \\&quot;advanced renewal complex cream\\&quot;. The cream arrives spoiled.  A replacement tub of cream sent to me by customer service is likewise spoiled.  (By which I mean the cream is the consistency of hard wax and smells bad.) The maker of the product has responded to my emails on this topic indicating that the maker KNOWS their cream is spoiled/defective! They are offering me a mere $8 \\&quot;refund\\&quot; for the spoiled cream. (Their own website sells this cream for $16.95.)  If you check out the facial flex on the QVC website you will see that they sell the facial flex WITHOUT the cream for a much cheaper price ($33, I think) - and they even throw in another set of 14 oz. bands (worth another $8.)  I bought the kit on Amazon from this seller specifically to try the cream, and I obviously wound up wasting my money.  Don&#x27;t get ripped off here.  Buy from QVC instead.</li>
    <li> I do as many repetitions as I can in two minutes twice a day (morning and night). I&#x27;ve been doing it for a week and my face already looks tighter. I also applied the cream to my face twice a day right before I exercised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, definitely unique.</li>
    <li> I love it , however I BROKE 2 of these from normal use. One even broke in a week after normal use. Hoping they send me a new one soon</li>
    <li> Do not buy this piece of junk. Here is how it will work for you. Youwill use it for about 4 weeks and then it will break in your mouth. evidently thats as long as it can last.&lt;br /&gt;Then you will call the compamy and they will send you another and that one will break in 4 weeks. Then when you call for some answers they just say \\&quot; we  are trying new products and we will refund you money...which they will.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good facial tonig product go to Flexaway.com and use a really good product.</li>
    <li> The product was used and they never said it was. It was missing one of the items in side, and again I thought I was buying a brand new product, with everything included . This seller is deceptive and dishonest. I will warn my family and friends away from ever buying from them.</li>
