      <li>product came in good shape and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I like that it is so easy to use and that it pre-measures the needed amount in the cup at the top.</li>
      <li>Refreshing taste - mouth feels clean</li>

      <li>I use this before bedtime, and it actually removes additional debris from my teeth as I swish it through my mouth, and leaves my mouth feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>My dentist insisted that I use a daily flouride treatment because my teeth are full of cavities and prone to decay.  </li>
      <li>but my dentists checkups are short and sweet after using this and a pre brush.</li>
      <li>I particularly like this product because it is alcohol-free and because of its flavor - cinnamon.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>If you want all of the cavity protection with none of the torture, I highly recommend Act</li>
      <li>Yes a little spicier but better working longer lasting results in this Cinnamon Flavor.....</li>
      <li>You have to see it in action.  </li>
      <li>So far no cavities and I could not be happier.</li>
      <li>Hard to find overseas in the stores but always available from our Amazon team.</li>
      <li>I wish the toothpaste industry would get away from the mint flavors or at least make them mild.  </li>

    <li> Refreshing taste - mouth feels clean</li>
    <li> What I love about this product is its availability in cinnamon flavor.  I&#x27;m just not a fan of mouthwashes that taste horrible and then leave the inside of your mouth unable to taste anything for the next meal or two.  Scorched earth technique to your taste buds.  If you want all of the cavity protection with none of the torture, I highly recommend Act Cinnamon mouth rinse.  You&#x27;ll LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Have a hard time finding in stores.  Good price.</li>
    <li> This is the only site where I could find cinnamon flavor ACT fluoride rinse.  It does not appear to be sold in stores any more.</li>
    <li> The product is priced right, has and excellent cinnamon taste, and I rinse with it after brushing. So far no cavities and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I have used cinnamon flavored ACT for years. Love it. It really does fight plaque. I only like the cinnamon flavor. So glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Hard to find overseas in the stores but always available from our Amazon team. My family loved the taste and performmance of this product since 1997</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivery was as promised.</li>
    <li> A good deal, can&#x27;t even find in the store anymore</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the bite it used to, but still the only fluoride rinse flavor I like.  Must not be very popular though. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the brick-and-mortar world.</li>
    <li> It works i guess, and what can I say? It&#x27;s mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t burn the mouth. I recommend this to anybody needing mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Great product for after brushing. Use a mouth wash before brushing since the pre rinses are being taken off the market. Don&#x27;t know if the stuff really works but my dentists checkups are short and sweet after using this and a pre brush. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended and I love this mouthwash! Thank goodness they brought back the cinnamon flavor, I don&#x27;t like any other flavors.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist said it&#x27;s the best thing out there for what it does.  It didn&#x27;t take me too long get used to the taste, and I rather like it now.  A box of six with free shipping lowers the cost of the ACT Anticavity Cinnamon Fluoride, alcohol-free &amp;#34;rinse.&amp;#34;  A little.  I have no complaints.  And that nifty cup built into the top of the bottle?  It&#x27;s really cool.  You have to see it in action.  You squeeze the bottle and the pump line goes to the top of the bottle where it shoots the &amp;#34;Fluoride Rinse&amp;#34; to one side or the other of the cup.  When you reach the &amp;#34;fill to here&amp;#34; line on the cup, you stop squeezing.  A perfect dose every time.  It&#x27;s neat.</li>
    <li> I like the Cinnamon flavor the best and ACT b/c it was recommended by my dentist. It helped a &amp;#34;pre-cavity&amp;#34; go away!! :)</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash available love the cinnamon taste. My Dentist recommended it. I can get it locally here in Chicago for about $ 4.30 .</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist, and works great.  But I just wish it would not have the annoying amount-dispensing limiter.  I end up removing it before use with pliers each time to avoid the annoyance.</li>
    <li> Yes a little spicier but better working longer lasting results in this Cinnamon Flavor..... Sure like everything else manfactures claim no benifits between flavors.</li>
    <li> Everything went very well.</li>
    <li> My dentist insisted that I use a daily flouride treatment because my teeth are full of cavities and prone to decay.  My saliva is not plentiful, and I couldn&#x27;t use the leave-on flouride toothpaste that he recommended, so I use this instead.  I do believe that my oral health has improved as a result.  I use this before bedtime, and it actually removes additional debris from my teeth as I swish it through my mouth, and leaves my mouth feeling clean.  Cinnamon is a good flavor.  I use it every day.  The instructions are to put a measured amount in your mouth and swish for at least 30 seconds, then not to eat or drink anything for half an hour.  This particular product has an especially easy to use measuring device built onto the mouth of the battle.  I use a little bit less than the full dose, and one bottle will last a month or two.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and have had great checkups. I love the cinnamon flavor. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in good shape and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find cinnamon mouthwash in stores anymore.  I went online by chance to see if it was available, and it was!  I do purchase the six bottles at a time for my husband and myself - it&#x27;s thriftier this way.  I&#x27;ve used this mouthwash for years and will continue to do so (hopefully) for years to come.</li>
    <li> My dentist has recommended that I use a product like this for the last number of years.  Lately the cinnamint flavor has been hard to find and the mint flavoring does not agree with my stomach.  Good product, but a touch pricey.</li>
    <li> This is a very good mouthwash, providing sodium fluoride for cavity protection. I particularly like this product because it is alcohol-free and because of its flavor - cinnamon. While many mouthwash products are available in any drugstore, all seem to be mint, with this ACT variant among the missing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great stuff in your waterpic.</li>
    <li> I like that it is so easy to use and that it pre-measures the needed amount in the cup at the top.</li>
    <li> love it... great product and fabulous delivery system of the mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this rinse for over 10 yrs now. It was recommended by my dentist. It works, because I haven&#x27;t had cavities since. I bought It from Amazon because a lot of the stores do not carry cinnamon anymore and I hate all those mints. It turned out to be a lot cheaper too.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> I wish the toothpaste industry would get away from the mint flavors or at least make them mild.  this is a great product for those of us (gasp) that don&#x27;t like the mint flavor</li>
