      <li>I gave 4 stars in hopes that my first impression (lighted mirror) was correct that the product is great.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>

      <li>LOVE THIS MIRROR.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this thing</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with the Floxite 7\\&quot; Magnifying 8x Lamp</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>it is my favorite travel mirror.</li>
      <li>It is like taking a flashlight and shining it at your chin and trying to use that light to put on make up!  </li>
      <li>They both love them.</li>
      <li>It is not terrible, but if you are purchasing this with the hopes of looking at your throat, go with the 5X.</li>
      <li>The mirror swivels much better and is easier to position.  </li>
      <li>If you want to keep your teeth and gums healthy, be more thorough when flossing.</li>
      <li>Now she can spend even more time in front of the mirror.  </li>
      <li>Better for travel weight.</li>
      <li>They are, however, of excellent quality while they last.</li>
      <li>; model broke after many years of abuse, so I went on Amazon hoping to find a replacement.</li>
      <li>It would be better if it had a non-magnified side also</li>
      <li>I have traveled with mine for many years and find it easy to pack and assemble.</li>
      <li>To make sure not to much makeup is applied and looks good and no tell tale sign of lines of makeup</li>
      <li>It has two different light variations and it is perfect to see close without looking like you are peering into a circus mirror.</li>
      <li>The others I&#x27;ve bought have the light in the mirror - clearly it&#x27;s better to have it beneath.  </li>
      <li>Good quality and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>The item was delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>easy to pack.</li>
      <li>separates easily for packing.</li>
      <li>Travels easily.</li>
      <li>Primping made easy ...</li>
      <li>a new advertising campaign \\&quot;The make up mirror that is so good</li>
      <li>The 8x is strong enough,the light is pointed where you need it.</li>
      <li>light is cheaply made and the light may or may not make connection and work.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it, the light blinds you, the mirror is cheap quality</li>
      <li>I purchased this mirror for personal grooming, and it seemed great.  </li>
      <li>Outside of that it&#x27;s a great mirror for makeup application, or closeup work.</li>
      <li>The difference is the way the light is focused on the area you want to see.  </li>
      <li>The mirror does rotate around the light</li>
      <li>The option that was important to me was the wall.</li>
      <li>The diffusers don&#x27;t diffuse the light at all.</li>
      <li>Fortunately.</li>
      <li>Another quibble is that if you are, for instance, attempting to focus on your eyebrows, you will find that the light source is not sufficient for portions of your face positioned near the top of the mirror, so you kind of need to adapt to the mirror, rather than it accommodating you.</li>
      <li>My light bulb has burned out and I have a spare, but I do not know how to replace it(I can&#x27;t find the instructions).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was the perfect gift</li>
    <li> Primping made easy ... the magnification WITH lighting is the key to the success of this product in my opinion. The base makes work hands-free, the light focuses on the areas of interest ...and the magnification lets you see things BEFORE they become noticeable, enabling you to apply makeup quicker and more accurately.  The company has great customer service and after MANY years of use the switch failed, they sent me a new switch free of charge.  I have traveled with mine for many years and find it easy to pack and assemble. Beware, when your family/friends see this, they likely will want one ... at least that&#x27;s been my experience, which makes gift giving VERY easy ... another side benefit of this produce ;)</li>
    <li> This is the best magnifying makeup mirror.  I have bought several, and find this one is less \\&quot;blinding.\\&quot;  The others I&#x27;ve bought have the light in the mirror - clearly it&#x27;s better to have it beneath.  I would totally recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> For this item I wanted to be able to assign 2.5 stars. A completely middling score, but that&#x27;s not available, so I rounded up in the spirit of niceness. It&#x27;s not a bad mirror. If you just have examining your face close-up as a goal, it works quite nicely. It&#x27;s when I got task-oriented that things got tricky. Biggest problem: The base is too lightweight to keep the mirror/lamp portion from pulling the whole thing over. This will not be a problem if you have the perfect flat countertop which happens to be at the perfect height with a perfectly located electrical outlet to plug into. But, if like me you need to position it on the windowsill next to your sink, for proper height, you might find that once you stretch the cord (not even to full stretch,) that just the weight of the cord will cause the whole shebang to tumble off the windowsill into the sink, most likely taking your underarm deodorant and neti pot with it. I could get it more or less stable on a lower surface by angling the mirror just so, but at the expense of my back, because then I had to work from knee level and it wasn&#x27;t comfy.   Another quibble is that if you are, for instance, attempting to focus on your eyebrows, you will find that the light source is not sufficient for portions of your face positioned near the top of the mirror, so you kind of need to adapt to the mirror, rather than it accommodating you.</li>
    <li> My Rialto ballast quit working in 1 1/2 years.  Company will not give a replacement. It worked well but not long enough for the price of $135.</li>
    <li> This is my second mirror in about 15 years.  This is the only way to do a makeup or face maintenance.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lighted mirror that was compact for travel that would provide adequate light for applying makeup.  This mirror would work great for performing surgery on eyes, but the magnification is too strong for applying makeup.  I return it for a refund and haven&#x27;t found one yet to meet my needs.</li>
    <li> process was handled well. product was as expected except light bulb burned out after one weeks use. spares were included</li>
    <li> This is by far the best make-up mirror I have ever owned.  My relatives who have seen it agree.  I left it in a hotel in Indiana this year.  Someone in Indiana is enjoying this mirror since the hotel said it was gone when I called them a few hours after I left.  I don&#x27;t blame the person for stealing it.  It is that great.  They could have a new advertising campaign \\&quot;The make up mirror that is so good, people steal it.\\&quot;   I called the company because I did not know the exact magnification I had.  They were wonderful.  Once you own it, you won&#x27;t be able to use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is the third Floxite mirror I have purchase in the last 20+ years.  I got this new one when my last mirror started to crack a little on the base.  I use my old mirror to travel with and my new one is set up on my vanity.  I wear glasses and can&#x27;t see a thing without them so this mirror is great.  When I have my glasses on and use the mirror you see things that you didn&#x27;t know were there,  troubling, but helpful.  Two of my friends have purchased this mirror after using mine.</li>
    <li> Had this same mag. mirror for about 6 years, never traveled without it. I couldn&#x27;t, cause I couldn&#x27;t see to put my make up on without my glasses. So when it broke, I looked pretty bad for awhile, till I could get this in...it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> This mirror is just perfect for seeing those pesky hairs and anything you need to see close up (I&#x27;ve even used it to see splinters that I couldn&#x27;t see with my reading glasses). I love it!</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine as far as how it is made, but not fine when you go to use it. It hits right in the eyes even with the shield in the round opening for this problem. Wish I had not purchased it. I had the original mirror and loved that by Floxite. Sometimes it is better to leave a good product alone than tinker around at the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the same Floxite mirror which I&#x27;d had for years.  My 2 year old grandson accidently knocked it off my dresser and broke the mirror.  I love this mirror and use it daily for putting on makeup and tweezing my eyebrows. I tried buying a different brand but took it back to the store because it didn&#x27;t measure up to this one.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I needed a decent magnifying mirror for travel, which seems a hard item to find. Based on other reviews I hoped this one would work for me but it&#x27;s going right back. It&#x27;s very heavy, which is a concern for me for travel, but more importantly the lighting is truly awful. If you sit in front of this mirror with your face centered, the only part of your face that is lit by the lamp is your chin and the tip of your nose. The diffusers don&#x27;t diffuse the light at all. If, as a kid, you ever held a flashlight up under your chin while telling ghost stories, the effect is the same. Two thumbs down.</li>
    <li> This mirror has pros and cons.  I got the 8x magnification which works fine for my 53 year old eyes!  But it is fairly small.  It would be better if it had a non-magnified side also but it does not.  Most annoying con is that it sits very, very low so I have to prop it up on a basket to be anywhere near my face for makeup application.  Otherwise neck would be very strained.  The mirror does rotate around the light so you can get your face lit well where you need it.  Not sure if I will keep it.  Gonna keep looking.</li>
    <li> Works great for putting in contact lens and for applying make-up. I really like that you can use it on a flat surface or wall mount it.</li>
    <li> I am only giving it one star because the mirror was shattered on delivery and the product had to be returned.  It was much lighter than I expected.  My girlfriend has one and she loves it, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m ordered one for myself.  I do intend on ordering another one.</li>
    <li> This make-up mirror is a replacement for the same that I had for about 10 years!  I LOVE this thing, the lighting and magnification is perfect, so happy I was able to find this brand again!</li>
    <li> I got this mirror about 5 days ago.  The light wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I kept fiddling with it and sometimes the bulb would come on and sometimes not.  I tried to take the bulb out and replace with one of the 2 spare bulbs included.  The spare also would not work.  I tried seeing if I could fix the connection but finally gave up.  I put it at the foot of my recliner and meant to package up and return.  But the recliner squished the mirror and it broke.  I was so angry.  I only had it a few days and had it worked as it should have I know it would not have gotten broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw the whole thing in the trash as it isn&#x27;t worth replacing the mirror if the light doesn&#x27;t work and I can&#x27;t return it now.  I bought a different mirror that I will attach to the wall this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This light is cheaply made and the light may or may not make connection and work.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a disappointment.  Floxite has been a great product over the years but it has changed.  This mirror was too small in size.  The mirror made one dizzy - distortion.  The wire sparked.  The mirror was returned for a second time.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for checking your face for little details like unwanted facial hair, etc.  I use it a.ot.</li>
    <li> It works VERY well, but be warned: unless you are used to 8x magnification, it is somewhat of a shock to see your facial features so huge.  But these aging eyes appreciate the help!</li>
    <li> I like this mirror very much and have had it for several years. My light bulb has burned out and I have a spare, but I do not know how to replace it(I can&#x27;t find the instructions). My husband actually cracked the plastic trying to twist off the mirrow part. Any help will be appreciated. I keep my mirror on a chest that is just the right height for me. I have other mirrors of this type, but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned. Does a great job of illuminating &amp; magnifying. I like the two different lenses to simulate natural or artificial light. Would have been nice for the maker to include extra bulbs as they cost more to ship than the replacement bulb cost...an annoyance. I suggest checking at a Battery+Bulb store. (Neither Lowes, nor Radio Shack had them.)</li>
    <li> This is my third Floxite magnifying mirror. They seem to last about 6 to 7 years before the base goes kaput. They are, however, of excellent quality while they last.</li>
    <li> This is my third one. I have purchase the magnifying mirror as a gift for my family and friends also. Service was great, price is fair, I couldn&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
    <li> While the magnification is good, there is a several second pause after the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; switch is clicked before the light comes on.  I e-mailed Floxite about this and the response I received was, &amp;#34;Several people have mentioned this so I don&#x27;t think it will cause a problem&amp;#34;.  Also, the mirror is so loose it falls off the stand.  Irritating to say the least.  I have somewhat fixed the problem by wrapping tape around the stand to create a tighter hold.&lt;br /&gt;My first Floxite lasted several years, the second only a year so I have definite concerns about this one.  If I could find another mirror like this made by any company other than Floxite I would switch immediately.  They seem to have a monopoly on this particular type mirror, and their quality seems to be going downhill..</li>
    <li> Ordered it to replace an old one and it still does exactly what I needed to do</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY THIRD FLOXITE MIRROR. IT IS NECESSARY FOR ME, AS MY VISION DECREASES, I CAN STILL APPLY MY MAKE-UP FLAWLESSLY.</li>
    <li> I have had this same product for many years and so far am equally as satisfied as I was with the previous on which I dropped and the arm broke....I would recommend this product and manufacturer....</li>
    <li> I had this mirror in the 5X for about 12 years and LOVED it. Sadly, it recently met its demise. I decided to try the 8X as a replacement.  The only thing that I do not like it that when you look in your mouth with it ( to check a sore throat, etc.) there is some distortion. It is not terrible, but if you are purchasing this with the hopes of looking at your throat, go with the 5X. This model is great for make up and tweezing if that is all you need from it.</li>
    <li> I purchased my original Floxite mirror at BB&amp;Y....guess I just got lucky first time.  When the unit broke (many years later) I returned to the store to get another one, but they no longer handle this model.  I ended up buying two different mirrors and returning them because they just weren&#x27;t the functional quality of this unit.    The difference is the way the light is focused on the area you want to see.  The other units provided ambient lighting, but if you&#x27;re counting wrinkles, that just isn&#x27;t good enough.    I was very glad to find the same model on Amazon.  I did move from 5X to 7X, but that was just personal preference.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2, returned both. Light bulbs loose, delay lighting up, unable to get bulbs tightened. Owed a Floxite mirror for 15 yrs, never a prob. Will contact Flixite directly before reordering.</li>
    <li> Excellent magnifying aid - helps me see eyelashes that have fallen in my eyes that I cannot otherwise see.  Many other good uses.</li>
    <li> I have bought 4 of these.  Gave one to my best friend, one to my mother, one to my sister and kept one for myself.  I travel with this mirror and once you get over the shock of all you can see in it, you will LOVE IT!  :)</li>
    <li> The item was delivered very quickly. Although it appeared to be packaged very well, the mirror glass was broken in a couple of places. Fortunately. I had an old Floxite mirror which had a broken base. I was able to put the old mirror on the new base. It does not fit exactly as it should, but it will work.</li>
    <li> My first one fell apart after more than 10 years, This one is a little smaller than my first. Oh well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of difficult to assemble. My wife uses this as her travel mirror. She has poor eyesight due to a medical condition. The light part of this unit is pretty much useless, the mirror part is OK and it fits very eaily in an overnight bag.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s old 5&amp;#34; model broke after many years of abuse, so I went on Amazon hoping to find a replacement. Saw the 7&amp;#34; model, she loves it, sooo much better. Happy wife &#x3D; happy husband.</li>
    <li> I got the 8X to replace my very old Floxite 5X which i love so much that i taped all the broken pieces together after it fell and broke a few years ago.  I am still trying to get used to the 8X stronger magnification, i hope it will not be a problem.</li>
    <li> Replaces one I had for years that  broke.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS MIRROR. HAD ONE BEFORE BUT WITH AGE It broke a wire inside, and I broke the glass. Was so pleased to be able to find another one. I gave it 4 stars as the base is very light and the mirror is heavy so a flat surface is needed. The older one that I had users batteries so it was more stable. Outside of that it&#x27;s a great mirror for makeup application, or closeup work. Amazon has great customer service.</li>
    <li> Love this. Couldn&#x27;t live without it. Totally worth the price</li>
    <li> I dropped and broke the old mirror I had had for years. I was delighted to see Amazon had the same model available. This mirror is very effective for applying mascara, lipstick ec or locating a foreign object in your eye. It folds for travel. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> thought this might be too large but it is just awesome both the light and the mirror are perfect for anyone who wears glasses for closeup  tweezing is easy too.  Great buy</li>
    <li> Being older, (82 yrs old)  I floss my teeth once or twice a day. But i do it very scientifically. You need the mag mirror to do this. Amazing how that white stuff builds up at the gum line daily. If you want to keep your teeth and gums healthy, be more thorough when flossing. This is my second one of these mirrors. Last one lasted me over five years and i use it daily. Great for ugly hairs in your nose as well. Tried a 10X once and it is too much. 7 or 8 is plenty for magnification.</li>
    <li> A great lamp set , bought them for my Daughters. They both love them. A good set , works great, Would recommend them to anyone , a great make-up mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased three Floxite 7\\&quot; Lamps, one for me, and two for my friends.  Now we can all talk about what we see.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to see up close.  To make sure not to much makeup is applied and looks good and no tell tale sign of lines of makeup</li>
    <li> It is exactly like the mirror I had for 10 years and finally burned out, and less than buying directly from the manufacturer. The 8x is strong enough,the light is pointed where you need it. My old one was 5x.</li>
    <li> This is the best magnifying mirror I have ever bought, the magnification is just right you can see everything. I will purchase another one just to have it in case it breaks, that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Have bought several for myself and for gifts...</li>
    <li> Just like 1 I had purchased several years back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for personal grooming, and it seemed great.  Unfortunately, the light burned out after 5 turn-ons.  I&#x27;m a busy person (like everyone else)so it&#x27;s taken me a little while to lookup and order a replacement light.  I decided to write this review since I&#x27;m online to do that today.  I gave 4 stars in hopes that my first impression (lighted mirror) was correct that the product is great.  I would have given 5 stars if I thought my light was just a fluke, but I seem to recall other reviews with similar experiences.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item over 10 years ago. The clarity on this mirror is NO comparison to the original.  The view is contorted and it is difficult to see clearly without shifting yourself constantly.</li>
    <li> I had this mirror and dropped it.  I had looked for its replacement for some time and was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It has just the right amount of magnification for me.</li>
    <li> I love my new Floxite 7&amp;#34; Magnifying Mirror.  It is easy to use and I can actually see clearly in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is just right...not too large that it is difficult to focus on what you need to.&lt;br /&gt;I had one previously and recently broke it (my fault) so, this is a replacement.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I bought this same mirror 25 years ago.  The only reason I had to get a new one was I dropped it and broke the glass.  I highly recommend this product.  You wont be disappointed.  Travels easily.</li>
    <li> Great lamp set. I put the mirror of the 7&amp;#34; on the 5&amp;#34; lamp set.  It is not so heavy and works great with a little propping.  Better for travel weight.</li>
    <li> This will be my mother&#x27;s 3rd lamp ... But she likes it so we&#x27;ll get another and expect to replace it again with the year. The base COULD be a little more durable!</li>
    <li> When the lamp box was opened, the lens was not in the bubble wrap. I need to contact Floxite now to see if I can get the missing lens. It was for a gift and the person just told me today. Not happy about the whole deal.</li>
    <li> The 7&amp;#34; mirror with 8x magnification is so much better than my old 5&amp;#34; mirror with 5x magnification.  Very easy to use and the lighting provided is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite mirror for makeup.</li>
    <li> I use this for identifying unwanted facial hair.  It has two lenses, one for day and evening.  The light placement is just a little awkward for me but it serves the purpose.  It&#x27;s not too big for storage. I gave it a three star because I was expecting to see a lot that I was missing with my very small magnifying mirror with no extra lighting that I was using.  It did show a few areas I was missing but less than expected.</li>
    <li> I owned Floxlite before so after hubby broke mine I had to rush to locate another. No store in my area had one, so thank goodness Amazon has the variety and ships so quickly because it arrived in record time. This mirror accomodates both wall and counter. The option that was important to me was the wall. It has two different light variations and it is perfect to see close without looking like you are peering into a circus mirror. The construction is solid and I find no negatives to Floxlite.</li>
    <li> Liked the amount of magnification.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Now she can spend even more time in front of the mirror.  To me, the mirror&#x27;s too scary to look into.</li>
    <li> We have owned the older version of this mirror and really like the new improvements. The mirror swivels much better and is easier to position.  The manufacturer&#x27;s customer service is excellent if you should ever need it.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with seeing certain areas, but it may have had a lot to do with my glasses and eyes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted.  Excellent quality, delivered on time.  Good Follow-up.</li>
    <li> This was the saddest excuse for a make up mirror I have ever seen!  It is like taking a flashlight and shining it at your chin and trying to use that light to put on make up!  Poor light, poor mirror, don&#x27;t waste time ordering this one.</li>
    <li> it is my favorite travel mirror. this is my second one. maybe a tad top heavy occasionally but the light and the 8x strength makes up for it. easy to pack. separates easily for packing.</li>
    <li> i preferred the older model of this mirror. this light is placed so that it hurts your eyes to leave on long enough to complete make-up application.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and for a good price</li>
    <li> Good magnifying mirror.  You can see Everything!</li>
    <li> this is the 3rd purchase of same.... this time though the magnifying mirror is not as strong as the previous ones??? other than that i have glaucoma and need a stronger magnifying mirror all is ok..... but thanks for asking...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mirror/light set.  I wish they still made the 10&amp;#34; one, that was the best, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to this one now, and it does the trick.  I use it for tweezing, face cleansing, putting on make up, brushing my teeth.  The old 10&amp;#34; one lasted for over a decade, same bulb, until I broke the mirror while travelling.  I expect this new one to last that long as well.  I think this is the best lighted mirror company I&#x27;ve ever found, and even though it&#x27;s not my favorite 10&amp;#34;one, I still give it 5 stars because it performs that well.</li>
    <li> The magnifying part of the mirror is great, but  the bulb burned out within a week and it is difficult to find a replacement bulb locally. It is costly ordering a replacement bulb via internet and paying shipping and handling for a tiny bulb. Thought about sending the mirror back for a full replacement but decided the same thing would happen again with the bulb because it has happened with previous floxite lamps. In good light the mirror works great, so I am keeping it to use without the bulb. I like the flexibility of the stand and the magnification is good with no distortion.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this mirror only magnifies 8x. That&#x27;s plenty of what I want to see to put on makeup. I had purchased one with twice that magnification at a local store and returned it because when I looked in it one eye was the size of a baseball in that mirror. It scared me!</li>
    <li> This mirror is the best I have had.  It is easier to use that mirrors with higher magnification.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very well built. Long cord helpful. HOWEVER package arrived without lenses. I had an old light so I used those but dissapointed. Check your package carefully</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, the light blinds you, the mirror is cheap quality and it just isn&#x27;t a very well designed product.  I returned mine for a refund.</li>
    <li> excellent quality, very good price</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the Floxite 7\\&quot; Magnifying 8x Lamp Set Mirror.  This is my second Floxite 7\\&quot; and this one is much more sturdy than the first one......on this one the mirror with stay in whatever position you place it in, a definite plus!  I would definitely purchase it again, next time in a slightly stronger magnification, say a 10x, if that is available.</li>
    <li> I am over 60 and this is my third high magnification mirror and it is the best one yet.  My magnification needs have increased as I have aged and it is a joy to find such a good product at very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The light is actually blocked somewhat where the mirror attaches. The light appears splotchy on your face.  Also didn&#x27;t come with the lens to look like \\&quot;evening\\&quot; lighting.  Was too top heavy also. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really liked the mirror and lamp. I have used one for years and this was a replacement!! I have to have it and it is so easy to travel with!!</li>
    <li> Returned this mirror after trying to use it for a week.  The distortion level was so great, I was unable to tell if my make-up was on smoothly or not.</li>
