      <li>love that i&#x27;s cruelty free and</li>

      <li>This product is sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>The results for my hair include smooth and shiny without frizz.  </li>
      <li>Unless you want to exhibit it as a display because you paid so much for it, don&#x27;t expect spectacular results.</li>
      <li>Just smooth and conditioned.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Every product is fabulous and does just what it says.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I use a Matrix voluminizing shampoo as an alternative, but I must always use the Angel Wash conditioner with it to achieve a good, soft result with body.</li>
      <li>It practically acted as a toner after the first wash and conditioner, immediately removing some of the yellows!!</li>
      <li>$60 for both shampoo and conditioner is not that unreasonable, but now that my family has grown with the addition of a baby it makes me much more aware on what I spend on things that are not necessities.</li>
      <li>I have very fine straight hair.  </li>
      <li>Clean and conditioned just from a shampoo?</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants tangle free, healthy hair.</li>
      <li>With this shampoo-conditioner combo I also add Anti-gravity and Full Again.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been wonderful - thick and creamy.</li>
      <li>And (!) they smell sooooo good.</li>
      <li>It is not a bad shampoo or conditioner, it is just not for me.</li>
      <li>This makes your hair so soft and shiny and so easy to manage,  I just love it and would recommend it to all.</li>
      <li>I also figure I spend so much at the salon, why not spend the extra to keep looking great for weeks after my visit?  </li>
      <li>Does not weigh down the hair and keeps it in great condition.</li>
      <li>Fortunately have found one now that really is gentle. . .  </li>
      <li>Yes, they&#x27;re a bit pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found any other to work as good.  </li>
      <li>am enjoying the products the most I have spent on shampoo &amp; Conditioner however my hair really deserved them.</li>
      <li>I first used this product at the salon, after I got my roots done.</li>
      <li>They have most definitely helped in that area.</li>
      <li>and she has seen first hand what these products can do.</li>
      <li>I have super fine hair that is fragile.</li>
      <li>Forever my favorite shampoo and conditioner, I only wish it were easier to find in salons/stores here in Washington!</li>
      <li>and then I&#x27;ve followed it up with Kevin Murphy&#x27;s mousse (can&#x27;t remember exact name).</li>
      <li>Makes my hair super soft!</li>
      <li>I really regret not returning the product when I first saw how watery the shampoo was but my biggest regret was purchasing from this seller.</li>
      <li>So lovely to treat your hair to Kevin Murphy shampoo &amp; conditioner - the rich formula smells very slightly like oranges &amp; chocolate.</li>
      <li>Shampoo and conditionar don&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down, hair is full</li>
      <li>But I could really tell when I put the Angel rinse in my hair.</li>
      <li>Im not going to lie to you, I&#x27;m gonna keep it real</li>
      <li>The conditioner seemed to help a little but the shampoo did not seem to make a difference in my flat, fly away hair.  </li>
      <li>I do much better using Kevin Murphy wash and rinse than with any other product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>A very small amount will provide a good lather; ditto with the creme rinse.</li>
      <li>But since mine isn&#x27;t like that at all, she sent me to the hair whisperer who highly recomended angel wash and rinse to me.</li>
      <li>This duo keeps my hair soft and with a little styling product it seems to do much better with holding a style throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this duo for several weeks and like it very much.</li>
      <li>&quot; and the conditioner is very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>This is no better for hair than most shampoos.  </li>
      <li>I am a believer and will keep using this until I&#x27;m an old bitty and don&#x27;t really have much hair left.</li>
      <li>I will never use a different hair product as long as Kevin Murphy products are available.</li>
      <li>Not every seller, certainly, but please check back in and let us know who sent this shampoo to you from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;miriam</li>
      <li>Not heavy.</li>
      <li>This set is a MUST for blonde ladies and gentlemen, real or otherwise.</li>
      <li>Recieved early than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I did not lose any coloring and even my hair stylist was surprised.  </li>
      <li>After years of coloring and damage, my hair now feels soft and silky again.</li>
      <li>For fine delicate colored hair such as my hair - this Kevin Murphy duo certainly does the trick.</li>
      <li>Its a little pricey but so worth the money since you dont need a lot of it</li>
      <li>Just enough conditioning to have hair soft without being greasy.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more from this product after reading the reviews but was disappointed as it wasn&#x27;t extraordinary at all.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine, thin, colored hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s weird because normally when shampoos clean your hair</li>
      <li>Hard to find, but worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Shampoo and conditionar don&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down, hair is full and then I&#x27;ve followed it up with Kevin Murphy&#x27;s mousse (can&#x27;t remember exact name). Just enough conditioning to have hair soft without being greasy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great. FYI, the same size, purchased separately, is $71.00, today, anyway</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!!</li>
    <li> jury still out on this product, just starting using a week ago</li>
    <li> This is a really nice shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.  I did not lose any coloring and even my hair stylist was surprised.  If you&#x27;ve used Kerastase, you&#x27;ll like this too.  And the smell is really nice...it&#x27;s just slightly scented.</li>
    <li> I want to thank those who took time to urge caution in that this shampoo has been &#x27;watered down.&#x27; Can you identify the company you purchased the shampoo from? In this way, the Kevin Murphy company can step in and protect the quality of the product and the integrity of their name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Angel. Wash in Prague, Czech Republic - a great salon that used this shampoo after  color and cut. It&#x27;s been wonderful - thick and creamy. I am so disappointed to learn that it&#x27;s being tampered with. Not every seller, certainly, but please check back in and let us know who sent this shampoo to you from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;miriam</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the quality, but it was not worth the price. Beware - I thought this brand was &amp;#34;naturaL&amp;#34; but the shampoo has several food dyes in it that are not of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sources. (Red Dye #40 for one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the conditioner did not detangle my hair. Not worth the price - going with something else next time.</li>
    <li> If this shampoo is counterfit they are doing a great job.  I have baby fine, thin, colored hair.  Have had thin hair my whole life and have tried a variety of products over the decades.  I love this shampoo...it gives my hair bounce and body.  I use it in conjunction with Boing styling creme.  Glad to have found these products!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product after reading the reviews but was disappointed as it wasn&#x27;t extraordinary at all.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. It is quite pricey but it lasts a long time. A very small amount will provide a good lather; ditto with the creme rinse.</li>
    <li> This product was extremely expensive.  It did no better or no worse than suave shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Unless you want to exhibit it as a display because you paid so much for it, don&#x27;t expect spectacular results.</li>
    <li> Angel Wash prices are a bit more than I would prefer to pay, therefore 4 stars instead of 5.  The results for my hair include smooth and shiny without frizz.  This product is sulfate free.  I just use a small amount even on my long hair so it lasts for several months.  Angel Wash was recommended by my stylist.  I would recommend to anyone who wants tangle free, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this duo for several weeks and like it very much. I have very fine, thin hair, which is difficult to style and keep the frizzies to a minimum. This duo keeps my hair soft and with a little styling product it seems to do much better with holding a style throughout the day. I haven&#x27;t found any other to work as good.  These are my results only!</li>
    <li> I love this wash and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love that this shampoo and conditoner is for both fine hair AND colored hair.  It works well and the fragrance is very pleasant.  I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair that is fragile. I also seem to have problems with shampoos and conditioners making my scalp itch.  But, the Kevin Murphy Angel wash and rinse leaves my hair shiny and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.  And even though it leaves my hair shiny, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling limp. My hair seems to stay in better condition, too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product line I have ever used. It makes my hair smooth and shiny. And it smells wonderful. I will never use a different hair product as long as Kevin Murphy products are available.</li>
    <li> This is no better for hair than most shampoos.  Fortunately have found one now that really is gentle. . .  this is not it, though</li>
    <li> This makes your hair so soft and shiny and so easy to manage,  I just love it and would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Love this and want to buy more.</li>
    <li> It is not a bad shampoo or conditioner, it is just not for me. It does add some volume but it dries  my hair.</li>
    <li> The Kevin Murphy products are incredible.  Yes, they&#x27;re a bit pricey, but worth every penny.  With this shampoo-conditioner combo I also add Anti-gravity and Full Again.  What a difference.  And remember a little really does go a long way.  Follow the instructions even if it seems like too little.  It&#x27;s not.  And (!) they smell sooooo good.</li>
    <li> Exceptional products for men and women!</li>
    <li> My very favorite product for my hair.  It shines like crazy and is very moisturized and manageable after using this product.</li>
    <li> This wash and rinse have made a believer out of me.  Worth the price because it is luxurious and leaves my hair looking and smelling great.  I also figure I spend so much at the salon, why not spend the extra to keep looking great for weeks after my visit?  It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally a dirty blonde, but I am currently coloring it to very pale/nearly platinum blonde. I first used this product at the salon, after I got my roots done. I was not scheduled for a toner (To \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the yellow-tone out), so one of the stylists put this in my hair instead of a regular shampoo. It practically acted as a toner after the first wash and conditioner, immediately removing some of the yellows!! It cooled the color after one time! The shampoo smells like \\&quot;Froot Loops\\&quot; and the conditioner is very soft and silky. This set is a MUST for blonde ladies and gentlemen, real or otherwise.</li>
    <li> Forever my favorite shampoo and conditioner, I only wish it were easier to find in salons/stores here in Washington!</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair.  The conditioner seemed to help a little but the shampoo did not seem to make a difference in my flat, fly away hair.  For the price, I would not buy the shampoo again, the conditioner maybe . . .</li>
    <li> For fine delicate colored hair such as my hair - this Kevin Murphy duo certainly does the trick. Does not weigh down the hair and keeps it in great condition.</li>
    <li> As described.  Recommended to my Mom by her hair stylist.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything except for Kevin Murphy.  Every product is fabulous and does just what it says.  Love, love, love KM products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kevin Murphy products for just over a year now after my stylist recommended I try them to restore my over processed hair. They have most definitely helped in that area. After years of coloring and damage, my hair now feels soft and silky again. My husband has even noticed the difference and once again loves running his fingers through my hair. There was a moment not that long ago that that simple action was nearly impossible. The scent is also wonderful. I have gotten many compliments on that from friends and family. The only thing I wish was different is the price. $60 for both shampoo and conditioner is not that unreasonable, but now that my family has grown with the addition of a baby it makes me much more aware on what I spend on things that are not necessities. Ha, I suppose with all the damage my hair has endured it has become a necessity... because this product actually works. Try it!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful!  I started it with my hairdresser and have been using it for over 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very good, lathers up well and makes me feel like I have more hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from the salon before and decided to buy it online to save some money. That was a big mistake. It was obvious the shampoo was a fake and had been watered down. In fact the shampoo was so runny and watery that it would continually leak from the bottle in my shower. I really regret not returning the product when I first saw how watery the shampoo was but my biggest regret was purchasing from this seller.</li>
    <li> Not sure about &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; reviews I read but both items were sealed and neither one seemed runny or watered down. Recieved early than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying the products the most I have spent on shampoo &amp; Conditioner however my hair really deserved them.</li>
    <li> So lovely to treat your hair to Kevin Murphy shampoo &amp; conditioner - the rich formula smells very slightly like oranges &amp; chocolate. Hard to find, but worth it.</li>
    <li> need more of this and cannot locate on line. It is too bad that there is not more to purchase</li>
    <li> love that i&#x27;s cruelty free and thats the reason I bought it</li>
    <li> Its an amazing product.  Its a little pricey but so worth the money since you dont need a lot of it</li>
    <li> I do much better using Kevin Murphy wash and rinse than with any other product I&#x27;ve found.  Sometimes I use a Matrix voluminizing shampoo as an alternative, but I must always use the Angel Wash conditioner with it to achieve a good, soft result with body.</li>
    <li> Im not going to lie to you, I&#x27;m gonna keep it real, I think I&#x27;m in love and I&#x27;m probably going to marry this product. This Angel set is awesome!!! I have fine hair that is also curly/wavy. Normally people who have curly hair have thick hair to go with it. But since mine is fine and curly, it doesn&#x27;t really curl, it just frizzes like crazy! So curling it means moving in slow for the attack so you don&#x27;t freak it out...but even that doesn&#x27;t work. I heard about this product from my sister who is a nail tech at a salon and she has seen first hand what these products can do. And after witnessing that she decided to try it as well and was recomend with the luxury wash. Which worked amazingly with her mermaid hair. But since mine isn&#x27;t like that at all, she sent me to the hair whisperer who highly recomended angel wash and rinse to me. I could tell immediately. I mean IMMEDIATELY. The consistency was different than regular shampoos. It was slow to come out of the bottle and didn&#x27;t Seem to want to seperate when I rubbed my hands together before I lathered up my hair. But when I put it in my hair it dispersed easily. It&#x27;s weird because normally when shampoos clean your hair I feel like it strips all moisture out of your hair and then you HAVE to put conditioner in your hair to make it &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; again AND THEN it weighs done my hair. I already fight with trying to get volume so that has never worked. But the Angel wash felt like it was conditioning my hair as well as washing it. So that was really different. Clean and conditioned just from a shampoo? Unheard of. But I could really tell when I put the Angel rinse in my hair. It smoothed out my hair and it felt really soft but not coated soft if you know what I mean. Not heavy. Just smooth and conditioned. I was like whhhaat?! I&#x27;ve tried lots of different expensive hair products from Unite hair care line to Purology and this was the first time I felt like a product actually got what my hair was all about. There is agod! I am a believer and will keep using this until I&#x27;m an old bitty and don&#x27;t really have much hair left. (Hopefully that never happens with my hair) but even then I would use it for the sheer smell of it. It smells great!</li>
    <li> keeps my hair soft, falling into place without hair dryer and has wonderful natural</li>
    <li> Think I was more impressed with this duo when used by my hairdresser.  Have switched between another shampoo after a few weeks</li>
