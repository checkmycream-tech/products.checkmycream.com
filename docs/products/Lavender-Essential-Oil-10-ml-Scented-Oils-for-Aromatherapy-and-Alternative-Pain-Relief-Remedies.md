<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great quality essential oil. Strongly scented, which indicates a high quality oil. It blended well with my carrier oils and creams. I love using lavender. It&#x27;s very calming and relaxing. I am happy to recieve this oil to review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m newer to the whole essential oils trend, I&#x27;ve only been using oils for about 3-4 months, but I have to say lavender is one of my favorites. This brand is a very nice quality oil, I compared it to a friends expensive brand oil and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. I love putting lavender oil in a hot bath or homemade body scrubs, and recently I started adding it to my bottle of Argan Oil (cause Argan oil stinks). I love this oils calming effects. Anytime I&#x27;m having a stressful day this is my go to oil! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I use various essential oils for lots of projects I do like homemade cosmetics, candle making, homeopathic remedies, etc. Lavender essential oil is my favorite and one I use often. I like to try lots of different brands of oils and this was my first time trying NES brand. I was able to get a discount on this purchase which was awesome. It shipped fast and was of the high quality I need and expect from the oils I use in my hand made products. The lavender smelled amazing and I would definitely buy again for my needs.</li>
    <li> I had heard about Lavender Oil, but never bought or used any prior to this time.  I really love it &amp; find it works so well for making me and other people, including my great grandchildren, go to sleep at night.  Just rub a drop on your hand &amp; wipe on your pillow case; or put a drop on a cotton ball &amp; place in your linen closet.  Will definitely buy from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance.  I am excited to try it.  I like all the benefits of it listed on bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil!  Works great, smells great!  I use it in the bath tub also.  Makes it so relaxing.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! Cant wait to make bath salts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started to dabble in essential oils and I was so glad I got a chance to try this Lavender Essential Oils. I haven&#x27;t invested in a diffuser yet, but its on my list. I read up on all the things that this beautiful smelling oil can do and I was amazed. I put some of the oil in the palm of my hands and took a big whiff and it gives you a wonderful feeling. In fact, it almost put me to sleep it was so awesome. You would think when the product contains the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that it would leave a greasy oily feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t. It soaks into your skin very fast so all you are left with is the lavender scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to bed, I put a couple of drops on my pillow case and I slept the best than I have in a long time. I have a dry patch on the side of my wrist that I had badly burned back when I was 16 years old. I slipped and fell and the side of my wrist  went onto the hot grill and it burnt pretty bad. Of course it&#x27;s been healed for years, but I put a drop on that place and rubbed it in, and it already seems a little softer. I&#x27;m going to put the lavender oil on it everyday and I&#x27;m hoping that the dry feeling will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found out another use from one of my friends. We both have dogs that are nervous wrecks when they go to the vet or groomers. She told me what she does is tie a bandanna around her dog&#x27;s neck and put a couple of drops of the lavender oil on the bandanna about 30 minutes before she leaves the house. Dixi really seems to be more calm when she gets to the vet or groomer. The next time I take my Lexi, I&#x27;m going to try to put a couple of drops on her collar and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I can tell that this is very good quality lavender oil and I recommend it for anyone that needs a little calm in their life.</li>
    <li> This is the best lavender oil I have ever used.  I would highly recommend it  I use it for many things especially adding a few drops to my bath is very calming.  This is a great product with super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great lavender oil. I was very pleased with the purchase. We use aromatherapy oils frequently and are always looking for high quality products. NES Lavender Oil fit the bill. Helps with headaches and is very calming. A+</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it! It comes in a dark amber colored glass bottle to help protect the oil and it has a rubber dropper spout. I use this in my diffuser and I put it on cotton balls that I tuck inside my pajama drawer. A little goes a long way and the oil smell wonderful all by itself or diluted. Overall I am very happy with this oil and am discovering new uses all the time!</li>
    <li> Use this every single time I take a bath; helps me to relax!</li>
    <li> I recently got into aromatherapy and was so excited to try this lavender oil. I&#x27;m not a huge flower scent fan and was worried this would be too strong for me but I was wrong. The smell is light and smells really good. I use it in my diffuser at night when my husband and I lay in bed. It has helped up relax so much. I&#x27;ve noticed I fall asleep faster with this oil. This oil is great for more than just aromatherapy. You can use it for first aid for relief from cuts, scratches, bug bites, and minor burns too. It helps cold sores, migraines, allergies, sinus congestion and more. I can&#x27;t believe I went so long not knowing about Lavender oil and all the uses it has. I love this stuff now and definitely will make sure I always have it on hand. *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I love lavender essential oils and this one is no exception! I love putting this in my essential oil defuser and making my whole house smell great! It really is great for calming down after a hard day at work! A little bit really goes a long way, so I have to be careful at how much I use at any given time! I have been using this NES brand for a few weeks and the bottle is less than half way empty! I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion. I love this oil and will consider buying more when this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> Love this Lavendar Oil!  I have used a number of lavendar oil products and this by far is my favorite.  Just smelling it when stressed makes me feel better.  Buy it now, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> This is one of the greatest oils I have ever used. I used it in mixing with lotions and making my own soaps. Also is very relaxing if you put a few drops in your bath.</li>
    <li> I liked this lavender oil. I use it when im feeling very stressed. The work i do requires a lot of patience and understanding when caring for the elderly. It comes in very handy on those rip your hair out, leave me alone kinda of evenings when you have 10 spare minutes just for yourself. Im glad i got to try it for free.</li>
    <li> I was pretty stressed out what with a big project at work and a 12 year home all day on summer vacation. A friend of mine recommended I try aromatherapy. I googled it and found that Lavender should help. I ordered this product (it was the most reasonably priced one I could find). I don&#x27;t own a diffuser but my friend said I could get the same effect by adding a few drops of the oil into a bold and pouring boiling water over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this every day for a week now and I honestly can see a difference. I&#x27;m less stressed and my son actually seems quieter and less bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again BEFORE my current bottle is empty!</li>
    <li> First purchase of this type of product.  I love, love, love it.  Scent lasts, I use on kindness and even on my wrists, etc.  will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used the oil to put on my temples when I got a headache.  Headache went away and didn&#x27;t come back so I was very impressed with the oil.  I would recommend product.</li>
    <li> This stuff helps with migraines and smells great. I either rub it on my temples or put it in an Epsom salt bath for relief and it works better than if I would have taken meds to get rid of my migraine.</li>
    <li> Love lavender oil! My favorite essential oil by far! Great product and company.</li>
    <li> How have I survived this long without this product? This was the very first time I have purchased any essential oils. I love the smell of Lavender, so naturally this was my first choice. After doing some research about Essential Oils, I got busy! Besides using in it&#x27;s raw/pure form, I got creative and made a room diffuser for my bathroom, I use it in my laundry and I made a fine mist sprayer to spray my pillows before bedtime.~~~ WOW~~~My only disappointment is I did not buy a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Lavender Essential Oil. It works so well with a few drops in my diffuser, or a couple of drops on a light bulb. I did experience a better nights sleep the first night I used it.  I also plan on making lavender scented sleep pillows for gifts. It&#x27;s so calming and relaxing, which, this mommie definitely needed more of! It doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve a nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I received this Lavender Essential oils the other day after a great promotional offer to test this out in my own home. I have just started looking into the different essential oils and natural oils for the home and body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the smell of the lavender! It reminded me of going outside in the summertime and picking the flowers! Very calming and relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to find an oil diffuser to start using in my home, but for now I&#x27;m just using some on my pillows for a nice calming, soothing, relaxing effect at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just realized that this can also be used for other things like headaches,allergies, anxiety and many other uses. That&#x27;s wonderful! I love learning new things about these essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this the next time I get a migraine for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks NES for your quality Lavender oil. I will look forward to your other products.</li>
    <li> This lavender CAN NOT possibly be authentic lavender oil.  When I smelled it it actually caused my blood sugar to plummet and make me sick EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on chemically-made fake essential oils.  I tossed this in the garbage.  I can&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I used this essential oil in my homemade whipped shea butter.  It smells amazing and does a great job at masking the nutty smell of the shea butter.</li>
    <li> I like this Lavender Oil by NES a lot. It has a strong lavender scent that holds up well in the homemade lotions I make. When I can&#x27;t sleep just a drop of this on my pillow helps me relax enough to slip off to dreamland.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy lavender oil, this is the one to buy!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t  see any differance.  My headaaches don&#x27;t  go away. 😣</li>
    <li> I love essential oils because they have so many uses in the home and they are all natural.  Lavender is one of my favorites because it is so relaxing and refreshing.  One of my favorite uses is adding just a bit to my home made laundry soap.  I have also used this as a room freshener by adding a bit to some water in a spray bottle.  This is a high quality oil so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have using this oil for just over a week now and love it! I am a fairly skeptical person when it comes to oils and such but everything it claims works. When it came in the mail right away I used it just under my nose and all of my congestion when away almost instantly. By putting it on your pillow before you sleep it helps to you to relax and fall asleep. Being able relax and fall asleep quickly for me is super important since I am a student and college can be pretty stressful so I really appreciate everything it does. The only thing that I wish was that the bottle wouldn&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> This Lavender Oil is very strong, that is great, as I will only need to use a small amount of it .</li>
    <li> As soon as I start to experience the &amp;#34;aura&amp;#34; that accompanies my headaches, I apply drops of lavender to the back of my neck (right at the base of the skull), my two temples and one in between my eyes. I then sit down and relax for up to 10 minutes. My headache disappears! Thankfully, I don&#x27;t have more than 3 or 4 of them a year, but when they happen I reach for my lavender. You should, too!</li>
    <li> I use lavender oil daily. It is antibacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral.  I make healing salves. I have even test it on a long cut..half I treated with lavender salve and half with other ointment. The lavender started healing quicker and left not mark afterward. I use it on blemishes, bug bites, Bath soak. It does help with insomnia, upset stomach, (aroma therapy..infusers, etc) I add it to almond oil for a lovely after bath oil and also to treat nerve, joint, and muscle pain.  This product is very nice, good price, works perfectly. good customer service, good value  I had to give a bottle to each of my children, they love it so much.  These little bottles are just the right size for keeping with me at all times. One of my girls likes to put it on the tip of her nose so she can smell it all the time.  she says everything else smell boring, silly girl.</li>
    <li> Lavender is a soothing and relaxing smell and this essential oil delivers. Because it is essential oil and not fragrance oil, the goodness and smell is long lasting. Essential oils have a lot of uses including potpourri and soaps. I love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I rub just a bit on my pillow case at night &amp; it helps de-stress so sleep comes quicker!  I have read where it works with allergies so will be trying it this Spring - I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. I put a little on the insides of my wrists and behind my ears before going to bed and it definitely helped me to relax and fall asleep quicker. This will last me a very long time. Great value</li>
    <li> Oh... it just smells so good. I love lavender oil and I actually keep two bottles in my house. One I keep at my desk with a diffuser and the other I keep by the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering why, it is because lavender is known to be a stress relieving fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does so much more. I actually looked it up on line and found the following information:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Lavender is used for:&lt;br /&gt;-restlessness&lt;br /&gt;-insomnia&lt;br /&gt;-nervousness&lt;br /&gt;-depression&lt;br /&gt; It is also used for a variety of digestive complaints including gas&lt;br /&gt;- loss of appetite&lt;br /&gt;-vomiting&lt;br /&gt;-nausea&lt;br /&gt;-upset stomach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people use lavender for painful conditions including:&lt;br /&gt;migraine headaches&lt;br /&gt;-toothaches&lt;br /&gt;-sprains&lt;br /&gt;-nerve pain&lt;br /&gt; and joint pain.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people add lavender to bathwater to treat circulation disorders and improve mental well being.&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply cream before I got to bed and I add a few drops in my lotion. Then it remains on my hands and I can sometimes smell it while I am sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased lots of brands, but I am particularly impressed with the quality of this one. It is just great. 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Loving this NES Lavender essential oil, it is great for diffusers or just to rub on your temple for migraines, which I suffer from very frequently.  I have a new diffuser, and have been having problems with headaches lately, so I just put 3 drops in my diffuser and let the wonderful smell of lavender fill the air.  It is not too strong, and relaxes me and eases my headaches. I highly recommend this, as it can be used for so many other things as well. I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a connoisseur of lavender oil, but it doesn&#x27;t matter with this product, since it is very potent stuff. Though not a cure-all, it will be a very pleasant treat for your nose and psyche.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lavender essential oils I have ever purchased.  It packs a lot of scent in a small amount.  I use it to help calm my nerves and help me sleep.  I also use it with a carrier oil to make a natural skin treatment.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is my favorite essential oil by far. This sweet smelling oil doesn&#x27;t have the overpowering smell like some other oil&#x27;s do but a light &amp; airy smell. A great oil to use in burner&#x27;s or in the making of other product&#x27;s such as chap stick ,shampoo&#x27;s &amp; conditioner&#x27;s ,homemade beauty products, homemade cleaning products,etc.. Also great for those who are stressed.Only takes a few drop&#x27;s of this oil when making product&#x27;s &amp; last a long time.This essential oil is a must have for me &amp; will be buying another bottle !!! I highly recommend buying &amp; trying it !</li>
    <li> This is an excellent essential oil. It helps me with migraines and I also like the smell of it and use it in my scent warmer as well.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was very excited to get this Lavender Oil.  I have never used Essential Oils before, so this was my first experience.  I have used it in my bath and LOVE the fragrance.  I also now have a diffuser (got especially because of this oil) and it sits in my bedroom.  I have found it very relaxing.  It has said that it is good for your scalp, and since I have a very dry scalp, I am going to be using it there as well.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this oil, is the awesome smell though.  I want to be sure to mention that I was very impressed with the packaging of this.  You can tell the seller cares about how it gets to you.  It was all wrapped up in bubble wrap, so that it wouldn&#x27;t get broke in transit.  I received this for free, and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This lavender essential oil does have a pleasing and calming smell so it should help with going to sleep and easing anxiety as stated in the ad when used in properly ventilated spaces.  I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to see if it eases the pain of burns or itchiness of bites like my Lavender oil from Young Living.  I&#x27;ll try it the next time I have one of those events.  If you haven&#x27;t learned the many uses of this versatile oil, I would encourage you to look into some of the books that are available on Amazon to help you decide that this is one of the best essential oils to keep on hand and purchase a bottle of this oil to try out.</li>
    <li> I just recently invested in a personal aromatherapy diffuser for my desk at work and wanted something that not only helped keep work stress to a minimum, but also was pleasing to others who worked in my office. It only took a few drops in the water for the humidifier to produce a fantastic scent that everyone I work with really seemed to enjoy and I loved it&#x27;s calming effect in the air as I went about my day. I would happily order this oil again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil in my vaporizer for a while now, and love it. The smell is not too strong or overpowering. It is a nice, pleasant scent and helps me to relax and sleep.</li>
    <li> Lavender is one of my favorite fragrance. Hence I got this essential oil.  So far I have used this oil for three things:&lt;br /&gt;1] In diffuser&lt;br /&gt;2] Put few drops on cotton ball and keep it in shoe closet&lt;br /&gt;3] Put in potpourri&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell last for a long time. It is light and soothing. I love the product and will definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
    <li> Did you know that lavender oil is a great product for use in Aroma diffusers / oil burners as well as being fantastic by itself?. This lavender oil scent strength is really good. I love lavender essential oil&#x27;s benefits. It has the ability to eliminate nervous tension, migraines, insomnia; it really helps me to relax and sleep. I cannot sleep without this product, a few drops upon the pillow does the trick and aids a good natural sleep. It is also great when using to refresh homemade lavender pouches and drawer bags. I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review, but all opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it!! Most useful essential oil I have ever received!!!I use it very often for relaxation and it really helps!!I But the great thing is that this is also great for first aid on minor burns, scrapes, or bug bites, to stop bleeding, help treat a cough or respiratory infection, help relieve the symptoms of allergies or congested sinuses, alleviate the symptoms of hay fever, relieve many types of headaches and it also reduces anxiety and stress when applied to the base of the neck.

    <li> I go through a lot of oils, for migraines. So when I found this lavender oil from NES. I knew I had to get it to test it out. I have liked that it safely helps relieve my migraines. That I can use it in my vaporizer that is in my sons room to help with his congestion. I like that it is easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to use an insane amount for it to work. I have also used it on my pillows as well to see if it would help me sleep. It has helped and I have noticed I haven&#x27;t been running to the sleeping pills as much. The scent is a very pretty lavender. Reminds me of a candle. Not too overpowering and not too weak that you cant tell that it is around. So far I have nothing but great things to say about the Lavender Essential Oil from NES and this will be my go to when I am starting to run low!</li>
    <li> I love this product, although only a small bottle it is really strong so you only need a few drops and the smell will linger in your room for hours. I use the Lavender oil for a number of purposes. In the spray bottle I add water and a few drops of oil and spray the room or add it to my electric diffuser. This product is well worth trying if you have troubles falling asleep. I put a couple of drops on my pillow and I was fast asleep straight away. Definitely had one of the best sleeps ever which is unusual for me as I&#x27;m always so stressed and unable to sleep. Lavender oil has been amazing to help me relax and fall asleep.  If you like to give it a try a stress free evening and a good deep sleep in your room with the lavender aroma, definitely buy this.</li>
    <li> Lavender oil is my favorite for reducing stress and helping me to chill out. Having a large family can be stressful at times. This essential oil is my secret weapon. Just a couple of drops in my bath, or on a light ring and all my cares just drift away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is known for it&#x27;s healing and calming properties. We will rub a drop of it on my fingertips and then lightly stroke the temples of the one suffering with a headache. It doesn&#x27;t take long until they are feeling better..or asleep which is the best thing for bad headaches anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent of this oil. I love that it can be used in laundry, baths, rubs and ointments just to mention a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a gentle oil that calms the world around you... give Lavender Oils a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was purchased by me with an online coupon or gift card.</li>
