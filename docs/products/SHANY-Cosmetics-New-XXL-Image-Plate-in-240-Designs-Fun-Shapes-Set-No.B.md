      <li>i love the designs i used stamping and nail art polish</li>
      <li>Then I Thought The Plate Would Be, Filled With Cute And</li>
      <li>well I should say most of the designs are it wont fit on my nail.</li>
      <li>I have every set available on amazon, and LOVE them all.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love the palate, great selection, however, the images aren&#x27;t etched very deeply and the prints don&#x27;t pick up or stamp well.</li>
      <li>It was shipped real quickly, nicely, and as I first started testing it, worked like a charm..</li>
      <li>These worked excellent with this plate with no smudge are messy clean up.</li>
      <li>Boy i was so excited when this came.</li>
      <li>The images are nice and stamps are clear for the most part as long as you use good nail polish, not the cheap runny kinds.</li>
      <li>But others have received perfectly fine plates, so I guess it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>a lot of konad images and the good thing about each of these plates is the images are all different.</li>
      <li>Only thing with the D plate is the bottm image of the playboy bunny did not engrave good.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t have a plate full of replicas.</li>
      <li>This plate has a lot of cool images and it arrived on time.</li>
      <li>NOT A BAD COLLECTION FOR THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>the designs are super different or unique but it is a good plate and the price is very reasonable</li>
      <li>But these work super.</li>
      <li>It has plenty of images to choose from, and they are very pretty.</li>
      <li>I was nervous it was going to come in an envelope, but it came in a nice big box.</li>
      <li>For the price it was nice to have such a variety of designs.</li>
      <li>Fun</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s HUGE - definitely not something that&#x27;s easily transportable.</li>
      <li>I was able to use regular 99 cent nail polish.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars: This product comes in an envelope (as shown in the product photograph) showing the plate on the cover, and the metal plate itself has a film that you must peel off first before using it.</li>
      <li>Bigger than I expected, but happy.</li>
      <li>The image is so clear that it really looks cool.</li>
      <li>The images that I have used stamp crisp and clear.</li>
      <li>There is a kind of covered cardboard backing that goes slightly past the end of the plate</li>
      <li>Even with the slight damage and scuffing issues, I love this plate for the quality and variety of designs, and its value, and plan to order the others.</li>
      <li>I have used numerous bottles of polish, knock offs and name brands with the same outcome and more than one stamper and has worked like a charm.</li>
      <li>I admit I was a little nervous, as I am sure we all are when ordering stamp plates.</li>
      <li>Lots of variety &amp; so far everything I have tried, stamps really well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit cheaply made compared to other brands.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you want clear designs and a variety of designs.</li>
      <li>I received the first plate with scratches and incomplete designs, and a warp in the middle.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the plate arrived slightly bent on one side, but I was able to bend most of it back and it works fine.</li>
      <li>Word of caution: the bottom of this plate, which as a sort of rubber/foam non-slip backing, left black scuff marks on the metal tray that I was using it on, so make sure your working surface is protected from this.</li>
      <li>I feel Like it should have cardboard on both sides of it since it is a large plate and the larger the plate</li>
      <li>Overall it was an ok buy for my three little girls nails.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this plate, it has a hard outer piece that holds the plate so you can not cut yourself.</li>
      <li>and so is my 5 year old daughter,</li>
      <li>They have a lot of good images but some of the other ones are a little too big for your nails.</li>
      <li>This was a little awkward to use because of its size but over all its awesome!</li>
      <li>Some of the images are a little big for my fingernails, so i&#x27;m not sure if I can use those ones or not, but all in all it is a good buy.</li>
      <li>Regarding the clarity of the images, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best or worst, or even in between, since this was my first time stamping and have nothing else to cmpare it to such as Konad, Bundle Monster, etc.</li>
      <li>I got this plate particularly for its abundance of cat images, but a lot of the other images on this plate will be useful for other festive occasions.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When the product arrived it was slightly bent. Does not affect the outcome of the stamps though. It&#x27;s quite big so using it is a bit cumbersome when you have that, nail polish, nail polish remover, and all the stamping necessities around. The images are nice and stamps are clear for the most part as long as you use good nail polish, not the cheap runny kinds. There is a kind of covered cardboard backing that goes slightly past the end of the plate so the metal edges won&#x27;t cut. I probably won&#x27;t buy another big one like this since it&#x27;s not too convenient for travel. Regarding the clarity of the images, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best or worst, or even in between, since this was my first time stamping and have nothing else to cmpare it to such as Konad, Bundle Monster, etc. If the size isn&#x27;t an issue for you then I would recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> It came in the standard Amazon box however there was only the air bubble in the box with it.... The plate is slightly bent... not bent enough that is doesn&#x27;t work but bend enough that it doesn&#x27;t sit flat on the desk or table. I feel Like it should have cardboard on both sides of it since it is a large plate and the larger the plate the easier it bends. Stamps well though.</li>
    <li> This plate has a lot of cool images and it arrived on time. I was a little sad that it was bent and somewhat flimsy on a black cardboard plate. For the price it was nice to have such a variety of designs. Some of the images were a little blurred when stamped. Overall it was an ok buy for my three little girls nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this plates. Bigger than I expected, but happy. It&#x27;s a bit cheaply made compared to other brands. The metal scratches very easy with the razor scraper. So I suggest using a plastic one so you don&#x27;t destroy this.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to order this after reading the reviews. I have been looking at plates for a while, they are expensive! when I saw this I thought it was a GREAT value! It came in perfect condition! I was nervous it was going to come in an envelope, but it came in a nice big box. Was not damaged one bit! I am so happy with my order!</li>
    <li> Love the palate, great selection, however, the images aren&#x27;t etched very deeply and the prints don&#x27;t pick up or stamp well. I&#x27;ve also purchased another stamper from Sally&#x27;s to see if I have better luck. Such a shame. This posed to be an awesome&lt;br /&gt;Product! Sigh.</li>
    <li> These xxl plates are some awesome plates. I have all four. easy to use. I was able to use regular 99 cent nail polish. I also was able to use the 57 cent acrylic paints out of walmart. These worked excellent with this plate with no smudge are messy clean up. Only thing with the D plate is the bottm image of the playboy bunny did not engrave good. I don&#x27;t know why these plates don&#x27;t have any reviews. They have 240 designs each. I have all the images I have been seeing sell for 5 bucks. a lot of konad images and the good thing about each of these plates is the images are all different. you don&#x27;t have a plate full of replicas. I think five are duplicate images that are meant for opposit hand. These are a still for the price. other plates this massive are around 40 bucks and up.</li>
    <li> This is a great plate! It&#x27;s HUGE - definitely not something that&#x27;s easily transportable. Some of the designs aren&#x27;t to my taste, but there&#x27;ll be something for everyone on this plate. I got this plate particularly for its abundance of cat images, but a lot of the other images on this plate will be useful for other festive occasions. There are many kinds of characters on this plates - cats, Smurfs, Hello Kitty, kisses, assorted animals, British-style griffons &amp; creatures that would go on a coat of arms, floral images, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars: This product comes in an envelope (as shown in the product photograph) showing the plate on the cover, and the metal plate itself has a film that you must peel off first before using it. Unfortunately, the plate arrived slightly bent on one side, but I was able to bend most of it back and it works fine. Word of caution: the bottom of this plate, which as a sort of rubber/foam non-slip backing, left black scuff marks on the metal tray that I was using it on, so make sure your working surface is protected from this. If the plate had come perfectly flat, I&#x27;d be giving this product 5 stars. Even with the slight damage and scuffing issues, I love this plate for the quality and variety of designs, and its value, and plan to order the others.</li>
    <li> Allow me to preface this: I stamp. A lot. I have every set available on amazon, and LOVE them all. BM, Cheeky, RA, even the Shany  small plate sets. I absolutely hate to leave a bad review. This XXL plate just sits unused in my collection. I received the first plate with scratches and incomplete designs, and a warp in the middle. Requested exchange, which was speedy and I was impressed with that aspect. Second one arrived  quickly, only to have scratches and a bend in the corner that rendered the lotus design and surrounding designs unusable. Cat has no tail, clovers run off the plate, etc. Overall, I am not happy for what I paid for it vs. value, but I didn&#x27;t feel like sending the second one back and risking it being even worse than the first two. So, overall for me, not happy. But others have received perfectly fine plates, so I guess it&#x27;s worth a try. I just wish I&#x27;d saved my money.</li>
    <li> The plate is awesome i love the designs i used stamping and nail art polish and they looked great i would have given it 5 stars but my plate was bent great product but need a better way to prevent bending the plate.</li>
    <li> Lots of variety &amp; so far everything I have tried, stamps really well.  My only comment is I would like to know what the &amp;#34;symbols&amp;#34; mean.  I contacted their web &amp; they didn&#x27;t know either!  LOL  Got some figured out doing research, but I kinda want to know what I&#x27;m stamping!  :-)  Overall, though I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I admit I was a little nervous, as I am sure we all are when ordering stamp plates. Boy i was so excited when this came. It was shipped real quickly, nicely, and as I first started testing it, worked like a charm.. I am in love with this plate, it has a hard outer piece that holds the plate so you can not cut yourself. The only problem is i get my polish on the sides, which doesn&#x27;t bother me any, and can be cleaned with acetone.  Highly recommend if you want clear designs and a variety of designs. I have used numerous bottles of polish, knock offs and name brands with the same outcome and more than one stamper and has worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> No me gusta porq no levantaba muy bien los disenos y se via Sucio y lo tube q segresar y eso q yego sarpido</li>
    <li> I own the 2012 set of Shany plates. I am not impressed with the plates. Half of the images don&#x27;t stamp. But these work super. I haven&#x27;t done all the images but I can feel all the images with my fingers so I&#x27;ll assume they should work. I used the angry big image on my sons nail today. Dad is going to kill me but at least it is only one nail and its in white. The image is so clear that it really looks cool. These are really good plates and price is good also.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the Hello Kitty design, but the designs aren&#x27;t etched enough on the metal that it deforms the design when you stamp it on your nail.</li>
    <li> Item as described, love this plate!</li>
    <li> I just got my plate in yesterday and hurried to open and do a few swatches. The plate had a few minor hairline scratches and bended parts in 2 of the corners. This did not affect the stamping quality one bit. Cute designs and a great price, don&#x27;t debate any longer about getting this plate. I&#x27;m happy with it and so is my 5 year old daughter,</li>
    <li> They have a lot of good images but some of the other ones are a little too big for your nails.</li>
    <li> This was a little awkward to use because of its size but over all its awesome! It has great designs!</li>
    <li> I like the designs on the plate but I don&#x27;t have long nail nor do I have fake nails. Some of the designs are so big well I should say most of the designs are it wont fit on my nail. I guess I can use it for other things.</li>
    <li> This plate is very big, it is bigger than my iPAD! It has plenty of images to choose from, and they are very pretty. Some of the images are a little big for my fingernails, so i&#x27;m not sure if I can use those ones or not, but all in all it is a good buy.</li>
    <li> NOT A BAD COLLECTION FOR THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;Good selection of images. The only complaint that I have is that the corner of the plate is all bent and crumpled, so it will affect at least 5 images. The images that I have used stamp crisp and clear.</li>
    <li> This is nice sized and it stamps fairly well. the designs are super different or unique but it is a good plate and the price is very reasonable</li>
    <li> i like so much ,have many options!!! i hope more !!!&lt;br /&gt;y like more desing to hearts, butterfly,bees and dragonfly!!!</li>
    <li> This Nail Art Stamping Plate is Very Nice And Bigger Then I Thought The Plate Would Be, Filled With Cute And Fun Nail Art Designs 240 Designs Is Better Then 30 Designs</li>
