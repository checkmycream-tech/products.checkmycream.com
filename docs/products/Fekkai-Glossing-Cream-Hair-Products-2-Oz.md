      <li>No more dry ends from over stressing your hair looks smooth and shines,feels wonderful you will love it,I will only use  Fekkai Products</li>

      <li>Just make sure you only use a &amp;#34;pea&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, and I much prefer the CHI Pliable Polish!  </li>
      <li>I love this product for my blonde, medium texture, chin length hair.  </li>
      <li>Robin suggested squeezing it onto your hands first, then rubbing it through your hair.  </li>
      <li>The Fekkai did pretty much nothing - just didn&#x27;t make a difference in my hair, so I see no need to use it.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have been please with how little product you need to make my hair tangle free, friz free and shinny.</li>
      <li>size a amount like the back says, and avoid your scalp (a little on top is ok) or your hair will be greasy.  </li>
      <li>It smells ausome and works very well on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It gives the instant smooth feel to the hair.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my driy, curly hair.</li>
      <li>I highlight my hair and it is very helpful keeping the frizzed look away.  </li>
      <li>I have very kinky hair</li>
      <li>really enhances my color and highlights.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Only a very light amount is needed, but it does a long way!</li>
      <li>I keep it away from my scalp and use it mostly at the mid point and ends and lightly over the top for the frizz -  towel dry hair, put a small amount in my palms (less than dime size), rub together and distribute evenly.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought the small bottle.</li>
      <li>Until I found a good deep conditioner and started washing my hair way less, I used this stuff and a dry shampoo to get any leftover grease out.  </li>
      <li>A little bit of this product will go a long way, so make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will get a greasy look.</li>
      <li>Its wonderful would highly recommend as I have very long and thick hair and just a small pea size application</li>
      <li>I have long medium thick wavy/curly hair, foiled, and it adds a nice gloss, helps smooth and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or look greasy.</li>
      <li>Overall, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>There is no other product like Fekkai!</li>
      <li>I do not like to apply much of anything but after noticing how dry my hair was getting from the winter</li>
      <li>This small tube can last 2 years easily if you use just a pea size amount each time you apply.  </li>
      <li>It is a great thing to have in the bathroom specially on a bad hair day.</li>
      <li>AND it barely has any fragrance to it at all.  </li>
      <li>i have natural hair that I get pressed and flat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money as a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>It makes my already straight poofy hair less poofy.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s well worth the money as a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> It makes my already straight poofy hair less poofy.</li>
<li> It is very light though and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my thin hair.</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or flat like some of the Moroccan oil products do.</li>
<li> I use this product after flat ironing my hair.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just a strong one; however, I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
<li> Seems strange, but it worked.</li>
<li> I use it before I dry my hair</li>
<li> My hair is not processed or colored, but it is still dry by nature.</li>
<li> I just blow dry</li>
<li> It only takes a little bit.  </li>
<li> This is my second purchase of this product, it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
<li> , I haven&#x27;t imagined any such improvement with the other 9,732 products I&#x27;ve tried since my dark shiny tresses began to defect in favor of this sorry substitute, so I&#x27;m guessing this product really works.  </li>
<li> A little of this product gets the job done and goes a long way.</li>
<li> A tiny bit (half a pea-sized drop)adds needed luster to my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it limp like some glossing products.  </li>
<li> As a bonus it&#x27;s small enough to bring in a carry on when traveling.</li>
<li> You just need to be careful of using only a very very small amount.</li>
<li> This is not for straightening, rather to add some gloss to hair that tends to be dull (such as bleached or curly hair).</li>
<li> Totally not worth the price.</li>
<li> This does not leave a residue or way down the hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not the only user who gets a lot of mileage out of the small tube, and I used it by the recommended pea-size amount, but the tube I bought in June 2012 is now rancid!</li>
<li> Would not repurchase or recommend to anyone with slightly frizzy hair.</li>
<li> was just hoping for a slight smoothing effect.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I sure don&#x27;t think so. I LOVE this stuff. It makes my already straight poofy hair less poofy. I don&#x27;t have to straighten it if I use this stuff I just blow dry and I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a sample through the mail a while back.  Loved it so much I found it on Amazon and ordered it.  Great product</li>
    <li> my hair turns very beautiful after using it</li>
    <li> I love this product for my blonde, medium texture, chin length hair.  A tiny bit (half a pea-sized drop)adds needed luster to my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it limp like some glossing products.  Great for older hair!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference at all in smoothness or shine of my hair.  AND it barely has any fragrance to it at all.  (I LIKE a fresh, clean or citrusy fragrance).  It&#x27;s pricey, and I much prefer the CHI Pliable Polish!  THAT is a great product!  A little messy, but leaves a great, healthy, &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look to my hair!  The Fekkai did pretty much nothing - just didn&#x27;t make a difference in my hair, so I see no need to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this Fekkai Glossing Cream for several years and it is amazing!  I use it before I dry my hair and it gives my hair great shine...really enhances my color and highlights.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good glossing cream. Definitely does what it claims to do. However, I didn&#x27;t think it was extraordinary. It was just alright. For the price it might not be worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and performance of this product. I&#x27;m not the only user who gets a lot of mileage out of the small tube, and I used it by the recommended pea-size amount, but the tube I bought in June 2012 is now rancid! It has to be the olive oil in the formula.  It now smells like rancid cooking oil.  There is a lot of product left that I can&#x27;t use, and Proctor &amp; Gamble won&#x27;t honor exchanges/refunds unless products are purchased from their websites.  They advised exchanging it at the place of purchase, but how do I do that at Amazon.com?</li>
    <li> I have been please with how little product you need to make my hair tangle free, friz free and shinny.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It makes my hair so shiny and smoothes the frizzies out. It only takes a tiny dab, so the bottle lasts quite a while. Even the 2 oz bottle lasts a couple of months for me.</li>
    <li> Smooth and conditions ends.</li>
    <li> There is no other product like Fekkai! This stuff lasts forever - you only need a very very small amount!! I put it in prior to blow-drying, and it leaves my hair so smooth, silky and styles GREAT!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my driy, curly hair. My hair is not processed or colored, but it is still dry by nature. This glossing cream didn&#x27;t really do anything for it and it is pretty strong smelling for me. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just a strong one; however, I am very sensitive to smells. I also was under the impression that this was a cruelty-free product, but then I found out that is is by Procter &amp; Gamble...soooo....yeah. Probably should have researched more before letting the twitch in my finger take over the mouse and purchase it. Oh well...maybe I&#x27;ll give it away as a gift to a friend or something...</li>
    <li> I use this with a blow dryer with a roller brush and it leaves my unmanageable hair into beautiful and shiny hair</li>
    <li> Works ok on my fine, wavy, frizzy hair. However, for the price it isn&#x27;t that much better than lower priced products.</li>
    <li> Was expecting this to de-frizz my hair as well as add some shine. It did add shine but my hair still remains frizzy. I don&#x27;t even hair overly frizzy hair....was just hoping for a slight smoothing effect. Glad I bought the small bottle. Totally not worth the price. It is very light though and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my thin hair. Would not repurchase or recommend to anyone with slightly frizzy hair. Does smell amazing though which is a plus!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used.  It smells ausome and works very well on my hair.  I have very kinky hair and it controls frizz and adds shine.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair super soft and shiny. It&#x27;s definitely the best haircare product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s well worth the money as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using the glossing cream for several years now and it is a great product. I have hair that tends to frizz and so I have used it almost daily-especially in the summers! A little of this product gets the job done and goes a long way. The 2 oz size lasted me about a year the last time.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from Target and loved it, so I bought it on Amazon.com because it was cheaper than buying at Target. A little bit of this product will go a long way, so make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will get a greasy look. It keeps fly-aways at bay and your hair looking beautiful! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff makes my poor, dulling, thinning, greyed, elderly hair shinier and fuller, which is pretty impressive (I am not taking this whole aging process well, can you tell?), but I&#x27;m not 100% sure...I mean, maybe it&#x27;s my imagination?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otoh, I haven&#x27;t imagined any such improvement with the other 9,732 products I&#x27;ve tried since my dark shiny tresses began to defect in favor of this sorry substitute, so I&#x27;m guessing this product really works.  In fact, I&#x27;m  going to buy some more, just in case, as so often seems to happen every time I find a wonderful beauty product, they stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, give it a shot-- it&#x27;s worth the price to find out if you imagine it works for your hair, too!</li>
    <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t help with tangles. Great for people that seek the sleek glossy hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. You only need a tiny amount so this size lasts me over a year. I have long medium thick wavy/curly hair, foiled, and it adds a nice gloss, helps smooth and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or look greasy. I keep it away from my scalp and use it mostly at the mid point and ends and lightly over the top for the frizz -  towel dry hair, put a small amount in my palms (less than dime size), rub together and distribute evenly. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or flat like some of the Moroccan oil products do. This is not for straightening, rather to add some gloss to hair that tends to be dull (such as bleached or curly hair). My daughter has extremely thick, curly hair but it doesn&#x27;t work as well for her. She uses the heavy duty stuff previously mentioned. I really love all of the Fekkai products, if only they weren&#x27;t so expensive. As a bonus it&#x27;s small enough to bring in a carry on when traveling.</li>
    <li> Just a bit of this gives my hair shine, a bit of texture and reduces frizzies and flyaway hair without making hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This cream is light and it tames frizzies and gives hair a nice shine that looks natural.  This is my second purchase of this product, it&#x27;s a little pricey but, you only have to use a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> Great product for everyday use. It is a great thing to have in the bathroom specially on a bad hair day.</li>
    <li> I reeeeeaaallly like this stuff.  My hair was AWFUL.  SO frizzy no matter what I did.  This stuff saves it.  Just make sure you only use a &amp;#34;pea&amp;#34; size a amount like the back says, and avoid your scalp (a little on top is ok) or your hair will be greasy.  Until I found a good deep conditioner and started washing my hair way less, I used this stuff and a dry shampoo to get any leftover grease out.  Seems strange, but it worked. Overall, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for making your hair look smooth and shiny.  You just need to be careful of using only a very very small amount.</li>
    <li> Its wonderful would highly recommend as I have very long and thick hair and just a small pea size application is just enough Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> i have natural hair that I get pressed and flat ironed every 2-weeks. I do not like to apply much of anything but after noticing how dry my hair was getting from the winter I knew I needed something between my visits to the salon.  After doing some research I found this item through Michelle Obama&#x27;s stylist and it does the trick! Silky glossy light and bouncy hair.  This does not leave a residue or way down the hair.  Only a very light amount is needed, but it does a long way!</li>
    <li> No more dry ends from over stressing your hair looks smooth and shines,feels wonderful you will love it,I will only use  Fekkai Products</li>
    <li> This small tube can last 2 years easily if you use just a pea size amount each time you apply.  It is a fantastic shine gloss.  I focus on the ends of my hair that start to look split after a while.  I highlight my hair and it is very helpful keeping the frizzed look away.  Highly recommended and completely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I use this product after flat ironing my hair. It gives the instant smooth feel to the hair. As the direction says do not use more than a pea size, otherwise it will feel so greasy you will need to shampoo your hair...</li>
    <li> Robin McGraw recommended this in her book, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  It&#x27;s easy to control the amount you want to squeeze through the top.  It only takes a little bit.  Robin suggested squeezing it onto your hands first, then rubbing it through your hair.  Works nicely for me.</li>
    <li> great smell, not sticky at all. My sister recommended it to me, now all my family and friends use it</li>
</ol>
