<li> My hair was getting fried from using curling irons, so I went back to the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; mesh rollers (without brushes).  </li>
<li> I was using long clips to hold in the rollers....</li>
<li> what can you say about something that you need and have used for so long.  </li>
<li> I bought these pins to use with my regular plastic rollers that came with a half cylinder cover to hold them.  </li>
<li> Then I feared they wouldn&#x27;t work because the rollers have no brushes, but I put two in each roller, so they criss-cross in the center.  </li>
<li> Exactly as expected.</li>
<li> AND THE SHORT MINT GREEN ONES.</li>
<li> Longer and don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;knobs&amp;#34; halfway down like the others</li>
<li> Such a shame that these are so hard to find these days!</li>
<li> I have very long, thick hair and one pin</li>
<li> but unfortunately they don&#x27;t work at all with my curlers which are metal and have only a few holes.</li>
<li> I usually have to go to a Health and Beauty store to find these, if they&#x27;re in stock.</li>
<li> I AM RETURNING THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO THICK FOR THE PLASTIC ROLLERS THAT I PURCHASED.</li>
<li> All you do is roll your hair in the curler and push the pin at the base of the curler next to your scalp and you&#x27;re done!  </li>

    <li> My mother always look for these tools to hold her rollers.  The tools are sturdy and perfect to hold the rollers.</li>
    <li> Great quality for a really good price!</li>
    <li> My hair was getting fried from using curling irons, so I went back to the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; mesh rollers (without brushes).  I was using long clips to hold in the rollers....OUCH! My hair was getting tangled in them and being pulled out when I removed them.  I went online, hoping \\&quot;they still made them\\&quot; (I&#x27;m a flower child of the 60&#x27;s)...and was thrilled to purchase them.  Then I feared they wouldn&#x27;t work because the rollers have no brushes, but I put two in each roller, so they criss-cross in the center.  I LOVE them!</li>
    <li> Was just what my mom was looking for. Delivery was fast price was great.</li>
    <li> met my needs picks are straight with no ridges  which I like best and they are not sold in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> These are longer than the picks I could buy locally, great for holding larger diameter rollers.  Good venfor, product came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Good product!This was a very good price for the amount that you get.I use brush rollers all the time and these do the job.</li>
    <li> Adequate - just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to&lt;br /&gt;keep curlers in place a old favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect yet simple and durable&lt;br /&gt;as well!</li>
    <li> These are better than Bobby pins or clips!  All you do is roll your hair in the curler and push the pin at the base of the curler next to your scalp and you&#x27;re done!

IF THE ROLLERS WERE THE ORIGINAL &amp;#34; PLASTIC HAIR ROLLER by GOODY&amp;#34;,THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE. I SURE WISH I COULD FIND THE ORIGINAL &amp;#34;GOODY &amp;#34;BRAND PLASTIC HAIR ROLLERS. IN LIGHT PINK. AND THE SHORT MINT GREEN ONES. IF ANY ONE HAS SOME YOU NO LONGER USE LET ME KNOW.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Thank you !!</li>
    <li> I am using this for cards I am making and these picks are miniature knitting needles.  Not what this product would normally be used for, but that&#x27;s why i bought them.</li>
    <li> Arrived early--very well made and nicely packaged--length perfect to keep mesh rollers in place.</li>
    <li> I never got the picks....nothing...not even a credit ...I&#x27;m sure they know I didn&#x27;t get the products ...so it didn&#x27;t cost much ... that&#x27;s not the point. Crumbs !!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for hair rollers of any kind.  Has many uses as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these pins to use with my regular plastic rollers that came with a half cylinder cover to hold them.  the cylinder covers make lined marks on my hair so I don&#x27;t like to use them but these pins work Ok.  I wish they had longer ones for my big rollers.</li>
    <li> Such a shame that these are so hard to find these days!</li>
    <li> They are simple but unfortunately they don&#x27;t work at all with my curlers which are metal and have only a few holes. It just doesn&#x27;t work. I wished I can find these old curlers which could be fixed with these roller picks.</li>
    <li> If the rollers I had were any good these would probably work but with mesh rollers (with no brush inside) the picks cannot hold the roller in place. I used two picks per roller and they just fell out.</li>
    <li> Received as shown. Just right for vintage curlers.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great for Larger Rollers...</li>
    <li> Well the envelope was sealed but the content was already opened. So there is no way that someone opened it during transit. It was just sold opened.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for, excellent quality, excellent service!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my mother and to replace the picks that she had used for years.  They work well and are sturdy.</li>
