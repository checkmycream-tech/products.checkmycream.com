<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
    <li> I was not aware the roses would come in different sizes. I received really small ones and thats not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> So cute i wish i had more of these</li>
    <li> I ordered these in small, assorted colors. What I received was 11 big &amp; 9 small. The small ones look like like smashed flowers or balls. The larger ones look okay but they are too big for what I need. Glad I only ordered 1 to try before ordering multiple qty that I needed. The colors could be better as well.</li>
    <li> i thought they looked great so i ordered them, but after seeing them, it wasnt for me so i gave them to a girl that does awesome art work on her nails. thanks</li>
    <li> they stayed on for a while with not a lot of nail glue love them so much but i put them some where in my room and now i cant find them think i might need to order more</li>
    <li> i love these flowers there so popular and so cute but they can be a little tricky to glue on make sure u use arcylic so it stays on longer</li>
    <li> I think you pay too much for this item. Worth less than $1. Okay I guess. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but it might stick to nails.</li>
    <li> I made several purchases of little charm-like pieces similar to these. I&#x27;m going to decorate my own phone case. This was the last package to arrive. Most of my orders were from Hong Kong so I knew they would take a few weeks to arrive. I wasn&#x27;t too worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is exactly as pictured. The roses are small and very cute. They&#x27;re very nice.</li>
    <li> Some of the roses are morphed and look gross. They are huge and bulky on your nails. I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;re supposed to use them if they don&#x27;t even look like roses.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED. The colors are drab and sad looking. They are dark! Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Yay, kawaii!!!! On time and as described. Flat backs and differing sizes. I look forward to creating some very nice designs with these pieces, and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Super cute and I received multiple sizes, so I can add smaller ones with the slightly bigger ones. I will be purchasing more of these in the bear future</li>
    <li> came in different colors some a bit bigger then others,&lt;br /&gt;but i would use the bigger ones for my thumb nail,,</li>
    <li> too big to place on my nails, but they are super cute. I might end up gluing them to a cell phone cover or using them for other art decorations. Not sure I could wear them on my nails and not be bothered that they are so huge.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised. I love the item and it was at a very great price. Great to add character&lt;br /&gt;to your nails</li>
    <li> These roses are so stinking cute when they are put on! My only complaint is I now have a hard time doing my hair, but the messier hair is totally worth how cute these are on!</li>
    <li> they look so cute and shiny.....besides that i got two that are smaller around but would probably end up to high on the nail...jajaja those two actually look like teeth...lol....</li>
    <li> I received about 6 and most were chipped.</li>
    <li> I feel that these are way to big to be used on nails. They stick out way to far and take up too much room!</li>
    <li> Some of the flowers were broken or not even full size. I kind of expected better especially since the pieces were already tiny to begin with and only ten came in the back. I would buy more but I don&#x27;t want another crappy set. Disappointed to a certain degree.  If I do buy these again it will be from a different company.</li>
    <li> really pretty but not the colors i wanted or expected, but they are still good quality and would possible order again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried these yet, however I love the colors, and the price!  I Can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> okay these are to small but supper cute they dont break as esly as you might think and the price is very expensive i think for the amount recived</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered a lot of little roses,but I only gotten like a minimum of ten. I thought I was getting what it said was to be 20pcs. I was disappointed,but the roses were pretty.</li>
    <li> Great product and great variety. They are a bit over sized looking on nails, but it may just be my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Variety of colors&lt;br /&gt;-Detailed looking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to keep on nail&lt;br /&gt;-Weigh down nails a bit&lt;br /&gt;-Quite large for nails</li>
    <li> Cute colors perfect for summer, looks just like the picture. Small &amp; slim good to put on nails, would buy again!</li>
    <li> Thes are very cute and really make ur nails stand out! They stay on well if u use a resin/glue to place them.</li>
    <li> My clients really love these and so I will need to order more.  they are very detailed and look great on the nails and toe nails.</li>
    <li> They were to big and there weren&#x27;t that many colors. Plus they catch on fabrics, strings, and are hard to keep on.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in December, got it a month after, its really quite nice, I will be using it for art, but not nail art, its just small and cute, just right for any art ideas that come along the way.</li>
    <li> You will receive NONE of the colors shown! I am beyond unhappy with this purchase! The roses are all different sizes to the point that some or them are unrecognized as roses. The colors I received are ugly! Pale yellow, dark blue, and orange, the picture shown does NOT represent ANY Of those colors, roses in my package are also uneven! I have ONE dark blue rose and the rest are orange and yellow. How am I suppose to make any uniform design with THAT?! Send me another  pack of rose nail art that are the same colors as your picture! I am one UNHAPPY costumer!!!  D:&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> they looked so cute on my acrylics and I loved the different colors, they always matched my outfits! very awesome product!</li>
    <li> They are really cute and don&#x27;t get caught on stuff like my other nail jewelry does. Not too big but large enough to start a conversation.</li>
    <li> Was really looking for the black but it does not come in the pack instead I got two different purples</li>
    <li> These look so pretty on my nails...they are not however the colors shown here which was kind of a let down because I really wanted these colors shown, but the colors I did get are just fine too!!</li>
    <li> It is so big I don&#x27;t think I can use for nail art.&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like the picture, but the size is different. it is as big as iPhone&#x27;s circle button on the middle bottom.</li>
    <li> All the flowers are different colors, no two flowers of the same color. Otherwise they are kind of cool. B</li>
    <li> I thought that the roses would be like in the picture but they were pale pink, lilac, &#x27;kermit&#x27; green, black and white. Most had a glossy finish and I noticed a couple were sparkly/ glittery. I was looking forward to red roses but nope; no red roses! The only thing I really like about these are the size. They are just the perfect size for nails.</li>
    <li> Ok so they came at good time. I was super excited -_-&lt;br /&gt;But then I opened it to find it was only a little...I was honestly mad. I thought more would come in the order.&lt;br /&gt;If I would have know such little comes. I would have ordered two maybe. And some of the flowers only have one color...I think each color and size should have the same amount. But over all it was ok, the flowers are cute and perfect for nail art.</li>
    <li> So I have just got these in the mail which was awesome because they came approx. 1-2 weeks  before they were supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I bought these (MIXED COLORS AND SIZES) to decorate phones cases, and I really do like them they are not too small but just the right size. BUT I was a bit disappointed for the color turn out because I was REALLY hoping to get the light purple and mint green, which I only got 1 mint green and 0 purple. Here is the list of the colors I got :&lt;br /&gt;BIG SIZES : 3 corals , 3 yellows , 2 peach , 2 black, 1 orange, 1 hot pink,1 baby pink, 1 mint,&lt;br /&gt;SMALL SIZES : 3 light pink, 2 clear (UGLY)&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: really cute in larger sizes but I really wanted a better color selction</li>
    <li> Small but useable - cant wait to use them. Great price for quantity and quality. I like the colors included.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive 20 pieces, only received 5</li>
    <li> Somewhat pricey for what I paid and only received 10</li>
    <li> First off they are much larger than I was expecting, they look and also fit more like it&#x27;s supposed to be a cell phone charm, and also, the colors weren&#x27;t what I was expecting. Lots of them I probably won&#x27;t even be using because they&#x27;re not typical colors that I use when I do my nail art at home.</li>
    <li> Tiny and low height. Love them. I&#x27;ll be using them for paper crafts. Colors are a bit transparent, but pretty.</li>
    <li> I love these but they are difficult to use on natural nails because they are hard to stick on. Acrylic nails would work better with these. Also, I only got a pack of 10 in the mail when I expected 20.</li>
    <li> The roses are grate when I tried them they were awesome but are a little big and pops out when ur in a crowd because it is to amazing</li>
    <li> Product arrived before the estimated ship time which was good but the bows were all different colors which makes no sense so you can&#x27;t match up the colors I guess u get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> These flowers are great, they really stand out.  hey will be great for summer on toenails, but are also great on fingernails.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY UNIQUE AND MAKES BEAUTIFUL NAIL ART DESIGNS,,,IF YOU LOVE YOUR NAILS TO LOOK NICE YOU MUST GET THIS LITTLE FLOWER SET</li>
    <li> I love the Roses design! Also when taking them of are reusable! Would buy more &amp; tell other people about it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it says 20 pcs no I got the most like 10 in a really small cheap bag. I was not happy about it good thin was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> These roses were exactly what I expected. I just wish they would have come in a container for storage..&amp;#34;&amp;#34; Didn&#x27;t know&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I had to get a refund because they didn&#x27;t believe that I only received 12and only 3 different colors. They wanted a picture. I just wanted the amount thAt  I paid for and if they show 5different colors then I would have hoped to have gotten 5 different colors not 3.</li>
    <li> Loved them so much! arrived in about 2weeks! Faster than expected, just as in the picture and stay well on the nail.</li>
    <li> the colors that i received was mainly pinks and peaches, which i donnot mind but the variety could be better, overall good product.</li>
    <li> These are of all sizes. So I can put more than one together. They look just as pictured with a wider variety of colors. I will buy agian.</li>
    <li> Nothing sticker to it at all I used several different glues and none of them held the piece but it was pretty but very useless</li>
    <li> i wear these all the time i&#x27;m in love with them and aaaa theyre just so cute forever and always 10/10</li>
    <li> They need to resend my stuff because didt have the last name is Sarahi Ayala Rodríguez i pay for the things</li>
    <li> The size is too big to place on small natural nails.  I was not found of the colors either. Perhaps I can use them for other crafts.</li>
    <li> This set only had 10. Not happy with it at all and one of the roses are chipped. Not a wide variety in colors</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these...she got the magnet earring to match the rings she made</li>
    <li> Well as much as i love ordering from the seller i must say i dont like these flowers they r kind of cheesy some of them are cute but some are not! U may like em just for me i do not! But for the price its not a bad gamble</li>
    <li> Theyre awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Super cheap&lt;br /&gt;Most cabochon followers like this are usually $3 for only 10. Super good deal. Recomended. I ordered more.</li>
    <li> There very pretty put I only got white,black,pink,and red roses I really want some mint green rose .</li>
    <li> I had to file these down on the bottom because they are super high off the nail. Other than that they are very detail n beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> never ever recieved this item! im sure i would have loved the flowers but i never had the option to decide.....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like being negative BUT this stuff took over a month and arrived on the latest estimated arrival date, so it was still technically on time, but there IS NOT 20 pieces in this package. I have like anywhere between 7-10 and there aren&#x27;t even double of a color to do both ring fingers if you&#x27;re doing nails ... And there&#x27;s no point in complaining even if they offer to send you another one because that&#x27;ll take another month and then asking for a refund of 90 cents is just petty.... I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied, but I can&#x27;t really be too upset knowing what goes on in those factories overseas (google it)!</li>
    <li> I kinda likes wht I received. I mean it was what I expected for the most part but the roses were to big for my nails and some of the roses were cut at the bottom so I won&#x27;t even be able to use a couple let alone the larger roses at all</li>
    <li> I am not a professional, but this piece is very easy to put on (with a nail glue) and easy to take off.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it&#x27;s too easy to take off because of its big size.&lt;br /&gt;The size is too big and it just sticks out from the nail if you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;When I say size, I mean the height of the piece. It looks like I just have a big clump on my nail.&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, the rose fell off from my nail a couple times if I accidently bumped into something.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve learn to SUPER glue the piece)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it definitely is an attention getter and the design is very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Considering its cheap price, it might be a good investment (if you don&#x27;t care about how easily it can fall off)</li>
    <li> The quality and shape are very nice they are so adorable! The only let down is that they are a little too big for what I need especially when working with short nails but I will figure out a way to use them.</li>
    <li> I received these but they are not the colors pictured, the black and white are the same but the green and lavender are dark blue and yellow, and the ones that look like dark pink are bright red</li>
    <li> Aside from the mixed sizes.. and there wernt two of the same color AND size I guess they are ok. If you dont wanna match that is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these acrylic flowers on jewelry for a while now, and hardly anything I see, I really like. So I thought I&#x27;d get my own flowers and try them in my own designs. Well, I haven&#x27;t been doing much designing, but I have these cute little guys on a paper plate and look at them for a while. They kind of look like candy - just don&#x27;t eat them! I would say I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My roses arrived safe and damaged even after such a long trip.. They add so much to a manicure, in fact I have a wedding to attend this summer, and I am going to have them on my own nails - even if I have to order again to make sure that I have my color in stock. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The flowers are cute but I only received  10! I would give this product a five if I would have gotten ALL 10</li>
    <li> Product is very nice, however the colors received were different from the ones shown in the stock photo.</li>
    <li> i loves these flowers, they are beautiful. but i ordered the one with the torquise flower but when i saw them, it had every color in the packet except torquise. i have black, red, pink, and white. yyyeahh... i would recommend to those who dont mind if you miss a color.</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT!!!  IT worked amazing! i will soooo buy this next time! good quality! So Goood amazing! Perfect Good</li>
    <li> I was looking for them to be bigger.... I will find a use for them being a crafter but they are very tiny and not the pretty vibrate colors shown here.... More pastels and whites.... Very misleading.</li>
    <li> These stay on pretty well when my nail lady put them on, they are pretty big for nails if you don&#x27;t have acrylic or gels I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them, although the colors are great and they really stand out!</li>
    <li> This is ok.  I ordered 2 sets and used them to make stud earings they turned out cute but some of the pieces were incredibly small.  So small that you couldnt make out that they were flowers.  There were about 4 in each set that werent usable.  For the price that is okay just a heads up.</li>
    <li> As pretty as these are, I have very tiny nails and these are quite large. I wish there were different sizes instead of all of them being so big.</li>
    <li> I didnt  like them, sorty</li>
    <li> This are very big but pretty! Good for making your nails look fancy and fun!</li>
    <li> IT WAS A LITTLE BIG FOR SHORT NAILS AND HARD TO STAY ON BUT WITH THE RIGHT GLUE AND LONGER NAILS IT WAS BEAUTIFUL</li>
    <li> Theres not even 20 pieces so i didnt appreciate it and i dont really care because its toi big and was not looking pretty</li>
    <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
    <li> I received these about a week ago, very early considering the estimated time. These will work perfectly for my nails, but I will say they aren&#x27;t very small. I actually got 21 pieces, most of them have at least a pair, a few of them don&#x27;t and thats okay. I definitely love these and just might repurchase when Im out!</li>
    <li> Received my order 2 weeks before earliest estimated arrival date! Holy cow! There was one flower that was not a rose, but that&#x27;s fine it is very pretty. I ordered these for my daughter&#x27;s Easter basket and I only plan on putting them on her thumbs. They would work well on any of my nails.</li>
    <li> They do come with 20 but not the colors in the picture &amp; i was hoping to get those colors ):</li>
    <li> The size is so big.  I think these item isn&#x27;t for nails.  Maybe it is for another things.  But for nails, I don&#x27;t see the use.</li>
    <li> I got them on time and they are really cute but they come in different sizes and I just got 17</li>
    <li> I never got compliments with these on. It&#x27;s not like I was fishing for any, but it&#x27;s nice when I have things on my nails and people like them. I would suggest these for naturally long nails or acrylic nails only because these are pretty big. The green in the picture doesn&#x27;t match up though. The green is like a bright lime color, not a sea foam/minty color. Not sure how to feel about these...</li>
    <li> 4 stars because two colors were switched, I got pink and blue instead of the featured purple and green. Not mad though, pink is my favorite color anyway!...they&#x27;re just like the picture and good size.</li>
    <li> They are super cute and formal i just haven&#x27;t bendable to use them cuz i need to go to dollar tree and get some more glue.</li>
    <li> Can be painted but im not crazy about the few colors i got.... some are so big i used them elsewhere as decorations but they are roses, they are tiny, they come in a tiny baggie and i love the price</li>
    <li> It was okay not really what I expected. I didn&#x27;t receive a red one that&#x27;s the color I was looking forward to</li>
    <li> I just wish they came in more colors and with more than 20. Overall, good product. They came quick, price was good.</li>
    <li> I am a nail artist and i couldn&#x27;t have made these better myself! Super cute and they are going to make for some fast and fun nail art!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for shipping them so fast !</li>
    <li> I wish there were more of them, but these are a pretty good buy.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> So I finally got these and they were exactly what I expected maybe even better. They can fit on your nail if you like really loud and 3d nails then they are perfect. They might seem a little better for say a cellphone case. But other than that the product is really cute and exactly what it said.</li>
    <li> i ordered these roses because i love roses, anyways i just got the 60 flowers instead!! I never orderd the 60 flowers and i am very confused. I want my roses!!!![[ASIN:B008FOT6U8 350buy 20pcs New Colorful Acrylic 3D Rose Flower Slices UV Gel Nail Art Tips DIY Decorations]]</li>
    <li> These are adorably cute!!! but one down fall to them only get a few of them.... not bad for the price they are actually worth it and shipping was decent!!!</li>
    <li> these are bigger than I thought. they are all different. some have glitter and the colors are black, white, blue, yellow, lime green, light blue and bright pink</li>
    <li> They shipped at a good time and there were 20 but they were a little bulky on the nail. It took up most space on the nail looking a little unnatural.</li>
    <li> The thing is when i order the flowers there are one of one color 3 of another i thought that maybe it would be an even amount of each color but no the roses are indeeed cool for nail designs i just wish they were consistant</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed! It is supposed to 20 I only got 10 and they didn&#x27;t even match! It was very cheap but I would still like to get what I played for!!! I am very dilapidated!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Was able to do awesome design with this product it was very nice to work with.</li>
    <li> All I received was green and pink. I bought 2 packages because other people said they didn&#x27;t receive what they wanted so I said oh ill order two since its cheap anyways. However, it skrewed me over because I got all green in one and all pink in the other. I didn&#x27;t receive any purple, red,black or white. very disappointed</li>
    <li> Love these flowers! I did my nails for Valentine&#x27;s Day and got several compliments with these flowers as accents. Shipping was very quick only took a week!</li>
    <li> just as described, these shipped fast and were packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
    <li> They were too hard and didn&#x27;t stay on my nail. There weren&#x27;t enough colors and sizes. I didn&#x27;t like them. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I just opened my package, it seems as if there&#x27;s 2 different kind of flowers here, the kind displayed in the picture nd a smaller white/clear not so cute flower, I do not like these. But the others are ok. The colors aren&#x27;t so great either nd they should at least make sure u have 2 for 1 color not just an odd ball smh</li>
    <li> Just like the picture shows it, it is a good price for a good amount of roses, if you love 3D art to put on your nails, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty. And the size of these are awesome. They just need to come in all different kinds of colors.</li>
    <li> The roses do look exactly as they appear in the pictures.  They are beautiful on nails. I have used them for my nails.  As my nails are long they do fit well with room to spare.They stayed securely on my nails when applying.To get them to stay better, scratch the flatside with something coarse (ie safetypin etc) before applying glue, hold down for one minute. Also, you can cover it with a clear top coat, or a little extra glue on top to secure. The product does take a while to arrive. The only problem I had with this product is that when I applied a black rose to my nail,I had french tips, and when I applied the glue onto the rose, the black ran off the rose all over my nail. So that was truely the only downfall.You can only get that off with nailpolish remover. I have applied it to natural nails, it does stick, depending on how active you are depends on how long they stay on. I applied it to my daughters little finger and it  fit but of course it did not have room for much else. On acrylics they stick longer, even with washing dishes, baths,etc. Just keep in mind this does stick out and it probably will come off, but it is reusable. So far the amount of money you pay its really cute and serves the purpose. It gives a great 3d look. If you are not into bulky nail art this is not the product for you. It only received 3 stars do to the black smearing.</li>
    <li> havent used these because they are way too big and stick out too far. Half of them were broken in the bag when i received them. I would not recommend unless its the look you are going for.</li>
    <li> I WAS //NOT// given the amount promised. I was only given one little bag including 10 pieces. And considering what I paid for them? Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy, don&#x27;t take the chance. They&#x27;ll look cute on nails, but in the end? I only got half of what I paid for. And I&#x27;m fairly upset about it considering $3 is a bit much for paying for something that falls off in the near future, but, I only got HALF of what I was told I would receive. and $3 for 10 pieces? That&#x27;s far from ridiculous, that&#x27;s absurd.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with this, and I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> If it says 20pcs it should include 20 pcs not 10. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying anything else if this is what in gonna get</li>
    <li> This set was supposed to come with 20 but I ordered 2 sets so there should 40 it only came with 20 when I payed for 40</li>
    <li> I bought these not expecting much and I was right.  they r made of a cheap material and come in a tacky packaging. I was very disappointed with this product, the quality was just not up there for me.</li>
    <li> These roses are really cute. They come in pretty colors and they look nice on the nail. The shipping time was long as they had to resend them. It was worth it though... My clients love them! Will order more ☺</li>
    <li> These are really cute, but a few came broken and can  not be used.  For the price and being in China I didn&#x27;t want to ship back.</li>
    <li> I use these on my nails occasionally. They work very well with acrylic nail glue (not so much with just top coat) and they&#x27;re small enough that they don&#x27;t overpower a design; they just enhance it. They fall off pretty easily, so if you work with your hands a lot, either carry around nail glue or use them sparingly. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> They aré beautiful but I have two complains first they only came to me 15 pieces and that sucks!!! Second they are too flat to place on nails so I can use them for decoration ( that wasn&#x27;t the idea but)</li>
    <li> One flower covers my entire thumb with some overlap, so I am not sure how they can sell these as nail art, rediculous!  Even if i had super long nails, these are way too wide to be nail art....  :-(</li>
    <li> i was looking for good flowers and i thought these would be it. their really big and in a weird off peach color, purple, one black, some red , no white and not 20 pcs, never again</li>
    <li> I recieved it today, very fast from when it was expected but I only got 16 roses and only white black purple and blue. Such a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because of the price and I thought they are cute. Later I wondered if the flowers would look cheap. Not the case at all. Just as pictured.</li>
    <li> I love these 3d roses I already used 6 of em and I need more they fit great on nails.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t sztay on nail to bulky</li>
    <li> They are cute, bigger than i expected though</li>
    <li> Very Cute , just like the picture and arrived sooner then expected :-)</li>
    <li> These are cute, but way to big for my nails.  The colors I got were blue, white, red, pink, and black.  They do stay onto your nails with just a top coat, so no nail glue is needed!</li>
    <li> First, I want to begin by saying that the shipping of this item was decent for coming from out of country. When it arrived it was appropriately packaged. There was not a whole lot of product inside but I won&#x27;t complain because I did not pay much at all.&lt;br /&gt;The flowers came in pretty colors and they have nice detail as shown in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;I, personally am only able to use these in a limited capacity because of how large they are. This nail decoration is also quite thick, so be mindful of this when you are considering it for nail design. I knew I would not be able to use this on my natural nail bed but I thought I would use it on a false nail bed as shown in the picture. The only other problem is that they are quite tall and the bottom is completly flat so it won&#x27;t form to the curve of your nail.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent item but it is made a little to large for smaller nail beds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten the acrylic 3D rose nail art gems and they were slightly bigger for just nails but over all they were great, for a great price!</li>
    <li> They were slightly smaller than I expected, but were still cute!</li>
    <li> i got my shipment fast its a little package but i love them great for your n  ails or whatever</li>
    <li> Was kind of hesitate to buy because it had no reviews.... But they are great! Perfect size for nails! And they came way before the estimated arrival date! Will buy again! And they were so cheap!</li>
    <li> These are worth trying! They are a bit larger than I thought but are super fun! Worth getting for the price!</li>
    <li> I occasionally use these on my nails. Quality and shape are very beautiful, they are so cute! I really like it.</li>
    <li> The flowers are smaller than depicted in the photo. They are slightly bigger then a regular nail gem but nonetheless are pretty and a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> First of all it toook foorreeevverrr to get to my house.... (Florida)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then about 5 of the roses were the ones pictures I didn&#x27;t even get good colors...&lt;br /&gt;The rest were these tiny balls of plastic that are supposed to look like roses but they don&#x27;t,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will even ever use them</li>
    <li> i like the fFlower Slices some pcs are too big to place on the nail but they are very nice.</li>
    <li> The roses are nice and very pretty</li>
    <li> This is not as advertised either. Only came with three colors. I wanted what was shown here. Very dissapointed. Waste of money again. Zero stars..but amazons service was outstanding. I was unsatisfied and the took care of it. Well done</li>
    <li> They are really good quality and I love them. They are super cute and I would buy more of them.</li>
</ol>
