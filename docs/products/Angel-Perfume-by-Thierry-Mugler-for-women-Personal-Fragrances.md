      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>This version I got from this company is packaged nicely but it is watery</li>
      <li>Smells great but wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Angel for 10 years and I still love the scent</li>
      <li>this is NOT the genuine product!</li>
      <li>Those of you who think that this Angel smells different, you&#x27;ve got some great sniffers!</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>I could swear its.noy authentic</li>
      <li>The women I sent it to have used Angel for many years.  </li>
      <li>i was able to find</li>
      <li>My top pick.</li>
      <li>Some of what I&#x27;ve read about Angel EDP being too strong has me nervous about applying more than one squirt of the EDT.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>Huge bottle.</li>
      <li>Great deal, just know this isn&#x27;t a regular bottle</li>
      <li>really like both scents, but the Angel EDT was more appealing to me, so I treated myself to a bottle.</li>
      <li>There should be a statement saying that it is not like the original Angel.</li>
      <li>I suspect this is not an original version of the Angel Fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have bend wearing Thierry Mugler for years, the smell is so wonderful, not too strong, this particular one is like the ones I normally buy from Macy&#x27;s or Bloomingdales, I love it, will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Finally I was able to buy my favorite perfume after years of wanting it.</li>
      <li>Packed well and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I ordered it directly from Thierry Mugler, so you might want to make sure who is fulfilling/selling yours.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell you right now</li>
      <li>Great subtle yet rich fragrance.</li>
      <li>The first time I wore the Angel EDT, I&#x27;d applied it to my wrist and to my neck.</li>
      <li>It is NOT the real Angel.  </li>
      <li>Very dissapointing.</li>
      <li>thanks and regards from Brazil.</li>
      <li>bottle came with a spray, this makes it so much easier to use.</li>
      <li>Had I known that this would be so different from the original Angel, I would not have purchased.  </li>
      <li>New!</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this for sone years now and love the idea of purchasing the refill for less cash.</li>
      <li>Literally translated, Eau De Toilette means &amp;#34;toilet water&amp;#34;, using the more traditional meaning of toilet (hygiene).  </li>
      <li>The other nice thing is that you generally use less than you would perfume because the dilution spreads the scent more broadly when sprayed.  </li>
      <li>My momma&#x27;s 2nd bottle lol needless to say she loves it</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.</li>

<li> Honestly, I am NOT sure why there are so many negative reviews about the Eau De Toilette being watery.  </li>
<li> This is to ensure that the smell is long lasting, which it is.  </li>
<li> I have been using this brand for a long time and it just didn&#x27;t hold up</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel eau de toilette: Bergamot, Patchouli, Vanilla, Cedar, White Musk, Peppery Pink Berries, and Candied</li>
<li> It is missing the Patchoulli, so it is a different scent altogether.</li>
<li> Its a copy cat attempt- and not a good one!</li>
<li> Unfortunately nothing like the eau de parfum</li>
<li> Sorry to say, I feel disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> it is awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great but wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> love it. arrived as adsertised</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves the perfume. Came packaged well and intact.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately nothing like the eau de parfum</li>
    <li> Great smelling perfume! I actually bought the refill before this purchase. It&#x27;s good to have both now...especially since this is one of the provocative perfumes I&#x27;ve ever smelled. Yes, it been around for awhile but it&#x27;s a great go to ladies.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal, just know this isn&#x27;t a regular bottle</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling perfume for the fall and winter.  The price is fair, and I got it under prime shipping.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I am NOT sure why there are so many negative reviews about the Eau De Toilette being watery.  Literally translated, Eau De Toilette means &amp;#34;toilet water&amp;#34;, using the more traditional meaning of toilet (hygiene).  The bottle came in the Thierry Mugler box, AND it came with the spray head.  I ordered it directly from Thierry Mugler, so you might want to make sure who is fulfilling/selling yours.  This smells just like the perfume, and the beauty of the eau de toilette is that the water evaporates over the course of the day and the fragrance remains.  This is to ensure that the smell is long lasting, which it is.  The other nice thing is that you generally use less than you would perfume because the dilution spreads the scent more broadly when sprayed.  This is a terrific option for those that cannot afford 2 ounces of the perfume spray.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t in a box and it appeared to be water. I have been using this brand for a long time and it just didn&#x27;t hold up</li>
    <li> great scent lasts all day do not have to respray during the day. great price best i was able to find</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, I feel disappointed with this product. Had I known that this would be so different from the original Angel, I would not have purchased.  Why has it been altered?  It is missing the Patchoulli, so it is a different scent altogether. I won&#x27;t return it, and will definitely not re-order. There should be a statement saying that it is not like the original Angel.</li>
    <li> Amazing. New! Great scent! Awsome price! You would have to be a fool not to get this!</li>
    <li> My top pick. I keep buying this Angel every time I run out. I have been wearing this for sone years now and love the idea of purchasing the refill for less cash.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and came on time!</li>
    <li> It is NOT the real Angel.  The women I sent it to have used Angel for many years.  Both knew immediately that this was not what they knew Angel to be.  Very dissapointing.</li>
    <li> I have bend wearing Thierry Mugler for years, the smell is so wonderful, not too strong, this particular one is like the ones I normally buy from Macy&#x27;s or Bloomingdales, I love it, will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle came with a spray, this makes it so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both love the smell of this!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom, She said she loves it.</li>
    <li> The deliver time was perfect and the product just match my expectiations. I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks and regards from Brazil.</li>
    <li> Finally I was able to buy my favorite perfume after years of wanting it. Great price. Huge bottle. This will last me a while. Great subtle yet rich fragrance.</li>
    <li> Those of you who think that this Angel smells different, you&#x27;ve got some great sniffers! You&#x27;re correct. I didn&#x27;t realize until after I&#x27;d done some research on the two fragrances that the Angel eau de toilette has different notes than the eau de parfum. Here&#x27;s a lil somethin&#x27; taken from Sephora...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel eau de partum: Bergamot, Hedione, Helional, Honey, Dewberry, Red Berries, Vanilla, Caramel, Patchouli, Chocolate, Coumarin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel eau de toilette: Bergamot, Patchouli, Vanilla, Cedar, White Musk, Peppery Pink Berries, and Candied Praline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like both scents, but the Angel EDT was more appealing to me, so I treated myself to a bottle. Like the Angel EDP, each time I take a whiff, I get something different. The first time I wore the Angel EDT, I&#x27;d applied it to my wrist and to my neck. I smelled my wrist and got white musk. When I&#x27;d fan my collar, I&#x27;d smell the praline and berries. Whatever decides to waft up my nose, it smells DELICIOUS and absolutely wonderbar!!! Some of what I&#x27;ve read about Angel EDP being too strong has me nervous about applying more than one squirt of the EDT. But, one quirt seems to be all I need for at the end of the day, I can still smell it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Angel for 10 years and I still love the scent</li>
    <li> I suspect this is not an original version of the Angel Fragrance. I have bought it at Macy&#x27;s before and when I wore it people would rave about the scent. This version I got from this company is packaged nicely but it is watery n nobody comments on the scent. I want to return it. I paid over fifty dollars and am.very dissapointed!!! I could swear its.noy authentic</li>
    <li> I have Been wearing Angel since 2002 and I can tell you right now this is NOT the genuine product! Its a copy cat attempt- and not a good one!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume at a great price.  Packed well and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of compliments when I wear &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34;, ..:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Alien&amp;#34; is also a big winner!!&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder~~</li>
    <li> My momma&#x27;s 2nd bottle lol needless to say she loves it</li>
    <li> Ordered the toilette thinking it may be close to the Theirry Mulger perfume. Not even close...it is awful. I tried to return it but the site I purchased from wouldn&#x27;t give me a return option. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. You get what you pay for...buy the perfume.</li>
