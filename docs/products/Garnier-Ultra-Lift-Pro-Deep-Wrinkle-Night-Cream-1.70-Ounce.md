      <li>Skin feels great right after applying as well as when I wake up in the a.m.</li>
      <li>my face is very smooth and the crease is almost gone, it has also helped with my neck and chest area.</li>
      <li>It applies easily and absorb nicely to my skin.</li>
      <li>very good price  makes my face soooo soft</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS NIGHT CREAM,</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>its mostly on my neck and a bit on my chest.</li>
      <li>My skin is much more hydrated and looks much more recovered in the morning</li>
      <li>Excellent facial cream.</li>
      <li>Smell is ok, did not hydrate as much as I would expect (and what I have experienced) from a night cream.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have found that doing this helps the cream absorb and hydrate my skin much better.</li>
      <li>Love Garnier  products.</li>
      <li>- Lovely texture</li>
      <li>to the point where I feel comfortable just using a BB cream or sometimes no foundation at all!</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer to maintain soft skin.</li>
      <li>I bought the eye gel and cream too, and that seemed fine.      </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not had one issue with this at all surprisingly also when I put this on at night</li>
      <li>This is a creamy colored, lightly fragrant face cream.</li>
      <li>once it&#x27;s absorbed, it&#x27;s light &amp; looks like it&#x27;s doing its magic.</li>
      <li>Velvety, rich on skin...</li>
      <li>this is a VERY potent cream and is not for the sensitive skinned.</li>
      <li>Great stuff for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery, I love this product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this night cream</li>
      <li>This night cream is not greasy and appears to do a good job although I don&#x27;t know that it has actually reduced any wrinkles.</li>
      <li>uncommon active ingredients</li>
      <li>I think this particular formulation is being discontinued so I will be buying many jars before it disappears.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M VERY SENSITIVE TO MANY TYPES OF FACE CREAMS.  </li>
      <li>SHOULD IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbed into my skin.  </li>
      <li>but I feel its completely absorbed into my skin.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper than some other night creams and works great.  </li>
      <li>I honestly can barely see the wrinkle anymore, it has really smoothed out.</li>
      <li>I have combo skin with an oily T zone and very large pores, this does not clog my pores and does not feel greasy...</li>
      <li>Keeping skin well hydrated makes all the difference between a slightly wrinkled dehydrated apple and a nice smooth one.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for quite awhile really like the texture and that it absorbs into my skin quickly and is not greasy</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad because it made such a difference!</li>
      <li>(the night cream or drinking 8 glasses of water a day), but doing both in combination really helped!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin and when I first used it, it seems to just sit on my face.  </li>
      <li>First of all, let me be up front, I&#x27;m 32 and don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t necessarily say what helped more</li>
      <li>I think the earlier you start using night creams for wrinkle prevention, the better.</li>
      <li>on my 3rd jar of Garnier and at first I loved it better than anything I&#x27;ve used but in the last month I&#x27;ve developed red, crusty blotches on my forehead and my face is shedding like snow.  </li>
      <li>Certainly I&#x27;d use an alternative if anticipating a &amp;#34;dating&amp;#34; envenvironment.</li>
      <li>The supplier sells it at a very  competitive price.</li>
      <li>this night cream absorbs really well on my skin.  </li>
      <li>You would be just as well off buying a Vaseline product which is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
      <li>but I also didn&#x27;t get much moisture from this &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; either.  </li>
      <li>This is going straight into the trash.</li>
      <li>I see alot of others didnt have much results and</li>
      <li>as I just came  upon it  anf decided to purchase it since it was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>This even feels better going on, a really thick and rich cream compared to.most others I have tried.</li>
      <li>Much more so than other ultra-lift products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The cream itself is very hydrating and fast absorbing, it feels soft and nourishing on my skin.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of choices these last months!)</li>
      <li>ago after having been so amazed by the results of my first experimental purchase.</li>
      <li>Ingredients\\&quot; listed on the back have caused many people to have the same reactions.  </li>
      <li>Now, I really don&#x27;t care for the scent at all, but I&#x27;m not going to rate it lower for that because I&#x27;m a (60 year old!)</li>
      <li>if you have sensitive skin, STAY AWAY!!</li>
      <li>I am back to Nature&#x27;s Gate natural creams and my face is looking better after 2 weeks of going back to these natural products..</li>
      <li>The box looked very old and used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 29 years old and started to notice a big wrinkle forming right in between my brows-</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 of these just ran out of the first jar - I opened the 2nd jar and liquid went everywhere</li>
      <li>Red rash all over my face the first time.</li>
      <li>While it was quite different than my original purchase, it worked equally well and as promoted!</li>
      <li>I have tried a couple other brands in the same price range and found this one to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s about 1-2 dollars less here than at the store if you need to qualify for free shipping.</li>
      <li>it is well absorbed even in the oily areas  - tamed my dry flakey brows...</li>
      <li>I have a few very fine lines starting</li>
      <li>Turned 58 this year and had read positive recommendations about using it for wrinkles and overall skin smoothing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;m overly sensitive to it&#x27;s exfoliating capabilities.  </li>
      <li>People have guessed my age the highest so far 32, but I am 44.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can see a difference in my skin by adding this as my night cream.  I won&#x27;t be looking for another for a long time.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in wrinkled/torn box without a seal on it.  Product looked used.  Returned it with no problems.</li>
    <li> On September 30, 2009 I purchased Garnier Nutritioniste Ultra Lift Pro Deep Wrinkle Night Cream - 1.7 oz and the 1.6 oz size for day time.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these products.  They do not work.  You would be just as well off buying a Vaseline product which is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Ok. First of all, let me be up front, I&#x27;m 32 and don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles. I have a few very fine lines starting and I&#x27;m looking to prevent rather than reduce. So I have no clue if this stuff reduces wrinkles. I also obviously don&#x27;t know if this stuff has prevented any wrinkles either. I mean, how would I? All I can say is that I have no more lines than when I started using this.    Here is what I CAN say:  Pros  - Smells nice, I like the smell a lot.  - Lovely texture, this is what I expect from a night cream  - I have combo skin with an oily T zone and very large pores, this does not clog my pores and does not feel greasy... it is well absorbed even in the oily areas  - tamed my dry flakey brows... my eyebrows are flakey. Nothing helps them. Except this.  - Makes my skin feel soft and smooth    cons  - Hard to tell if its \\&quot;working\\&quot; but thats partially to do with me  - Not dermatologist recommended  - untested (unproven?) uncommon active ingredients</li>
    <li> this stuff was AWFUL!! if you have sensitive skin, STAY AWAY!! i immediately had an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital to get a shot and allergy meds. my eyes were swollen shut and my skin was red and itchy. this is a VERY potent cream and is not for the sensitive skinned. buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I can see a huge difference and think it&#x27;s a great product, I would recommend that you try it out.</li>
    <li> I like the weight of this cream which I used both day and night. The supplier sells it at a very  competitive price. I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I been using garnier products and they usually work, they&#x27;re not so expensive and they do work.</li>
    <li> Feels great. Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement but I haven&#x27;t used it for very long</li>
    <li> Great product.  Much cheaper than some other night creams and works great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I look much younger than my 61 years.</li>
    <li> I never get rashes, knock on wood.  I have had one for a few days now.  its soooooo itchy and its hard not to scratch it.  its mostly on my neck and a bit on my chest. Going to get something to sooth it.  I bought the eye gel and cream too, and that seemed fine.      I am a little creeped out that it made me get a rash.  I mean it must have some serious stuff in there because I next to never get rashes.  I do not have sensitive skin.  so very weird and makes me wonder what the hell is in this stuff...      even tho the eye cream works, i wonder whats in it too...    i think i will go back to something less toxic, like aveda or something.</li>
    <li> This is a creamy colored, lightly fragrant face cream. It applies easily and absorb nicely to my skin. My skin feels hydrated when I use this product. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t feel any tighten effect and don&#x27;t notice any change to my skin when I use it. I would purchase this product for the purpose of moistening my skin and only when it&#x27;s on deep discount.</li>
    <li> I like it but will not reorder.  It&#x27;s a little heavy and dare I say greasy.  Much more so than other ultra-lift products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly disappointed with this product. Sure, it smells great and its fancy jar makes me feel like I&#x27;m putting $100 cream on my face. However, it just does not moisturize well. Compared to my no frills Cetaphil, the Ultra-Lift cream does not stack up. A moisturizer&#x27;s ability to, well, moisturize should be its strength. Keeping skin well hydrated makes all the difference between a slightly wrinkled dehydrated apple and a nice smooth one. This doesn&#x27;t plump up my apple. Also, it had no effect on the light wrinkling around my eyes or any tight (i.e. dry) areas on my face. Alas!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the cream and my skin feels softer.  It arrived when I was told it would.</li>
    <li> this night cream absorbs really well on my skin.  It does not sit on the skin but I feel its completely absorbed into my skin.  I have tried a couple other brands in the same price range and found this one to be my favorite.</li>
    <li> There is nothing about Garnier products that I do not like.  I am a woman of 60 and I look 40, with no surgical intervention, because of products like this.  Ladies give it a try.</li>
    <li> very good price  makes my face soooo soft</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer to maintain soft skin.</li>
    <li> Actually I&#x27;m writing about Garnier-Lift with SPF 15 FPS.  I&#x27;m male, 54.  Over the last 20 years I&#x27;ve spent up to $5,000.00 a year on skin products and facials.  Some creams (La Prarie) I&#x27;ve spent $300.00 for a jar this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar of Garnier and at first I loved it better than anything I&#x27;ve used but in the last month I&#x27;ve developed red, crusty blotches on my forehead and my face is shedding like snow.  I&#x27;m going to my pharmacist today and will take the Garnier with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;m overly sensitive to it&#x27;s exfoliating capabilities.  I loved the product but this is something to consider.  I&#x27;ve never had a skin reaction like this since I was 19 and tried to use Nair instead of shaving ...DON&#x27;T Ever EVER try that!!  LOL</li>
    <li> Excellent facial cream. Excellent price, too.</li>
    <li> Feels really good going on. Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. Skin feels great right after applying as well as when I wake up in the a.m.</li>
    <li> Velvety, rich on skin...once it&#x27;s absorbed, it&#x27;s light &amp; looks like it&#x27;s doing its magic. Winter, Spring or Summer—this cream works wonderfully, without blocking pores. For years I&#x27;d been looking for a great night cream...search is over!</li>
    <li> no issues with this on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I think this was the second &amp;#34;Garnier&amp;#34; product I bought a few mos. ago after having been so amazed by the results of my first experimental purchase. I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed with this one either! While it was quite different than my original purchase, it worked equally well and as promoted! Now, I really don&#x27;t care for the scent at all, but I&#x27;m not going to rate it lower for that because I&#x27;m a (60 year old!) male, and have no right to complain about a product formulated for women being too &amp;#34;old lady/flowery&amp;#34;. I go with what works, and this is a very effective product in my view. Certainly I&#x27;d use an alternative if anticipating a &amp;#34;dating&amp;#34; envenvironment. (I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of choices these last months!)</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews BUT whenever I buy a product I always want to check to see what other people are saying about it.  Anyways, hear is my two cents about this product.  Considering everybody&#x27;s skin type is different and what works for some doesn&#x27;t work for all this product may work for some people but It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin and when I first used it, it seems to just sit on my face.  It didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbed into my skin.  I have used numerous other facial creams before but I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.  I didn&#x27;t get any rashes like other people complained but I also didn&#x27;t get much moisture from this &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; either.  Good luck if you decide to try!</li>
    <li> I just connected it and it does work. To short of a time to rate it any further.  Will know in a few months if it keeps working.</li>
    <li> I found this at Grocery Outlet for $6.99 and thought I would give it a try. I hadnt looked at any of the reviews yet as I just came  upon it  anf decided to purchase it since it was reasonably priced. I see alot of others didnt have much results and some had allergic reactions, but I have had nothing but the best results with this. I am 47 and was beginning to get that deep crease between my eyes from squinting, it was quite noticeable however since I started using this my face is very smooth and the crease is almost gone, it has also helped with my neck and chest area. I have very sensitive skin and have not had one issue with this at all surprisingly also when I put this on at night, I lightly dampen my face, take a small bit of this with my wet fingertips and pat it on all over, then I gently rub it in and again lightly wet my hands and pat my face down. I have found that doing this helps the cream absorb and hydrate my skin much better. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Too Waxy and you can get it at Walmart Cheaper</li>
    <li> I like the day time same stuff with sunblock but decided to try this one out too. Seems about the same and so like it but wish now it had the sunblock too.</li>
    <li> I do not know what was in the jar, but it was NOT the product I have used for several years.  The box looked very old and used.  Do not waste your money with this.  I contacted customer service.  They told me to throw it away after 10 days.  I did this.  My money was returned.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for dry skin.  Also a great texture that even works under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using this cream for years. It really works.</li>
    <li> Very good product really work!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. People have guessed my age the highest so far 32, but I am 44. I&#x27;m good with that.</li>
    <li> The product was as described and as always a good price. I recommend using this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old and started to notice a big wrinkle forming right in between my brows- ugh! It made me look angry and stressed all the time and I just wanted it to be gone! So I bought this night cream and I&#x27;m so glad because it made such a difference! The cream itself is very hydrating and fast absorbing, it feels soft and nourishing on my skin. I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to it at all, and the night cream is so thick that a jar will last you a long time. I started using this night cream while also consciously increasing my water intake (drinking water helps your skin stay hydrated and younger looking!) so I can&#x27;t necessarily say what helped more (the night cream or drinking 8 glasses of water a day), but doing both in combination really helped! I honestly can barely see the wrinkle anymore, it has really smoothed out. My skin is much more hydrated and looks much more recovered in the morning (I used to wake up looking like a cave woman!) to the point where I feel comfortable just using a BB cream or sometimes no foundation at all! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this night cream, I wish I started using night cream sooner. I think the earlier you start using night creams for wrinkle prevention, the better. I would highly recommend this cream for someone just starting an anti-aging routine because it&#x27;s nourishing, it works and it&#x27;s also relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Smell is ok, did not hydrate as much as I would expect (and what I have experienced) from a night cream. I do not have sensitive skin-I can usually put whatever on my face. I have never had a reaction to any facial product in the past. However, like others who have commented, I have used this twice and had reactions both times. Red rash all over my face the first time. As I write, I have a red rash around my mouth and chin that is itchy and swollen. Others have commented about the ingredients and the history/uses of them. I cannot comment on that, but wanted to warn others of my experience. This is going straight into the trash. Have a great day :)</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years. For the price, I like it and it&#x27;s about 1-2 dollars less here than at the store if you need to qualify for free shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because in the past it has been wonderful,, but this new stuff in the square pots caused me to have an allergic reaction,, swollen itchy skin round the eyes,, painful and miserable, made me look like a zombie from a movie. Took antihystamines and hid.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, I love this product.</li>
    <li> Ill be oredering more,,</li>
    <li> My wife is using this cream for years now. In recent weeks it was not available where we normally get it from.&lt;br /&gt;This cream we received does not even come close to the one my wife had for years. Most likely NOT genuine Garnier. It burns and has a completely different cream structure. This stuff is very bad. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I recently bought Garnier Ultra-Lift Moisturizer and was excited to have a little money to buy it.  Turned 58 this year and had read positive recommendations about using it for wrinkles and overall skin smoothing.  Surprise!!  I developed a nasty rash on my neck,and some on my face: basically, Contact Dermatitis...severe itching, redness, rash that made me very miserable.  I subsequently did some research and the three \\&quot;Active Ingredients\\&quot; listed on the back have caused many people to have the same reactions.  There are some medical concerns about \\&quot;Avobenzone\\&quot; also, and its use as a sunscreen.  Just be careful if you buy this product and try it on a small area first.  I had a couple of unpleasant nights and  days because of it.</li>
    <li> I received this product last night and was appalled to see the condition of the box.  It looked like it went through regifting at least a number of times.  The box didn&#x27;t even have the cellaphane wrap as is the case when you purchase it in the store.  Very disappointing and will not be ordering items such as this anymore.</li>
    <li> I find it a bit runny.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS NIGHT CREAM, I&#x27;M VERY SENSITIVE TO MANY TYPES OF FACE CREAMS.  BUT THIS ONE NEVER EVER IRRITATE MY EYES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD  SUGGEST ANYONE WANTING TO TRY THIS DEEP WRINKLE CREAM, SHOULD IT&#x27;S WORTH THE MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRINKLES DO DIMINISH YOU WILL SEE RESULTS GUARANTEED.</li>
    <li> the lids on 2 of the bottles were cracked with item seeping out.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for quite awhile really like the texture and that it absorbs into my skin quickly and is not greasy</li>
    <li> Love it! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the way it goes on the skin and it had a slight tightnening but drying effect.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and wanted the lift but it didn&#x27;t feel good on the skin..I am back to Nature&#x27;s Gate natural creams and my face is looking better after 2 weeks of going back to these natural products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier is overated and a waste of money.  I have not had any luck with any of their products except for the hair coloring..</li>
    <li> I think the quality is not that great. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Product was supposed to be new but was used I opened jar and big portion was removed not new jar</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these just ran out of the first jar - I opened the 2nd jar and liquid went everywhere and the contents looked like they had broken down and didn&#x27;t smell right - must have been very old and too late to return.</li>
    <li> Love Garnier  products. I ordered 3 products and I am very pleased with each one. I don&#x27;t feel you have to spend a fortune to find beauty creams that work.</li>
    <li> I spent a month using this on one side of my face and Avon Anew Thermalift on the other. By the end of my trial, it was clear that the Garnier side has fewer and less deep wrinkles on my upper cheeks and around my eyes. This even feels better going on, a really thick and rich cream compared to.most others I have tried. And it smells amazing. I think this particular formulation is being discontinued so I will be buying many jars before it disappears.</li>
    <li> This night cream is not greasy and appears to do a good job although I don&#x27;t know that it has actually reduced any wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great item, have been using this forever and i cannot find in the stores.</li>
