<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT VALUE!  I paid for the entire kit what I would have paid for a lip brush!  BUY THIS NOW!!!</li>
    <li> I bought my brushes around June 2011. I still have them and they&#x27;re still in great shape and rarely ever shed. The only downside I had was the 2 larger brushes and the eyebrow/lash comb have came off their handles not long after having them. The glue sucks. I guess the larger brushes are a bit more like small kabuki brushes now. I did love the set for the price and probably will buy again as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Well, there are 12 brushes but they are not good quality. It&#x27;s made by cheap plastic and I don&#x27;t think they will last long.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a nice, inexpensive brush set for a while. This set is NOT cheaply made - bonus! I would recommend this seller &amp; product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these make-up brushes as a starter set for my 14 year old niece. The brushes are nice and a good quality.  For the price, this set s a great bargain.  The case is not as nice as I hoped, however for the money I paid, it&#x27;s still a great buy.</li>
    <li> I only use about 4 brushes but I&#x27;m not a makeup expert.  They were what I expected.  I would say overall just good quality.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. The price was great, the delivery was fast, and the brushes themselves are in great condition. I&#x27;ve used them everyday for the past few months. UPDATE It&#x27;s been five years, and I still have some of these brushes! Thinking about ordering them again soon.</li>
    <li> i ordered these brushes Monday just receive them today very satisfied i love them they are perfect for my new collection of make up i just bought amazon does business very well and i will recommend the brushes and the website!! i am truly pleased</li>
    <li> This are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don&#x27;t know how anyone can say they&#x27;re chesp; they&#x27;re super soft and seem very high quality to me. They all work great, and I know I&#x27;m going to use them tons (I&#x27;ve already used them twice today)!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking to add to my make up brush collection and try different ones, after reading tons of reviews i decided to jsut get these. they came packaged nicely, but right when i opened them the head of the eyebrow brush fell off, nothing a drop of glue didnt fix. i have washed the whole set twice and have had no shedding at all. theyre not the *best quality but i would reccommend them.</li>
    <li> I saw the price on these brushes and thought id give them a try. But after just one use I became frusterated with my purchase. The brushes were stiff, scrachy, and cheaply made! I would NOT recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t want their faces being scrached up by the brushes.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes and case.</li>
    <li> Obviously didn&#x27;t expect to get genuine leather but the case these brushes come in is poor quality. I got it as a gift and as soon as i opened it the tape tore the \\&quot;finish\\&quot; of the case off. Also the plastic covering on the inside is wrinkled and fliiiimsy. the brushed though are nice..especially the eye brushes...i would buy the brushes again but definitely not the case.</li>
    <li> these brushes are amazing! i bought them about 4 months ago and i fell in love instantly. I was looking for something on the cheaper side because ive spent so much on brushes before. These are worth it and i would recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> I think this is an awesome brush set. I just received it and haven&#x27;t used it a ton but it works really well. I use the flat shader brush a lot for my makeup and it doesn&#x27;t pick up color too well but it does work it you constantly go over it.  I used the eyeliner brush and it works really well. It picks up pigment easily and stays on strong. I was happy to see some nice, big fluffy brushes in there for blush and it even comes with a mascara brush which is the only thing I&#x27;m hesitant to use because I would want to wash after each use and that would waste mascara.  But in total, I really love how cheap this was and even though I probably won&#x27;t use everything (just because of what makeup I like to use and what I use a brush for--I don&#x27;t need the blush brushes or the mascara brush and I already have an eyebrow comb) it is really nice to have a great variety of quality brushes, and the packaging smells like... leather I guess, and it is really nice to own a collection of brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional make up artist and I absolutely loved these brushes. I am very big on brushes and I am always searching for brushes to add to my kit. I find these to be great for anyone who wears make up regularly and even other make up artists just to have some extra brushes on hand. I read other reviews and saw that some mentioned that the brushes did have an unpleasant smell, but it&#x27; probably the packaging and it&#x27;s nothing a good brush cleaner can&#x27;t fix. Some bristles did come out when I cleaned them, but it was nothing drastic or noticeably. The brushes themselves are soft and not stiff, which is something I absolutely hate. I would use these on a client and I think they&#x27;re also great for new make up artists who are just starting out in their career. Overall I was pleased and I would recommend this brush set to others.</li>
    <li> I got them on time. 2 day shipping. they look great but the sleeve they came in smells weird. sort of chemical-ish smell. the brushes themselves do not have an odor. I&#x27;m still yet to use them, but I&#x27;m sure they will work like a dream, considering I am an amateur make up artist (Hint: Practice on myself :) ).</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I got them mainly for the big powder brushes, and the angle brushes. But everything else was a bonus! The brushes came looking exactly like they do in the pictures, and are so soft! They apply my makeup beautifully, the way I want them to! They do shed a few hairs here and there, but it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re shedding on your face, or hairs or coming out every five seconds. Maybe one or two hairs a week. Max.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes feel sturdy and strong (I even tried to break one and couldn&#x27;t!). I love them, definitively worth the money! Especially at so cheap, and they came within 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice, however, that the brushes did smell like a strong paint smell, which I&#x27;m weird, and kind of like. But the smell faded after like 30 minutes, no joke. The hair on the powder brushes could be a little denser, but they&#x27;re so soft, it&#x27;s not really an issue. Besides, I&#x27;m comparing it to an Elf flat top brush, which is really dense, so it&#x27;s no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these brushes!!</li>
    <li> The product shipped very quickly which I loved. The brushes are soft and efficient. Only thing is that some of the brushes are the same.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BRUSHES!!! THEY ARE VERY SOFT, EASY TO CLEAN, GREAT TO APPLY MAKEUP, THEY DONT SHED ANY HAIRS OR ANYTHING. THE PACKAGING WAS GREAT. EVERYTHING IN EXCELLENT CONDITION!!DELIVERY WAS GREAT TOO.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these brushes, the price is amazing and you def gt them! I am very happy I bought these!</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived extremely quick.  The brush bag had small tears in it and the metal closures were a little rusted.  The large brushes are very soft, but aren&#x27;t very dense, so it too soft to use effectively for blush or powder foundation.  They are good for finishing powder though.  The small brushes are excellent quality.</li>
    <li> can we say \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;... i definitely did not expect these brushed to look so good!!! super excited to learn with my new kit...*smiles*    Sincerely,    1 Satisfied Customer</li>
    <li> This selection is not the best, but it will do the job.  Case had a strong chemical smell when it was taken out of the plastic bag it came in, but that quickly dissipated.</li>
    <li> Well you get what you pay for, I love the brow brushes! They fall off the stick easy so I had to super glue some back, the bug brushes I never use.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these brushes!!! Before purchasing them I actually compared my options and still chose to go with this particular set because of how they were made. I am so happy for making the decision because they have held up quite well. I use mineral foundation and mineral blush so I was quite picky on the brushes I was going to order. Here is my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush is just fabulous and does exactly what I had anticipated. The blush brush is wonderful and it works superb with mineral blush. The eyeshadow brushes work very well with the eye shadow that I use as it is one of the better eye shadows on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that I did learn a long time ago is to be sure to clean your make up brushes with a very good shampoo every two weeks and let them air dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set of brush only to realized that I don&#x27;t need most of the brushes included on the package so I decided to return it.  This set of brush is for make up artist.</li>
    <li> wells the brushes were kind of cheap, the bristles on the blush brushes kept falling off. If you are looking for play around brushes for your daughter then these will be great. But if you&#x27;re serious about your makeup brushes then don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> good quality brushes, very soft, all the necessary make up brushes were in the set. good price, did not shred.</li>
    <li> The brushes for me are a compromise. They apply my make up better than some of the free ones I got from Ulta, but they really aren&#x27;t as good as paying $5 per brush, or whatever some of these really nice places charge. For me they work well and are pretty soft considering the price. Overall I am very happy with the product. Just a reminder there is no foundation brush, so if you want that in your set, I&#x27;d look at one of the other kits. I had no problem with the case, like some people, and find it convenient to use for travel.</li>
    <li> The price is awesome for these brushes!!!  The quality is great and the variety is amazing.  I use these daily and they are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I bought this set recently and it arrived quickly. No rust or any other defects. So far the bristles seem to be staying where they belong. The blush brush and powder brush are really too soft (not enough bristles) to be much use. There are no soft shadow brushes at all. More like various sizes and shapes similar in stiffness to a concealer brush. Probably would be great for applying cream shadows. A couple of them are probably going to be useful but I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this particular set.</li>
    <li> Hello brush set that came with my Marinello kit haha. They hold shadow pretty well, and my school probably charges way more for these than amazon does.</li>
    <li> these brushes are the WORST. i would have never ordered these make up brushes if i knew the quality of them would be so poor. giving them 1 star is a compliment. when i use the brushes they leave brissles on my face because of how poor quality they are. i do NOT recomend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> They shed a bit but for the price you really cant complain. They apply and blend the makeup well. Just wish it included a foundation brush.</li>
    <li> I liked the set for the number of brushes and different types included. Yes the set has a plastic smell but really who cares? The only disappointing thing about these brushes was that I couldn&#x27;t find a soft eyeshadow brush. The brushes are too stiff for eyeshadow so it barely picks up any color. I thought it was the new eyeshadow palette I bought, but no I tried applying the shadow again with another soft eyeshadow brush I already had, and I realized it was just these brushes that were the problem. I agree with a previous reviewer who said these would be good for applying cream makeup or concealer but not eyeshadow. Still this was not a total waste and I could use these brushes for other makeup. Also they do not shed or lose hairs easily so that is another plus.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes on the 14th and they came today, the 17th. can you say super fast shipping! the case is so nice, soft leather and compact, not much bigger than an evening clutch purse. i love that the case has two snaps and, there is a plastic flap to protect the brushes which is also nice. the brushes are amazing! very soft, and the handles are long. these brushes are also lighter than some other brushes i have used. this helps me because i tend to have a heavy hand. for the price, theyre worth it.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good brushes but there were two problems with them them. First of all, the smell emerging from this pouch has soaked into these brushes leaving them to smell horrible. Since when are your makeup brushes supposed to give you a piercing headache? Second of all,these are not the same brushes that are shown in the picture. The angle brush is very stiff and not at all soft. Otherwise, the three rounded brushes are quite nice.I hope after letting the pouch, which is quite nice, set out for a few days the smell will fade.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes. They&#x27;re perfect and great quality. The case it comes in is well made which is a plus! If you&#x27;re looking for makeup brushes that are great for a cheap price get these!</li>
    <li> Brushes - the hair of the bushes was of nice soft quality.  The cut of the brushes was somewhat ratty.  Worth the $10 -$12 paid but not worth the $35 value advertised.  Would not have purchased item if seen first.  Very strange assortment of brushes.  Too many brushes for eyes but no contour brush for the face.  Shipping - Very poor. For a 4 oz package $6 dollars is excessive PLUS 2 weeks is very slow.  2-3 postage stamps could have gotten it here in 3 days. Don&#x27;t like \\&quot;SmartPost\\&quot;</li>
    <li> These brushes are kind of flimsy, not real happy with them. I guess for the price I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for everyday make-up and it is perfect! The brushes are very soft and the packaging and case were beautiful! Five stars!</li>
    <li> I got this set for Christmas 2011 as a gift from someone who isn&#x27;t very well versed in brushes. That being said, I absolutely adore a few of them, mainly the concealer brush and eyeshadow brushes. The shadow brushes are very soft and hold pigments well. However, I have started to notice that some of the bristles are pulling out at odd angles. The concealer brush is fabulous, it cleans very very well, I have absolutely nothing but good to say for it. The powder and blush brushes are the biggest disappointment, they  hold pigment well but are so stiff. They feel sort of like hair that&#x27;s been sprayed stiff, absolutely awful for precise application. I find them shedding a lot as well. The case of this product is cheap, my snaps ripped off and I&#x27;m left with two big holes on the side of it. The fan brush is also very stiff and too wide for my taste. The thickness wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much if the bristles didn&#x27;t fray off in every direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re looking for a good price on a concealer brush and starter eyeshadow brushes, this product is worth it for those alone.</li>
    <li> the carrying case is nice enough but after about 6 month, washing about once a month, the brushes started to fall apart.  not the bristles themselves, the attachment from the metal to the wood.  I superglued it back and was happy.  Honestly i have mostly switched to a NICE bh cosmetics set that was around 20$ and it is much much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this as a starter set.</li>
    <li> Since I got this set for 10 (shipping included) I can&#x27;t complain about the value. You get what you pay for people. However this set is pretty good. I did notice the smell but I just used some conditioner to wash out the brushes and let them air dry. Smell gone. People forget that the leather material is fake and when its in a factory in plastic it tends to leave a foul odor. It happened as well with a luggage set I bought. Just let it air out and it will be fine. I had some issues with the angle brush but otherwise nice set. For those who bought this and want to complain, please go and by yourself a professional set $100 plus if that is \\&quot;quality\\&quot; you are supposedly looking for. Don&#x27;t buy something cheap off amazon and then get mad that it&#x27;s not what you thought it was....thank you :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a Christmas present and my sister was so excited, she started using them right away.  It&#x27;s a good product at a cost effective price.</li>
    <li> The brushes came with a nice case. The material is soft but not really good quality.  The shipping is, however, very fast.</li>
    <li> The brushes are ok. Whenever I use them, some of the hair falls out of them :( I dont think they will last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush set for about six months. The brushes are made of a fine quality. I use this set everyday. I love this set! Great gift!</li>
    <li> This was well worth my purchase. Sure you may notice a \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot;, but I found it to be more reassuring than not. These brushes pick up the color much better than my old brushes. I have noticed a nice smoother finish than my other cheapies. And the folding carrying case is perfect for my constant packing back and forth (not to mention just enough room to add my eyeliner and a couple other brushes)! Now I am not no makeup guru by any means, however for a person in the service industry where you need to be presentable these are a 5/5 by me!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are of good quality. Really soft bristles, solid wood handles. The onlydown side is the the snaps were rusty.</li>
    <li> I ordered several of these 13 piece makeup brush set with the case for Christmas stocking gifts. The order arrived quickly. Everyone loved them! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter, who wanted \\&quot;real\\&quot; makeup and makeup paraphernalia. Definitely cannot beat the price, and they are relatively well-made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s a year later, and all of them (that we have not lost) have withstood the test of time and usage, including a major international move. None of the brushes have shed really. The case was never very fancy, but it is easy to wipe clean and still folds up and closes nicely. I should mention, too, that my daughter is almost five, and she and her girlfriends have been hard on these brushes. Still pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> i ordered these brushes with realistic expectations according to the price..however i don&#x27;t feel that you should spend any amount of money for makeup brushes that smell profusly of a strong chemical smell..i tried washing them and still, the smell is very strong. I used one of the bronzer brushes, and the hairs started to fall out right away. pass on these!</li>
    <li> i got these brushes as a gift, and i think they are incredible. granted, i&#x27;m a teenage girl, and i see by some of the reveiws that these brushes are okay to play with, but i strongly disagree. i didn&#x27;t notice any bristles falling out, and the brushes are super duper soft. these are all the essential brushes.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It is exactly what you pay for. The price is amazing for the quality of these brushes. I only con about it is smell but I got rid of it, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this item two days ago &amp; the days it was suppose to arrive was the 20th-23rd. But i got it on the 17th! Can we say super fast shipping! (: Anyways, i love all of the brushes, im 17 years old &amp; i bought this to go with my BHCosmetics 120 Palette &amp; i love it so much. The brushes are very soft &amp; theres everything i need in here for a great price. I would definetly recommend this to anyone who would like a quality brush set for a decent price. (:</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes!! I&#x27;ve never gotten brushes myself, only as gifts, and I&#x27;ve always known for a pack like this to be super expensive, so I have to admit I was a bit scared. But as soon as I got them, I absolutely adored them!! They&#x27;re so soft, and it&#x27;s easy storage with the case too!! Highly recommend~</li>
    <li> excelente producto de buena calidad, lo uso a diario y me han resultado muy buenos y practicos para llevar de viaje el estuce no permite que se dañen y que puedan ser transportados sin problema. gracias</li>
    <li> Blush and powder brush are too soft - some of the brushes can be utilized for backup.  Not for serious makeup artists, though - buy these for your daughter or niece who wants to play around.</li>
    <li> First of all, the shipping was outstanding. I mean WOW!! they came like a couple of days after i ordered.   Second of all, the brushes these are the brushes that are included:  Powder Brush, Blush Brush, Fan Brush, Concealer Brush, Brow Brush, Eyeshadow Brush, Angled Eyeshadow Brush, Sponge Brush, Highlighter Brush, Eyeliner Brush, Eyelash and Brow Wand, and the Lip Brush.  ALL GREAT BRUSHES FOR SUCH A GREAT DEAL!!!</li>
    <li> they are very soft! Not rough at all. I got 13 in total. they look well put, and they also look like they will hold up for a while.The case they came in is big and the smell is just good! i am happy that I finally bought this set.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes recently and wow, they are amazing. The shipping was phenomenal. The case had a very strong smell but I didn&#x27;t let that bother me. The brushes are great quality and are soft as can be. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for an inexpensive brush set. Never again am I paying for expensive brushes!</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes they work very well and they are at an unbeatable price. I received my order in 3 days! I am absolutely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I recieved these in the mail and used them right away. My old brushes were nasty and falling apart and when I started to use these I felt them and thought to myself \\&quot;These are too soft and won&#x27;t work very well\\&quot; but I was wrong. They are super soft, but they distributed the makeup onto my face so well, it looks like a professional did my makeup. There are brushes to do all your makeup, and they all come in a great folding case. I love these brushes, too bad I didn&#x27;t buy them sooner.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of makeup brushes for a great price.  I got this set for my teenage daughter and she has been quite pleased with them.</li>
    <li> I am learning how to apply my makeup a little more dramatically and needed a variety of brushes in different sizes. This is a wonderful group of brushes that are super soft and that pick up the powder very well. The price was excellent too.</li>
    <li> Beginners makeup brush. Got this for my sister who just started wearing makeup. And it does the job. Not the best, But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> IT NOT GOOD ... IT WAS VERY CHEAP AND I WASTE ALL MY MONEY ON IT   DONT BUY IT</li>
    <li> This product is not what i expected. the case was already chipped and the brushes are stiff. not good at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered these brushes. They are a great buy for the price! If you are looking for a good everyday brush set, definitely try this one.</li>
    <li> This makeup brush kit is absolutely excellent for the price!&lt;br /&gt;All of the brushes are soft and actually secured very well.&lt;br /&gt;Have not lost any of the \\&quot;hairs\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;They pick up makeup and apply the makeup perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I honestly cannot justify buying the $200+ makeup brush kit that I would like......&lt;br /&gt;But, these are very nice brushes and actually last!&lt;br /&gt;For under $13 you cannot beat that!&lt;br /&gt;Double, even triple the price these are great brushes!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes they are super soft. The case keeps them all organized and easy to travel with. My friend (who spends TONS of money on designer brushes) this past weekend was jealous when she saw them, and demanded to know where I got them. The only complaint I have is that one of my brushes came apart where the metal is connected to the wood, it is an easy fix with a hot glue gun tho.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome for the money! They did not hurt my eyelids when using them, and I just love using them...Great buy!</li>
    <li> These brushes are horrible.  First of all, the case they come in is a cheap plastic one that literally smells so bad I can&#x27;t keep the brushes in it.  When I took it out of the envelope I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it smelled.  I seriously feel like this whole set is from the dollar store.  The brushes lose hairs like crazy and they feel really cheap.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in the product and I will never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This is incredible!!!! Brushes are soft I have used organic brushes my entire life and was very scared to try something else, these are amazing</li>
    <li> It was ok for the price i paid.  2 of the brush tips were not glued to the handles and 2 came of as i started using (u can just fix those easily). The handles are comfortable in your hand.  I love the angled brush and i also use one of the concealer brush for highlighting.  The 2 large brush (Blush and Powder i think) are super soft, feels great on the skin, but lacks density and as such is not really useful to me.</li>
    <li> I just recieved the brushes!! It took a little longer than I wanted, but considering its near Christmas time, it would make sense. I like the case, I probably wont be keeping the brushes in there for long though because I like to keep all my brushes together, in a glass cup thing.   The brushes are great, they are soft and I used them for the first time today RIGHT after receiving them. :) The biggest brush (powder brush) has got to be my favorite, nice and fluffy:) The only brush I didnt like from the whole set was the fan brush, 1 because I dont plan on using one ever, and 2 because when I received it, some of the hair were already falling off and it just wasnt pretty.   Over all, I really like all of the others. The eye liner brush gives a very thin like which I love, but I can easily make it into a big line too. The brushes came in a black case, that wraps around all the brushes. There is two plastic pieces on the inside, one to keep under the brushes, and then one to put ontop. I&#x27;m guessing it will keep the case from getting dirty, which is great, but like I said, I probably wont be using the brush case for long.  I bought these brushes to use with the new BH cosmetics 88 matte pallete that sadly has not come yet:(</li>
    <li> Brushes coming off :[</li>
    <li> I bought this for the main purpose of the smaller brushes, and i love them they are great i love the leather case its in it fits in my purse perfectly and i love all the sizes its great.</li>
    <li> For the price, its ok. Next time, I will invest in better quality brushes. It had a funny smell when I opened it. Also, I can only see these brushes lasting 6 months top!</li>
    <li> So honestly, based on the reviews I thought this would be a decent enough set... well not so much. The eyeshadow brush pad broke off after a few uses, and the rest of the brushes are pretty cheap. I ended up purchasing a brush from Sephora and the quality is MUCH better, although quite a bit more expensive. All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this set again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my big sis has this set and used some of the brushes on me so I&#x27;m familiar with them. I&#x27;m glad I got this and not a bigger set because it has enough brushes as it is already. Some of which I don&#x27;t know how to use..lol.It&#x27;s very nice! The only thing wI didn&#x27;t like was the smell of the case :P awful...so I opened it to let it air out for a long while.</li>
    <li> I usually would get my makeup brushes from Walmart but saw these and even with tax they were cheaper. However after just using them one time the bristles started to fall out and one of the brush heads fell off the handle. It is a quick fix with some hot glue but definitely didn&#x27;t expect it to happen.</li>
    <li> These brushes are Ok.. They are not in the greatest pouch, but serves its purpose. They are have held up fairly well, and the they are soft enough.</li>
    <li> Well I must say you do get what you pay for.I have not used the brushes yet but they are made of poor quality.I Should have not expected much considering the price.</li>
    <li> Im 16, love makeup, and love this set!&lt;br /&gt;These bristles are so soft, i haven&#x27;t used them yet but i can&#x27;t wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case did have a chemical smell, like plastic or house paint. But its not bad, i like it, it makes it smell new :)&lt;br /&gt;The brushes have the smell a little, not really, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because&lt;br /&gt;1 - I havent used them so I dont know how they REALLY feel.&lt;br /&gt;2 - THe case was kinda flimsy, looks great but its not the strong leather. But it&#x27;ll do!</li>
    <li> They were soft and nice and the scent that other ppl complained about wasnt bad to me so it was a really good purchase and i would definitely recommend this to someone.</li>
    <li> Overall this kit is great! The brushes are incredibly durable for the price, and they arrived ahead of schedule (which is always a plus) My only complaints about the product are that the case feels very cheap in that I wouldn&#x27;t want to just throw it wrecklessly in the bottom of my makeup bag. I also feel like the heads of the brushes aren&#x27;t attached very well, which is no big deal, and considering the price isn&#x27;t a problem at all. I would recommend for anyone looking for a cheap, durra lie set of brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic!  It would be difficult (and very expensive) to find all these brushes in one place elsewhere.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.    The Brush Company is awesome.  There was a problem with my order, and even though it wasn&#x27;t their fault, they fixed it to my great satisfaction and deep gratitude.  I seldom come across customer service like this, especially when online shopping!    Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I have to say i got this item like in three days i placed the order June 1 and received it June 3 that was great. The brushes are pretty good and the brush roll was great. The item i received was different than the one pictured here but it still does the job. I also like how everything was indiviually wrapped nicely packaged. I would buy again thanks again for delivering so quickly.</li>
    <li> I got my item a little later after the promise period but i got it and it was on good conditions.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply amazing! I was really surprised on how great these are. I had no problem with the hair falling out and the brushes were in perfect condition. In my opinion, these brushes are just as good (if not better) then the ones sold at Mac or Sephora. The amazing price is just the cherry on top! I love love love love these brushes! If you&#x27;re hesistant on buying them, don&#x27;t be! THEY&#x27;RE PERFECT! :)</li>
    <li> These brushes shed a lot, theyre cheap for a reason but do the job if you need it done.</li>
    <li> I liked these brushes, the bristles are very soft and gentle on the skin, but after 3 months, the silver parts on them started falling off, just doesnt seem as if they were glued on very well. Not too bad, but I will be going with something a little nicer as far as complete make next time</li>
    <li> i thought i made a good deal but its not something that would be long lasting... the brushes are not so strong. other than that i still use them but not as often as id like to.</li>
    <li> I love this kit. I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to doing make up I - mostly do my friends make up when we go out. I have everything I need and can do the latest make up tricks.</li>
    <li> Lovely case, love the smell of leather, but the whole package came somewhat early and I enjoyed that.  The brushed look professional, larger in size for some, but overall, a good buy at a better price.</li>
    <li> I found the brushes to be very soft and flexable. if your looking for a variety set this is your best value.They did not fall out as other&#x27;s have said,I have been useing them for over 2 week&#x27;s now and they still look and feel brandnew. This is a great gift set..</li>
    <li> Mail time was quick. Product is okay. Good for people who are just starting. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. Crappy brushes... spend more money on something else. This is a waste if a product.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes thinking they were a great deal but in my opinion, they really aren&#x27;t worth the price. Not long after getting the set, one of the heads fell off of one of the brushes. I thought it really wasn&#x27;t that much of a problem, seeing as it was a brush I never really used. Now, a little over a year later, i&#x27;ve noticed that the brushes \\&quot;shed\\&quot; hairs on my face, and that most of the heads have fallen off of the brushes over time. It is easy to fix with just a bit of super glue but I still feel I shouldn&#x27;t have to fix my products like this. If you don&#x27;t mind a little DIY or the occasional hair on your face, they are fairly good brushes. However, they really aren&#x27;t the deal they seem.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! they have the quality that I needed, and for the price its such a big deal actually. I will buy them all over again.</li>
    <li> They are better than I could imagine them to be.  Very nice.... Price was great... Saved at least $10.00 . Would buy them again when needed, hopefully they will be same or close to the price I paid..</li>
    <li> Perfect starter set until you can figure out what you are really doing and what you really need. Good deal</li>
    <li> I received these brushes in about a week. That was fine. The packaging was great. The brush case is very nice. Now the brushes, the first brush I pulled out was the eyebrow comb and brush brush, it came apart instantly. From there on I tried wiggling all the brushes and they all were loose. Maybe this is why they&#x27;re only 11 bucks. Luckily I have a hot glue gun, I&#x27;ll be gluing them all together tonight. By the way I had no shedding with these and the brush hair is really soft!</li>
    <li> Within the first week of using these brushes they started falling apart. The heads of the brushes don&#x27;t stay attached. I don&#x27;t like to be overly harsh about products, but these are total crap. Don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
    <li> I am impressed, the pic advertised doesn&#x27;t give the set as much credit as needed, really happy with the brush sizes, styles, and case!!</li>
    <li> I was concerned with them smelling or shedding due to all the reviews from the different brush reviews from different companies and these didn&#x27;t smell and they don&#x27;t shed even a year later. The Pouch is fake leather and not pretty (I&#x27;m okay with this as the brush quality was more important to me) and there isn&#x27;t a foundation brush but worth the price over all!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t top quality brushes, but they sure do their job nicely for how little they cost! The bag was good, closes nicely and keeps the brushes in good shape.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Not as good as more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve had but good for an amateur.  They work just fine!</li>
    <li> worth the money!! I&#x27;ve been using these for about a year now. Not one complaint!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this set and case. None of the brushes have been shedding even with close to daily usage.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the worst I have ever used, every time I use them they leave hairs on my face.  Not to mention, they&#x27;re very rough and uncomfortable.  And the glue was terrible so they came right off from the sticks.  I&#x27;m not a fan and I won&#x27;t by buying them again.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes work pretty well. There is a nice assortment of brushes. I only use about 4 of them, though. One of the blush brush heads came off the handle, but it was easily fixed with glue.</li>
    <li> The brushes came quicker than expected and looked just like they did in the picture. The only bad thing is that I expected a much larger powder brush, it just looks like a slighty larger blush brush but this isn&#x27;t a big deal.  I&#x27;m very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> Love that the case has a plastic cover on both sides of the brushes, so it keeps my case clean and makes it easier to disinfect the case and the brushes.</li>
    <li> Great veriety of brushes and size, but poor construction quailty. About half of these brushes are now seperated from the wood or sheding bristles. You get what you paid for on these brushes. (They do stay really soft though)</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set to practice with my make-up, the brushes were a great price for the quality.  The work well and gets the job done. would recommend others to buy.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for all of my bridesmaids and they all LOVED it. you can never have enough makeup brushes but this one has everything you could possibly want/need</li>
    <li> Decent quality.. you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t bad but you can tell they are not the high end brushes from Mac, sephora, etc</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say this set is a good set for teenagers who need some brushes to practice.  They&#x27;re definitely not for other use.  I only use small brushes to apply eyeshadows and liners.  I bought a separate foundation brush because I couldn&#x27;t use any of big brushes this set has.  Bristles fall out very easily and they&#x27;re very rough.</li>
    <li> One of the brushes broke off the handle the first time using it. There&#x27;s another similar brush so i didn&#x27;t return it</li>
    <li> I bought this set mainly for the eye brushes and it actually is a great set! I recommend washing them really well when you first get them (a lot of dye will come out). But then they will be soft and work amazingly well!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! For the price I expected them not to be really soft but they are :) I was really disappointed about the fan brush because it is so thin that it doesn&#x27;t pick up ANY PRODUCT but other than that these brushes are perfect! I must worn you they have a funny smell when you first receive them so I recommend you wash them before use.</li>
    <li> The brushes fell apart about a week later. The brush head came off of the handle. Other than that they&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> Just received the brushes, they are a nice quality brush for the price. The case is a very nice kidd leather, smells great. Seems to be the just the right size to put in a makeup case for overnighters too! As I am giving these to my fashonista daughter for Christmas, I will come back later and let y&#x27;all know how they stand up to her constant use.</li>
    <li> First of all they smell...but anything would, if it were encased in stinky plastic. I am in Make Up Artistry school, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to use my MAC or Sephora&#x27;s brushes on my models, or later my clients, so I ordered these. They are not marked on the handle, so you have to take a guess....but I bet I can figure out the eyeliner brush, to the blush brush. I removed the blush brush, and carefully washed it and conditioned it. I checked it for bristle fall out by tugging on the bristles. There was no extra bristles. I would do this with any make up brush I bought, no matter from a store, or online, MAC or no name. I have to do the same with the other remaining brushes. They are wooden handled, full size, with a fold over case. I&#x27;ll air out the case, Febreeze it, and do what I can to remove the smell. Eventually, though, they will go into my make up artist belt. I knocked the review down a star cause of the smell. But this, so far, is a nice set of brushes for the money, and what I intend to use it for.</li>
    <li> great soft brushes but fell apart after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I really liked them, they&#x27;re good quality!&lt;br /&gt;And all of you who said they&#x27;re cheap should shut up and go to hell! Stop bitching out!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about 3 days before it arrived! Which is very very unusual since most products takes weeks! I opened the box to find these brushes in the bag, though I do not think the bag is very nice it is useable, The brushes are soft and perfect for no matter how much to use make up! I cleaned them as soon as I opened them, though they were in bags and have never been used, after they dried they were still soft the bristles do not fall out when using them! Overall I would so say buy these!</li>
    <li> i got these yesterday, used some today and i have to say they are all really soft no hard bristels at all. I love the case they come in i am really pleased and would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> When I ordered these they lasted abt 3wks and after that the head of the brushes started to come of one by one , by the end of the month I did nt have anymore brushes left.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are thin and the strands keep dropping out! I would not recommend to anyone! The quality sucks and they smell horrible!</li>
    <li> Well, the brushes are @ a good price. There&#x27;s 1 blush brush &amp; 1 powder blush which are pretty soft although the handle for the blush brush came off so i had to stick it back together. Then there&#x27;s 7 eye shadow brushes more like concealer brushes. When i tried apply eye shadow with the brushes i had to pick up more product than i normally would {NO GOOD}. The mascara spool &amp; the eye brow comber both handles came off, This is having them for about 2 months. I wouldn&#x27;t be ordering brushes from this seller anymore.</li>
    <li> Love all the different brushes that come in this travel case you got everything you need in this case to get ready or for a night out.</li>
    <li> I am not a big make up person but when I go out like to get creative .&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft and easy to use !</li>
    <li> This set features such a large variety of brushes! I haven&#x27;t used them yet but so far I really love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the super difficult-to-open packaging. Other than that it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a make-up person. I bought this because my friends told me that every woman needs a brush set. I use maybe 2 or 3 of the brushes on a bi-weekly basis, I did say I wasn&#x27;t a make-up person. BUT if you are a make-up person I would really recommend these. They are the best set, my sisters have even asked to borrow them, they are the make-up types.</li>

    <li> Sure they aren&#x27;t MAC quality or anything, but for the price they are an incredible deal. I originally was in the market for just a brush case and the case plus the brushes was cheaper than anywhere else. I am so thrilled with this purchase.</li>
    <li> very nice and not cheap at all. I wash them all the time and they are still in great shape.</li>
    <li> The above product exceeded my expectations and arrived quickly. Very happy with the purchase and wuld recommend purchasing from this company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten really comfortable with these brushes that I decided to buy them again. I&#x27;d give a 5 star but sometimes the brush would fall off from the stick. Maybe because it wasn&#x27;t glued on enough. I don&#x27;t know but I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!!! They are sooooooo soft and amazing great deal:) I would tell every girl who loves brushes to get these the hairs don&#x27;t fall out and they work really good!</li>
    <li> I have never owned a complete set of make up brushes until now, and i have to admit they all appear to be good quality brushes. I also like the wrap up case they come in with magnetic snap buttons to keep it closed. Shipping was pretty fast as well, i would definitely buy from this seller again! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This set has a brush for every need.  Comes well packaged in a leather like roll out pouch.  Nice set for the professional or the do it your selfer.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to get my niece and my mom told me how she&#x27;s is always in her brushes when she visits.  My niece loved it, makes her feel like a professional artist and the brush are high quality.  Would recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this case as a present for my grandmother.  She needed some new makeup brushes and this appeared to have everything she needed.  When the brushes came in they were soft and much nicer than I expected for the price point.  My mother has now asked for a set because she likes them so much.  Given that she&#x27;s a make up addict and she likes them says a lot to me.  Nice, soft brushes and a good assortment.</li>
    <li> Im in awe with my new brush set, I needed this like nobody could ever know. I know Im not gonna use every brush but I will find a use for them all</li>
    <li> Bought this over a year ago and they are still strong and in great shape.</li>
    <li> everything I was expecting. Obviosly you need more than this brushes but this really help a lot to start with</li>
    <li> I just needed a few brushes and this kit gave me just enough brushes.  The brushes are soft and I really like the wood handles and the case is good for quick travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item if you do not want to be overwhelmed by having too many brushes.  The five rating is a great way to express my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and the price was complimentary to the item as well.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this...... It&#x27;s perfect I mean I don&#x27;t use the bigger brushes but I use the eyeliner brush and lip brush its just a great set.</li>
    <li> Given to my daughter for gift, she loved them.  Great price! I would recommend this to anyone who once a great value.</li>
    <li> I actually got 2 sets of these brushes due to the good reviews here, one for my sister and one for me. The brushes are a good quality especially for the price. They are lasting quite long seeing that I&#x27;ve had the maybe a year and a half now and they are all still in very good condition. I will definitely recommend these and even repurchase when I need to.</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes yesterday. I like the way every single brush was wrapped in plastic to avoid them getting dirty and/or damaged. The brushes are very soft, and not stiff like most cheap makeup brushes. They aren&#x27;t professional grade brushes (that doesn&#x27;t mean they are bad) they are just for casual use. I bought these for my mom, and she loves them. I hope they last.</li>
    <li> Nice size set of brushes and carrying case is well made.  Seems like it will hold up to traveling and wear and tear.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted these brushes, so I ordered them for her. She had no complaints and, as far as I know, unless they got lost or eaten by the dog, she still uses them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT SO MUCH ; AND IT TAKES 3 DAYS TO COME ... ILOVE ITS CHEAP ; BUT IT WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> The brush heads often pop right off the handles. Nothing a little glue won&#x27;t fix, but then the brushes themselves aren&#x27;t of terribly high quality. The point is that it&#x27;s functional, though.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001LVA0XO 13 Piece Makeup Brush Set and Case]] Originally, based on the look of the items on the site, I thought it would&#x27;ve been a small(er) case but it turned out to be quite a good size, much like an oversized clutch. That&#x27;s not such a bad thing for me. The case also looked very glamorous, you&#x27;d never think it was just a case for make-up brushes. Also, the shipping packaging was excellent. However, I would&#x27;ve preferred more variety in terms of the brushes. Especially a proper blending and/or fluffy brush. Basically, all the ones that come in this set are a bit flat and stiff. Maybe a beginner would have more luck with purchasing this set than I did.</li>
    <li> I realize you can&#x27;t expect professional quality from a $12 brush set, but these were terrible!  The case and brushes stunk to high heaven!  I washed the brushes, and they either fell apart or had some kind of weird brown ooze come out of them.  Yuk!  Spend the extra money to get a half way decent set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product cause it was cheap and i needed new brushes, while waiting for my new brushes i read the reviews yall are wrong these brushes are great and i got them for 4 dollars you cannot beat that period great brushes great price fast delivery and ya there is a smell but thats cheap plastic let it air out and you will be fine</li>
    <li> these brushes are great for travel, I&#x27;ve notived they need to be cleaned and taken special care of, more so than other bruches, but the case they come in is great,  litterally for the price....YOU CAN\\&quot;T BEAT IT!</li>
    <li> Everything a lady would need to fix her makeup is in this package.</li>
    <li> Long story short, this is worth looking into buying if you wear makeup and like your supplies organized. It isn&#x27;t expensive, it comes in a really nice leather case, each brush has it&#x27;s own spot. The brushes are SUPER soft and silky feeling, and they came in 2 days before the estimated arrival date. Buy it! :)</li>
    <li> I have had my brushes for awhile now, i love them and use them often. This is one of the  first items I ever bought online.</li>
    <li> So discouraging when after a month of using these brushes they came off their handles. Before this happened I really enjoyed their quality of hair and durability. I would not recommend to a friend or buy again</li>
    <li> These are very durable and they work wonderfully. I love this brand and would love to receive more products from this company.</li>
    <li> The brushes are of very good quality and the case is quite convenient. It&#x27;s easy to travel with and you get a lot of brushes for the money. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If these were a set of MAC brushes, of course they wouldn&#x27;t get 5 Stars,  BUT, this set offers THIRTEEN good quality brushes for LESS THAN TEN BUCKS!  I am very impressed so far with this makeup brush set..and I&#x27;m picky!  I had a full set of MAC brushes for over a decade and a half.  When it was time to get new brushes, I could not justify buying more than a few MAC brushes, because their prices had gone up CONSIDERABLY!  So, I did a lot of research, and got most of my brushes from a well known company that met my criteria on quality AND price.  BEFORE I GO FURTHER, let me say that I LOVE makeup!!  I wear it daily, from the \\&quot;au natural\\&quot; to the \\&quot;cat eye\\&quot; or \\&quot;smoky eye\\&quot; looks to the \\&quot;vibrant eye/neutral lip\\&quot; look or vice-versa.  I get a lot of \\&quot;makeovers\\&quot; at makeup counters to learn how to create different looks at home. To do that, I need a variety of good quality brushes.  After buying my core brushes,  I needed some \\&quot;filler\\&quot; brushes...those brushes that do specific tasks that I use often, but maybe not daily.  I saw the 12-piece ELF set, and probably would have got those, but they were out of stock.  THEN I FOUND THIS SET...and I&#x27;m really glad I did! They arrived promptly, and, from other reviewers I knew they might have an odor (mine did, no big deal, I knew it was from the PU Leather case, so I unrolled it and put it on the table in the garage for 24 hours and they are fine!!)!  I washed the brushes with Brush Shampoo before first use and, AS EXPECTED from most brushes, they shed A LITTLE BIT,  DURING THE FIRST WASH ONLY!!  I let them dry overnight, and put them to the test. I&#x27;m a tough critic, even though this set was less than $10, I expect them to perform as described.  To my delight, they do!  Some of the MOST mportant things to me are the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). Good Quality:  this means they have a nice feel in my hand, have soft, full bristles, and feel well made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). No Shedding:  ok, all brushes shed a little, but after a gentle shampoo, I want that to be the end, for the most part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3). Complete Set:  if I&#x27;m getting 13 brushes, I expect them to compliment each other, not have 2 fluffy brushes and 11 eye&lt;br /&gt;  shadow brushes that are the same size (this set has a nice variety of brushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4). Decent Case:  I need a place to put every brush, and (though its not the best quality), this case does its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list goes on, my point is, keeping the price in mind, this set hits every one of my main criteria.  My suggestion is to take care of ANY BRUSH YOU BUY!  Wash with a good quality brush shampoo before first use and 1-2 times a month. After each use, spray lightly with Brush Cleaner, and wipe dry with a microfiber cloth, if you don&#x27;t, they will get hard and fall apart.  Keep them in their case (if you don&#x27;t like this case, buy one you do like), if you don&#x27;t, THEY WILL shed.  I RECOMMEND THIS SET AS A STARTER SET, OR A FILLER SET TO ANYONE!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.  Wish some where not so long so that you could carry easy.  But still a Great deal!</li>
    <li> The 13 piece makeup brush set was an outstanding value.  My wife uses them on a daily basis. They seem to be exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set at a very reasonable price. Good quality. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good set, especially for beginners. Professionals, I believe, can and will have great pleasure in using and purchasing this kit.</li>
    <li> It is true that you get what you pay for. The brushes are not the best, especially the eye makeup brushes. But, the bristles are very soft and the larger powder brushes are pretty good. I also use the spoolie and brow groomer all the time.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for some cheap brushes, these are it. If not, go elsewhere and spend more money.</li>
    <li> 2 brushes fell apart within hours of opening my package. Over the next week, others also came apart. I was able to glue them back on but I don&#x27;t like that I had to do that. The brushes themselves are nice though.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth it! I love this whole set! been looking for something just like it but expected it to be way more expensive! This is a great deal! I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> these brushes are very durable and are worth the cost. The case they come in is good too. Lots of sizes to choose from.</li>
    <li> This was my first makeup brush purchase, and I&#x27;ve recently purchased several E.l.f. brushes, but for a beginner, these brushes work really well. They&#x27;re really soft and easy to handle, but after a few days of using them, the wooden handle of one of the powder brushes actually detached from the metal part of the brush, which was only a small setback seeing as it can be easily fixed with a little glue. Also, a small hole poked through in the bottom of where you put the middle sized eyeshadow brush, which was disappointing, but I have a brush holder anyways so I don&#x27;t really need the case that came with the brushes. The quality of the brushes are decent, but the case is very cheap quality and feels like a cheapy pleather material, and it didn&#x27;t seem to be sewn together that well, either. As for how the brushes apply makeup, they work pretty well. I use them daily with foundation, concealer, powder and eyeshadow and they work very well.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. The brushes are very soft and the case is compact, I travel a lot so that is a plus. Loved it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased two.  One for me and one for my daughter&#x27;s stocking.  This set has everything you need for every look!</li>
    <li> My daughter in law loved the brushes to go with her Shany Professional Eyeshadow Pallette!  The brushes make it more fun while she is creating her masterpieces!</li>
    <li> i liked this item it was ok. i mean i couldnt figure out what all the brushes were for but i used a few of them.. and i actually added some of my own and removed the ones i dont use</li>
    <li> Brushes work really well some of them do not really pick up my eye shadow. But for the price they work!</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooo soft! Good quality and came four days before the expected delivery date</li>
    <li> This set is awesome! The brushes are nice and fit well in their individual slots.  The leather holder is very beautiful, and I feel like a professional every time I open it!</li>
    <li> I do not compromise on certain products, but this was a beginner set my my daughter.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this set for the discriminating consumer.  The case was made of  plastic No. 7 which is toxic.  I threw it away immediately and washed the brushes.  The shape of the larger brushes are not designed well.  Five star for fast delivery and great beginner set, 3 star for the toxic plastic cover and the poorly designed large brushes.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto. Mi novia esta super contenta con este regalo.  Muy completo set. muy buena calidad.  Buen producto. lo recomiendo ampliamente.  Saludos desde Venezuela</li>
    <li> The brushes in the set are nice quality. They&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin like some of the other &#x27;professional&#x27; brushes. I love this set because it has so many different tools.</li>
    <li> It is a very good material. I works to perfection, buy it to lear to makeup myself the right way. And I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice case, nice brushes, love having something to keep all my brushes together. especially to travel with. I can just throw it in my bag.</li>
    <li> Make up doesn&#x27;t stay on brushes so I think the quality of the hair is very poor. Don&#x27;t recommend this set, looks very nice and all but when you start using them its a little frustrating be cause you have put and put make up and you end up using more product than you would normally use.</li>
    <li> love this brush set! The only bad thing was that one of the brushes head piece came off by itself only after having it for a week. Other than that I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I would have given this five stars, but the one and only thing I don&#x27;t like about it for me, is the openings where you slide in your brushes.  I wish a couple more were bigger to fit some of my other thicker handle brushes.  I like everything else about it, I like the plastic inside that covers the brushes ( nice feature). I like the closure, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product around a month, or a little longer, and I am pleased with it.  It&#x27;s going to be great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I like some of the small flat brushes that were included, they work great.  So, as you can see I would recommend this set for anyone looking to buy a brush set with the case.</li>
    <li> A great starter set for my teenage daughter.  The quality was just ok, but it was perfect for her as a beginner.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with the case at all.  If I would have just opened it I would have pulled the snaps right out of the material it was attached to.  I am going to try to reinforce the material with DUCT  TAPE.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. I use it every single day:) it was very nice and at the price I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I was both surprised and delighted with the selection and quality of these makeup brushes. I bought them for my 16 yr old grandaughter who is experimenting with makeup. When I saw the brushes I just knew I had to have a set also. The price was  reasonable and they shipped fast.</li>
    <li> SO soft!  Great set! Doesn&#x27;t shed! Great Price! I got these for christmas. Love them I was surprised at the durability of the brushes, they seem extremely well made for the price. Also the variety of the brushes you get and the travel case that comes with makes this even more awesome!. The only thing I wish is that it came with something that had each brush labled.</li>
    <li> This brush set had a lot of different types of brushes, but lacked a little in quality. I would recommend this as a second set for traveling</li>
    <li> These brushes are really cheap-- like dollar-store variety. The brushes are lightweight and flimsy; they aren&#x27;t high-quality materials and the case is not like the picture-- its more of a little pouch. I was so disappointed, I threw them away after first use! I would definitely not advise you to choose this brush set/case-- you won&#x27;t be pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set! This price is amazing and the brushes are great. This set has all the brushes you need. My favorite is the angled brush. Its perfect for applying eyeliner or using your eyeshadow as your liner.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes the metal part came off the wood and fell off so I had to push it back on the wood handle. Sort of pissed off about that.but other than that not bad.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas. She loves make-up and she really loved it!  Not cheap looking! But most important the wife loves it.</li>
    <li> came before the date it said and thew brushes are great. the only promblem is that he brushes slip out of the pocket.</li>
    <li> Love the Brushes overall. They are great quality however, I have a few of the handles detach from the brush.</li>
    <li> Such good quality for the price! Not much else to say, it&#x27;s a good quality product for a great price. I use them every day. Easy to wash.</li>
    <li> Good for short term use. Mine didnt last that long. The brushes came apart :(</li>
    <li> The Eye brushes are a bit rough but some of them are ok</li>
    <li> Wife used these till they wore out</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking I would use the brushes right away but unfortunately I have no even opened the pouch yet.  I need to replace my brushes here soon, so hopefully I will be able to put these brushes to good use :)</li>
    <li> There are 13 brushes as promised, but in most of the photos it shows 3 small dark, fluffy brushes next to the blush brushes. Well these are not in the case, instead all of the small brushes are the hard, bright orange hairs. This is very disappointing to me because I was buying this for the eye makeup brushes and these brushes do not hold shadow very well. They work for eye liner, lip color, and concealer very well, but they are just not very good for applying eye shadow.</li>
    <li> its not the best brushes. i mean they do shed but for the price i paid what can u expect. also when i got the brushes the case smelled like chemicals to me.</li>
    <li> Giving it 3 stars because the brushes are weak I feel like they&#x27;ll fall apart in a few months but you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll use them because they do get the job done. The foundation brush sucks it&#x27;s a little too soft and didn&#x27;t smudge my powder foundation well.</li>
    <li> very nice&lt;br /&gt;iam happay with this itme</li>
    <li> Could not be happier with this brush set. The leather case it comes in is as soft as butter. It has a variety of brushes and is perfect for all types of makeup.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations. I use all of the brushes except for one. Which I don&#x27;t need now but will use in the future. So thank you.</li>
    <li> Allot of people complain about the smell but does it matter! Its just the case that smells like it and its about the brushes that matter and the brushes are soft and feel great on the skin I would deffently suggest this to a starter in makeup to someone who has been doing makeup for years! So don&#x27;t let the reviews that say the set smells get to you it dosent even bother me(:</li>
    <li> This is a great kit and the quality of the brushes were great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I needed this product since I bought 96 color eyeshadow I wante options and this product was the package deal for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect set! I love these brushes. They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do and the quality is really good.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good. I&#x27;ve had them for over a year and i must say they DO NOT SHED AT ALL, they are soft and good the only thing is the bigger brushes the irony looking part fell off but could always be reglued on. BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT</li>
    <li> did not feel cheap at all!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who wants to be a make up artist at some point. this is basically a beginners kit but she really liked it.</li>
    <li> The best brush set I have had. No shading and very easy to clean. Will buy a back up set</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft tipped and I like to use some soft and some hard tipped brushes all of these brushes are soft I was unable to use them but if you like all soft tipped they are good quality and very nice comes in a good sized case too</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this brush set.it has everything I wanted plus more. A very great buy and love the price.</li>
    <li> The brushes started instantly falling apart.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved the brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes are just ok. Nothing great about them.</li>
    <li> Okay so before I decided to buy these brushes I read a few reviews. Most people said that the brushes had a nasty smell and that they shed after washing them. How they put it was like it was an unbearable smell, which it isn&#x27;t AT ALL!!! I could barely smell anything, I washed my brushes as soon as I got them and they DID NOT SHED and the smell was gone. The case is alright, it could be better. The brushes are soft and smooth. I would buy this product again with no problem.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product. Can&#x27;t say enough about the quality. Good job. Made me look real good. She enjoys putting on her make-up.</li>
    <li> I really like the soft leather of this case! When I ordered it, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the brushes to be the best quality but the smaller eye brushes turned out to be wonderful! The glue that keeps the medal and wand together came loose on the bigger brushes within the first usage.</li>
    <li> very good the brushes are soft in great shape and really good and the case held up well and yeah i love the brushes</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s cheap brush set? I made a bad decision to buy this one. One of the brush was broken because it was out of glue. This makeup brush set should have a product description so I could know how to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about a year. The brush part is great but only after a week of use the handles came unglued. I&#x27;ve only seemed to have his problem with the blush brushes though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these brushes for over a year now, and overall, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with them.  However, I&#x27;ve had two of them break.  The blush brush&#x27;s handle has separated from the metal piece holding the bristles, which it pretty annoying, since I had only kept it in the included brush case.  It seems that the pieces were poorly glued together.  The plastic of the brow and lash brush broke off at the handle while I was traveling and had it in a separate makeup bag (all of the brushes together in the case make for a pretty bulky product), which is also pretty annoying, since it&#x27;s one of my most-used brushes.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and unharmed. Love the case. The brushes are lovely and work well. Also easy to clean. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great no brush hair that falls out! I love the little pouch it comes with it works great for me!</li>
    <li> I did get what the description told me I&#x27;d get, I just didn&#x27;t like that the types of brushes weren&#x27;t marked or that there wasn&#x27;t a booklet to see what area of the face each brush was used for.</li>
    <li> the brushes comes in different variety..it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. the brushes aren&#x27;t of the greatest quality but it works fine so i guess so.</li>
</ol>
