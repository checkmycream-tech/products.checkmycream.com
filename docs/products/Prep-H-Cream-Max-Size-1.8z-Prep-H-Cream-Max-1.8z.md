    <li> Always keep this in your make-up bag. The gel works the best but the creams are great too!</li>
    <li> Great product does what its supposed to do!</li>
    <li> works and a good price</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I thought it would.  Doesn&#x27;t alleviate pain but does lubricate.  It was intended for a specific purpose which I found out from the doctor I don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> This cream is designed to relieve pain caused from hemorrhoids. It comes with an \\&quot;insertion tube\\&quot; so you can deliver a small amount right into the anus. The cream is also, of course, for pain relief of the outside tissue. But the tube is very convenient for what it&#x27;s designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product overall.</li>
    <li> A BIT SPENDY AND I AM NOT USING IT FR THE DELICATE TISSUES IN  MY der·ri·ère I AM USING IT FOR THE DELICATE TISSUES UNDER AND AROUND MY EYES - I USE IT AND IT WORKS FANTASTIC</li>
    <li> This stuff is very affordable and effective and arrives time and in good condition.  Works well for puffiness under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use. Helps shrink hemmoids &amp; helps with the pain.</li>
    <li> It pains me to have to review such a product, but I guess anyone who&#x27;s experienced bleeding understands the need. It absolutely helps reduce the bulging vein and eliminates the bleeding. I had zero luck using the insertion tip for interior application, though. Couldn&#x27;t relax enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: HA! I just noticed the down votes. I come here to talk about a private issue and it&#x27;s not good enough for some! ha ha! I wonder what else I should have added? ;)</li>
    <li> Had the worst flare up of my life and this DID shrink me some, it was worse pain than I was already in. I tried the Mayinglong ointment and it was far superior. Prep H might soothe some people but I would NEVER use it again. Witch Hazel is good if you can get the alcohol free kind.</li>
    <li> it is working product for me. i&#x27;d try many other Preparation but this one works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have other problem but does have itch that make&#x27;s me crazy but this one helps me 100%</li>
    <li> I have some annoying bags under my eyes that this has worked pretty well for. Don&#x27;t get it in your eye though because it wasn&#x27;t designed for the ocular area.</li>
    <li> I found that it works great and would recommend it to anyone.It was sent as in a respectful way i;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Packaging worked well, and item is effective for  a brand I&#x27;m familiar with, no complaints</li>
    <li> not a cure! but relief.</li>
