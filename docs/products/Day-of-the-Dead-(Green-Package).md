    <li> Awesome Day of the Dead tattoo&#x27;s! This review is for 2 tattoo sheets, all Black, Day of the Dead temporary tattoo. All tattoo&#x27;s were on a 6 x 5 sheet, because of their close proximity to each other they were a little difficult to cut around. They were easy to apply with water and a washcloth. I applied these without base makeup. The detail around the eyes had the white outline as seen on the picture as did the teeth, which was a nice surprise as I thought that I would have to fill in the white with make-up. I filled in the inside eye area with black make-up and also applied white around the tattoo&#x27;s but could be worn with or without make-up. They were easy to remove with baby oil with a little work. I tried both methods of removal as listed on the package, rubbing alcohol and baby oil, the baby oil was the easiest of the two methods for me. I wore the tattoo&#x27;s all day (about a 12 hour period). No visible flaking or peeling. Looked great, received a lot of compliments. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Will buy again!! Easy to apply, looks great on, easy to take off.</li>
    <li> These were hard to get on and off, however they were pretty cool once we did get the on.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and remove! My costume was awesome because of this temporary face tattoo!</li>
    <li> Perfect....I sed them for face tattoos to look like a thug. Go on easy...stay on!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I got so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Loved this temp tattoo mask. It was so easy to apply, looked great and lasted all night. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Very easy to put on if you cut out sections and aoply seperately. Looked great when finished. Was a  little hard to remove but not bad. We used rubbing alcohol and baby oil.</li>
    <li> cannot apply over cake or cream white make up</li>
    <li> there is no color and it was really hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply easy to remove. Turner heads</li>
    <li> This thing was awesome!!! Everyone all night kept saying, wow how long did it take you to put that makeup on?? So it sure didn&#x27;t look cheap, and taking it off - I used rubbing alcohol diluted with a bit of water.  I happened to get 2 just in case and boy I sure was glad I did - application can be tricky and if you mess up - well having a backup is key.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Look so good in the packeage hope look good when i put in face.</li>
    <li> Tattoos are great quality and work well, however I think they are overpriced for just one. I had to go buy additional tattoo kits for a 2nd Halloween party and the same exact tattoo came as a package of two for 3.00 less than the single one I ordered. My order did not come packaged which leads me to believe that the seller is breaking them apart and raising the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent received in Good condition</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, easy to remove.</li>
