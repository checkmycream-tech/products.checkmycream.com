<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells really great. Hair is soft and wonderful. I have relaxed hair</li>
    <li> Wen is the best product</li>
    <li> I LOVE WEN!!!! Nice scent too.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the fuss is about.  Expensive without any great results.</li>
    <li> This one is the real thing, love it</li>
    <li> My favorite my hair smells great and it does the job</li>
    <li> you need to add an additional 15 minutes to complete the process in the shower and then my hair just hung -- I wash my hair every day and if you want to go some where in a hurry -- you can&#x27;t  use Wen.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I LOVE my wife&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous. This stuff really made her hair even more amazing, super soft with what she says has more bounce and body, whatever that means?  And it smells incredible!  Highly recommend for your ladies and men, buy some for your wives or girlfriends. It&#x27;s an investment that she&#x27;ll appreciate and you will too.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome, it does everything that they say it does if you use it correctly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to shampoo.</li>
    <li> This made my hair so oily after washing and blow drying it. I thought maybe it&#x27;s me and I&#x27;m washing it wrong but I&#x27;m not. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but paying this kind of money for Wen my hair shouldn&#x27;t look oily and I need of a wash.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> leaves hair greasy if you follow directions.</li>
    <li> I love Wen! My only issue with this one is the smell. It&#x27;s not nearly as nice as the pomegranate or fig. Otherwise, it&#x27;s still great. My hair has never been softer. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I use anymore.</li>
    <li> Wen is the best and this one smells like a delicious peach pie!!</li>
    <li> By far my favorite Wen purchase to date! Was delivered quickly and makes my hair look, feel and smell amazing!! Definitely going to reorder. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for several years now and my hair is in great shape.  This new scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> love all of Wen products!  this one smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after watching an infomercial, thinking that this would help my naturally curly hair. I only used three pumps, I can&#x27;t imagine what my hair would have been like with 16-24 pumps. I couldn&#x27;t even dry my hair. It looked and felt filthy. Limp and greasy, like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a month. This product is going back.</li>
    <li> Smells sooooooo good!</li>
    <li> This, of course, works great like all the Wen products.  I especially love the smell!  I think it is my favorite so far and I have probably tried 5 or 6 different scents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of this Wen product.  It still has the same great effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am loving whe wen products. My hair is softer, cleaner for longer and seems to be growing. Plus it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one as much as the original wen. I thought it dried my hair out</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend.  This is her favorite scent in Wen.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my best friend. She says she loves it. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent myself, but she says it smells good. And if she likes it, then I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> The best stuff for your hair my hair looked like a bail of hay before I used this</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Used as indicated and whats all the fuss about? So expensive and its just the same as using regular shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> The difference that I see in my hair does not justify the price.  I will no longer be buying this product.</li>
    <li> The best around for fine thin hair. Great product for static.</li>
    <li> I have found I can&#x27;t use Wen as a cleanser as advertised (it just doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean) but as a conditioner it works wonders - my hair is silky soft, shiny, and I rarely ever have to brush it. I have also found that for some reason, certain scents don&#x27;t work as well in my hair as others do. The pomegranate and honey peach work great, but the mango coconut barely did a thing for me. It can take a bit of investing to find the right scent for your hair, but good lord is it worth it.</li>
    <li> This new scent is great!  WEN products are the best and never disappoint!  Worth the money for sure!</li>
    <li> This product started making my hair fall out... I only used it about 6 times and noticed that my hair was starting to fall out in that short amount of time...  I have fine baby hair (but I have alot of it) so that may be the problem... my hair isn&#x27;t thinning but not soon after using this product my hair was coming out...  I stopped using immediately... just my personal experience...  may do well on hair that is coarse but definitely not for my fine baby hair...</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of this one.  I like others but this one leaves my hair a little oily the next day.  I can usually go two days without shampooing but this one doesn&#x27;t do the same.  Day two is not so pretty.  Day one is though so I will keep it and use it for days where I want my hair to look and smell pretty.  Sweet Almond Mint smells better.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again.  It&#x27;s fine for once a week washing to skip the conditioner but it left my thin hair feeling coated and kinda frizzy at the same time.</li>
    <li> even though I enjoy using WEN this scent is very distastful, a friend said it smells like cat pee</li>
    <li> Smells yummy, just weighs down my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product is AMAZING. I have used it now for about one week and my hair is silky, smooth, keeps it&#x27;s shape all day (I dry with round brush and hair dryer) bounces and just looks amazing. My hair does not look oily and stringy, it&#x27;s just beautiful and healthy looking. NEVER will I go back to shampoo and conditioner. I just purchased three more WEN products. I am a WEN girl now :)</li>
    <li> Another great scent from this all natural shampooing conditioner. It has really given my hair shine, bounce and health!</li>
    <li> Cleans hair beautifully.  I have fine hair and I end up with shiny, manageable hair that does not go flat.  My scalp was also very itchy all of the time and now that has stopped. The fragrance is wonderful too, it smells like fresh peaches.</li>
    <li> Love it, but way tooooo expensive..........</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product......use nothing but Wen for hair products.</li>
    <li> The only one i will use. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed at all!!!</li>
    <li> Wen is the best product out there for my curly head girl! She particularly loves the smell of the honey peach! I thought it was a little pricey but after seeing the results it&#x27;s worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> It weighed my hair down so bad I had to QUIT USING IT!!!!!! WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND?</li>
    <li> I love my wen hair products. This made my hair smell and look good. Love wen!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only cleansing shampoo that does not dry my hair out but still cleans it.  Although I relax my hair, this makes it feel like it has life again.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product I received is 100% authentic. Secondly, this stuff smells incredible. It&#x27;s not a sickly sweet scent which I was worried about when I ordered it, it&#x27;s just so... delicious smelling. My boyfriend loves the scent as well. And third, this has transformed my wavy hair from frizzy and dry to healthy looking. The first few times I used it before I figured out how many pumps I need I ended up feeling oilier than usual, but I stuck with it and once my hair adjusted and I learned what I need to do for myself - holy cow! My hair is so soft and shiny, there&#x27;s a lot less frizz going on, and I feel like my waves have been enhanced in a good way. This isn&#x27;t going to magically give you perfect hair, but it&#x27;s going to give you the best possible version of the hair you have. I am officially a Wen girl. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Works really well!!</li>
    <li> I will not buy this product again. My hair felt dirty and oily. I had to shampoo several times to get wen out. It felt as if I had put hand lotion in my hair rather then any thing to clean it. Not at all as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I have long grey hair. I do not color it. Maybe that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Talk about fine print, The writing and directions on the bottle are so small it is impossible to read. Product should come with a pamphlet in print that can be read.</li>
    <li> Replenishes dry unmanageable hair so it is healthy, shiny and soft again.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this one! and wen is a great brand just not what I use all the time. I buy a cleansing conditioner probably once per year and use just a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner the rest of the year.</li>
    <li> My natural (no relaxer) hair has a 4C texture.  I love using Wen products.  Summer Honey Peach defined my curls nicely, gave me great volume and fullness, and gave me great second day hair.  This will be the one seasonal Wen cleanser that I stock up on.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! Feels amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use any other shampoo... my hair feels healthy and has grown faster since I started using this.</li>
    <li> love it , great price</li>
    <li> Wen shampoo is AMAZING! Worth every dollar. The smell of peach is awesome. I used it on my 2 year olds hair which is fine, and curly blonde. His hair looks perfect now.</li>
    <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  The smell is amazing and I love how soft it makes my hair.  I thought I had pretty normal hair and I try to go 2 - 3 days between washing it.... it&#x27;s not good to wash your hair every day after all.  I find that when I use this my hair gets greasy REALLY fast and I don&#x27;t put the extra &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; in my hair.  I&#x27;m still torn as to whether I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and at a good price !!!</li>
    <li> Yes its great! Love the smell!</li>
    <li> I love Wen.  I love ALL Wen cleansing conditioners and I like the replenishing treatment as well.  This scent is PERFECT for summer and a nice changeup from my usual Mint. I love Chaz&#x27;s idea of seasonal formulas too, it&#x27;s fun to shake things up!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Wen Cleansing Conditioner. It cleans the hair wonderfully, without weighing it down. Smells great. Would certainly order again.</li>
    <li> I like wen it&#x27;s a very produce .if your thinking about using wen do it you&#x27;ll be surprise</li>
    <li> Wen never fails to deliver. This is a quality product and works as advertised. It allows any hair color used to last longer and the hair is soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Product was ok .... The pump was never functional so I believe I&#x27;m using and wasting too much.... I asked for a new pump to be sent and it was never received ..... Unsure if I&#x27;ll ever order any of these products again</li>
    <li> This product stinks.  I have many different Wen products and they have nice smells.  This smells like the cheap shampoo that you buy in the stores at the mall.  It is a bad perfume smell.  I like the 613 formula the best.  It has a nice pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice some people love this and some hate it.  If you like strong perfume smells, you will like it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> use Wen every day as a leave-in conditioner/styling cream.  I have naturally curly hair and it&#x27;s the only product I need to give me nice bounce and definition.  the smell is fantastic - I have people stop me all the time and ask me what it is.  LOVE my Wen!</li>
    <li> WEN is a great product. With curly kinky hair, WEN encourages you to wash your hair more frequently without the &amp;#34;tangle&amp;#34; fear because it is slippery and cuts down on detangle time. Plus, the scents are great, and i&#x27;m sure you could find a scent that suits you perfectly. The con can be that it might be a bit costly for a 16oz bottle. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Also, for me, I still have moisturizing problems regardless of how special this product is. So, overall, you should try it..</li>
    <li> Came early and girlfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> The scent is heavenly!  This formula was not as thick as some of the other formulas I&#x27;ve tried.  However, it worked the same.  This product on it&#x27;s own is a little heavy for my hair.  I use less, and I also switch off with shampoo.  I sometimes put it on my hair at night or a few hours before a shower to deep condition.  I also use it for a leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t as nourishing as some Wen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love WEN products.  Too expensive at times.  Sales are better.  Like to try the different fragrances.  Do not like the almond.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It is smooth, smells great and keeps your hair in great condition.</li>
    <li> Was really excited to try this product after the infomercials. We have very hard water and thought this would help with my hair care, but really wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Instructions require up to 16 pumps per use. Really to feel your hair is clean, that amount seems necessary. Really pricey, especially when you will go through it so fast.</li>
    <li> Smell is so deliciously peachy!!! I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on the smell of my hair than on my perfume!! Hahaha</li>
    <li> Very nice new scent - Have used Wen consistently for three years and will never go back.</li>
    <li> Smells Great!!  I love this scent better than any other that i have tried</li>
    <li> This is not a sweet scent, it is a delicious not overpowering scent, and works well similarly to the tea tree oil WEN.  It works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the seasonal Wens, they seem to work better on my hair than their normal line.  That being said, this has been the first seasonal one that seems to have dried my hair out and made it frizzy.  I LOVED the Coconut Mango (the seasonal for previous summers) and I really liked the Spring Orange Blossom, but this one was a dud for me.  (For reference, I have wavy hair that has a tendency to be frizzy...I always go for the super moisturizing hair products.)</li>
    <li> Not for all hair types. Makes my hair really oily</li>
    <li> I liked the product but hated the smell</li>
    <li> I loved it!!! The only problem I had was the pump broke when I first put it in the bottle....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a WEN girl now and wouldn&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo or conditioner!</li>
    <li> Love this Peachy smell!</li>
    <li> I used this twice to make sure I wasn&#x27;t going nuts, but this scent literally makes my hair smell like cat piss after I use it. This was my first introduction to Wen, so before being 100% judgmental, I&#x27;ll try another scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I did enjoy the way it made my hair feel - so not a total loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at how many positive reviews these products get. Maybe they&#x27;re just not for me... First, the product is very expensive. When using this &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; you have to wash your hair everyday because it weighs your hair down &amp; makes it look like it needs to be washed! My colorist recommended not shampooing every day unless necessary - working out, sweating, etc. because it strips necessary moisture from your hair. I guess that&#x27;s not an issue with the Wen products, as too much moisture seems to be the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I used this cleanser a few times, then gave it away. It made my hair look lifeless, dirty, and in need of a wash. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Love, love , love this one. Love the smell and love the way it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> Like the outcome of my hair but the fragrance is awful</li>
    <li> I used wen hair care for abt a month and at first I loved it. But than it started to make my head feel oily and really dirty. I needed to go back and add shampoo in my hair to make it clean. This continues to work only if u use shampoo first and than use the wen hair care afterwords. Otherwise it will stop working and makes it feel really dirty.</li>
    <li> This is the first Wen product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have fine, thin hair that breaks easily but I don&#x27;t think I could use this exclusively.  What worked for me was to shampoo my hair about once a week but use Wen in between, like maybe every other day.  As far as the scent is concerned, I LOVE IT!!  However, it smells nothing like honey or peaches... More like honeysuckle, but still really nice.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, can&#x27;t use every day on my fine hair though...</li>
    <li> Scrumptious! I love this fragrance! Wen cleansing conditioner is the only &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I use on my hair. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smell so good and it makes my hair wavy and soft</li>
    <li> Really nice hair cleansing without stripping the good stuff in my hair.  The fragrance is nice for summer</li>
    <li> loved the scent, delivery was fast</li>
    <li> Love wen and this is my favorite. Scent</li>
    <li> Have used this product before. A great shampoo/ conditioner all in one</li>
    <li> I was impressed at with the first use, but after the second and third time my hair was oily looking. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly one of my favorite scents from Wen. Love Wen in general works great on my wild curls, I&#x27;m mixed African American and Spanish (spain) my curls are still wild but the form of the curls are more defined. Love my hair, I work as a hair model and my stylist loves using it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this one. Wen does an excellent job of keeping my hair soft and smooth. Best of all, not static in the winter</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and don&#x27;t usually wash my hair daily. After one wash with Wen my hair felt great. but as the day went on, it felt heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> Not sure how I feel about Wen,  I didn&#x27;t particularly like how my hair felt after final rinse. I only used once so I am giving 4 stars for now as it smelled good and I had a good experience with the seller as my order was fulfilled as expected.</li>
    <li> This is the worst smelling Wen they have ever made. Seriously, the worst!</li>
    <li> The product works great just like all of the WEN cleansing conditioners! I use them for a leave-in conditioner, and have tried many of the different scents. It works great just like the other cleansing conditioners, but I do not like the scent as much as some of the others, such as the mango coconut. Still works great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Wen yet! Smells yummy and not so minty &amp; tingly.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I swear by Wen product! It made my hair softer, fuller, and helped bring back my hair line, I kid you not! At 17, I was told my hair line started to recede. This devastated me as my hair is my pride and joy. My coworker bought me this Christmas 2013 and I will never stop using it! It is worth every penny! I will recommend Wen to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> The smell of the product was great. Overall it was just ok I feel like it did a mediocre job cleaning my hair and always felt a certain heaviness still in my hair after getting out of the shower. I tried leaving in a small amount of cleanser as a conditioner and also rinsing completely the heaviness was the same either way. I felt like my hair was greasy or oily looking 2 days after the was so actually felt I had to was more frequently. The manageability was just ok no more and no less than my usual shampoo. All in all I was not impressed it was not worth the money and I&#x27;m just trying to hurry and get through this bottle so I can go back to my Miracle 7 products.</li>
    <li> I have thick somewhat frizzy hair. This smells really good and works well with my hair as long as I dont rinse it too thoroughly. If I rinse it all out I end up with big hair. Just rinse it mostly out with this kinda hair and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I LOVED the scent, but it dried out my hair no matter how I tried to use it. No amount, great or small, was moisturizing enough for my chemically-treated hear. :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and the person said she HATES it. It does not leave your hair as advertised. They should sell this in a sample size so you could try it without spending all this money.</li>
    <li> Made my hair too greasy.</li>
    <li> I love Wen. I buy it all the time. It&#x27;s amazing for my color treated (purple) hair. This keeps the color vibrant and amazing. And it smells like the second coming of Christ. It&#x27;s heavenly. It&#x27;s as if angels were baking you a nice warm desert.</li>
    <li> Smells great! It smells more like honeysuckle than peach though, which is fine with me. Left my hair with volume and soft. I don&#x27;t use as many pumps as directed so I expect this to last me a while. This was the first Wen product I tried and I loved it so much I ordered two more bottles of the Summer Honey Peach. Definitely a favorite.</li>
    <li> Wait a minute? Is this a conditioner or a shampoo? The directions said you can put it in as a stay in conditioner. It&#x27;s soaps up too much for that!! And it says conditioner on the bottle but it&#x27;s soaps up like a shampoo. And the pump doesn&#x27;t work. Which is very inconvenient. And for the price it was at least the pump could work.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how soft it makes my hair.  I didn&#x27;t use nearly the amount that it tells you to use and it was plenty.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product that smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended if you want to quit overwashing every day with shampoos that strip your hair of its natural oils. My hair was immediately softer, smoother and lighter feeling.  It&#x27;s expensive,  and it seems like a lot of pumps to use (I do refuse to &amp;#34;repeat&amp;#34;), but my hair looks clean for 5 days,  no kidding, so I figure I&#x27;m actually using it at a reasonable rate.  Sounds crazy but even on day 5 people comment on how good my hair smells! (I do pile and clip it up on top of my head to sleep, which totally helps) An additional bonus for my lifted (lightened) dark blonde hair is that it is actually lightened more by this Honey Peach cleansing conditioner,  so my roots can go longer between hair colorings.  I&#x27;m actually SAVING money by using WEN.</li>
    <li> I adore the smell of this one, and the product is excellent. I wish they did not discontinue great smelling products  like this one</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Works just as described.  Leaves your hair shiny and pretty.  No frizz.</li>
    <li> I love it. Will never use regular shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I love wen this is one of my favorite smells</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get used to the no-lather idea for shampoo and it leaves my hair not feeling very clean.  don&#x27;t like this at all and my husband says it smells like B.O.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the Wen cleansing conditions - they are all excellent if you are disciplined about following the directions.  Even my hair dresser noticed how much healthier my hair looked after using these for a few months.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair smell like mildew. I&#x27;ve washed 3 different times thinking I didn&#x27;t put enough in or too much anything to alter what I was doing. In addition, you can&#x27;t read anything on the back of the bottle to help you when trying to see if you are doing something wrong. I washed my hair the last time with this shampoo yesterday, then today went to lunch with a friend and told her what I&#x27;d observed. I asked her to smell my hair, maybe my smell was off.....she said it smelled &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and not right. I attempted to try and contact the seller &amp;#34;Morning Beauty&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m guessing its an Amazon store, because there was no way to contact the seller regarding my concerns and get help. My only option was to leave a rating and/or return the product. I will be returning. Not ok this is so expensive and it stinks up your hair. grrrr.... :(</li>
    <li> I love WEN products, but this is by far my favorite.  It smells wonderful and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> My wife has fallen in love with this product.</li>
    <li> From the wife - Love the smell of Summer honey peach and so does my daughter. I&#x27;ve been using Wen for several years now and love it. Won&#x27;t use anything else. My hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
    <li> I love the produce but do buy a different smell I got the peach one and it was really bad but I did finish it</li>
    <li> I opted to not try this and return it based on numerous reviews that I read about it causing hair loss. My hair is thin enough as it is, so I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk to try it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this on thin hair though it kinda feels heavy and waxy and you&#x27;re supposed to use like 12 pumps at a time which is overkill</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this scent by wen.  I will not be buying it again! Left my hair dry it defiantly didn&#x27;t work as well as the other scents I have used.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious without an overpowering menthol smell, and not a knockoff/fake product. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and, it smells wonderful I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance so far the best---and I think I have now tried just about all except Pumpkin (no thank you on that one--just my opinion)  I cannot believe what a difference Wen products make on my thick wavy, sometimes frizzy hair----frizz no more!!!  I use 6-13 as the conditioner.  My hair dresser  who does not use wen can tell a huge difference in my now silky hair----oh how I wish they had this back in the 70&#x27;s---I now wear my hair just as long as I did way back then---but it is much healthier and silkier----and the texture is what I always wished for.  My hair is very course---when I tried to layer it --each layer tried to do it&#x27;s own thing making look like a red smurf.......no more smurf hair!  yeah--thanks Wen.---I will not buy from the infommercial&#x27;s but Amazon is&lt;br /&gt;THE way to go.  Thank you so much!!! :-0  Happy hair days are here at long last</li>
    <li> I love wen and always have, but this scent in particular is not their best. It smells like cat pee.</li>
    <li> It works the first three weeks really well to clean the toxins out of my hair and it smells great. However, I don&#x27;t need to shower more than once every other day because soaps irritate my skin if i shower everyday, so my hair gets SUPER greasy with this in it. However, this might be because I only use four pumps instead of the 20 recommended. I find that herbal essence works in my hair much better</li>
    <li> Five star 10/10 absolutely love peach wen. I have been using wen for a fear years now. I know which product to use for my hair with the changing seasons. Winter I use lavender because it&#x27;s thicker and more of a balm. The summer peach was the perfect summer cocktail that my hair needed. It didn&#x27;t get oily like the lavender left it. And it didn&#x27;t dry it out. It was a perfect balance. My hair has actually grown since using it and my natural color has shined up a bit. I am a firm wen believer. READ THE RECIPE AND FORMULA. DO NOT JUST PICK A GOOD SMELL. Any wen problem can be fixed with another correct formula.</li>
    <li> I have written a review for WEN already so I won&#x27;t repeat myself. I do want to say that the Summer Honey Peach is wonderful!  I am hoping they will make it a regular option and not just seasonal.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you need to before summer ends.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I am a faithful WEN hair cleanser, with that being said I enjoy trying out different WEN scents, I am currently deplyed so the water is harsh on my hair while the sun is blazing on it all day! So i chose this summer scent and i liked it. The texture and consistency of this cleanser is a plus plsu for my dry, medium course, wavy hair; my hair loved the cleanser! The only reason i gave it 4 stars not 5 was because although I liked the scent it had a weird smell like plastic or a werid smell, I think came from the artificial peach scent, but overall not bad and i truly did like the product.</li>
    <li> smells mild and sweet.  Great for damaged dry hair with a fresh scent of peach</li>
    <li> Product was as described.  Great Price. Fast shipping.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> As with all wen products this one works very well and leaves hair smooth and shiny.  I&#x27;m not fond of the smell of the peach (thought it would be peachier)</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love my Chaz products! Been using Chaz for about 2 years now and won&#x27;t use any other shampoo/ conditioner</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this shampoo, my friend introduced and let me try her &#x27;Sweet Almond Mint&#x27; and I liked the product very much.  It made my hair looking full, moist and smooth. Then I ordered this &#x27;Honey Peach&#x27; because peach is one of my favorite fruits.  I just received it and used once only.  It didn&#x27;t give me the same feel as &#x27;sweet almond mint&#x27;.  My hair is not as moist and smooth as after using &#x27;almond mint&#x27;.  However, I am satisfied with the fullness of my hair look.  Next time I will order &#x27;sweet almond mint&#x27;.  I guess different hair textures may react differently with various products in this line.</li>
    <li> I love this honey peach its the best smelling one !!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product which arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> Works well! Smells wonderful! Hair doesn&#x27;t stay clean as long though.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It works and smells delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon Prime!! I appreciate I can order, as I desire w/free shipping (vs) put on a forced WEN membership w/them arbitrarily deciding to send product and auto billed along w/high shipping charges. With WEN, I was told it was at my discretion, yet their site did not allow me to push back when and what to send me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely HATED this product. It was awful. Made my hair So oily and it was extremely hard to get out. Very disappointed. I will never recommend this to anyone. yuck!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer-I am a big WEN fan, I tried it initially out of frustration with my thick, unruly (think mixed chicks) hair.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed enough of a subtle change to stay with it and by staying with it my hair began to respond and become more manageable, shiny, smooth and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I then experimented with it as a moisturizer, cuticle cream, etc., and found it to be incredibly versatile, it conditioned my skin and nails beautifully too, even soothing pesky insect bites from being outside extensively this past Summer. And itchy, dry, thirsty skin last Winter.&lt;br /&gt;This latest offering was intoxicating to say the least-a juicy, sweet, peach explosion, delicious and delightful.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t expect miracles from products, but I would not switch from WEN unless I was absolutely forced to or they stopped making it, God forbid.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop, as with Mother Nature herself the possibilities are endless, surprise us again!</li>
    <li> Everyone should try Wen products.</li>
    <li> Love WEN products, and I like trying new scents.</li>
    <li> Usually, I like the smell of most Wen products.  In the bottle, Summer Honey Peach had a nice peachy smell, but on my hair, it was entirely a different matter.  There was a chemical odor that reminded me somewhat of bitter grapefruit the second that it was applied to my wet hair.  Mercifully, unlike the Summer Mango Coconut and the Fall Cinnamon Apple, where the smell doesn&#x27;t dissipate even in 24 hours, this fades out after drying.  Because the cleansing conditioner is pricey, I will finish the bottle.  However, there won&#x27;t be a repeat order.</li>
    <li> Always love my wen products</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter who has long, thick, full, latina hair. Absolutely worth every penny! Smells amazing and it makes her hair so soft, silky, and shiny!</li>
    <li> Great product, great scent!</li>
    <li> I like the mint wen hair cleaner, but even though this one has a wonderful scent, I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel by the end of the day. Next order will not be this one. Still makes my hair soft at first, but by the end of the day it get greasy, when normal shampoo doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> Smells good and goes on smooth but I noticed a lot more hair falling out after I used it, and my hair was just as frizzy as usual plus not very workable, not necessarily greasy but kinda greasy. Idk I&#x27;m back to herbal essence</li>
    <li> At first I noticed a difference in my hair being more moisturized. I used it for a week straight and by the end of the week I had to use some Goldwell Shampoo to help decrease the grease.  I literally felt like my hair was chunky and slimy :(</li>
    <li> I love the WEN products...  They are just really expensive.</li>
    <li> leaves the hair feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed. For a week. I used 10 pumps for my shoulder length hair. And one pump as leave in conditioner. It dried out my hair. I now have rough dried up flyaways hair, sticking out all over my head now. It does not work as advertised. Not happy at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am sure this product would work if it came with a pump so I could use it</li>
    <li> this product does nothing but make hair so greasy it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> My hair has less frizzy and more smooth</li>
    <li> WEN  is awesome...I just can&#x27;t say enough about it...my hair feels great...the only thing I would defiantly say is Not to follow the directions of how much to use....I just use about 2 full pumps to my hair and I have hair to the middle of my back but semi thinnish...works and smells great</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN products for almost a year now after someone gave me the first bottle as a gift. I probably would never have bought it for myself, but now I am a convert! I think the key (after reading so many mixed reviews) is to experiment with how much product you need for your hair length and type, wash it twice per the directions, and really massage the product into your hair and rinse, rinse, rinse thoroughly until you don&#x27;t feel it anymore! I have very fine, color-treated, chin-length hair which I was washing every day. With Wen, I now wash every other day and it&#x27;s fine. The most noticeable differences for me have been how shiny this made my hair, even after one use, AND the fact that my color lasts much longer. I know it&#x27;s expensive, but it replaces shampoo, conditioner and styling products if you&#x27;re lucky so it&#x27;s not that bad in the scheme of things. One bottle lasts me between 1 1/2- 2 months and I use 4 pumps for the first wash and 4 pumps for the second. I cannot see going back to regular shampoo. I have tried different fragrances for each bottle I have used - summer mango coconut, spring gardenia green tea, sweet almond mint and now, the summer honey peach. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in how each formula affected my hair, but the summer honey peach is BY FAR the best-smelling of the bunch. Like fresh peaches and honeysuckle - I&#x27;m going to stock up on this one while they are available. Also, I have purchased these from Amazon, QVC, and Sephora, but not from the official WEN site as I read many horror stories about the issues people had with their &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; and canceling if they weren&#x27;t happy. I would definitely recommend at least trying this product - well worth it!</li>
    <li> The first use I was amazed. Then the second time my hair came out oily. The third time I rinsed extra long to make sure it wasnt oily. Still had the effect. For the price and amount you have to use, it&#x27;s just not worth it!</li>
    <li> Heavy perfume peach scent. My daughter likes it, but it gags me. It also did not perform as promised on her biracial extra curly, puffy hair. It does moisturize well, but does not reduce the volume and make her curls look defined.....AT ALL. It was just like any average deep conditioner. I tried to use it on my hair which is thick, straight and normal to oily and by the end of the day it made my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it for a week: oily and gross! NOT worth that crazy price tag. Save your money and go buy some Suave. Seriously.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, especially this scent. I&#x27;m going natural which turns out to be very hard work. When I first used this product I was disappointed with the fact that it wasn&#x27;t lathering up but then my friend who is a WEN user explained that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to. Once I got over that, I&#x27;ve been enjoying using it. My hair is very manageable after I wash it now and i don&#x27;t have to necessarily make sure all of it washes out. It&#x27;s great that I can wash, condition and moisturize afterwards with this one product. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It reminds me of picking fresh peaches from the orchards, amazing.  Remember just because I love the fragrance doesn&#x27;t mean another person does.  Everyone is different.  I did notice a bit of difference in the consistency, maybe a little thinner a bit whiter, I&#x27;m not sure, but it was something.  It did work well as I expected.  Also, every head of hair is different.  I always use globs of this, don&#x27;t be stingy.  If your hair feels greasy you didn&#x27;t use enough.  Since I didn&#x27;t purchase a huge bottle I decided to use this more for my leave-in since I use the Fig (for moisture) and the Tea Tree (for scalp issues).  I plan on buying this again if I can find a good price.  I really wish he (Chaz Dean) made this in gallons, but he said on QVC it&#x27;s not going to happen so don&#x27;t ask.  I would put this fragrance as one of my top fragrances with the 613, in fact; I love this fragrance better than the Fig, but the Fig has tons of moisture for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the WEN product that  I purchased. I will continue using it. thanks</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of Wen but I do buy it occasionally for a change of pace. Not much fragrance though.</li>
    <li> Scrumptious fragrance; one of the best scented cleansers in the Wen line.  CVontains all sorts of extra ingredients which make the hair healthier.</li>
    <li> I tried this with low expectations. However I was blown away by this product! I personally love the way it smells very peachy; similar to country peach from BBW. I used it as the directions stated 8 pumps scrub head and hair leave in. Rise and repeat. As soon as I took the towel off my head I saw a difference. My hair was shiner. When I blew it dry it had crazy shine and more volume than I&#x27;ve ever achieved with a plethora products! I curled it with no other products and the curls and volume stayed all day! Call me a convert! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using this product wrong but it makes my hair very oily. It says to use 10-12 pumps for shoulder length hair and I my hair came out dirtier after the shower, so I tried using less but that didn&#x27;t help. I love the smell of the summer honey peach but I don&#x27;t like the result.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. It made my hair feel very dirty. IT smells great....BUT that&#x27;s it. Will not purchase again or continue using.</li>
</ol>
