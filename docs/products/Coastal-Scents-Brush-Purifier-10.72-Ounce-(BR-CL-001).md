      <li>But it is a good product.</li>

      <li>but i don&#x27;t think its safe</li>
      <li>I was going to just replace them, but I&#x27;m glad I opted for this instead.</li>
      <li>It was an eye opener for sure.</li>
      <li>Really glad I got this stuff.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I did, because I like the product.</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>It seems like she is satisfied with them</li>
      <li>It was amazing how much make-up came off of my brushes!!</li>
      <li>But if you have a full set, like say 13 or more, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
      <li>My brushes didn&#x27;t dry out afterwards which made me SUPER happy!  </li>
      <li>This product was super helpful in pushing me towards better brush hygiene.</li>
      <li>This would be a great product if you had maybe five make-up brushes (total) that you&#x27;re using.</li>
      <li>It works well and my brushes look fantastic but they were a pain to rinse....</li>
      <li>Does a fantastic job cleaning my makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and pleased with them so far.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>I love this product, it cleans my makeup brushes very well!</li>
      <li>Anything else, it does not seem to get the brush clean.</li>
      <li>i found a solution to getting the brushes clean</li>
      <li>I used maybe 2 ounces of solution to clean about 10 brushes.  </li>
      <li>I clean my brushes weekly so that bacteria does not build up and clog my pores.  </li>
      <li>you have to clean your brushes weekly</li>
      <li>Long bristled brushes will definately use this up kind of quickly, but if you don&#x27;t use brushes for your foundation, you could get more uses out of the bottle because you won&#x27;t need to put so much in the cup to cover the bristles of your brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this to clean my brush set, and it appears to get the brushes very clean, and leaves them soft.  </li>
      <li>These really gets my brushes super clean and there is a lot of product here :) Bottom line can not beat them for the price and it doesn&#x27;t dry your brushes out :)</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth the money...</li>
      <li>; Second,you rinse it(them)in warm water; And Third, you let it(them)dry overnight.</li>
      <li>I got this product and used it right away.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like how much I have to use to soak my brushes clean.</li>
      <li>This brush cleaner works great and takes very little effort to remove makeup and residue from my brushes.  </li>
      <li>i just wish the bottle was bigger so that way it would last me longer, but over all great product.</li>
      <li>This works very well and quickly.</li>
      <li>First, you soak your makeup brush(s) in the solution for 15-20 min.</li>
      <li>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser lil bit is enough</li>
      <li>Will totally buy more when I needed.</li>
      <li>i already used almost the entire bottle to clean the brushes but the brushes still weren&#x27;t clean, even when i work the stinking solution into the brushes.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t get the stains out of your brushes if you&#x27;ve used dark eye make-up on a light colored brush, but I will clean the make-up out of them!  </li>
      <li>It works a lot faster then other brush purifiers and actually makes them smell good when they&#x27;re all clean.</li>
      <li>This came earlier than expected and was a great surprise.</li>
      <li>Brushes come out clean and soft...</li>
      <li>The brushes looked like they were completely rinsed but when swirled around in a glass of clean water soap</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d have to clean several brushes at a time, soak them, rinse them, and maybe soak them again to really get them to come clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a super clean person, and I don&#x27;t know why it never dawned on me until recently that I should wash these things.</li>
      <li>iT IS SIMPLE AD EASY</li>
      <li>This worked really well for my brushes.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s too much time.</li>
      <li>This one did not get much out, if that.</li>
      <li>It defiantly cleans a brush its fast</li>
      <li>it really gets all the guck and dirt out of my brushes.because</li>
      <li>It does the job, cleans my eyeshadow brushes and foundation bushes very well</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions, you end up using more than expected.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with make up.</li>
      <li>The amount in the bottle just isn&#x27;t much.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this cleaner to anyone that wants to preserve the life of their makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>Needed a really good makeup cleaner because all my brushes are white with pink.</li>
      <li>Only downside is that it seems to take a lot of it to get them clean</li>
      <li>I simply soaked them for about an hour and then rinsed them until the water ran clean.  </li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t cleaned them in a month or more which is most likely why I needed to use so much solution, but I was hoping it would last a little longer than it did.</li>
      <li>I used about 1/5 of the bottle doing one very good cleaning of all my brushes (foundation, blush, a few eyeshadow, eyeliner, and a few new ones I had purchased, etc)</li>
      <li>After use my brushes came out shinny, soft, and back to their original shape.</li>
      <li>This cleaner cleans brushes very well and the bristles are still soft.</li>
      <li>I laid them on a clean towel to dry and they retained their shape and softness.  </li>
      <li>It worked well, left some of my brushes really soft and others kind of rough.</li>
      <li>My brushes feel soo soft!</li>
      <li>Also, I had to clean all the brushes twice with this solution so the bottle did not last as long as i wished</li>
      <li>I am pleases so far with this product.</li>
      <li>It takes a little time, but gets them clean.</li>
      <li>So for that reason, in the long run, it&#x27;s really not that cheap.</li>
      <li>You have to be careful with how much you use....</li>
      <li>My wife uses this to clean her pretty expensive (I think)</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I can be a little heavy handed.</li>
      <li>fantastik heavy duty cleanser and dish-washing liquid got the makeup out the first time using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a set of brushes I have had for about a year, and never cleaned. I&#x27;m a super clean person, and I don&#x27;t know why it never dawned on me until recently that I should wash these things. Now that I have, and have seen the crud stuck in them, I&#x27;m definitely going to keep up. This product was super helpful in pushing me towards better brush hygiene. After use my brushes came out shinny, soft, and back to their original shape. I was going to just replace them, but I&#x27;m glad I opted for this instead. Just a few drops of this on one of my eye shadow brushes and immediately stuff was coming out of the brush. It was an eye opener for sure. Really glad I got this stuff.</li>
    <li> You have to be careful with how much you use....It&#x27;s good though.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I only wish it came in a larger bottle. Did not harm brush bristles. I&#x27;m not sure of its disinfectant properties though.</li>
    <li> like the title said it doesn&#x27;t do anything. i already used almost the entire bottle to clean the brushes but the brushes still weren&#x27;t clean, even when i work the stinking solution into the brushes. this is a waste of money!!!! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS BRUSH CLEANER IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK!!!!!!. i found a solution to getting the brushes clean but i don&#x27;t think its safe but i&#x27;m gonna do it anyway, fantastik heavy duty cleanser and dish-washing liquid got the makeup out the first time using it.</li>
    <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it can be a little difficult to remove from your powder or blush brushes. But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because I can be a little heavy handed. It defiantly cleans a brush its fast and I love it.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a residue on the brushes and it takes too long to dry. Not a good choice for quick cleaning.</li>
    <li> This works great for my brushes. it really gets all the guck and dirt out of my brushes.because you have to clean your brushes weekly i just wish the bottle was bigger so that way it would last me longer, but over all great product.</li>
    <li> The product does remove makeup from your brushes but it takes too long to rinse out. I kept rinsing out my brushes and soap kept coming out. I used the correct amount instructed on the directions. The brushes looked like they were completely rinsed but when swirled around in a glass of clean water soap kept making the water bubbly. I spent 20 minutes just rinsing out four big brushes. That&#x27;s too much time. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This cleaner cleans brushes very well and the bristles are still soft. The problem is, since you have to fully submerge the bristles, depending on the brushes you&#x27;re cleaning, you may not get very many uses out of the bottle. I used about 1/5 of the bottle doing one very good cleaning of all my brushes (foundation, blush, a few eyeshadow, eyeliner, and a few new ones I had purchased, etc) and they can all be soaked in the same solution, but the foundation brushes have somewhat long bristles and you have to soak them to get all the makeup out of them. Long bristled brushes will definately use this up kind of quickly, but if you don&#x27;t use brushes for your foundation, you could get more uses out of the bottle because you won&#x27;t need to put so much in the cup to cover the bristles of your brush.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed this this cleaner. Other cleaners I have used have always gotten the liquid foundation out of my foundation brush. This one did not get much out, if that. If you&#x27;re looking for eye brush cleaner, this one works. Anything else, it does not seem to get the brush clean.</li>
    <li> cleans the brushes really good and when your done you see all the make up that was just stuck in the brush</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I use it for cleaning all my brushes!</li>
    <li> At the price offered I can&#x27;t complain about the product.  It won&#x27;t get the stains out of your brushes if you&#x27;ve used dark eye make-up on a light colored brush, but I will clean the make-up out of them!  I used maybe 2 ounces of solution to clean about 10 brushes.  The solution has a \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; scent to it, but doesn&#x27;t create suds.  My brushes didn&#x27;t dry out afterwards which made me SUPER happy!  Will totally buy more when I needed.</li>
    <li> It worked well, left some of my brushes really soft and others kind of rough. The problem I have with it is that it leaves a lot of residue which takes a long time to wash out. It took me hours, literally, to wash it out.</li>
    <li> Love this brush cleaner. Works so good and you see that its taking all the dirt and grime out of your brushes!!! Will be buying more !!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it cleans my makeup brushes very well! I have not had any problems with this product at all!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser lil bit is enough</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered two of these but I&#x27;m glad that I did, because I like the product. Very easy to use and pleased with them so far.</li>
    <li> These really gets my brushes super clean and there is a lot of product here :) Bottom line can not beat them for the price and it doesn&#x27;t dry your brushes out :)</li>
    <li> This brush cleaner smells nice and does a good job of cleaning makeup brushes.  Brushes come out clean and soft...I would recommend this cleaner to anyone that wants to preserve the life of their makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> This came earlier than expected and was a great surprise. I liked the cleaner but the smell was not the  greatest. Also, I had to clean all the brushes twice with this solution so the bottle did not last as long as i wished</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with make up. I am pleases so far with this product. I will post new review if my brushes start going bad.</li>
    <li> clean&#x27;s my brushes good and i dont have to sit there and scrub them like how i use to. Great product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Needed a really good makeup cleaner because all my brushes are white with pink. It takes a little time, but gets them clean.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 of these bottles and just barley used up one bottle....ive had them for at least 3 months. the only thing i dont like is it takes forever to get all the soap off the brushes.ive noticed if i just put a small amount into a cup and then dip my brush that its not as bad</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks! It takes forever to dry, and leaves your brushes oily! It borderline ruins your brushes. None of my brushes have applied makeup the same since I used this. The worst.</li>
    <li> This brush cleaner works great and takes very little effort to remove makeup and residue from my brushes.  I simply soaked them for about an hour and then rinsed them until the water ran clean.  I laid them on a clean towel to dry and they retained their shape and softness.  I clean my brushes weekly so that bacteria does not build up and clog my pores.  This product has a pleasant, clean smell and did not damage my brushes or cause the bristles to fall out.  It especially worked well on one of my brushes I use for separating my lashes after applying mascara.  It took the mascara off the brush without any scrubbing!  Awesome product, highly recommend!  [[ASIN:B005FKTDLW Coastal Scents Brush Purifier, 10.72 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Does a fantastic job cleaning my makeup brushes. Could not believe the amount of dirt &amp; makeup that came off from the brush purifier. Worth it!</li>
    <li> I was great. It just takes a while to wash out all of the residue out of the brushes. Okay</li>
    <li> It does the job, cleans my eyeshadow brushes and foundation bushes very well w/t leaving any residue. I just soak my brushes in it for 15 min and rinse them under lukewarm water. My problem is that the design of the container makes it very hard to use. I have to pour some into my 2 oz disposable cups and soak my brushes, I wish I could pump it out. I won&#x27;t repurchase it, going back to clinique.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to clean my brush set, and it appears to get the brushes very clean, and leaves them soft.  Only downside is that it seems to take a lot of it to get them clean (I soaked my brushes in it).  I hadn&#x27;t cleaned them in a month or more which is most likely why I needed to use so much solution, but I was hoping it would last a little longer than it did.</li>
    <li> The Costal Scents Brush Purifier Works so well... It works a lot faster then other brush purifiers and actually makes them smell good when they&#x27;re all clean. Who ever created this... Thank You!! This is definitely worth the money... Oh my goodness... it makes me want to purify my brushes rather than oh its time to purify my brushes!! Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn Lo Coco&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005FKTDLW Coastal Scents Brush Purifier, 10.72 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to clean her pretty expensive (I think) MAC brushes. It seems like she is satisfied with them</li>
    <li> I like this brush purifier and feel like it cleans out my brushes quite well. So why the reason for 4 stars? The amount in the bottle just isn&#x27;t much. I used it once and am almost halfway through the bottle. Granted I cleaned out all my brushes at once, but nevertheless. If you follow the directions, you end up using more than expected. So for that reason, in the long run, it&#x27;s really not that cheap.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for my brushes. I added a lot of water to the mixture to make it go further.</li>
    <li> I got this product and used it right away. It works well and my brushes look fantastic but they were a pain to rinse....But it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff because my acne was flaring up for no apparent reason; also my face, after applying makeup in the morning, felt grimy at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it out and it works quite simply: First, you soak your makeup brush(s) in the solution for 15-20 min. ; Second,you rinse it(them)in warm water; And Third, you let it(them)dry overnight. I love this Purifier, it cleans my makeup brush thoroughly and my pores are now unclogged!</li>
    <li> This works very well and quickly.</li>
    <li> My brushes feel soo soft! It was amazing how much make-up came off of my brushes!! I plan on ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> THANKS SO MUCH AND SORRY FOR TAKING SO LONG TO MAKE A REVIEW. iT IS SIMPLE AD EASY I HOPE EVRY ONE TRIES IT BC THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
    <li> I used it on several different types of brushes and the makeup ran off the brushes as I put it on.  Great product and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> this product is essential for wash for makeup brushes and sponges.  This product removes all of the makeup from the brushes and because of this you get less break outs on your face.  This product goes a long way because you only need a small amount. This is an excellent product from coastal scents.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how much I have to use to soak my brushes clean. This would be a great product if you had maybe five make-up brushes (total) that you&#x27;re using. But if you have a full set, like say 13 or more, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. You&#x27;d have to clean several brushes at a time, soak them, rinse them, and maybe soak them again to really get them to come clean. If you only use your brushes occasionally, you won&#x27;t have a problem. If you wear make up daily, you may not want to use this.</li>
