      <li>my favorite shopping place.</li>
      <li>Gives my skin a nice, clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Cleared up all my face acne and had greatly improved my body acne, and it seems to only be getting better!</li>
      <li>there is so much product in here, it will take years to finish honestly!</li>
      <li>but for the most part its fine...</li>
      <li>Every once in a while I get blemishes and it clears it right up!!</li>
      <li>It gives a clean refreshing feeling and moisturizing softness.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this soap.</li>
      <li>Nice product and fast delevery .</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about its usages.</li>
      <li>My light/moderate acne has neither improved nor worsened since I started using this product, but I am happy with it because it is a VERY reasonably priced and natural soap!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my new cleansing regimen.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, which is wonderful, and it&#x27;s also very gentle on skin, but I got it predominantly because I read multiple reviews that it was good with eczema.</li>
      <li>You will be clean FIRST!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>and I love how it lathers real well and cleans my face.</li>
      <li>I really haven&#x27;t been this pimple free since before puberty!</li>
      <li>can smell good later.....</li>
      <li>Certainly not a bad product, but not anything I&#x27;d ever go out of my way to seek out again.</li>
      <li>They all made my skin feel clean, fresh and kept the moisture in.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>highly recommend using an exfoliating glove for better results, also sold on amazon.</li>
      <li>when washing off the product it leaves a squeaky clean feel but when you dry your face it becomes flakey (the skin) but as long as you have a good moisturizer you&#x27;ll be good</li>
      <li>It does leave my skin feeling deeply cleaned, but it&#x27;s very important to moisturize!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sud up as nice as the solid bar of soap, but if you don&#x27;t like bar soap then this is definitely the next best alternative!</li>
      <li>Love it live by it</li>
      <li>This is the first time I tried it!</li>
      <li>Fatty shipping, great product</li>
      <li>just clears it right up.</li>
      <li>I love the squeaky clean feeling this amazing soap leaves behind.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft and smooth all day.</li>
      <li>makes my skin super soft!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try, and has multiple uses if the original use does not work for you.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need much AT ALL each time you use it, i&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and you can&#x27;t even tell that any is gone.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery is always a plus.</li>
      <li>so this has really help my break outs.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it does much for my acne.</li>
      <li>Of course, all skin is different, so it could be my skin far more than the product in and of itself.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s very cleansing.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see this doing absolutely nothing for it.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t purchase or use any African black soap of any kind again.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it my blemishes seemed smaller over night but after about a month of use</li>
      <li>I gave the contents a good stir and am putting some into a small jar to avoid taking up too much counter space and to prevent compromising the entire tub by scooping up product with wet hands.</li>
      <li>This particular brand has little to no smell, the price is very reasonable and the shipping was very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I got this soap in hopes that it would help with my acne/oily sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that the easiest way to work with it is to take your loofa or Clarisonic, rinse, squeeze, then rub it in the soap to get just enough; instead of trying to scoop out the soap or getting too much water in the tub.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
      <li>I experienced a break out this bad in 7 years.</li>
      <li>the blemishes on my face are blurring and my skin in general is clearer.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this product several days.</li>
      <li>Then I decided to switch between my previous facial cleanser and this soap, which was fine for a while, but still was leaving my skin really dry even with moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I first read about the benefits of African Black Soap Tub in a woman&#x27;s magazine.  </li>
      <li>My face is pretty sensitive to this soap due to the pieces of ash in it, it&#x27;s really harsh.  </li>

<li> My face is pretty sensitive to this soap due to the pieces of ash in it, it&#x27;s really harsh.  </li>
<li> and I have not experienced the magical transformation I was led to expect from other reviews.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for a new soap for my face, so I have been using this African black soap for about a month.</li>
<li> This happened to me only once and was very minor.</li>
<li> It helped my acne clear a little bit, but not completely.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s texture is soft and a little scoop goes a long way!</li>
<li> and it lasts a LONG time</li>
<li> The black soap he brought was authentic while this was a fake.</li>
<li> In fact, daily use of this soap may slightly over-exfoliate skin, leading it to become slightly red and flaky for a day or two.</li>
<li> Definitely a difference from the other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve recently stopped using it on my face, but have been using it on some other parts of my body which have acne problems and those</li>
<li> I have tried several brands and found little difference between them.</li>
<li> And I only used it for a few seconds.</li>
<li> I will say you have to be careful with this soap, there are some sediments which feels like itty bitty rocks</li>
<li> It clears up bites, rashes, and any other skin issues.</li>
<li> Maybe it has worked wonders with other people but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
<li> recently retired and brought a block of  raw black soap</li>
<li> Initially I washed my face every day with it, which in about a few days it really dried my face out.</li>
<li> One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that blemishes now leave a dark scar whether or not they&#x27;ve been popped when using this soap.</li>
<li> This can be avoided by using it every other day, or taking a day or two break from it when skin starts to feel raw or look pink.</li>
<li> However, I only have two very small, quarter sized patches of eczema.</li>
<li> Let me start off sharing that I have tried a few other black soaps.  </li>
<li> have seen a little improvement, so i hope that continues.</li>
<li> This product dried up two zits I had over night.</li>
<li> This is fake  African black soap that was Not produced in Ghana or west Africa for that matter.  </li>
<li> Either way, it wasn&#x27;t an awful product, simply nothing I&#x27;d be interested in again.</li>
<li> Now my skin is almost cleared thanks to oil cleansing with hemp seed oil but those nasty dark spots won&#x27;t go...</li>
<li> Dries my face, caused me breakouts, now I have those dark weird pimples on my forehead.  </li>
<li> but if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer it makes your skin red and painful.</li>
<li> No oil in the late afternoons!</li>
<li> Nothing insane.</li>
<li> This product made my skin break out horribly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> there is so much product in here, it will take years to finish honestly! you don&#x27;t need much AT ALL each time you use it, i&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and you can&#x27;t even tell that any is gone. makes my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> What am I supposed to do with this?</li>
    <li> Love it live by it and it lasts a LONG time</li>
    <li> It has been several weeks and I have not experienced the magical transformation I was led to expect from other reviews. In fact, daily use of this soap may slightly over-exfoliate skin, leading it to become slightly red and flaky for a day or two. This can be avoided by using it every other day, or taking a day or two break from it when skin starts to feel raw or look pink. This happened to me only once and was very minor.

Definitely worth a try, and has multiple uses if the original use does not work for you. Look online to find the best method of use to suit your needs!</li>
    <li> Fatty shipping, great product</li>
    <li> great quality as if i bought it straight from the original website &amp; its cheaper!! :-) it&#x27;s starting to help my acne and i&#x27;ve literally only used it twice. the blemishes on my face are blurring and my skin in general is clearer. when washing off the product it leaves a squeaky clean feel but when you dry your face it becomes flakey (the skin) but as long as you have a good moisturizer you&#x27;ll be good</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried it! I love it! It&#x27;s texture is soft and a little scoop goes a long way! I follow up with the Shea butter! Together it makes my skin look &amp; feel smooth!</li>
    <li> It works well for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Nice product and fast delevery . Thank you</li>
    <li> Truly feel the difference vs regular soap</li>
    <li> Certainly not a bad product, but not anything I&#x27;d ever go out of my way to seek out again. It lasts a long time, which is wonderful, and it&#x27;s also very gentle on skin, but I got it predominantly because I read multiple reviews that it was good with eczema. It didn&#x27;t help at all with mine. Of course, all skin is different, so it could be my skin far more than the product in and of itself. However, I only have two very small, quarter sized patches of eczema. Nothing insane. I was surprised to see this doing absolutely nothing for it. Either way, it wasn&#x27;t an awful product, simply nothing I&#x27;d be interested in again.</li>
    <li> I got this soap in hopes that it would help with my acne/oily sensitive skin. It definitely shrink pores and removes oil but if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer it makes your skin red and painful. The first time I used it my blemishes seemed smaller over night but after about a month of use I don&#x27;t think it does much for my acne. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that blemishes now leave a dark scar whether or not they&#x27;ve been popped when using this soap.</li>
    <li> Best soap! I&#x27;ve been using it for years! Cured my eczema!</li>
    <li> Let me start off sharing that I have tried a few other black soaps.  I have tried several brands and found little difference between them. They all made my skin feel clean, fresh and kept the moisture in.  This particular brand has little to no smell, the price is very reasonable and the shipping was very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using an exfoliating glove for better results, also sold on amazon.</li>
    <li> This has been amazing for my oily skin, face &amp; shoulders.  Everything is or is well on its way to being cleared up and I don&#x27;t have the oily gook feeling at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve found that the easiest way to work with it is to take your loofa or Clarisonic, rinse, squeeze, then rub it in the soap to get just enough; instead of trying to scoop out the soap or getting too much water in the tub.  This pairs well with Alba Bonticals Hibiscus toner.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Cleared up all my face acne and had greatly improved my body acne, and it seems to only be getting better! I really haven&#x27;t been this pimple free since before puberty! The tub is biog enough to last you quite awhile. I strongly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for a new soap for my face, so I have been using this African black soap for about a month. Initially I washed my face every day with it, which in about a few days it really dried my face out. Then I decided to switch between my previous facial cleanser and this soap, which was fine for a while, but still was leaving my skin really dry even with moisturizer. My face is pretty sensitive to this soap due to the pieces of ash in it, it&#x27;s really harsh.  I&#x27;ve recently stopped using it on my face, but have been using it on some other parts of my body which have acne problems and those have seen a little improvement, so i hope that continues. It does leave my skin feeling deeply cleaned, but it&#x27;s very important to moisturize!</li>
    <li> This is my second tub and I love it. Every once in a while I get blemishes and it clears it right up!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 mths now and I must say that its worked wonders for my skin, I have eczema so this has really help my break outs. I don&#x27;t use anything else. I will say you have to be careful with this soap, there are some sediments which feels like itty bitty rocks but for the most part its fine...</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Gives my skin a nice, clean feeling.</li>
    <li> It helped my acne clear a little bit, but not completely.</li>
    <li> Dries my face, caused me breakouts, now I have those dark weird pimples on my forehead.  Won&#x27;t purchase or use any African black soap of any kind again. Now my skin is almost cleared thanks to oil cleansing with hemp seed oil but those nasty dark spots won&#x27;t go...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! Keeps my skin soft and smooth all day. No oil in the late afternoons!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this product several days. I can see my pores tighten. I have a youthful glow on my skin. This product dried up two zits I had over night. I am very pleased with my new cleansing regimen. I do recommend this product. I will be adding shea butter as my moisturizer also.</li>
    <li> You will be clean FIRST!&lt;br /&gt;You can smell good later.....&lt;br /&gt;Where ever You feel You have a smell issue, this is the answer....</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s very cleansing.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery is always a plus. Been using the soap once in the morning and before bed since receiving...I have oily skin and I love how it lathers real well and cleans my face. It gives a clean refreshing feeling and moisturizing softness. Definitely a difference from the other soaps I&#x27;ve used. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is fake  African black soap that was Not produced in Ghana or west Africa for that matter.  My relative  came from Ghana recently retired and brought a block of  raw black soap and I melted it to where it could be placed in a tub. The black soap he brought was authentic while this was a fake.</li>
    <li> Lathers and cleans well. The consistency was very lumpy and it can be a bit messy to scoop products from the jar. I gave the contents a good stir and am putting some into a small jar to avoid taking up too much counter space and to prevent compromising the entire tub by scooping up product with wet hands. The product is good. Just wished there was an easier way of using it.</li>
    <li> Continues to be an excellent product</li>
    <li> I have always had a facial skin problem and this soap works well on oily skin.</li>
    <li> I first read about the benefits of African Black Soap Tub in a woman&#x27;s magazine.  I checked it out on Amazon,  my favorite shopping place. I love the squeaky clean feeling this amazing soap leaves behind.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about its usages. It clears up bites, rashes, and any other skin issues.</li>
    <li> Have only used it for 2 days and already see improvement in my skin.  Please with the product.</li>
    <li> It came exactly when it said and works great</li>
    <li> Very gentle for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing!!!  I have eczema and this product just clears it right up. Within two weeks my skin is clearer, more toned and glowing. I have been using this products for 5 years and i will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin break out horribly. I experienced a break out this bad in 7 years.</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER! Works for my acne and everything! Doesn&#x27;t sud up as nice as the solid bar of soap, but if you don&#x27;t like bar soap then this is definitely the next best alternative! Also it lasts FOREVER!</li>
    <li> The African Soap did not do anything different for my face except that it burned it and made it break out. And I only used it for a few seconds. Maybe it has worked wonders with other people but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
