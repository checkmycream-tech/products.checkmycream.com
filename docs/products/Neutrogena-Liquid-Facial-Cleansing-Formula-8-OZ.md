      <li>Those of us with acne need to be gentle with our faces, so this is a huge benefit.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best face soap.  Clean and easy.</li>
    <li> Love the clean, non-greasy feeling of Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Facial cleaner does dry out my face as reviews have posted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a straight male. This is by far my favorite personal care item. It cuts through gobs of zit-inducing grime and oil on my face and best of all it smells like absolutely nothing. That said, it gets rid of all the oil, so you better follow it with some Neutrogena face lotion, my second favorite product.</li>
    <li> Light smell. Much better than the deep clean .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had persistent acne for about 5 years now and have tried all sorts of cleansers (and other products) to try to reduce the amount of pimples I get. This is the only cleanser that cleans my skin of oils and dirt and doesn&#x27;t cause more acne or other adverse affects. After I tried it and liked it I tried others, and my acne got worse again! Not exactly scientific evidence, but I&#x27;m pretty convinced this is really helping to clean off sebum (which indirectly causes acne). I also tried the fragrance version (by accident) and didn&#x27;t like the smell... The fragrance-free smells better. A bit chemical-ly but barely noticeable. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue so you don&#x27;t have to wipe it off, rinsing by splashing water on my face about 3 times is enough. Those of us with acne need to be gentle with our faces, so this is a huge benefit.    I use it twice a day, everyday, and along with moisturizer it has helped me quite a bit. I should really see a dermatologist, but for now this is great. It does dry out the skin a bit, so you&#x27;ll want to protect it with a moisturizer and sunscreen (which is really a given if you are like me). It got removed from the local store I used to always get it from, so thankfully it&#x27;s now available on Amazon! And with Subscribe &amp; Save!!</li>
    <li> About three months ago, an upscale skin care brand that shall not be named opened a store nearby and I decided it was time to graduate to \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; skincare products. I ran out and bought a whole expensive set that I was positive would do amazing things for my skin. I wanted so badly to love it after dropping that much money but \\&quot;amazing things\\&quot; turned out to be breakouts ALL the time. After trying to stick it out for a while I decided that I needed to go back to basics. When I got an amazon offer for Neutrogena products I was all over it. Returning to Neutrogena was like coming home again - after growing up with their products in the house I trust them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is great for my normal-to-oily skin. After just a few days of making the switch, my horrifying breakouts from the other cleanser were starting to fade and a couple weeks later my skin looks and feels much better. The cleanser lathers up well, smells just fine and looks like the bottle will last a while. It even helped prevent hormone-related breakouts that I thought I was destined to endure on a monthly basis. I&#x27;ve been using it with their Stress Control Toner and oil-free SPF 15 moisturizer and have had no skin troubles at all. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> great stuff!!! use it all the time</li>
    <li> Such an inexpensive simple cleanser but I love it! I have sensitive, problematic skin prone to break outs and since I have been using this my skin is smooth and clear! It smells so clean too. I will use this soap forever!</li>
    <li> I am skin-obsessed, and therefore OBSESSED with Liquid Neutrogena. I have been using this since I was a teenager, and at 35, I still use it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, and it also doesn&#x27;t leave any residue like many other cleansers do. It leaves my skin perfectly clean. This is critical because I use SkinMedica retin A serum and I believe you need really clean skin to make sure it penetrates, etc. I then moisturize with La Mer. That&#x27;s the trifecta. I&#x27;ve tried other skin cleansers, but always regret it, and keep coming back to this.</li>
    <li> I know this is supposed to be fragrance free but I can smell it! It smells like wax, not pleasant but I overlook it cause it leaves my skin so smooth and fresh :)</li>
    <li> It feels great and smooth. If added some flower or fruit smell, it would be better. Anyway, I like it. Sometimes, I use this facial cleanser along with sea salt. Somebody told me it&#x27;s a great combination.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product was not the best for my skin. It left it very dry feeling and not very clean. I don&#x27;t have terrible acne but I have been getting some lately and it make it a bit worse. I switched to a different product with much better results.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great product. it cleans face deeply. love it. In fact my in law also love to order this product but it was out of stock at this time.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes my face feel super clean without drying it out.</li>
    <li> What can I say it is what it claims to be</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try it.  I guess I normally go for flashier packaging and products that make outlandish claims of what they can do.  But, this basic old stand-by is really the best if you have dry skin.  It cleans thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a dry, tight feeling at all.  I even wash off mascara and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes.</li>
    <li> I will always use this product, as I know that it will get my face clean without damaging my skin.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003BMI628 Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid Neutrogena, Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way my face feels squeaky clean with no residue of the product.</li>
    <li> Finally A Neutrogena Facial Cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out!!! I have tried a billion of neutrogena facial wash products and every single last one of them left me with dry patches on my skin and made my skin feel extremely tight. This product is incredible. I have sensitive dry skin and this product leaves my skin hydrated yet clean. It doesn&#x27;t have that invigorating tingling clean but after I use this my face feels very soft and it gets my make up off... That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been searching for and I found it! This facial wash has no fragrance... Doesn&#x27;t seem to have any harsh chemicals in it... Just a simple face wash.. Finally!</li>
    <li> I used this as a teen up until I was older and didn&#x27;t need it anymore it really helped with my acne. I also suffered from oily skin which helped, made your face look shinny and refreshed after use and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I like that its fragrance free so you can use your favorite body mist later or deodorant and not smell like your wearing 2 or 3 different smells. Great value for the price</li>
    <li> This is a good soap. I also use it in the bar form now too. The fragrance kind of stinks but it doesn&#x27;t really smell chemically. I like this soap so much because it has few ingredients and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all; aside from the dryness factor of using soap but that is just soap. I should mention that I have sensitive skin and can be quite a baby when it comes to bath products and their usual shortcomings. This is a solid choice.</li>
    <li> As a middle-aged man, this the only liquid face soap that I will use.  Love it.  Not harsh and no smell.  Leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a deep clean.</li>
    <li> By far one of the best fragrance-free facial cleansers! I even use to clean my make-up brushes too! The best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have been washing my face with Neutrogena Fragrance Free liquid facial cleanser for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried others but always go back for this one which doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Another item from the great neutrogena line. Less messy than the bar soap. This line of products is great for sensitive skin. Cheaper than retail. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The best oil controlling face wash. Well if your skin is acne prone that is. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Unless you have other skin issues.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena facial cleanser has been around for many many years.  It came out in bar form long before it appeared in liquid form from a pump bottle.I used the bar form when I was a teenager and truly believed that it kept me from having the teenage pimply problems my friends had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do still like the bar and use it, I also have the pump bottle that I keep in the shower.  There is no soap dish gobbed up with residue to contend with and the pump bottle is so easy to access, especially when my hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no perfume added to Neutrogena nor does it have any medicinal smell, which is one reason I use this.  Just one pump rubbed together on my hands creating a foam and that is all that is needed to cleanse my whole face.  And it completely rinses off leaving no residue.  I have very sensitive skin and anything with any kind of emollients will break my skin out, no so with Neutrogena.  My face feels so clean after washing and my husband has learned to use it also.  I think he likes the fact that he doesn&#x27;t have to lather up a bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our go to facial cleanser for both of us even tho hubby has oily skin and mine is mostly dry.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to product for the last few years.  It is gentle on my skin and does what I need it to do without drying it our.</li>
    <li> I have a mixed complexion.  Neutrogena face cleaners have always worked well on me.  This product does a thorough job washing makeup and oil off.</li>
    <li> Weird quality. Wanted to return it back, but this seller didn&#x27;t provide returns. Supposed no odor, but there is a weird distinctive smell of something old...Very sticky on the face, almost unable to wash out. Probably - not Neutrogena inside.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I keep one in the shower to wash my face. The pump makes it really easy to use and it lasted over a year. There are no perfumes in it or oil essences that have a scent. Its gentle and does not leave an oily residue without being stringent. It seems to support the skin, leaving it cleaner and a touch softer.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and Neutrogena products are all I can. use. I love this cleanser! My face feels so clean and has a healthy feel and even looks healthier. My shipment tools minimal time and was packed well.</li>
    <li> When I first read the description for this product, I was a little skeptical since I&#x27;ve spent so much money on products like it before; but boy oh boy, I do not regret this purchase! I am a 17 year old female with combination skin. Some parts of my face (nose, around eyebrows &amp; chin) get dry, while others are oily. (forehead &amp; cheeks) This product is just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my face from getting dry, &amp; gets rid of excess oils so my skin is never oily!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from my local Safeway store, &amp; since I have TERRIBLE allergies (and being a very light skinned Irish woman) I bought the fragrance free. To be honest, it DOES have a \\&quot;scent\\&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t what you think.&lt;br /&gt;Personally it reminds me of the dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for nearly a week now along with Neutrogena&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Toner, &amp; I am receiving fantastic results already! My pores are getting smaller, my face is smoother &amp; more supple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: This product does NOT irritate acne! No \\&quot;red face\\&quot;, &amp; it clears skin as it cleans! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Washes off cleanly with no residue or lingering odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different facial cleansers by Neutrogena and other brands. This is, so far, my favorite. Some other reviewers mentioned a scented version. The one shipped to me had no scent at all, which I really don&#x27;t mind. It feels really good on your skin and does an excellent job of washing away dirt and oil. I made my boyfriend try this just for kicks, and he said, \\&quot;That&#x27;s crazy, it totally increases the friction on your face.\\&quot; I was like, \\&quot;Haha, yeah, because all of the slimy oil is gone!\\&quot; That pretty much describes the feeling really well though. Anyway, awesome stuff, lasts a while too as you don&#x27;t need to use very much to work up a good lather.</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner makes my face squeaky clean which is what I look for in a face wash.  I have oily skin and this does the job cleaning it.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the Neutrogena facial cleanser--and the pump despenser makes it so convenient.I will indeed purchase it again. Nice so nice!!!</li>
    <li> I have this at every sink in my home and use as hand soap. Used for at least 20 years and never have had a problems with dried out hands. I know it is more expensive but so worth it when your hands don&#x27;t have problems. As soon as I use other hand soaps I notice my hands becoming very dried and irritated. As soon as this soap is back at the sink, problems with skin are not an issue.</li>
    <li> Easy on the skin, feels clean!</li>
    <li> This has always been my go to for clean skin and has never failed me! I love it! Great price!</li>
    <li> I was a liittle disappointed I ordered 3 liquid Neytrogena and my received 2 &amp; 2 hand cream I didn&#x27;t order hand cream. AA&lt;br /&gt;M wondering HOW this happened.......</li>
    <li> Good.  Good.  Double good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 35 years and have no wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry your skin but leaves it feeling clean. I&#x27;ve used it for years- I&#x27;m 60 &amp; have no wrinkles! But that might just be good genes!</li>
    <li> Only thing I let touch my face... besides water... and my kids&#x27; kisses.... ok, maybe not the only thing but for soap, it is! It makes my slightly oily face feel super clean! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it...</li>
    <li> No film after using soap and cleanses well.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin in the T-zone and normal maybe a little dry in the rest of my face.Didn&#x27;t bother me the scent-free version.Actually didn&#x27;t smell bad it does have a little clean scent. To apply, a very I mean very little product is enough, but when you wash it off, the skin feels sooooooo dry and tight, like if you apply egg white on your face. And 5 minutes later my skin is worst than ever. Super oily. So it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser.  I have a very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Great buy on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> works great. leaves your face feeling smooth after use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too expensive but I keep coming back to it.  The pump is so convenient for one-handed dispensing, it washes off easily without effort or residue, no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Neutrogena user and this is a very nice, gentle face wash. It&#x27;s worked great for everyone in my family. A little goes a long way.  It is non-irritating, fragrance free, and a good value for the money. Before you spend money on more expensive products, I would suggest trying this first.</li>
    <li> Fragrance Free liquid soap is what I had in mind when ordering.  Everything as expected -- couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial wash for about 3 years now and it has made a world of difference on my skin! I used to get these tiny bumps on my forehead and acne on my cheeks, but since using this facial cleanser, my skin has been so clear that sometimes, I skip putting on foundation. I&#x27;ve tried everything, from Kiehl&#x27;s and Clinique to other drugstore brands, but nothing has worked on my face as well as this! It also does a great job removing eye makeup. And one bottle goes a loooong way! I only use half a pump each time I wash my face, and it&#x27;s enough to remove all the makeup and grime. I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle since June, but I&#x27;m only just about to finish it...8 months later! I have my next bottle ready so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go a day without it. Definitely a must-try!</li>
    <li> Simple, effective, and comfortable.</li>
    <li> With so many facial cleansers on the market lately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this locally. Amazon offered it at a good price so I purchased a year&#x27;s worth. This is an effective deep cleaning product with no strong odor.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite facial cleansers of all time. I have very sensitive skin and this has been one of very few cleansers that does not cause my face to break out. I have used it for years...used to use the bar version, but love the pump! It lathers and cleans well, does not smell offensive, leave a residue, or clog pores.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products. But to be honest, the product line is a tad pricey. When I saw this  facial cleansing formula on the Amazon website, priced  three dollars less than the super market, I jumped on it with out a second glance.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this product only four stars is because it is fragrance-free. I LOVE the fragrance of Neutrogena and really wanted that wonderful aroma to fill my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, it was still a really great price.</li>
    <li> It has a very bad smell. we cannot say it is fragrance free and it does not create foam as well. very unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin and leaves your face feeling squeaky clean. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, it may be important for you to wash your face to get off any dirt and sweat that may have accumulated over the day.  But washing your face with soap (or even just having the shower hit your face) can totally strip off all of the natural oil that protects your face, which is not good either.  This is by far the least-drying face soap I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few (regular soaps like Dove, Dan Kern&#x27;s facial cleanser, other Neutrogena face soaps, etc.).  I also like that it lasts for a long time (3+ months?).  After I wash with this, I use Jojoba oil (from Whole Foods) to moisturize and wipe off any excess oil with toilet paper, but if that isn&#x27;t available then I use Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free moisturizer, since that&#x27;s the best formulated moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others since they stopped carrying this in the local store.  But none even compare.  Best Facial Cleaner ever!  Why? because (1) it cleans thoroughly, (2) you need only a small amount, (3) It does not cause any rash or damage to facial tissue, and (4) it gets rid of acne, blackheads, and other gross blemishes on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why they stopped carrying this in the local store and replaced it with a plethora of complete crap is beyond me.  The Deep Cleaning product from Neutrogena happens to be the worst I ever tried.[[ASIN:B000052ZB5 Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser, 7 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Good deal and good product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> Loving this stuff.  Never bought it because I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it. Won&#x27;t use anything else again.</li>
    <li> I just switched from the bar soap to this liquid soap and love it! A small amount goes a long way and is very good for those who do not want scented product. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> When I was a child, my mother told me to never use soap on my face. Since I was 12 years old, I have used Neutrogena on my face. I am now 66 years old, and have no wrinkles. Granted this may be partially due to heredity, but I believe the drying effects of soap contribute to the look of the skin. After so many years of success, I will stick to this product that is good, and gentle, for my face.</li>
    <li> I preferred the fragrant-formula, but for some reason Neutrogena dropped that option long ago. This still cleans effectively and gently and is a good second choice.</li>
    <li> This works great for cleaning my CPAP machine.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the clean feel</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. First the pump is so easy to use,the soap rinses out perfectly and quickly. Skin feels super clean and refreshing. The best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. The hand soap is excellent also. I recommend this 100% thanks for this product.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena for years.  It is a basic liquid soap without all of the bells and whistles.  It does not have the perfumes or oils that a lot of the products have today.  I like Neutrogena because my skin does not break out and it feels clean after each use.</li>
