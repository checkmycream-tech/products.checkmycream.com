### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It is a great Stocking Donner , to put on compression socks.</li>
      <li>Be patient and give it a good chance.  </li>
      <li>I then adjust the stocking to fit and give a good pull on the heel to lower it a bit and another good pull on the toe to loosen over toes.  </li>
      <li>Experiment with it until you find your own method to make it work.  </li>
      <li>i liked it, but mom didn&#x27;t .</li>
      <li>What a relief to able to get my socks without help.</li>
      <li>I now place the stocking on the donner, lay it on the floor, anchor the side with a foot, slip my toes into the stocking, grab a handle to raise the donner, grab by both handles and pull the stocking on most of the way.  </li>
      <li>I am well pleased with the Super-Fast Mini Thermometer it gives.  </li>
      <li>works great for me when putting on my left sock.</li>
      <li>Easy if you remember to have it face you, as you were looking at a smile...</li>
      <li>I just install the sock on the unit, stand up and push my foot right into the sock.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy, saves time, and easy to get used to with minimal practice.</li>
      <li>The support stocking slips far too easily off the wires when trying to stick the foot into it.</li>
      <li>Makes putting on the stockings so much easier!  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>After hip surgery, this was very functional to put on compression stockings.  </li>
      <li>Never did try the full leg stockings, only over the calf compression stockings.</li>
      <li>It gives a quick accurate reading, is small and easy to store and very convenient to use as compared to some of the other thermometers that I have used.</li>
      <li>but if your calves are extra large be aware that it will either hurt or not work at all for you.</li>
      <li>I use this for normal socks</li>
      <li>Required too much effort and dexterity to be helpful to a patient having just undergone open heart</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately, I was allowed to transition from &amp;#34;impossible&amp;#34; TED hose to normal compression hose two days later.</li>
      <li>My calves are  large due to CVI and I would feel pain upon using the donner.</li>

    <li> My calves are  large due to CVI and I would feel pain upon using the donner. It worked as it should and did make putting on the compression stockings on easier but if your calves are extra large be aware that it will either hurt or not work at all for you.</li>
    <li> Makes putting on the stockings so much easier!  What a time-saver.  Thank you.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The only one of three that I bought that finally work&#x27;s. Have author in my left leg, and I have trouble getting my socks on. What a relief to able to get my socks without help. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am well pleased with the Super-Fast Mini Thermometer it gives.  It gives a quick accurate reading, is small and easy to store and very convenient to use as compared to some of the other thermometers that I have used.</li>
    <li> This Jobst donner seems thicker &amp; stronger than the one that I had and broke previously.I would sure hate to try to put on compression stocking without a donner.</li>
    <li> It is a great Stocking Donner , to put on compression socks. I recommend this for anyone with a problem.</li>
    <li> The support stocking slips far too easily off the wires when trying to stick the foot into it.There should be some type of clamp to hold the stocking in place til the toe reaches the tip of the support hose.Til they improve it, I will not be buying this product anymore.</li>
    <li> Required too much effort and dexterity to be helpful to a patient having just undergone open heart surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I was allowed to transition from &amp;#34;impossible&amp;#34; TED hose to normal compression hose two days later.</li>
    <li> This device takes all the stress out of putting on compression stockings.  My wife who has Lymphedema in one of her arms was not able to put on her compression stockings until she started to use the Jobst Stocking Donner.  No further comments are needed.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a cheapo piece of ****.It works great for me when putting on my left sock. I just install the sock on the unit, stand up and push my foot right into the sock.Quick and easy, saves time, and easy to get used to with minimal practice. I use this for normal socks so I can&#x27;t comment on TEMS.</li>
    <li> My dad loves it. Provides the extra help he needs</li>
    <li> The Jobst Stocking Donner is truly a godsend. Before I had it, someone else had to assist me with putting my stockings on. Now I can do it myself! The only problem I had to deal with was my calf being larger than the opening. I solved that by stretching the opening slightly. I would recommend this to anyone having trouble putting on their stockings.</li>
    <li> It took a little expermentation to get the hang of the donner, but once I did I find that it takes a lot of the effort out of putting on support hose.</li>
    <li> i liked it, but mom didn&#x27;t . she returned, stating using no aide was easier.</li>
    <li> Helpful putting on the compression stockings but still they are a TASK!</li>
    <li> An item that takes a little time &amp; practice.  Easy if you remember to have it face you, as you were looking at a smile... this is the easiest way to put on the stockings.</li>
    <li> Instructions not very good, but it makes it 10 times easier to put on compression stockings.</li>
    <li> After hip surgery, this was very functional to put on compression stockings.  Never did try the full leg stockings, only over the calf compression stockings.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use with thigh high hose.</li>
    <li> I have had a Stocking Donner since 1-3-15 and I really like it.  Due to a bad fall, I don&#x27;t have a lot of flexibility when it comes to donning my compression stockings.  I now place the stocking on the donner, lay it on the floor, anchor the side with a foot, slip my toes into the stocking, grab a handle to raise the donner, grab by both handles and pull the stocking on most of the way.  I then adjust the stocking to fit and give a good pull on the heel to lower it a bit and another good pull on the toe to loosen over toes.  It works.  Experiment with it until you find your own method to make it work.  I use it every morning and will not be without it.  Be patient and give it a good chance.  It works.</li>
    <li> A bit clunky to store</li>
