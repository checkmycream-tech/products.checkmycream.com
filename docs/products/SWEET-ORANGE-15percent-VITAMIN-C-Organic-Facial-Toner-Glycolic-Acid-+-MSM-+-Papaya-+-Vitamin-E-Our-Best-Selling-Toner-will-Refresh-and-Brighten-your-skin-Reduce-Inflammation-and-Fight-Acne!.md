      <li>Very pleased with this product and the fact that it is organic, natural and contains no GMOs and is cruelty free and never tested on animals!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Combat free radical damage</li>
      <li>Yes, the products smell and feel great going on, but they don&#x27;t actually work.</li>
      <li>This product along with the cleanser and moisturizer is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer applies smoothly and also hydrates your skin well, without any stickiness.</li>
      <li>They all feel so light like I am not using anything.</li>
      <li>This toner does have a very strong scent to it, I wish it didn&#x27;t because I find it very overpowering</li>
      <li>I received this facial toner and it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I forgot that the packaging says sweet orange on it because immediately after I applied it onto my face</li>
      <li>Love this whole line of products.</li>
      <li>I ordered the full line - for morning</li>
      <li>The toner is lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>and I loved how it absorbed into my face quickly meaning that my facial routine didn&#x27;t have to wait.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying I have dry, very fair, very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It has a great slight citrus smell.</li>
      <li>I was excited to use with all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>cell turnover, leaving you with fresh skin&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toner for about a month, twice a day every day.</li>
      <li>product really makes my skin glow and look dewy and fresh!</li>
      <li>As an Esthetician, when my clients come in to me for facials, most of them say they want brighter, younger looking skin, and with the Azure Naturals Sweet Orange Vitamin C Toner, you will be on the right track.</li>
      <li>My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell you enough how much I love spraying this toner on face, neck &amp; decollete every morning.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased that although I have combination skin, the toner worked well on my skin and left it looking refreshed and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I love facial toners.</li>
      <li>I really love that this facial toner comes in spray bottle.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this entire skin care line.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sold on the scent.  </li>
      <li>The Azure Naturals Sweet Orange Vitamin C Toner has been great for my skin, I have noticed dramatic brightening effects since using this toner.</li>
      <li>All opinions are my own and are no way influenced by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the full line of Ultimate Vitamin C to try out including the facial cleanser, toner, serum , and moisturizer.</li>

      <li>My redness has gone down, my skin is clear, the oily and dry patches are evening out, just awesome stuff.  </li>
      <li>I pair this with Orange Blossom Water Toner and have used this both for the past two weeks, so I do want to preface that, since I can&#x27;t determine if the combination, or one or the other is the reason my skin is doing so awesome.</li>
      <li>but it just turns out what i thought was severly damaged skin was just dehydrated and craving intense moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is it REALLY doing it&#x27;s job?  </li>
      <li>Plus, it has all the usual great benefits that Vitamin C offers like, boosting the production of collagen, improves cellular turnover, refines skin&#x27;s texture, plumps and firms your skin and helps diminish fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old and have some very minimal fine lines and these products certainly did nothing to help them.</li>
      <li>I cleanse my skin as I normally would, then spritz this toner on my face and let it sink in.</li>

<li> However , after a few days , the sprayer stopped working</li>
<li> I was left feeling duped and poor.</li>
<li> I can also spray it on a cotton round to apply too.</li>
<li> And not the usual musk</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder or try another product when I&#x27;m out.</li>
<li> You are supposed to spray this on your face and neck and the spray is either broken or is missing a part to bring up the liquid.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s been slowly improving my skin.</li>
<li> I naively dove headfirst into this product line and was sorely disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love facial toners. I really love that this facial toner comes in spray bottle. It&#x27;s very refreshing to spritz it on my face after cleansing my face. I can also spray it on a cotton round to apply too. I spritz it on after cleansing my face and then apply my facial serums. The vitamin C helps to even out my skin tone and improves the overall appearance of my skin. It also smells really nice! This facial toner is such a treat!</li>
    <li> Thank you Azure Naturals for sending me this awesome toner to review for my blog, GlamRiver!  This Sweet Orange Infused Vitamin C Organic Facial Toner is just another great product from Azure Naturals!  This toner is the perfect follow up product to the Sweet Orange Infused Vitamin C Organic Facial Cleanser.

    <li> I received this facial toner and it smells amazing! I forgot that the packaging says sweet orange on it because immediately after I applied it onto my face I thought I smelled roses. Maybe it&#x27;s my nose that can&#x27;t tell a difference, but nonetheless, I love how it smelled and I loved how it absorbed into my face quickly meaning that my facial routine didn&#x27;t have to wait. I am pleased that although I have combination skin, the toner worked well on my skin and left it looking refreshed and hydrated. I use the toner under my makeup routine and also spritz some after I am done applying my makeup as a setting spray. Works beautifully, smells heavenly and if I need to apply more I can do so without the worry of my makeup running all over the place. Very pleased with this product and the fact that it is organic, natural and contains no GMOs and is cruelty free and never tested on animals!</li>

This toner does have a very strong scent to it, I wish it didn&#x27;t because I find it very overpowering and I can smell it instead of my perfume. Other than that this toner is wonderful and everyone should try it. I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.</li>
    <li> Love this whole line of products.</li>
    <li> This product works okay. I haven&#x27;t seen any real significant improvement to my skins since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sold on the scent.  It smelled a bit ... musky?  And not the usual musk I like.. more.. stale?  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it.  Another thing I wasn&#x27;t sure about was that you just spray it on.  Is it REALLY doing it&#x27;s job?  But then I used it for two weeks.  My skin has never looked better.  My redness has gone down, my skin is clear, the oily and dry patches are evening out, just awesome stuff.  I pair this with Orange Blossom Water Toner and have used this both for the past two weeks, so I do want to preface that, since I can&#x27;t determine if the combination, or one or the other is the reason my skin is doing so awesome.</li>
    <li> This product along with the cleanser and moisturizer is fantastic. My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free. It does smell like bug spray to me at times. I spray it all over my face and neck about five times. I also recommend ordering the cucumber eye product from the same company and putting it on your cheeks, eyes, and nose for dry climates. The moisturizer was not enough until I started doing this. They all feel so light like I am not using anything.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use with all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, received unsealed and looks like some was used! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> The one star is for the fact I can&#x27;t use the product.  You are supposed to spray this on your face and neck and the spray is either broken or is missing a part to bring up the liquid.</li>
    <li> Great product, all ingredients are well rated on EWG. Great find.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t dislike this toner in any way, I don&#x27;t think I can say it&#x27;s done anything miraculous for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple months now. It has a great slight citrus smell. Not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder or try another product when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> It is great and so refreshing.</li>
    <li> *Note: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own and are no way influenced by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the full line of Ultimate Vitamin C to try out including the facial cleanser, toner, serum , and moisturizer. Everything has a pleasant sweet citrus scent. The cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather up a lot but it cleans fairly well. The toner is lightweight and absorbs quickly. The serum is a non-sticky, non oily/greasy formula that hydrates your skin well. The moisturizer applies smoothly and also hydrates your skin well, without any stickiness. I&#x27;ve been trying it out and it&#x27;s been slowly improving my skin.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle, plus I sent one to my daughter-in-law.  I love how refreshed my face feels after cleansing and two to three sprays of this very pleasant orange infused toner.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this entire skin care line. Let me start by saying I have dry, very fair, very sensitive skin. I&#x27;m now in my late 30&#x27;s and had quite a bit of redness in my cheeks, a little sun damage and starting to notice fine lines new my eyes and forehead. This products is amazing. It smells wonderful and dose not burn or dry my skin out. I saw a noticeable difference in my skin within days of using Azure Naturals. My skin tone has evened out and feels like silk and I have never had any discomfort or redness. I have recommend it to everyone who has asked and I have gotten all &amp;#34;Thank yous!&amp;#34; back from everyone who has tried it. Also they have amazing costumer service!</li>
    <li> Great toner.  I bought this to try vitamin C products...this is just great.  Wish it were in a bigger bottle.  But it does work well and has only a slight if any hint of orange fragrance.</li>
    <li> I ordered the full line - for morning I use the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C serum and Vitamin C moisturizer, plus the cucumber eye. in the evening I use the Vitamin C toner, Retinol serum and Retinol moisturizer plus the cucumber eye. I also purchased the Vitamin C cleanser but I haven&#x27;t been using it yet as I finish up another cleanser. there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products. I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone. I use a Clarisonic daily. there&#x27;s been no issue with irritation or dryness. My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully. My forehead lines appear to be smoothing out and my eye crinkles do as well. for the affordable price I am REALLY IMPRESSED. I will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> As many reviewers stated, this stuff smells great and I loved putting it on. I naively dove headfirst into this product line and was sorely disappointed. Yes, the products smell and feel great going on, but they don&#x27;t actually work. I stuck with it for a few months, but there was no noticeable decrease in my creases. I&#x27;m 33 years old and have some very minimal fine lines and these products certainly did nothing to help them. In fact, I started breaking out quite regularly and finally gave up on all the products. I was left feeling duped and poor.</li>
    <li> So good for your skin</li>
    <li> Forget going extreme and trying lasers and peels to resurface your skin. I had terrible looking orange peel, crepey looking skin on my cheeks. After a bit of research, I put together a new skin regimen including this product. I cleanse with cerave hydrating cleanser then tone with this product by spraying on a cotton pad to remove excess makeup oil and dirt. Then i moisturize with dml lotion and finish with an spf moisturizer in the morning. I repeat at night minus the spf moisturizer. I have been applying dml throughout the day to really get hydration back into my skin. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this product resulted in absolutely no irritation what so ever! Very rare for me! I am not kidding that in 4 days the results are significant! I thought i would have had to spend hundreds if not thousands resurfacing my skin but it just turns out what i thought was severly damaged skin was just dehydrated and craving intense moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really makes my skin glow and look dewy and fresh! Makeup no longer cakes on my face and It doesnt dry me out and not a single pimple has surfaced, and an old breakout is quickly dissappearing. i can already see lightening of old acne spots, discoloration and uneven skin tone resolving itself. Something i thought i wouldnt have after suffering for years with acne and scars as well as using abrasive chemically saturated products that left my skin looking, dull, rough and lifeless. My mom noticed a difference in my skin on the second day of using this product within my routine and is now using it herself to revamp her mature skin! I believe consistency is going to be key for max results, but this product has definately earned a spot on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can finally start to say, i woke up like this! Flawless!</li>
