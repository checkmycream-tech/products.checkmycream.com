    <li> This cream contains 6% lidocaine! Put it on a half hour or longer before bikini area waxing, facial waxing, botox etc....I dreaded personal maintenance, then I found this product.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I had a laser hair removal treatment done on a rather sensitive part of my body and it was EXCRUCIATING-- I felt like my body was being cut open with a blazing hot knife. I was surprised since my pain tolerance is relatively high. I was so worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go in for the next five treatments. I ordered this cream, hoping for the best. I followed the instructions (provided in the package) and guess what? It worked like a charm! I felt almost NOTHING!! I will absolutely be ordering more of this for future hair removal treatments :)</li>
    <li> THe absolute BEST decision I ever made. I don&#x27;t care about the taboo around numbing creams, this helped me sit still while I had lettering done on my ribs. My tattoo looks FANTASTIC and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more! It worked so well I had to ask my artist if he had started yet. It was amazing!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the job likre Dr. Numb.</li>
    <li> Followed directions and it just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I just thought I was going to get a bigger tube, the advertising is definitely misleading. I get this little (carmex) size tube in the mail. One use and it&#x27;s all gone. For the price I paid for, it was not worth it. Hopefully it really works.</li>
    <li> When this product is used as directed, it works AWESOME!!!!!! I have had a tattoo done across my spine &amp; one on each hip and did not feel a thing!! I would most defiantly buy this again and I am going to! Worth the money for sure!!!!!</li>
    <li> Tiny tiny. No bigger then a small lip balm like they said.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great for electrolysis.</li>
    <li> This is the very best for tattoos my tattoo artist says it is better than what they have in the shop</li>
    <li> Good product not as effective as the doctors but efficient for the application</li>
    <li> The 1 jar did a whole portrait on my son&#x27;s rib cage nd he still have more left. He said it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Good product. Great for later treatments</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well honestly. Wears off after 5 minutes of application.</li>
    <li> does not say what ingredient is used to numb</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product and had to take the time to write a review which is something I never really do. But I&#x27;m very pleased. Just make sure to rub the first coat in very well! This made an hour and a half of tattooing a breeze! Thank you!</li>
    <li> very small canister bout the size of a half dollar and not very much in it but what was there worked well</li>
