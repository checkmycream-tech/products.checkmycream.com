      <li>Great fragrance....very satisfactory transaction.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s muskier scent is perfect for day and evening as it doesn&#x27;t  overwhelm like too sweet fragrances</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent ever!</li>
      <li>My wife loved it,she  gets so many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and in original wrappings and smells great</li>
      <li>I wish the staying power was better, but I still love the scent.</li>
      <li>and it made me love her more</li>
      <li>and I love the staying power.  </li>
      <li>the bottle is so cute.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Oh, how I love this perfume</li>
      <li>this is my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>This fragrance has been my favorite for over 15 years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more soon.</li>
      <li>I truly love this.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what my girl friend wanted so she could feel good</li>
      <li>Omnia is a beautiful fragrance: woodsy without being too masculine or musky, with hints of oriental spices.</li>
      <li>Why in the world did BVLGARI discontinue this classic, super great parfum?  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite!  </li>
      <li>This is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever used and the price is unbelievable!</li>
      <li>BVLGARI has introduced way too many &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; flavor of the month type perfumes... pick a color, they probably have a new scent for it.  </li>
      <li>this scent is always positively commented on! -</li>
      <li>I always prefer ordering from Amazon.com because more than likely they will have what I need.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased this fragrance on a transatlantic flight, based purely on the ingredients list in the ad.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to any other perfume, but I enjoy the fact that this smells so unique.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>(look at chanel No.5 - old, old, old - yet you still see ads for it!)&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and subtle and I&#x27;m always getting lots of compliments!</li>
      <li>Same with this bottle of perfume old smelling could not use it.</li>
      <li>things never cease to amaze me - mainly, how manufacturers&#x27; think that constantly discontinuing &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; scents, lipstick colors, etc., will force their loyal customers into buying something &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; from them - what it does for me, the same as many other women, is tick me off so badly that I buy NOTHING from them - and try a totally new manufacturer!</li>

<li> this particular &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; seemed to be watered down or something - somehow it just wasn&#x27;t as fragrant as the ones I&#x27;ve bought previously from amazon</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so different to any other fragrance I&#x27;ve smelt and</li>
<li> It is a very classy, subtle fragrance</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a slightly heavier fragrance that is both woody with an almost oriental floral.  </li>
<li> I still think that this perfume is not original, it has a slight smell of alcohol and did not have the atomizer.</li>
<li> If you are someone who likes a slightly heavy perfume that is a mix of a sandlewoody woodsy smell along with florals, then this is for you.  </li>
<li> Money wasted.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find sometimes</li>
<li> (although in a limited amount, unfortunately!)  </li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t get tired of it at all.  </li>
<li> I know I will not go wrong when ordering this for my daughter.</li>

    <li> My absolute favorite!  I won&#x27;t wear anything else.  The scent is nice and subtle and I&#x27;m always getting lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance....very satisfactory transaction.  I always prefer ordering from Amazon.com because more than likely they will have what I need.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Same with this bottle of perfume old smelling could not use it. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> My only cologne after Chanel No. 5 in the Fall &amp; Winter season. The best Bvlgari scent for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. It&#x27;s hard to find sometimes but I love it. I&#x27;ll be getting more soon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance I am just so sad that it is discontinued...now the only way to get it is trough amazon</li>
    <li> Excellent esmell, the presentation is beatiful, i think recommend it. I was not damaged in the shipping. Good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever used and the price is unbelievable! This Fragrance will also make for an Awesome gift!</li>
    <li> OMG does she smell good!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite perfume but I can&#x27;t find it locally any longer -however, this particular &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; seemed to be watered down or something - somehow it just wasn&#x27;t as fragrant as the ones I&#x27;ve bought previously from amazon</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been my favorite for over 15 years.  It&#x27;s muskier scent is perfect for day and evening as it doesn&#x27;t  overwhelm like too sweet fragrances can.  It arrived on time and in original wrappings and smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Proper</li>
    <li> I know I will not go wrong when ordering this for my daughter. She has faithfully used this fragrance for years.</li>
    <li> Bvlgari never disappoints. Omnia is a beautiful fragrance: woodsy without being too masculine or musky, with hints of oriental spices. I wish the staying power was better, but I still love the scent.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this fragrance on a transatlantic flight, based purely on the ingredients list in the ad. My wife loved it,she  gets so many compliments on it. It is a very classy, subtle fragrance</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent ever! It came in time for Christmas with plenty of time for gift wrapping, too.</li>
    <li> This perfume is so beautiful.  It&#x27;s a slightly heavier fragrance that is both woody with an almost oriental floral.  It&#x27;s so different to any other fragrance I&#x27;ve smelt and the bottle is so cute.  This is definately a Winter perfume and I love the staying power.  I can still smell it later in the day even if I applied it at 8.30am.  I get a lot of comments on it and I don&#x27;t get tired of it at all.  If you are someone who likes a slightly heavy perfume that is a mix of a sandlewoody woodsy smell along with florals, then this is for you.  I can&#x27;t compare it to any other perfume, but I enjoy the fact that this smells so unique.  I truly love this.</li>
    <li> Es un perfume que dura en la piel. Lo colocó en las mañanas y puedo pasar todo el día sin que se altere su Fragacia. Es mi favorito. Me encanta</li>
    <li> Oh, how I love this perfume</li>
    <li> It was exactly what my girl friend wanted so she could feel good and it made me love her more</li>
    <li> Why in the world did BVLGARI discontinue this classic, super great parfum?  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, but Amazon had it!  (although in a limited amount, unfortunately!)  BVLGARI has introduced way too many &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; flavor of the month type perfumes... pick a color, they probably have a new scent for it.  Companies that have such a winner on their hands - and this scent is always positively commented on! - should keep it in their line - classics don&#x27;t go out of style, but you DO have to advertise every now and then!  (look at chanel No.5 - old, old, old - yet you still see ads for it!)&lt;br /&gt;Some things never cease to amaze me - mainly, how manufacturers&#x27; think that constantly discontinuing &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; scents, lipstick colors, etc., will force their loyal customers into buying something &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; from them - what it does for me, the same as many other women, is tick me off so badly that I buy NOTHING from them - and try a totally new manufacturer!</li>
    <li> I still think that this perfume is not original, it has a slight smell of alcohol and did not have the atomizer. My mom has problems using it because it is poured into the container poe</li>
