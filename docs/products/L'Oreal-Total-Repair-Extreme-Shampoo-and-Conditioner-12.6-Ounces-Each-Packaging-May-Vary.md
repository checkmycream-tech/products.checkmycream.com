      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

      <li>I have waited to write this review to make sure it continues to work on my hair and with each use my hair feels more repaired.</li>
      <li>it works better then</li>
      <li>I am glad I used this and will continue to use this product.</li>
      <li>More products, more hair spray, more everything...</li>
      <li>I also continued my normal routine of using a flat-iron, and my hair looks the best it has in a long time.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair nice soft and shiny .</li>
      <li>at this point I don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s in these because my hairs never been more repaired or felt better and for 3 dollars a big bottle</li>

      <li>I cannot believe I am saying this, but I like it better than Nexxus, which had become my new favorite ever since I could finally afford higher-end shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It still smells nice when dry, but it is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to have crunchy ends before switching over to Nexxus, and I did not think it was possible to get any better, but L&#x27;Oreal has proved me wrong.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First off let me tell you I&#x27;ve worked at a salon for a couple years now</li>
      <li>Thanks Loreal!</li>
      <li>This is one of my first reviews on here if not my first</li>
      <li>Total Repair 5 wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me, so I decided to use the Extreme, and my hair now feels healthy and strong without breakage every wash and while heat styling :)</li>
      <li>I recently got a really good coupon deal and bought about 5 different types of this new L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Haircare line, and I will write reviews on each of the shampoos/conditioners.</li>
      <li>I was taught a long time ago that the more a shampoo suds, the cheaper it is.</li>
      <li>After 2 months of use, I am still using this, and my hair is soft, shiny, and full of volume, styling with ease.</li>
      <li>but after many attempts of tying to repair my dry, damaged, over processed hair using redken pureology, enjoy and pretty much any expensive line using the damage and repairing shampoo and conditioner from each line I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that comes close to working as good as this.</li>
      <li>I recently got a really good coupon deal and bought about 5 different types of this new L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Haircare line, and I will write reviews on each of the shampoos/conditioners.working, and that it was the answer to my hair problems this entire time.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really repairing you hair</li>
      <li>I get very damaged hair from curling or straightening my wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I know L&#x27;Oreal is recommended by my stylist and have used their other products but wanted something more intense.</li>
      <li>I was using acted differently &amp; styling my hair was more difficult...and always going flat by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>After a couple of washings my hair was more coarse and dry than ever.</li>
      <li>when it was wet, I could feel how it instantly made my hair more manageable.</li>
      <li>With the very first use I blew my hair dry, used a spritz of hair wax and my hair fell into place.</li>
      <li>Also salons and stylists are against drugstore brands because they are cheap and that would usually mean they are made quickly and cheaply with harsh chemicals but</li>
      <li>A litte goes a long way with the conditioner too which I LOVE because I always run out of one before the other.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Normally, when I dry my hair, I have to put in some kind of argon oil or drying treatment spray while my hair is damp to tame my frizzies.</li>
      <li>my hair comes out UNBELIEVABLY soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I stopped coloring my hair about 4 years ago thinking I should &amp;#34;embrace&amp;#34; my &#x27;natural&#x27; highlights.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the conditioner, so it lasts a long while.  </li>
      <li>I decided to put the shampoo/conditioner to the true test and not use ANY product while I dried my hair, and I have almost ZERO frizz just after using this shampoo/conditioner combo ONCE.</li>
      <li>I have 59 year old fine, but CV very thick, hair that is about 20% gray.</li>
      <li>It really made a difference when other things weren&#x27;t giving me any hope.</li>
      <li>This L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair Extreme shampoo is somewhere in-between the total non-suds of a sulfate free shampoo and a typical drug store brand.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product since quite awhile. It makes my hair nice soft and shiny .</li>
    <li> I have 59 year old fine, but CV very thick, hair that is about 20% gray. I stopped coloring my hair about 4 years ago thinking I should &amp;#34;embrace&amp;#34; my &#x27;natural&#x27; highlights. Once I had grown out all the colored hair (I keep it about 3-4&amp;#34; long), I began noticing the shampoo &amp; conditioner I was using acted differently &amp; styling my hair was more difficult...and always going flat by the end of the day. So I began trying different shampoos, styles, cuts, etc., to try and find something to simplify doing my hair in the mornings. More products, more hair spray, more everything...I was close to shaving my head to solve my problem. On a whim, I bought this shampoo &amp; conditioner...and I am so happy I did. With the very first use I blew my hair dry, used a spritz of hair wax and my hair fell into place. I also noticed my hair looked and felt healthier, and has looked better with every use. After 2 months of use, I am still using this, and my hair is soft, shiny, and full of volume, styling with ease.</li>
    <li> I love the product its amazing. but I was very upset when I found it in shoprite in North Jersey for $3.99 and bottle!!!!!! I thought I was getting the best deal here.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something for my dry and damaged hair. I know L&#x27;Oreal is recommended by my stylist and have used their other products but wanted something more intense. I am glad I used this and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of my first reviews on here if not my first but I decided after 2 weeks of using this I would finally break down and stop being lazy and write a review. Wow I hate writing reviews but had to for these two products because they are simply amazing. First off let me tell you I&#x27;ve worked at a salon for a couple years now not your typical salon by a high end one. im not a stylist but a receptionist so I have knowledge of hair products and how they work on the hair because I sell to people and give them knowledge on what products best for them. With that being said, i must say I never like to use drugstore brands because I feel like i should be using what&#x27;s sold at the salon but after many attempts of tying to repair my dry, damaged, over processed hair using redken pureology, enjoy and pretty much any expensive line using the damage and repairing shampoo and conditioner from each line I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that comes close to working as good as this. After one use I found my hair was instantly stronger. Shinier. Smoother, less flyaways, not dry feeling and not greasy, deranged and smells great! Just perfect. It felt as if each strand had been coated with keratin which is strange because it doesn&#x27;t contain keratin properties. Anyways it changed my hair and I feel like it looks longer and feels stronger and shiny and just over all repaired. The conditioner is simply amazing it works better then 40 dollar deep conditioners I&#x27;ve used. Keep in mind I have waited to write this review to make sure it continues to work on my hair and with each use my hair feels more repaired. I&#x27;m shocked because working at a salon I know that&#x27;s sulfate a aren&#x27;t suppose to be good on your hair and for some reason sulfate free shampoos never work on me but this one works amazing. Also salons and stylists are against drugstore brands because they are cheap and that would usually mean they are made quickly and cheaply with harsh chemicals but at this point I don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s in these because my hairs never been more repaired or felt better and for 3 dollars a big bottle you can&#x27;t go wrong! I would definitely give it a try it would work on any hair type mine is very fine damaged brunette hair. Give it a try you can&#x27;t go wrong you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Ps. When I told a stylist after being complimented on my hair looking better she was schooled and said she couldn&#x27;t believe I was using loreal after working at a salon knowing drugstore brands are bad and she said I don&#x27;t know how but it&#x27;s really repairing you hair I can tell and she said she was shocked/</li>
    <li> I get very damaged hair from curling or straightening my wavy hair. Total Repair 5 wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me, so I decided to use the Extreme, and my hair now feels healthy and strong without breakage every wash and while heat styling :)</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I am always looking for the perfect hair product that does what it is claims.  This is by far the best I have ever found.  I bought the deep conditioner as well and I like that a lot.</li>
    <li> My daughter had long thick hair and she loved this. It cleanses and adds body and shine. She likes it better than Pantene or Aussie!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner do not repair the hair as promised. I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a few months now, and find it is one of the few &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; treatments that seem to work. You don&#x27;t need much of the conditioner, so it lasts a long while.  I&#x27;m hoping to see continued improvement as I use it longer.</li>
    <li> It did not improve my hair at all. very disappointed - should have returned it.....</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner if you have damaged hair. It really made a difference when other things weren&#x27;t giving me any hope. Thanks Loreal! I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they discontinue this line.</li>
    <li> It ended up leaving my hair way too dry. I was hoping for some moisturizing along with the repair. It was not the case. After a couple of washings my hair was more coarse and dry than ever.</li>
    <li> I was taught a long time ago that the more a shampoo suds, the cheaper it is. This L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair Extreme shampoo is somewhere in-between the total non-suds of a sulfate free shampoo and a typical drug store brand. I actually think it was the perfect balance, because it suds enough to make me feel like it&#x27;s getting clean, and I did not need a whole lot to clean my hair. I could tell, even when it was wet, how well it was working. I cannot believe I am saying this, but I like it better than Nexxus, which had become my new favorite ever since I could finally afford higher-end shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is hard to describe. It has a very salon-shampoo type scent, if you know what I mean. Nothing fruity. It still smells nice when dry, but it is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is all the way down to my waist, so I normally use TONS of conditioner. I actually always buy two bottles of conditioner for every one bottle of shampoo. Normally, with brands like Pantene, I have to put tons and tons of conditioner in order for me to feel like my hair is getting hydrated, but  I was shocked at how the L&#x27;Oreal Repair Extreme Conditioner got the job done with only one or two palms full of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when it was wet, I could feel how it instantly made my hair more manageable.

I also continued my normal routine of using a flat-iron, and my hair looks the best it has in a long time. I feel like I just stepped out of a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly  cannot believe how well this is working, and that it was the answer to my hair problems this entire time. If this is out of your price range, I suggest paying attention to the sales of your local drug stores. I recently got a really good coupon deal and bought about 5 different types of this new L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Haircare line, and I will write reviews on each of the shampoos/conditioners.working, and that it was the answer to my hair problems this entire time.

    <li> Im skeptical about switching shampoo and conditioners but I have a feeling I will be sticking with these for a while. A litte goes a long way with the conditioner too which I LOVE because I always run out of one before the other. My hair feels amazing and if I give my hair a simple conditioner treatment(condition my hair and leave it in for about 5 minutes) my hair comes out UNBELIEVABLY soft and shiny. Love Love Love!</li>
    <li> great product and wonderful results</li>
