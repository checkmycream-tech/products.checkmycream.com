      <li>I think it would look nice.</li>
      <li>Nice hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and it is all they said it would be fast and easy hair do, I will order again</li>
      <li>Its light and realistic and the cut is perfect.</li>
      <li>pros: very pretty!!</li>
      <li>I love this wig.</li>
      <li>It could use more body.  </li>
      <li>Then my hair would stick up out of it and it would take 20 mins just to get in on comfortable!</li>
      <li>Love This Wig/Hair ..</li>
      <li>Will need to order more to style for my many looks.</li>
      <li>It was okay for a day or two</li>
      <li>It needed more hair</li>
      <li>Bcause this WIG is Super SEXY and so HOTT!</li>
      <li>It still looks cute but would had looked way more real</li>
      <li>Tossed it right in the trash after 3 uses!</li>
      <li>My only issue is the clips are kind of bulky and it starts to get kinky at the ends very quickly.</li>
      <li>The first day I wore it I got so many compliments on how pretty it looks.</li>
      <li>I found it easy to put on except that the cap is a bit large for my head.</li>
      <li>Good little trick and it works.</li>
      <li>First off being an avid wig wearer, I decided to try this.</li>
      <li>Overall I love it.</li>
      <li>It feels good, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
      <li>I was super excited to open up the package.</li>
      <li>Easy to use once you split the middle and not try to pull hair through.  </li>
      <li>Shipment was so fast, within 2 days of my order even though I was told it would take 4 to 6 days (or something of that sort)</li>
      <li>Very wig looking.</li>
      <li>if my leave out was not so much lighter than the rest of the hair.</li>
      <li>too straight for my liking though.  </li>
      <li>Appears to have the same cheap quality as those manufactured in China....</li>
      <li>so yes the straightening aspect, but that really is my decision and doesn&#x27;t impact my rating.</li>
      <li>it was to Than and straight</li>
      <li>Other than that I love it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend  this wig especially if you are not very familiar with wearing wigs (like I &amp;#34;was&amp;#34;) Good quality and thick, also safe to use straightener,curling iron etc on it .</li>
      <li>I bought this wig in high doubt.</li>
      <li>Would buy again highly recommend.</li>
      <li>After about an hour and a few internet searches; a snip at the top was all it needed.</li>
      <li>I cut the little one inch piece to allow for more freedom to make my part and the back of the unit is very full.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my head is pretty big</li>
      <li>and it looks like my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Not heavy.</li>
      <li>I have natural hair</li>
      <li>OH WOW....</li>
      <li>(1- Jet Black) has helped me tremendously get through the growing out periods .</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still too big and makes slight bumps because it doesn&#x27;t fit my head properly.</li>
      <li>The texture of the hair, as other people have said, requires your hair to be bone straight for even a possible match...</li>

<li> I have natural hair</li>
<li> OH WOW....</li>
<li> (1- Jet Black) has helped me tremendously get through the growing out periods .</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s still too big and makes slight bumps because it doesn&#x27;t fit my head properly.</li>
<li> The texture of the hair, as other people have said, requires your hair to be bone straight for even a possible match...</li>
<li> I first tried to put the wig on and pull some of my hair through the opening and it wasn&#x27;t hard at all</li>
<li> can put a flat iron to it, lasts awhile</li>
<li> It looks and feels natural, does not shed a lot but does get tangled a bit but nothing a little oil and flat iron can&#x27;t fix.</li>
<li> Very poor quality,tangles easily with frizz</li>
<li> fix the wig after it gets dry add olive oil and heat set it with a flat iron and voila its shiny and manageable again.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick and very natural looking.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been wearing for a week but little to now shedding and plenty of compliments.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons: SHEDS like crazy!, huge cap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge cap!</li>
<li> Like a lot of women who wear wigs I have short hair so Trying to pull my hair through the small hole was a pain in the butt.</li>
<li> or so i thought so you will need some bobby pins to hold it down</li>
<li> Poor quality, super thin.  </li>
<li> My hair is brown, and this wig iz black.</li>
<li> I got the number 1-jet black.</li>
<li> , I paid less than 20 dollars.</li>
<li> So my only disappointment is that the color is definitely NOT  a number 2.</li>
<li> Basically it was a waste of my money</li>
<li> so be prepared for that and mine lasted for 2 months with daily wear before I got tired of the shedding.&lt;br</li>
<li> First of all I got this product in 3 days, I was shocked.</li>
<li> Wig was too small and looked nothing like the picture.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t usually do reviews</li>
<li> Hair falls out, texture is poor .i</li>
<li> ,is of a poor quality</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
<li> The part was also weird.  </li>
<li> Was very disappointed.</li>
<li> This wig was horrible.</li>

    <li> I researched this unit on Youtube before I decided to purchase it.  I usually alternate between clip in extensions and 3/4 wigs because I like the freedom of changing styles.The color is a perfect match for me I got the number 1-jet black. I cut the little one inch piece to allow for more freedom to make my part and the back of the unit is very full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are the cap comes with a drawstring but it&#x27;s still too big and makes slight bumps because it doesn&#x27;t fit my head properly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and it is all they said it would be fast and easy hair do, I will order again</li>
    <li> Nice hair. Not heavy. Looks great. Color is even. No fizzing.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I received this wig today 8/1/13 ...I was super excited to open up the package. Shipment was so fast, within 2 days of my order even though I was told it would take 4 to 6 days (or something of that sort) I LOVED the wig, I cut the piece that holds the bang tigether and voila! I had a v shaped opening for my hair to go through.  I found it easy to put on except that the cap is a bit large for my head. No problem I could work with that, I paid less than 20 dollars. So my only disappointment is that the color is definitely NOT  a number 2. My hair is brown, and this wig iz black. It still looks cute but would had looked way more real if my leave out was not so much lighter than the rest of the hair. I know what I got was not a number 2 even though the box said so. Might return and re order a lighter color because the wig is itself is nice.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Easy to use once you split the middle and not try to pull hair through.  I&#x27;ve only been wearing for a week but little to now shedding and plenty of compliments.</li>
    <li> Love This Wig/Hair .. I cut my hair in a very short pixie and the Freetress Equal Invisible Part Wig - All Star (1- Jet Black) has helped me tremendously get through the growing out periods . I highly recommend  this wig especially if you are not very familiar with wearing wigs (like I &amp;#34;was&amp;#34;) Good quality and thick, also safe to use straightener,curling iron etc on it .</li>
    <li> This wigi is AWESOME!! It feels good, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Will need to order more to style for my many looks.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality,tangles easily with frizz ends.i don&#x27;t like it at all,would not encourage anyone to buy that,is of a poor quality</li>
    <li> Bcause this WIG is Super SEXY and so HOTT! I am really Excited on how GOOD it makes me LOOK!</li>
    <li> Wig was too small and looked nothing like the picture. Was very disappointed. Would not buy again nor would I recommend.</li>
    <li> This wig was horrible. The color I choose didn&#x27;t match my hair at all. It was okay for a day or two and then I couldn&#x27;t stop itching my scalp. I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Hair falls out, texture is poor .i won&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its o.k. too straight for my liking though.  It could use more body.  I wear it under a hat on my low key days.  The good thing is that it does not shed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the part. I thought that it was a lace front wig</li>
    <li> I bought this wig in high doubt. I had never worn an invisible part wig but this blew my mind. First of all I got this product in 3 days, I was shocked. I first tried to put the wig on and pull some of my hair through the opening and it wasn&#x27;t hard at all but it didn&#x27;t give me the look I wanted so I cut the one inch portion to the fron of the wig and opened it up and it looks like my natural hair. Good little trick and it works. I would def recommend this wig. It looks and feels natural, does not shed a lot but does get tangled a bit but nothing a little oil and flat iron can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the quality of the hair but if the hair was human hair or mixed I think it would look nice. It needed more hair it was to Than and straight</li>
    <li> Yes it looks like my hair and almost the length of my hair</li>
    <li> OH WOW.... This brand wig shed&#x27;s like a dog..... Appears to have the same cheap quality as those manufactured in China....</li>
    <li> First off being an avid wig wearer, I decided to try this. The clips would not stay in my hair, I tried everything but they wouldn&#x27;t stay. The wig itself would get tangled. Constantly. Basically it was a waste of my money</li>
    <li> Like a lot of women who wear wigs I have short hair so Trying to pull my hair through the small hole was a pain in the butt. Then my hair would stick up out of it and it would take 20 mins just to get in on comfortable! Such a pain! Tossed it right in the trash after 3 uses!</li>
    <li> pros: very pretty!! can put a flat iron to it, lasts awhile&lt;br /&gt;Cons: SHEDS like crazy!, huge cap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge cap! my head is pretty big or so i thought so you will need some bobby pins to hold it down&lt;br /&gt;This thing is going to shed ALOT so be prepared for that and mine lasted for 2 months with daily wear before I got tired of the shedding.&lt;br /&gt;To fix the wig after it gets dry add olive oil and heat set it with a flat iron and voila its shiny and manageable again.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, super thin.  Very wig looking. I would not purchase this item again.  The part was also weird.  The texture of the hair, as other people have said, requires your hair to be bone straight for even a possible match...</li>
    <li> It is a very nice piece.  It&#x27;s thick and very natural looking.  The first day I wore it I got so many compliments on how pretty it looks. I have natural hair so yes the straightening aspect, but that really is my decision and doesn&#x27;t impact my rating. The only reason I rated 4 is the opening. You have to cut it. I tried to put on as is.After about an hour and a few internet searches; a snip at the top was all it needed. Overall I love it. This product has most defiantly converted this anti extension girl! Can&#x27;t wait to try more!</li>
    <li> I love this wig. Its light and realistic and the cut is perfect. My only issue is the clips are kind of bulky and it starts to get kinky at the ends very quickly. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t usually do reviews but this is really a awesome wig. I was very pleased with this purchase. Would buy again highly recommend.</li>
