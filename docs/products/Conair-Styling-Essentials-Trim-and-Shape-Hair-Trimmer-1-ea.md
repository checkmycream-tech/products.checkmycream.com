      <li>I loved the original version of this, but this one feels a lot lighter and is cheaply made compared to the original one.  </li>

      <li>Not so easy to find in drugstores.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to use and trims the hair according to length of each blade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy and works well.  </li>
      <li>I like this hair trimmer because it is so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>If you know how to use it, I guess it would work fine.  </li>
      <li>My husband has fine hair...</li>
      <li>Using a little caution to cut smoothly it gives an excellent, smooth razor cut appearance.</li>
      <li>bought this a few years ago thinking it would be great for touch-ups while I was away from home, but since you can&#x27;t change the blades (it would&#x27;ve been nice if the packaging warned you about that)</li>
      <li>but actually, these are the safest and easiest to use and considering the price, they&#x27;re great.  </li>
      <li>I use this to smooth the fur on my Pomeranian after her scissor cut.</li>
      <li>I really like it because you don&#x27;t have to be a pro haircutter to end up with haircuts that look really nice.</li>
      <li>They are now $6.99 and free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy using these trimmers.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It is also important to read the instructions.</li>
      <li>It all became too much of an ordeal, and I&#x27;m glad I found a better alternative.</li>
      <li>so I found a &amp;#34;Hair Wiz&amp;#34; in 1990 to replace the original.</li>
      <li>The price is right, and they are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>My husband no longer has a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>Can be used anytime he needs a touch up or a full haircut.  </li>
      <li>product arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>If your looking for a quick fix, this product will do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it to shave my legs for a quick job</li>
      <li>A used razor blade cuts hair way better than this thing did when it was new.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and the price was right.</li>
      <li>and it did a fair job, it just makes your skin very dry using it without water or shave cream.</li>
      <li>This little tool is great for a trim.</li>
      <li>It is far better than any salon cut I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to use it on dry hair - not so much of a chance of making huge gaps that way!  </li>
      <li>I quickly went back and purchased more.  </li>
      <li>These are much more substantial than the little hand clippers, and do a better, quicker job.</li>
      <li>The best hair product for any age, especially for the grandparents when the grand-kids  visit and want a real hair-cut, I have used this product for 20 years and their isn&#x27;t any other product out there is comparable.</li>
      <li>you have fine, soft hair - like</li>
      <li>I first purchased one at Walmarts years ago.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what my wife said she needed.</li>
      <li>Be aware that there are no refill blades for this cutter.</li>
      <li>I am going to order several more.  </li>
      <li>this hair trimmer I first got at Walgreens</li>
      <li>Is allows me to go several more months before I get a haircut.  </li>
      <li>Three stars on first use.</li>
      <li>I tried for years to find a barber / hair stylist who would cut my hair exactly as I wanted it.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>The first one got lost during a move</li>
      <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been surprised at how cheap Conair&#x27;s powered clippers have become.</li>
      <li>Each one lasts for at least a year, which is great.</li>
      <li>I always cut my hair in the shower when lathered up with shampoo because I believe it cuts better and probably makes the blade last longer.</li>
      <li>It is easy to hold and never dulls!</li>
      <li>This one is sharp and cuts easily and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these trimmers!</li>
      <li>My dog hates being brushed and I&#x27;ve tried multiple groomers without a great result, so when I stumbled across this product at my local Duane Reade, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still I highly recommend this item!  </li>
      <li>Otherwise he took off too much hair.  </li>
      <li>For a time this was available in my local store in the hair accessories section.  </li>
      <li>However, while my hair is kinda fine, it&#x27;s very ornery, strong, and mean and eats razorblades for breakfast.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this trimmer!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cut like I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;Can not change the blades.</li>
    <li> excellent cutter..a bit flimsy structurally.</li>
    <li> The best hair product for any age, especially for the grandparents when the grand-kids  visit and want a real hair-cut, I have used this product for 20 years and their isn&#x27;t any other product out there is comparable.</li>
    <li> helpful grooming device</li>
    <li> I use this to smooth the fur on my Pomeranian after her scissor cut.</li>
    <li> good product, I feel it was somewhat overpriced</li>
    <li> Works Great ..&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic for shaping your own hair, unfortunately Amazon isn&#x27;t carrying it anymore but there is another similar one that has a handle&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this one and wish they would get it back. It has various marked sides for Long and Short so that you have an idea what youre doing&lt;br /&gt;I wish we could get replacement blades</li>
    <li> Will save you money on haircuts!</li>
    <li> I have even shaved my legs with it.  It has been a main stay for me, ordered extra for the future, the last one lasted 15 years!</li>
    <li> Just what i wanted to cut my hair. Simple, inexpensive and delivered promptly. This was a great find. Conair works.</li>
    <li> It is a pretty good trimmer, It does the job perfectly. I can not give it more than 3 stars because once the blade goes dull&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer has to be discarded, there is no way to replace the blades with a new blade so, you have to purchase&lt;br /&gt;another trimmer, and , when you want to do that you can not find it anywhere in order to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two so that when the first one goes dull (it will take a while) I can replace it with the other one I purchased, this will allow me time to try to locate another two in the marketplace and so on and on.</li>
    <li> Very nice for cutting hubbies hair</li>
    <li> Product did not perform to expectations. Blade not as sharp as would be anticipated. Prefer the older version to this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use on my puppy and found I could also use them on my self. Still learning how they work, but very happy with all the results I have had so far. Great product, great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The hair trimmer works just like I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> I was going crazy trying to find one of these as the first one I&#x27;d purchase at Walmart and they no longer carry them. I cut my own hair and this is perfect for trimming the neck area.</li>
    <li> I used these trimmers for years. In recent times, I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;ve disappeared off retailers shelves. I found they are sold here on Amazon, but that seems too much of an extent to go to, in order to get a cheap little trimmer. I believe Conair has discontinued this product, and whatever supply that Amazon has access to, will soon dry up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been surprised at how cheap Conair&#x27;s powered clippers have become. You can pick up a rechargeable clipper for as little as $15, at the usual retail outlets. These are much more substantial than the little hand clippers, and do a better, quicker job. And you don&#x27;t have to worry about razor blades, or whether you can find a replacement trimmer. It all became too much of an ordeal, and I&#x27;m glad I found a better alternative.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using these trimmers.  They are easy to use and trims the hair according to length of each blade. I use these frequently, for family haircuts. The blades last awhile before getting dull. I would estimate a years use. Delivery was quick and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I tried for years to find a barber / hair stylist who would cut my hair exactly as I wanted it. About 10 years ago I gave up and bought one of these in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair and leave lots of shampoo in it. I use a hand-held mirror and trim myself. Using a little caution to cut smoothly it gives an excellent, smooth razor cut appearance. I finish my shower and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cut hair in my shirt collar poking me in the neck. It only take about 5 minutes. The barber is always in. And, think of all of the money I&#x27;ve saved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these, which arrived quickly, to ensure that I will always have a sharp styling trimmer on hand. I highly recommend these trimmers!</li>
    <li> For a time this was available in my local store in the hair accessories section.  Then one day it vanished, however, I found it here on Amazon!  I like this hair trimmer because it is so easy to use.  I like the way that it shapes the hair on my neck.  It remains safely sharp for a long time as well. Based upon my experience I say that Conair Styling Essentials Hair Trimmer is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> It works but doesn&#x27;t seem to be blade replaceable, as it looks to&lt;br /&gt;be sealed. This would mean that one would need to mess around&lt;br /&gt;with it to try and replace it&#x27;s blades (Not worth risking injury to&lt;br /&gt;one&#x27;s self.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, because I can&#x27;t change the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not have bought it if I had known I couldn&#x27;t replace the blades.</li>
    <li> Great profuct fast delivery</li>
    <li> TO all my friends it really works good . cut my husbands hair and it saves  the price of a haircut</li>
    <li> Works well, but you cannot change the blade when it gets worn.</li>
    <li> I use this item to trim my hair.  It&#x27;s easy and works well.  I can go longer between haircuts using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool to keep your hair neat between hair cuts.</li>
    <li> can not change blades</li>
    <li> If your looking for a quick fix, this product will do. Be aware that there are no refill blades for this cutter.</li>
    <li> I have used the Conair Styling Essentials Hair Trimmers for years. I have given myself a complete hair cut with this little tool. It does a terrific job, but it works much better on wet hair than dry hair. It is also important to read the instructions. My last purchase was for 10 of these, as I will continue to use them for as long as they are made. Each one lasts for at least a year, which is great.</li>
    <li> Great product and on-time delivery!</li>
    <li> Found this item at Kroger&#x27;s for $4.99 - regular price. Bought it to use on a longish haired cat that keeps getting knots, because he doesn&#x27;t like being brushed beyond his neck. Haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> can not easily replace blade, probably impossible</li>
    <li> Another bad review--Did not cut hair.</li>
    <li> this hair trimmer I first got at Walgreens and when I needed a new one Walgreens didn&#x27;t have one. So am glad to find them</li>
    <li> This is my opinion of the product idea which I believe is a good one. It is not my intention to slight this brand as I have not used it. I have used a trim comb since 1971. The first one got lost during a move so I found a &amp;#34;Hair Wiz&amp;#34; in 1990 to replace the original. I have saved considerable money through the years with one of these devices. I always cut my hair in the shower when lathered up with shampoo because I believe it cuts better and probably makes the blade last longer.</li>
    <li> I use this for cutting my kids&#x27; hair. It is good for trimming hair and adding waves/layers. I really like it because you don&#x27;t have to be a pro haircutter to end up with haircuts that look really nice.</li>
    <li> I read another review, about the pet owner who&#x27;s cat liked getting it&#x27;s hair trimmed with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine, soft hair - like a kitty does - I could see this working quite well. However, while my hair is kinda fine, it&#x27;s very ornery, strong, and mean and eats razorblades for breakfast. E.g: I&#x27;ve had a mowhawk off and on for years and finally had to abandon shaving the sides of my head as I would completely dull three or four twin-blade razorblades every time I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this a few years ago thinking it would be great for touch-ups while I was away from home, but since you can&#x27;t change the blades (it would&#x27;ve been nice if the packaging warned you about that) this contraption stood no chance and it Hurt (yes, capital &#x27;H&#x27; hurt) each and every time I used it because it was too dull for me. The blades are molded into the plastic and can&#x27;t be changed. I finally threw it out and just use my clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it, I recommend getting getting manual clippers if you want something quiet/non-electric for trimming pets/camping/being extra green, because you can send them off to get sharpened when they get dull unlike this hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would NOT recommend this product because you can&#x27;t change the blades when they get dull.</li>
    <li> My husband no longer has a full head of hair.  Going to barber was not something he liked to do.  I have been using this brand of hair trimmer for at least two decades.  Not so easy to find in drugstores.  I am so glad I can get them on Amazon.  They are easy to use and last thru several haircuts.  Can be used anytime he needs a touch up or a full haircut.  Also, they are quite a bit lower priced than a trip to barber!</li>
    <li> My dog hates being brushed and I&#x27;ve tried multiple groomers without a great result, so when I stumbled across this product at my local Duane Reade, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Turns out its the perfect solution to cutting my dog&#x27;s hair - he doesn&#x27;t hate it and I can actually give him an even cut. I get a lot of compliments on his haircut and I recommend this product all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I really love it, if I had to nitpick, my only complaint is that the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp for more than 3-4 uses... I&#x27;m still eager to buy it though, its really the best way I&#x27;ve found to give my dog an anxiety-free haircut!&lt;br /&gt;Note: since I first purchased it at Duane Reade, it seems to have been discontinued, so now Amazon and E-Bay are the only places I can find it!</li>
    <li> I am not very satisfied with this trimmer.  I wanted to use it on my Morkie puppy and his hair is too fine for this to be very effective.</li>
    <li> My husband has fine hair... using this little tool does the trick! wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> If you know how to use it, I guess it would work fine.  Otherwise he took off too much hair.  I think that I will have to go to barber school so that I can cut it for him.</li>
    <li> I loved the original version of this, but this one feels a lot lighter and is cheaply made compared to the original one.  It still does trim just the edges off the hair by running it through your hair.  My husband uses it, I don&#x27;t dare put it in my hair.  I&#x27;ve used it to shave my legs for a quick job and it did a fair job, it just makes your skin very dry using it without water or shave cream. My legs still felt nubby after using it, but you couldn&#x27;t see the hair, you can just feel the nubs....&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my wife said she needed. Works like a charm. Been looking for something like this for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using one of these for two decades, first to repair the damage by barbers and hair stylists who apparently had hearing problems. After developing some skill with it, I began cutting my own hair and haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut in twenty years, saving over $2,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent.</li>
    <li> Good tool for trimming hair especially for those unable to get to the barber. Disappointed there is no way to change the blades if they dull with use, but price is low enough to re-order.</li>
    <li> darn thing came with a crack in one blade, too much hassle to send back, oh and the good side did not cut my dogs hair worth a darn.</li>
    <li> ***3rd UPDATE*** it is now May 2016 and I ordered 2 more of these.  They are now $6.99 and free shipping.  What a deal!  So if you don&#x27;t like the price and shipping - just wait, it will change as you can see from all my updates.  These new ones I received are VERY sharp - I guess I kept using the others until they got a big dull - and I didn&#x27;t realize it.  Still I highly recommend this item!  Saves me a BUNCH of money as I cut my own hair instead of going to a shop.  I use this for the sides and back and then use scissors for the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***2nd UPDATE*** I see there is a new seller instead of Drugstore.com.  The price has now dropped near the price it was when I posted the original review - a total of $9.50 for the item inc.shipping.  I am going to order 3-4 more of these.  Also...if you order more than one, this seller is now combining shipping fees. For my next 4, the shipping is $7.75.  With previous seller the shipping for 4 was $20!! Ridiculous... I am thrilled we have a seller now that is fair and reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***1st UPDATE***  I have gotten so many compliments on my hair after using this.  I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on my hair; I am dumbfounded.  However, when I went to order another today - 4-5 weeks later, the price has increased from $8.50 with shipping included to over $12.  Whew!  Won&#x27;t be ordering another for a while.  I&#x27;ll look elsewhere as this little item isn&#x27;t worth $12+ when I get my hair cut at a shop for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***ORIGINAL REVIEW***  I have an older one of these - so old I can&#x27;t remember when or where I got it.  This one is sharp and cuts easily and quickly.  I really love it.  I used it last night and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how well it tapered the back and sides of my hair.  Is allows me to go several more months before I get a haircut.  I am going to order several more.  Hint: It cuts much easier if the hair is wet - it can pull if the hair is dry and the blade is dull. This device has four sides which cut the hair to different lengths, depending on which side you use and what angle you hold it to your head (or someone else&#x27;s head) when drawing the hand down.  This unit is sharp (make sure you use it when your hair is wet) and it stays sharp a long time.  If you use it when the hair is not wet enough, it will pull the hair and hurt.nding on which side you use and what angle you hold it to your head (or someone else&#x27;s head) when drawing the hand down.

    <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use and gives great haircuts to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will probably order another one.</li>
    <li> It does a terrific job. I have not gone to a barber-shop since I purched them. However, it does take practice.</li>
    <li> I first purchased one at Walmarts years ago.  I quickly went back and purchased more.  Now when I need a new one they are nowhere to be found.  This is an awesome product.  I use it to cut the back of my short hair.  I cut my hair wet,  trim the bottom with scissor to length, then come this through to thin.  It is far better than any salon cut I have ever had.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve had on my haircut... and I do it myself!  No hassles trying to make salon appointments, and no expensive haircuts that you&#x27;re disappointed in when you get home.  I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon, and just sent off for more.  This product has has four length cutters you can use.  The only drawback, as stated in other reviews is that you can&#x27;t change the blade.  If you clean and dry them after use, they will last a very long time.  The price is right, and they are easy to use.  I hope Conair never stops producing this product.  It&#x27;s too bad it isn&#x27;t in more stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and now can&#x27;t find it in the stores (but I live in a small town where the shopping is terrible).  I have short hair which grows an inch a week I think, and to have it cut  twice a month in a salon would cost a fortune.  You have to be careful with these but actually, these are the safest and easiest to use and considering the price, they&#x27;re great.  I use it to get the bottom part of my hair in the back, close to the head - you can do it without looking, once you get the hang of it.  I think they tell you to do it on wet hair like the professionals but with wet hair, it takes off too much (gobs) and you can see the mistakes.  It&#x27;s better to use it on dry hair - not so much of a chance of making huge gaps that way!  I couldn&#x27;t live without this trimmer!</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for my 92 year old Dad who likes how it works.  The blade can not be changed which is why I purchased two of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer every couple of weeks or so to maintain that groomed appearance.  It works great for me.  I use the medium cut for the sides and back with ease.</li>
    <li> Does the job, nothing to write home about.  What do you want, it cuts hair. Came on time.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair trimmer for a number of years.  My last one bit the dust and I could not find what I needed locally.  Thanks so much for carrying this necessary product.</li>
    <li> Three stars on first use. A few uses later, it gets one star. The blades are cheap, soft steel and do not stay sharp very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy one that uses regular double edge blades. I did, and my blade expense went to zero by using used blades from my double edge razor when they are too dull for face shaving. A used razor blade cuts hair way better than this thing did when it was new.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the Jilbere Precision Cut Comb. I had the two years ago and I have tried several others in trying to find them again. The others were terrible--catching and pulling my hair without cutting it, rough edges that scratched my skin. This one does just what it is supposed to and allows closer trimming than the other I use it with.</li>
    <li> This little tool is great for a trim. It is easy to hold and never dulls!</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  What a gem!  So glad I found it.  Had previous one for years and couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband as he is on the road alot!  Comes in handy for a quick trim .....Great Product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Do not use it much but helps my cow lick?</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I could not find it in any of the stores around my hometown. Thanks to Amazon I can order these online. It is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> product arrived quickly.  Very pleased</li>
