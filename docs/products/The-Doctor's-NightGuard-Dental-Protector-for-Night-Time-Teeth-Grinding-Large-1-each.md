### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is probably the best protection against night time teeth grinding.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one still remains the best.</li>
      <li>I realized, I didn&#x27;t need to pre-cut the piece, as it was so pliable when it had been boiled, it would have been best to wait till that stage to adjust the sizing to my mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best I could manage was a &amp;quot;dent&amp;quot; in the plastic.  </li>
      <li>The price was excellent and if they work like the one I use, it is a great product</li>
      <li>And Medium works great in the mouth.  </li>
      <li>Still a great guard.  </li>
      <li>This is a great alternative.  </li>
      <li>great  confidence in this product and the price bully.easy to use .</li>
      <li>The BEST part about this night guard is that it&#x27;s CHEAP!</li>
      <li>Always good protection.  </li>
      <li>Good product for the price.  </li>
      <li>The forming went well, the instructions were good.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;d purchased others and this one is far easier to mold just perfect to your teeth and</li>
      <li>great deal saves my  teeth and smile</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit or feel as good as this one.</li>
      <li>The Doctor&#x27;s NighGuard Dental Portector is easy to fit to your teeth and gums and provides great protection from night time teeth grinding.  </li>
      <li>Easy!</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and was able to get a good fit.</li>
      <li>I reread the instructions and it said it was for the top teeth (d&#x27;oh!)&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>better choice, in my opinion, is the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard, which sells for around $25 all over the internet.  </li>
      <li>so maybe I don&#x27;t know better.</li>
      <li>It always stays in place, all night--no more headaches.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I really think this guard is great for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m online now looking for a better product from a competitor.</li>
      <li>What you are supposed to do is boil the protector in water and then press the scalding hot appliance into your teeth a good 3-4 millimeters.  </li>
      <li>The new device I bought at Walgreens is really great.</li>
      <li>I really cannot give a fair review of this product as I have yet to use it.</li>
      <li>or I would bite right through while it&#x27;s warm.  </li>
      <li>Easy to mold,</li>
      <li>easy to use, and easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t use the guard from my dentist - too easy to swallow.  </li>
      <li>I liked this particular brand of night guard better than the one I bought before.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>Nightguard was easy to fit if you follow instructions, and it held in place 100% of the time.  </li>
      <li>I like the Large size as it is more comfortable and provides more grinding room.  </li>
      <li>The Guard was cheap.</li>
      <li>It feels vary comfortable and secure.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t find it comfortable.</li>
      <li>husband prefers the somewhat bulky appearance of the night guard to the \\&quot;horrendous\\&quot; sound that</li>
      <li>I purchased a similar guard from Target that works great.</li>
      <li>The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard was easy to mold to my teeth on the very first try.</li>
      <li>It is a really unique design</li>
      <li>need to buy another, and this time, I&#x27;ll get it right!</li>
      <li>Even if you do get your teeth into it there is so much spillover on the sides that you&#x27;ll not be able to close your mouth</li>
      <li>super hard.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The instructions were quite clear and it was easy to fit</li>
      <li>The one I received should be the Large, was labeled as Large but look more like a Medium.  </li>
      <li>really helps shape the mold to fit your teeth and the shape of your mouth.</li>
      <li>Right night guard</li>
      <li>I had experienced pretty good luck when I bought the Advanced Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard model previously, but I thought I would try to safe a few bucks and buy the basic model.</li>
      <li>Make sure you get the right size, you don&#x27;t want it too big.</li>
      <li>This guard is easy enough to mold and trim yet has too much mass to be comfortable for all night use.</li>
      <li>I may have been doing something wrong, but I followed the directions as best I could.</li>
      <li>I also followed the directions and trimmed the mold before boiling in hot water</li>
      <li>I thought I was doing a stellar job of creating my mouth piece too.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>The product comes in several sizes for a true custom fit.  </li>
      <li>So buying a nightguard from your local dentist probably would be better, but if your insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it, you&#x27;re looking at almost $300--even</li>

      <li>The fitting instructions are ok, and I had a good fit at first, but after dipping the piece into cold water, the material contracted slightly making it exert noticeable pressure on my teeth when wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Read the sizing info and get the correct one, though medium and large both work for me at 5&#x27;6\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to drift off--it&#x27;s like a pacifier.  </li>
      <li>The bottom line is that the more expensive model is worth the extra expense, as getting the fitting process to work is a huge part of the whole deal.</li>

      <li>Even if you can take the heat the appliance does not get soft enough to really get your teeth in that far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why the complaints about this product, it&#x27;s easily trimable</li>
      <li>It took me bit of practice to get it right, but the company will mail you a new one if you mess yours up.  </li>

      <li>My final product now holds my lips open as I sleep, very uncomforable and unattractive.</li>
      <li>I have a problem with anxiety, which is why I needed this mouth guard, because I cannot clear my head at night and constantly grind and gnash my teeth together</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the second one I bought, once I molded it, seemed to mess up my bite, cause I didn&#x27;t mold it just right.  </li>
      <li>This might all sound really strange and complicated, but, in all, the whole process takes me about 15 minutes</li>
      <li>No real complaints other than I grind my teeth in the first place - and thus need something like this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Doctor&#x27;s NighGuard Dental Portector is easy to fit to your teeth and gums and provides great protection from night time teeth grinding.  The product comes in several sizes for a true custom fit.  These different sizes are not available with other companies products that have a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; size for everyone.</li>
    <li> This guard is easy enough to mold and trim yet has too much mass to be comfortable for all night use. I always wake up in the morning with my guard on the floor because I take it out in the middle of the night due to the discomfort. It also gave me headaches and ear pain from being so bulky. I did trim significantly however due to the nature of my small mouth it is simply to bulky.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with anxiety, which is why I needed this mouth guard, because I cannot clear my head at night and constantly grind and gnash my teeth together super hard.&lt;br /&gt;My hastiness got the best of me and I read the instructions really quick. I thought I was doing a stellar job of creating my mouth piece too. I premeasured, I used a serrated knife to cut off the excess waxy stuff that was too big for my mouth, I boiled the piece and then set it on my bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Then I reread the instructions and it said it was for the top teeth (d&#x27;oh!)&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized, I didn&#x27;t need to pre-cut the piece, as it was so pliable when it had been boiled, it would have been best to wait till that stage to adjust the sizing to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I really think this guard is great for the price. I&#x27;d purchased others and this one is far easier to mold just perfect to your teeth and less bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I need to buy another, and this time, I&#x27;ll get it right!</li>
    <li> I liked this particular brand of night guard better than the one I bought before. However, I only gave it 4 stars because you really have to pay attention to the sizing. And that is where the minus one star comes in. I don&#x27;t know HOW anyone could gauge their size really. It says if you are \\&quot;this\\&quot; tall and weigh \\&quot;this\\&quot; amount then \\&quot;this\\&quot; size is for you. It didn&#x27;t work for me. I should have listened to my dental hygienist sister as she once told me I had a small pallet. Ah well. I&#x27;ll try again. The BEST part about this night guard is that it&#x27;s CHEAP! And it&#x27;s even easier to mold than the last one I bought on Amazon. Just follow the instructions to a T and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best protection against night time teeth grinding.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one still remains the best.</li>
    <li> I really cannot give a fair review of this product as I have yet to use it. I purchased a similar guard from Target that works great. These were purchased for future use when the other guard wears out. The price was excellent and if they work like the one I use, it is a great product</li>
    <li> The Guard was cheap. That said it is so large that I am unable to fall asleep with it in.</li>
    <li> I clench my teeth and this helps to relieve the pressure when I sleep.  Good product for the price.  I use the small one and it fits better.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and was able to get a good fit. The problem is that within days, the plastic began to split and crack. It isn&#x27;t worn through, it&#x27;s just cracking at the tooth crowns.</li>
    <li> So buying a nightguard from your local dentist probably would be better, but if your insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it, you&#x27;re looking at almost $300--even if you do have insurance--it will still be around $100.  This is a great alternative.  Easy to mold, easy to use, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the second one I bought, once I molded it, seemed to mess up my bite, cause I didn&#x27;t mold it just right.  I&#x27;d say if you have insurance, go the pro route.</li>
    <li> Make sure you get the right size, you don&#x27;t want it too big. The problem I had with mine was it was too narrow. When I was molding it, I could have pulled it apart, but I didn&#x27;t because i thought it would just do it by itself. The forming went well, the instructions were good. It falls out at night sometime, but I think that is because I didn&#x27;t spread it apart. Another very important thing, make sure to suck in, it getts rid of all that extra space from the saliva, and if you don&#x27;t, it is very frustrating at night.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the guard from my dentist - too easy to swallow.  The Drs. Nightguard was easy to fit if you follow instructions, and it held in place 100% of the time.  I just stored it in water with a few drops of hydrogen peroxide when not in use.  If I had had this product 10 years ago, I could have saved myself so much dental work and bills.  I&#x27;m sold and am ordering one for my fiancee as well.  Totally an A+ product that functioned exactly as advertised.  Dip in hot water, then in cold water, then mold to your upper teeth.  Easy!</li>
    <li> My first night guard was the really expensive one from the dentist.  It mysteriously disappeared one morning and I used a thicker, old-school whitening tray, until I could think of something else, because the one from the dentist just wouldn&#x27;t stay in, so I didn&#x27;t want to replace it.  I later discovered the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard [[ASIN:B00006BSXM The Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard Dental Protector for Night Time Teeth Grinding, Medium, 1 each]] and perfected how to make it fit me the best.  They&#x27;ve since redesigned and I don&#x27;t like the new design as much[[ASIN:B000NLM1GW Doctors Nightguard Mouth Piece, Small - 1 Ea]] (ends up a bit bulkier feeling and less customizable), but I definitely prefer it to Splintek&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Splintek Sleep Right night guard and it is completely flimsy.  I could barely keep it in while conscious, so I know it won&#x27;t  stay in long, once I&#x27;m asleep. The thin part in the front has no rigidity of its own(as it appears to in the photo) and just flops around.  There is nothing to prevent this from slipping to the outsides of my teeth, out of place, or just out of my mouth.  It&#x27;s possible this might be good for someone who needs to prevent clenching when awake, but, like I said, it doesn&#x27;t just stay in place--it takes some actual effort to keep it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better choice, in my opinion, is the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard, which sells for around $25 all over the internet.  I&#x27;ve bought it at Walgreen&#x27;s for $24.99.  It comes in 3 different sizes.  It took me bit of practice to get it right, but the company will mail you a new one if you mess yours up.  I&#x27;ve seen some bad reviews for it--someone was appalled at the idea of sticking a boiling hot piece of rubber/plastic in their mouth and said they couldn&#x27;t make much of an impression, but I follow the boiling instructions exactly and, surprisingly enough, that one second in cold water(after boiling, per the instructions) makes it more tolerable to me than Latte or a cup of tea(which I can&#x27;t handlehot).&lt;br /&gt;Some tricks to help in making it...I pull off the blue thing(on the older one) and throw it out, before I start.  I just have to be extra careful to not bite using my teeth or I would bite right through while it&#x27;s warm.  I use my fingers to help form and also create suction using my mouth to form the sides.  Then, if there&#x27;s a lot of extra, I trim a bit and reboil for another 30 or 40 seconds, cool for one second by dunking in cold water and put it back in and create suction using my mouth and tongue to really form it to my teeth.  This might all sound really strange and complicated, but, in all, the whole process takes me about 15 minutes and I do it about every 6-8 months, when I chew through one.&lt;br /&gt;My husband prefers the somewhat bulky appearance of the night guard to the \\&quot;horrendous\\&quot; sound that my grinding makes(I have to believe him because I&#x27;ve never heard myself).  Plus, I put it on after the lights are out and I&#x27;m ready to drift off--it&#x27;s like a pacifier.  It always stays in place, all night--no more headaches.  I would highly recommend the Doctor&#x27;s Nightguard!</li>
    <li> great  confidence in this product and the price bully.easy to use . durable. fast shippimg.  great deal saves my  teeth and smile</li>
    <li> This product is not ready for prime-time.  What you are supposed to do is boil the protector in water and then press the scalding hot appliance into your teeth a good 3-4 millimeters.  Even if you can take the heat the appliance does not get soft enough to really get your teeth in that far.  The best I could manage was a &amp;quot;dent&amp;quot; in the plastic.  Even if you do get your teeth into it there is so much spillover on the sides that you&#x27;ll not be able to close your mouth and you&#x27;ll wake up in a puddle of drool.  So you will spend hours cutting and shaving the appliance to try to get something usable and in the end you&#x27;ll wind up just returning it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I do not have joint problems - just teeth grinding so getting the $400 custom fit seemed a bit absurd - the other reviewers apparently did not read the directions or the manufacturer has modified the directions to account for their concerns - dipping the mold in cold water for one second eliminates the \\&quot;scalding\\&quot; problem and using your fingers to mold the product and \\&quot;sucking\\&quot; in as directed really helps shape the mold to fit your teeth and the shape of your mouth. I also followed the directions and trimmed the mold before boiling in hot water so it did not go beyond where my teeth are (wisdom teeth gone).  It took no time at all for me to get use to the mold - No real complaints other than I grind my teeth in the first place - and thus need something like this.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these before, starting to wonder if different size or thickness. However, been having trouble sleeping with this one so far. Like anything it takes time, but thinking one that has less thinkness would be preferable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the complaints about this product, it&#x27;s easily trimable and if you do it correctly, forms a very good fit. For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it. Read the sizing info and get the correct one, though medium and large both work for me at 5&#x27;6\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them as an alternative to expensive doctor&#x27;s items for several years now with no complaints. Then again, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever used so maybe I don&#x27;t know better. ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for five years and noticed this time the plastic wasn&#x27;t as pliable as in the past. I thought it too hard and will not purchase again. The instructions were quite clear and it was easy to fit but I didn&#x27;t find it comfortable.</li>
    <li> The dental mold is too thick, so that as you scuplt it between your teeth during forming the overflow runs way up around your teeth. My final product now holds my lips open as I sleep, very uncomforable and unattractive. I&#x27;m online now looking for a better product from a competitor.</li>
    <li> The Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard was easy to mold to my teeth on the very first try. It feels vary comfortable and secure. Several years ago I had a mouth guard that was custom made by a dentist and cost over $500 and it didn&#x27;t fit or feel as good as this one.</li>
    <li> The material sticks to the blue plastic mold after heating and molding and would not detach. I ha to cut it off from the molded&lt;br /&gt;guard and thereby damaging it (torn)</li>
    <li> I had experienced pretty good luck when I bought the Advanced Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard model previously, but I thought I would try to safe a few bucks and buy the basic model. What a mistake! It did not survive the fitting process; I notice holes had formed, and I was not able to get it to mold again. I may have been doing something wrong, but I followed the directions as best I could. The bottom line is that the more expensive model is worth the extra expense, as getting the fitting process to work is a huge part of the whole deal.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife, but she is not using it as it seems a bit too large and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Junk. If you suffer from bruxism pass this by. My teeth tore it to shreds within the week. The new device I bought at Walgreens is really great. It is a really unique design and I was skeptical about spending over $20 on it. But I have spent far more than that on the traditional design. Maybe that&#x27;s the plan</li>
    <li> Always good protection.  But the sizes seem to vary, from small thin to heavy thick (large).  I like the Large size as it is more comfortable and provides more grinding room.  Last longer too.  The one I received should be the Large, was labeled as Large but look more like a Medium.  Smaller than my past Large ones.  Still a great guard.  And Medium works great in the mouth.  Just want a larger one ...</li>
    <li> This mouth guard is quite bulky, and is too uncomfortable to sleep with.  The fitting instructions are ok, and I had a good fit at first, but after dipping the piece into cold water, the material contracted slightly making it exert noticeable pressure on my teeth when wearing it.  I reboiled it and this time let it cool slowly after fitting, and it feels better, but I have a hard time keeping it from falling out...  I think im going to purchase something with a different design (even if they are more expensive).</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a past user of the blue base night guard, you may be looking for a replacement, like I was, since they are now hard to find, and have mostly been replaced by the white base item, which is a very different product, which comes in a red theme box.  Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll get the red-theme box if you order this.  I guess the blue base item is out of existence, which is too bad, this product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I followed directions and have tried unsuccesfully to sleep wearing the Doctor&#x27;s NightGuard.  It is too thick and bulky and too hard. It forces the mouth into an uncomfortable open position.  I trimmed the back edges but that didn&#x27;t help.  I wish I could find one that is less bulky and a bit softer. Since it&#x27;s guaranteed, I&#x27;m going to try to get my money back.</li>
