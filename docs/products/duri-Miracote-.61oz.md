      <li>It&#x27;s nice too because it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>The shipping from the Amazon vendors is fast and efficient and you can get started right away to build strong, beautiful and healthy nails.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting an amazing top coat because I love Rejuvacote so much.</li>
      <li>Works very fast and gives a nice protective shine.  </li>
      <li>For a nail coating, it is fine.  </li>
      <li>It took a few months, but now I have the best nails I have had in 30 plus years.  </li>
      <li>This is an ok top coat, I really was not all that thriller with it.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s good, quick dry.</li>
      <li>Seche Vite has always been my favorite quick dry top coat, I started the search for another brand after I was wasting money since the Seche would clot and become unmanageable too quickly</li>
      <li>Too god to be true right?</li>
      <li>It makes the whole nail feel strong and it looks so glossy with a &amp;#34;just painted look&amp;#34; .</li>
      <li>This Miracote is by far the fastest drying, leaves an incredibly shiny finish, and best of all it protects your manicure so it lasts at least a week longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I do my own nails and have used a million fast dry top coats in my life to prevent ruining my manicure while its drying.</li>

      <li>For the first time it&#x27;s not a futile effort for me to keep my nails polished -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was really excited to try Duri Maricote based on the raving reviews, unfortunately this product DID NOT live up to the hype:( I used it as a base &amp; top coat with a variety of different polishes and the results were very consistent...THE POLISH CHIPPED, PEELED and even POPPED OFF IN WHOLE PIECES within 24hrs of applying!!! I have NEVER had such a horrible experience with a top/base coat before:/ The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because it DOES dry super fast &amp; it DOES leave a great shine, so maybe I&#x27;m ok with it if I want to do a quick mani that will only last one day - However, it did surprisingly work well as a top coat over water transfers (got about 6-8 days without chipping/peeling) but overall I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> I purchased Duri Rejuvacote and it really works. My nails were thin and peeling. I followed the instructions to put on one coat a day for 7 days and I really noticed a difference! It&#x27;s nice too because it dries quickly. Well worth the $.</li>
    <li> Simple:  If you follow the instructions, your nails will grow.  My nails were permanently ruined many years ago after using solar nails for 3 years, one of the stupidest moves I&#x27;ve ever made.  My nails will never be great; but with this product, they grow to a decent manicure lenghth.  Would highy recommend.</li>
    <li> For a nail coating, it is fine.  I like the fact that it dries very fast and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It takes a few months for you to see the final results, but well worth it! Everyday looks like you just had your nails done because it is so shiney!</li>
    <li> Loved the way it dried my polish so quickly.  It says on &amp; lasts.  Goes on &amp; stays on.  That&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Miracote is perfect for a quick manicure. I usually do one coat of polish and then this topcoat. Otherwise, it does take a bit longer to dry. I did try this on top of my polish for a pedi and it didn&#x27;t work quite as well- there was smudging after about 45 minutes of dry time. I bought this because I have a busy toddler and didn&#x27;t want to worry about messing up my nails while chasing him around- for that purpose it works great!</li>
    <li> My nails look great ! I love that I no longer have peeling ,thin nails. My nails are are very strong. I no longer need costly weekly manicures.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I use Rejuvecote as a base, then my regular nailpolish, then Miracote. It keeps my manicure looking great all week long, no matter what brand of nailcolor I use. No chipping like before and no more touch-ups. Love this!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. This is the second time I order this. It really protects my nails and so far has been the only thing on the market that truely has made my nails strong ,..and also keeps them from breaking and chipping.</li>
    <li> Miracoat dries nails in half the time! Instantly to the touch! Nails dry like glass and are durable to wear.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an amazing top coat because I love Rejuvacote so much. WRONG. It was thin and didn&#x27;t dry as quickly as Seche Vite. It also smeared my nail art and bled.</li>
    <li> I love duri nail products!&lt;br /&gt;Rejuvacote makes my nail strong and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Miracote is wounderfull.It&#x27;s only takes 2-3 min for nail polish to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I use wait 30 min for nail to dry,because i love  to layer my nail polish for better dementinal look , it took  so long for my nail polish  to dry, its crazy!&lt;br /&gt;Not any more..Now i wait few minuets and i ready to go!.&lt;br /&gt;I adore miracote and just like rejuvacote it makes my nails stronger, nail polish staying looking  good for weeks .</li>
    <li> Seche Vite has always been my favorite quick dry top coat, I started the search for another brand after I was wasting money since the Seche would clot and become unmanageable too quickly and it would shrink the polish underneath and look bad. Duri is a life saver, the consistency is great, not thick like Seche and it does not shrink your polish. Takes a few more minutes to dry than my usual brand but it is cheaper and I am happier with it.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me after I complimented her on the beauty of her nails.  It took a few months, but now I have the best nails I have had in 30 plus years.  I get constant compliments and finally feel like I have the hands of a woman again! I tell everyone about this product.  I never dreamed my nails would grow again, ever!  I have osteopenia, the pre-cursor for osteoporosis and my nails would NOT grow.  I had a shelf full of nail products from all the big name companies, products I purchased at spas etc.  NONE OF THEM WORKED.  I continued to have split nails, torn nails, chipped nails and I had just about given up when a new friend of mine told me about Rejuvacote.  Since my nails have grown, I pitched all of the other products I had wasted money on.  Don&#x27;t walk, run to your computer or smart phone and order this product.  The shipping from the Amazon vendors is fast and efficient and you can get started right away to build strong, beautiful and healthy nails.  I no longer waste money with manicures that even damaged my nails further or fake nails.  I wish I had known about this product a lot sooner, it would have saved me a ton of money.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it today and know that it will take a few months to get the nails you want.  Have patience and follow the simple directions.  I have been using this since mid September and will continue to do so.  And I am told that the prices are the best here on Amazon.  I am on my second order now.&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Just got it so I don&#x27;t know yet. I used it a few times and it does make my nails shine.</li>
    <li> It keeps my manicure fresh for a long time.  I apply it every couple of days and my nails look great.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because for a top coat it works the best for me. Goes on easy, dries almost instantly and looks good.</li>
    <li> This is a fast drying, durable, high shine top coat. Great price, too. I will definitely buy this product again...</li>
    <li> Fast ship (prime), appeared as described, the quality is ok. It does dry my polish within a few minutes. I am very happy that it is formaldehyde free. But I noticed shrinking and chipping after a day. Nothing is perfect I guess.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic: it expedites the process of waiting for your nails to dry AND it creates a better barrier against chips than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used. Definitely worthy trying to see if you experience the same positive results.</li>
    <li> Really dries nails, only product I have used that delivers what it says it will do consistently( dries your nails very quickly</li>
    <li> I have no words to describe how great this top coat is. I&#x27;m almost out because I basically use it once a week since I do my nails so often. It really works unlike most things that say they&#x27;ll dry your nails. My nails are often dry and hard five minutes after putting this on them. It&#x27;s really good if you have somewhere to be and want to do your nails real quick.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever found. First topcoat that I&#x27;ve found that dries before I wreck my polish - which I&#x27;d nearly given up trying to do. Also protects polish for days. For the first time it&#x27;s not a futile effort for me to keep my nails polished - and I&#x27;m always doing work that destroys most manicures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different top coats and they all bubble or take too long to dry. This product routinely dries quickly with little to not bubbling or lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip though is to let the first coat of your chosen nail polish to dry COMPLETELY before adding a second or third coat and then add the top coat a few seconds later. This prevents peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this several times, will keep buying.</li>
    <li> This did not even last two days before it began chipping.  Will be throwing it out so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, quick dry. Don&#x27;t really notice any difference in my nails. Downside is the bottle is only half gone and is already pretty thick. But this is common in most if not all fast dry top coats</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best thing to ever happen to my nails! I do my own nails and have used a million fast dry top coats in my life to prevent ruining my manicure while its drying. This Miracote is by far the fastest drying, leaves an incredibly shiny finish, and best of all it protects your manicure so it lasts at least a week longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried. My manicures used to only last a week or so bc the nail polish would inevitably chip or peel and look awful (I&#x27;m kind of rough on my nails), and now I go 2 weeks before re-painting, and only then bc my nails have grown so much. Its crazy, no chips, no peeling!! This stuff is magic.</li>
    <li> Long lasting strong top coat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Excellent?</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has amazing nails, good length and very healthy looking. When I asked her what was her secret she recommended this for me to try. I have natural nails and until now unable to keep them strong. This works like magic! Keeps your nails strong, dry very quickly... I use it every time I go to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for growing out nails, I also use it as a base and top coat and it dries fast and looks great! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good,does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Covers great, smooth, glassy appearance. Dries almost instantly, even on multiple coats of polish. Am buying this again. This is my new go to quick dry top coat!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this.  Says it&#x27;s the best thing for her nails. Hard to find in shops so glad I could get it here.</li>
    <li> I loved this product it would dry almost instantly. I highly recommend it. I put it on as a clear polish and it is really shiny.</li>
    <li> Dries very quickly! Holds a beautiful shine. I&#x27;m using Duri Rejuvicote as well, so we&#x27;ll see if my nails get stronger. Stay tuned...</li>
    <li> This duri top coat polish delivers!  It seals the polish, it is shiny and it dries quickly.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Simply put. It dries in less than a minute even with it being on top of other coats, dry or not, it&#x27;ll dry them it. It makes the whole nail feel strong and it looks so glossy with a &amp;#34;just painted look&amp;#34; . I would recommend this to anyone and I will definitely buy another bottle when this one runs out. And a plus is that shipping is pretty fast, too.</li>
    <li> Because Miracote is the new HG of my nail arsenal. I purchased this after seeing a good review and one ok review of it somewhere online, I wish I knew where to find the girl who wrote the good review because she changed the way I do my nails FOREVER! I can literally lay down for bed 5-10 minutes after painting my nails and sealing them with this top coat and wake up without hair or sheet lines. What?! Too god to be true right? NOPE! I&#x27;ve used SV in the past and although I do like it, the smell is much stronger than Miracote&#x27;s and SV has a tendency of shrinking my polish. I haven&#x27;t noticed shrinking with this one and so it will be my go to until I find another product better than this one. Which I doubt I will! I would and have recommended this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> It was as if it was a nailpolish designed to chip. The topcoat allowed me to literally peel of any nailpolish I put on. It was terrible I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> bought it for my aunt and she loves the items</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it. First time I heard about it I had overheard two women talking about their mani/pedis lasting for weeks. I had to try it! Sure enough, it works! This company is quick and friendly. My first Order got lost - they sent out another ASAP no questions asked! I would definitely recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> I searched forever trying to find a good topcoat that wouldn&#x27;t chip after a couple days. I think I finally found it! This topcoat dries quickly and protects my nails for several days when my other topcoats would only last two or three at best. I found that it works better when I use it over my other topcoat so if you are having trouble I would experiment a little.</li>
    <li> Duri products I have found to be amazing&lt;br /&gt;The Rejuvocate helped my nails grow strong and long&lt;br /&gt;Now the Miracote really protects my polish and my nails have such a shine with this.&lt;br /&gt;Such a huge fan!</li>
    <li> I use this product each time I do my nails and in between times!  My polish will last two weeks with an additional coat of color and Miracote once or twice.  Miracote dries your nails super fast!!!</li>
    <li> Great coat.  I use even when I am not using regular polish.  Keeps my nails looking great.  i will order again</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It drys so fast and helps to keep my polish in place much longer. The price is right and it is so easy to order.</li>
    <li> Miracot is the fastest cover coat that I ever used. I could not believe how well it worked. It was dry before I started the next nail, so it protected the under coats from smearing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and continue to love it.  Works very fast and gives a nice protective shine.  Great for quick polish touch-ups.</li>
    <li> This is an ok top coat, I really was not all that thriller with it. I use it mostly on my toes, as far as my nails, my polish clipped when I used it.</li>
    <li> if your nails are soft &amp; break easy this product will give you lovely nails in a short period if you apply a coat everyday for about two weeks and the use about twice a week to keep the hard and growing</li>
    <li> I finally found something that really works! This is all that I will use from now on. I&#x27;m truly satisfied .</li>
    <li> The pain is sometimes unbearable. When I put on the first coat, the pain starts. After that coast it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It has definitely strengthen my nails, don&#x27;t get me wrong but I may have to try something else once I am done with these bottles. I am secretly hoping the pain stops after so many appications.</li>
    <li> This product truly does leave perfect nails becauses it goes on very easy and drys in just a minute or two!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me I ordered 3 bottles but was sent the wrong product.  Amazon gives you a return address&lt;br /&gt;to send it back but you have to pay for the shipping which is almost the price of the 3 rejunvinate products they mistakingly sent me.  Now they don&#x27;t seem to have the product and can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> This topcoat is something I cannot live without!  After polishing my nails with the required number of coats I need, I wait approximately 5-10 minutes and apply a fairly generous coat of Miracote to each nail, making sure to cover the entire nail and carry the topcoat down over the tip of each nail.  Wait a few minutes and you can proceed with small chores while the topcoat and polish finish setting.  It has a wonderful high glossy shine, and seals in the polish.  With an occasional touch up, my manicure now lasts me 7 full days, and in many instances even longer.  And it looks great.  This topcote is a must have if you do your own manicures!</li>
    <li> Great product. I get little to almost no wear on the tips of my nails. I put a coat on them everyday for the first 3 days and then every other day. I also use the rejuvacoat as a base coat which is also great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times now. The dry time is quite fast, maybe a minute longer than Seche. This top coat does not cause any shrinkage with any of the brands I&#x27;ve tried it with so far including 3/4 free brands and indies.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by a friend. I have used acrylic nails for about 20 years and tried several time to go back to my natural nails and could never do it as they always broke and split. this product is wonderful, I would say that within 4 months your natural nails will look pretty good.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t like. Madr Polish peel off.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  I USE IT OVER BOTH THE REJUVACOTE AND REGULAR NAIL POLISH.&lt;br /&gt;IT DRIES PRACTICALLY INSTANTLY.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AS A  MUST&lt;br /&gt;HAVE.  PUT IT ON YOUR NEXT AMAZON ORDER!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not much better than what is used in the salon. Like it !dont love it is good description</li>
    <li> I love when something does what it says it does. The best to bring dead nails back to life.</li>
    <li> no such luck,DOES NOT STAY ON as a top coat it does a poor job,my nails peel off with in a couple of days of regular wear.</li>
