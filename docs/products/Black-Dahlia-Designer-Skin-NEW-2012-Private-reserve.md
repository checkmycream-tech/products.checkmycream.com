      <li>Every time I use it I get compliments, plus the tanning workers say it&#x27;s their favorite bronzer..</li>
      <li>and I asked them what is the best bronzer they currently have.</li>
      <li>Price was better online than in any tanning salon.</li>

      <li>I will be ordering more from this company.</li>

      <li>I loved it and knew this was going to be my new tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>Black Dahlia is a awesome product.  </li>
      <li>Looking forward to seeing if it really does have anti-aging benefits as well as the nice smell and moisturization it provides.</li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves instant bronze!</li>
      <li>The scent is fabulous and entrancing.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and truly moisturizes.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin really soft, I don&#x27;t have any streaking, and it smells good.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>and they are NEVER a disappointment!</li>
      <li>and it really is helping keep my tan nice and golden.</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>Not Snookie-worthy, but nice and natural looking.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to peanuts, almonds, walnuts, pecans, sweet almond, pistachio&#x27;s, and all corn products.</li>
      <li>It rubs in easy and is VERY moisturizing!</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful when you first put on and the small stays that way even after tanning.</li>
      <li>The smell was pleasant enough at first, but has been lingering for about 5 hours now.</li>
      <li>texture - silky smooth and very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>It shows up like two hours after tanning, but it is well worth the wait....</li>
      <li>I burn really easy when in the sun even when using high spf sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you tan a super pretty brown color.</li>
      <li>right now my skin looks a couple of shades darker, after using this lotion and spending 5 minutes in a mid-level tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I was a shade or so darker right out of the bed</li>
      <li>Black Dahlia by Designer Skin is my new favorite lotion!!  </li>
      <li>Exactly how it was said it was going to come.</li>
      <li>I think it makes my skin look a tiny bit more luminous as well.</li>
      <li>But it came exactly as described.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I started using this lotion today, and the first thing I noticed is how moisturizing it feels.</li>
      <li>I saw results beginning the first tan.  </li>
      <li>aka &amp;#34;cheating&amp;#34; the only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because it&#x27;s thicker than most Designer Skin products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different lotions of all different levels, types and brands, but my Black Dahlia was by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is Amazing!  Your will get a darker tan.  I love it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of this lotion, but I am somewhat picky. The smell was pleasant enough at first, but has been lingering for about 5 hours now. It is still quite strong. I almost always get great color. I got less color than I am used to with this lotion compared to the others I have tried with a bronzing bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely go back to old favorites and will not try this lotion again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Nice texture - silky smooth and very moisturizing. I did not get any \\&quot;orange\\&quot; hues.</li>
    <li> Black Dahlia by Designer Skin is my new favorite lotion!!  I normally use Black or 14kt Gold, both by Designer Skin, but this lotion is so much better!  The smell is a little strong at first but it&#x27;s pleasant.  My boyfriend actually didn&#x27;t complain about the smell afterwards.  The color that I got was amazing!  I got at least 3 shades darker and didn&#x27;t turn orange.  I highly recommend this new lotion!</li>
    <li> I received what I believe was a good price for two trial packets.  However the product didnt perform for me on the same level of what I am currently using.  Not worth the price.  Skip this product, unless you have absolutely no color at all...</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for $125 at my tanning salon as a treat to myself...and I have never had such a horrible case of buyer&#x27;s remorse!! This lotion does NOTHING for me. I am not darker at all, in spite of using it in 3 different types of beds (level 3, 4, AND 5). Don&#x27;t waste your money...spend it on Luminary, which is amazing.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite designer skin lotion  But it came exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves instant bronze! I also love that this price is so much better than purchasing from a salon!</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion today, and the first thing I noticed is how moisturizing it feels. The bronzers work a lot better than the other Designer Skin lotions I use. Didn&#x27;t settle in my wrinkles at all. ;) right now my skin looks a couple of shades darker, after using this lotion and spending 5 minutes in a mid-level tanning bed. I think it makes my skin look a tiny bit more luminous as well. Looking forward to seeing if it really does have anti-aging benefits as well as the nice smell and moisturization it provides.</li>
    <li> great lotion too bad it is being discontinued.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product a week a go, and after using it once I noticed a big difference! It has more bronzers in it so you tan a super pretty brown color. it smells amazing. I will never use another tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Every time I use it I get compliments, plus the tanning workers say it&#x27;s their favorite bronzer.. aka &amp;#34;cheating&amp;#34; the only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because it&#x27;s thicker than most Designer Skin products.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Great color and my skin feel amazing afterwords. Nice smell! I&#x27;ve been using designer skin products for quite a while so far and they are NEVER a disappointment!</li>
    <li> The package on this product was HORRIBLE! The outer plastic with the black flowers design was already torn off and taped back... The plastic design underneath was cut and looks like a security tab was removed. Kinda makes me think it was stolen from a store.. The lotion itself im not a fan of. Idk if its even real.. Ive heard amazing stuff about this lotion but it just dont work to well for me. The shipping came as expected tho.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! One trip to the Diva hex and I could see a difference. 15 minutes for 3 days and I was a very nice shade of brown. Not Snookie-worthy, but nice and natural looking. Highly impressed! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of tanning lotions and this one I find is the best.  One use and I come out of the tanning salon really dark.  I find that I can tan less because the tan last so long.  Hope they keep making this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Black Dahlia lotion!! I&#x27;ve used many different lotions of all different levels, types and brands, but my Black Dahlia was by far the best I&#x27;ve used. Another great thing was how quickly my order was processed, shipped and received!! Awesome, simply awesome!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion.I purchased it one time with my tanning salon,i paid about 80 dollars for it.I purchased it the second from this buyer,and I love that it did not cost me half as much as they charge.I love the smell and I get great color from this lotion.I will be ordering more from this company.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is a little expensive, but in the long run well worth the money.  It leaves my skin really soft, I don&#x27;t have any streaking, and it smells good.  It is the darkest I have ever been.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite of the Designer Skin line. I prefer a few others like Black, Luminary, Belleza and Color Bomb. It was okay though. Price was better online than in any tanning salon. Would die before i paid over $40 for this let alone $90. My suggestion is to go for one of the others I mentioned that have good bronzers and moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants that dark, deep tan. The after smell is not great but you do get the results from this product and the price was decent as well.</li>
    <li> This product did give me great bronze color without the orange tint all over and on my hands and feet. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell it&#x27;s not bad just not great. Overall good product. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Black Dahlia is a awesome product.  It smells wonderful and leaves your skin so soft and gives you great color.  You do not have the after tanning smell other products leave.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great. You don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed all day after using it. I have used several different tanning lotions and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This lotion not only smells wonderful but also tans you very nicely! I would order it again! I am very Pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Someone stole it out of mailbox. Send should insure packages. Wish I could of use it. My friend has it and she loves if</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing I haven&#x27;t been to the tanning bed in two weeks and you can still see my tan.  The only problem I had was it streaked one time when I was in a big hurry and lathered it on too much.  Defiantly use baby wipes on your hands before you get in the bed after you rub it in or it&#x27;ll leave your hands orangy.  Definitely one of the best bronzes on the market.</li>
    <li> Tanning salons sell this for over $100 dollars! Sometimes closer to $200. Has like 43 bronzers. Amazing product. Only tip, when you&#x27;re really close to the bottom of the bottle.. Just toss the rest. No matter how well you shake it during the duration of your use, some bronzers sit on the bottom and will orange you.</li>
    <li> scent I love it its like powdery sweetarts in the bottle and on your skin its like a nice sweet perfume NO ATO AT ALL!! Except the next morning when I woke up I had a slight dha smell but thats all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color* I was a shade or so darker right out of the bed but the next day I had a nice natural looking deeper tan from the bronzers in this lotion. The bronzers arent too heavy or dark so this is a GREAT bronzer for people who want to gradual increase there dha tan over there real tan or for someone with a lighter tan. I dont tan that often so its PERFECT for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;texture * its a thicker lotion and I absolutely love that! It rubs in easy and is VERY moisturizing! I am so happy to have a bottle of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;skincare* This is a high end lotion with high end skincare ingredients which is another reason why I wanted this lotion so bad. I love the idea of getting a tan but at the same time doing something good for my skin! I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and does the trick. Smells wonderful when you first put on and the small stays that way even after tanning. Keeps skin soft too!</li>
    <li> OKAY LOTION FOR THE PRICE</li>
    <li> This stuff is the absolute best you can get. Locks in a tan for months, smells AMAZING, and doesn&#x27;t give an after-orange effect that streaks off. Do yourself a favor and get this lotion!</li>
    <li> I saw results beginning the first tan.  Not to mention that this costs over $100 at most tanning salons. The fragrance is not overpowering like some tanning lotions.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful. They smell the quality. I really loved the price. I saved a ton no buying at the tanning place.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for 5 months and absolutely love it! It goes on smooth and truly moisturizes. When I get out of the tanning bed I don&#x27;t feel all dried out and stinky. A big draw to this lotion really was the smell. This lotion also really helps keep my tan longer. I admit it I love going tanning but have recently tried to cut back and it really is helping keep my tan nice and golden. I would definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> It gets me really dark. It shows up like two hours after tanning, but it is well worth the wait....</li>
    <li> I went to my local tanning salon and I asked them what is the best bronzer they currently have. The lady showed me this bottle and told me it was $140ish. There was no way I was buy this there. But I did buy a sample packet there just to make sure I wanted to buy it. I loved it and knew this was going to be my new tanning lotion. I&#x27;m not switching to other lotions either. I got this product really fast. Exactly how it was said it was going to come. I&#x27;m over all very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Black Dahlia is it finest skin product I have ever had the pleasure to utilize. The scent is fabulous and entrancing. I love it and would like to be able to purchase it again for many years.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It is by far my fav!!! You must purchase this lotion! &amp; its a great deal. At Malibu its 160$</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have eczema and extremely sensitive skin. I am allergic to peanuts, almonds, walnuts, pecans, sweet almond, pistachio&#x27;s, and all corn products. The product I received did not contain any of listed above ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have nut allergies make sure you read the ingredients in person to make sure they do not contain walnuts.&lt;br /&gt;This product is one of the few I have found that does not contain any of my allergies. YAY!!! Happy dance!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The product I received smells amazing! It does not smell like tanning lotion, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;I am a blond with red undertone in my skin. I burn really easy when in the sun even when using high spf sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very fair skinned and used this the week of my wedding along with the high pressure tanning bed with bronzing rays and my skin did not go orange and I didn&#x27;t burn!!!!! Amazing! I absolutely love this stuff!!!!</li>
