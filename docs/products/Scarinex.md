      <li>Additionally, the Scarinex containers make applying the product easy and fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks for products like these!!</li>
      <li>She said, “I will pay for your first tube, if you’ll use it!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After using Scarinex I got great results in having little to no scarring from the surgery.  </li>
      <li>Scarinex it definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>I have a cesarean section scar right below my pants line.  </li>
      <li>would really recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The ridges on the scar have disappeared and it is now a light pink colour rather than bright red.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to our next evening out when I get to wear my favorite dress without feeling embarrassed about my knees.</li>
      <li>I’ve tried so many different products from doctors and over the counter, but nothing has made any difference.</li>
      <li>Scarinex really helped to calm my worries that I would have a horrendous to scar.  </li>
      <li>I used many different methods but nothing worked until i used Scarinex.</li>
      <li>I have to admit I use the skin rejuvenator over my entire face and not just the scars and my whole complexion looks better for it.</li>
      <li>With all of the positive reviews, I figured I had nothing to lose.</li>
      <li>It’s simple enough to use and most importantly it was affordable.</li>
      <li>SCARINEX is such an exciting product to me because I love the idea of a natural scar solution.</li>
      <li>After using Scarinex for a month, I am pleased to say that the red scarring has reduced significantly, without affecting the texture of my skin, which is on the sensitive side and can react badly to new products.</li>
      <li>but as I got older I began to feel like it was the first thing everyone noticed about me.  </li>
      <li>Although it is not visible to others I just really wanted to erase it from my body.  </li>
      <li>Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal cream and Gel has been the key to fading my scars.</li>
      <li>I don’t, and that is thanks to Scarinex.</li>
      <li>I got better results than I had actually expected.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this on my neck and my scar has faded so much</li>
      <li>As a kid it didn’t bother me so much</li>
      <li>I would recommend Scarinex to anyone who wants real results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the results so far, they&#x27;ve definitely lightened up a whole lot</li>
      <li>I decided to try Scarinex: Advanced Scar Removal Treatment to clear up some of the old scars on my legs.</li>
      <li>When I was a kid I fell off my bike and ended up with a fairly large and obvious scar on my right cheek.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Using as directed is definitely important because I&#x27;ve tried some stuff and not really followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>It sometimes made me self conscious to go out without make up, and it really had started to affect my confidence.</li>
      <li>Finally, one day I decided I’d had enough and bought Scarinex: Advanced Scar Removal Treatment.  </li>
      <li>Scarinex is actually two products in one: the first is the actual scar cream, which helps the healthy skin cells with the actual scar, and then the scar gel helps the body heal the actual scar.  </li>
      <li>My raised scars started to go down and the skin was smooth again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it works because  the few times I&#x27;ve tried to use it the scent was so strong that is all I could smell</li>
      <li>The cream works wonders to make my sensitive skin soft and touchable again.  </li>
      <li>Applying Scarinex to my scar has shown much improvement and it is only a matter of time before it becomes unnoticeable.</li>
      <li>I started applying the Scarinex as directed and began to see results in just a few applications, the redness of the scar started fading and the surface was smooth.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised of the speed it removed my scars.</li>
      <li>You need some patience as skin healing takes time, but the crucial point I want to share here is: It Works, and it really has made a difference to me.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s only so much concealer you can use.</li>
      <li>I wasn’t really expecting it to work because that seemed like too much to hopeful but after just a short amount of time I began to notice a big difference!</li>
      <li>I never expected it to work so well!!</li>
      <li>You can still see where my stretchmarks were if you look really hard, but they are pretty much gone!</li>
      <li>friend Valarie, who is an airline attendant and travels the world, told me about Scarinex Scar Gel, for a big visible scar I had on my left arm.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone with major scars they are trying to fade.  </li>
      <li>When I was in high school I had to have three different surgeries on my left foot.</li>
      <li>When I first stumbled across Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal Cream &amp; Gel , I was a bit skeptical on the results.</li>
      <li>I can barely tell it’s there.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend was involved in a minor car accident and though she was okay, the accident left her with small scars on the left side of her fore head.</li>
      <li>I have a few scars on my body that I thought I’d never get rid of – because I like to use natural, gentle products</li>

    <li> SCARINEX is such an exciting product to me because I love the idea of a natural scar solution. I have a few scars on my body that I thought I’d never get rid of – because I like to use natural, gentle products and I didn’t think anything like this existed for removing scars. Now that I know about SCARINEX, I have a scar cream to try that is effective and safe!</li>
    <li> Received product as described in very quick order and am using it as directed, very happy so far with results</li>
    <li> I had a big surgery which also left me with a BIG scar was using a scar cream from my doctor but it was 150.00 for a small tube saw this and for almost the same amount of money got 6 bottles used them all and have not seen any improvement will not buy this again. the skin rejuvenator smells like bug spray</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:e3c3e70dae4cda1b4caabe11ca1f6bb]] This is my video review of my results after using both the Scarinex Gel and Cream. In the short time I have been using the product I have seen results. Scarinex it definitely worth trying. Please, check out the video.</li>
    <li> I was always self-conscious in the past about a few scars that I had, specifically on my neck and my arm. I decided to try this on my neck and my scar has faded so much I can barely tell it’s there. I wasn’t sure how much I would have to go through but there should be plenty left for all the other scars I have too. I definitely recommend Scarinex. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Recently, my two-year-old took a hard fall and split her lip completely through. She healed well, but it appeared that she would grow up with an ugly scar over her upper lip. After researching scar removers, I chose Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal Cream and Gel because of its two separate applications (I didn’t believe that one cream could “do it all”). After a week I could see a visible difference. The redness had disappeared, and the scar began to fade. After three weeks, the scar had faded to a line so thin that only a parent would notice. I am very pleased with Scarnex, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have had a large-area cicatrization from a long term skin infection. It looked not really bad, but was a self-confidence killer to me as I noticed that people were looking at it all the time. So a close friend recommended Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal Cream &amp; Gel to me. The concept of it sounded plausible to me and so I decided to give it a try. My scars started fading and I could feel and see that my skin became better day by day. You need some patience as skin healing takes time, but the crucial point I want to share here is: It Works, and it really has made a difference to me.</li>
    <li> When I first stumbled across Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal Cream &amp; Gel , I was a bit skeptical on the results. I had a horrible scar on my neck from a work injury and was a bit self conscious about it. I have tried other products in recent months and received minimal if any results. With all of the positive reviews, I figured I had nothing to lose. After a few weeks of use, the scar has diminished considerably. I am impressed with the results and plan to continue using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Three years ago I was involved in a car accident that required four extensive surgeries and left nasty scars on my arm, one of which being about 7 inches long and a half inch wide. I had tried everything, from over the counter, as seen on tv and prescription products from the doctor and this is the ONLY thing to make a difference in the appearance of my scars. Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal cream and Gel has been the key to fading my scars. SO happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Scarinex Scar Gel &amp; the Rejuvenating Cream&lt;br /&gt;My friend Valarie, who is an airline attendant and travels the world, told me about Scarinex Scar Gel, for a big visible scar I had on my left arm. A year later, when I saw her again, she said, “I see that you never used the product, (Scarinex Scar Gel) because your scar is still there”. She said, “I will pay for your first tube, if you’ll use it!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product almost every day until it was gone, about 4 months. My scar is almost invisible now.  I’m sorry I didn’t take a before photo, but it is 100% better now.  I believe if I use one more tube it will be gone.  What I like most about my results, is how it unified the color of my scar, making it almost invisible. Today I ordered the 6 pack, Scarinex Scar Gel + the Rejuvenating Cream, so I can share with friends and family.  It will make an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> Couple of months ago i was part of a biking accident. It was not that bad, however i was left with some scars on my legs and arms. I used many different methods but nothing worked until i used Scarinex. I was surprised of the speed it removed my scars. It only took about a month for my scars to fully disappear. Scarinex also lacked the unpleasant smell unlike many other products that i used.</li>
    <li> When I was in high school I had to have three different surgeries on my left foot. I am very thankful that the surgeries were successful and that I am no longer in pain, but I have always hated the scars that were left behind. A friend of mine recommended trying to find a scar removal product. I searched Amazon and found Scarinex and decided to give it a try. Now the skin on my foot looks healthier, less puffy, and my scar has been fading. I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the results I got since I started using the Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal Treatment. I was in a car accident a few weeks ago and, after using various tissue oils, vitamin E-creams and other over the counter medicines, my scars did not fade.&lt;br /&gt;A friend suggested that I use Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal Treatment and I am SO glad I did. I’ve only been using it for 3 weeks now, but I can already see a difference. The redness and swelling is gone and the scars appear lighter and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I lived in the humid South for a few years when I was growing up and ended up with legs covered with scars from bug bites. It was so bad I refused to wear shorts for almost fifteen years. I’ve tried so many different products from doctors and over the counter, but nothing has made any difference. I was about to give up when I found Scarinex. I followed the instructions on the label and after several weeks, I was finally wearing shorts again. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Scarinex gel and cream have given me a way to become scar-free.  The gel has a healing effect that works over time.  The cream works wonders to make my sensitive skin soft and touchable again.  I needed a strong partner to help get past scars that I don&#x27;t want and I am happy that I found Scarinex gel and cream.  Additionally, the Scarinex containers make applying the product easy and fast.</li>
    <li> Since I can remember I had trouble with skin. I was a restless child. I had so many accidents in childhood that I can&#x60;t count the scars. It was ok then, but now it is not. I tried every skin cream and gel I could think of. My friend recommended me Scarinex, and I decided to give it a try. Well, I must say that I do not regret it. The moment I started using it, my scars started fading. I can&#x60;t describe how happy I am.</li>
    <li> Having suffered from acne both in my teenage years an as an adult, I was left with red scarring that still made me feel like an awkward teenager. It sometimes made me self conscious to go out without make up, and it really had started to affect my confidence. After using Scarinex for a month, I am pleased to say that the red scarring has reduced significantly, without affecting the texture of my skin, which is on the sensitive side and can react badly to new products. I really hope the good results continue, along with a boost in my confidence.</li>
    <li> My brother has had scars for several years due to an accident. I gave him this product as gift. I never expected it to work so well!! The scars have faded a LOT, which traduces to a higher self-esteem and a better life. Thanks for products like these!!</li>
    <li> This product smells horrible! I don&#x27;t know how well it works because  the few times I&#x27;ve tried to use it the scent was so strong that is all I could smell so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as recommended and my scars have faded tremendously.  They have thinned and don&#x27;t have the ridges they did before.  I was using Mederma and it was okay but a few areas were thicker and I could feel some ridging.  I recommend this product to anyone with major scars they are trying to fade.  I got better results than I had actually expected.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was involved in a minor car accident and though she was okay, the accident left her with small scars on the left side of her fore head. We decided to try Scarinex and after three weeks, I can comfortably say the scars are almost gone. We still have plenty of the cream left so I believe the scars will be fully gone after a while. The cream is easy to apply and doesn’t have a horrid smell as do many creams. Also Scarinex didn’t give her a rash or leave her with a burning sensation like a couple of creams we’d tried earlier. Scarinex does work, definite recommendation. Good product.</li>
    <li> Scarinex: Advanced Scar Removal Treatment has been Heaven sent. After undergoing reconstructive surgery on my right knee to fix my torn ACL, a huge scar has appeared. Although I already knew that there’s virtually nothing I could have done to prevent the scar from showing up, it still bothered me to the point where I had to find a solution. Applying Scarinex to my scar has shown much improvement and it is only a matter of time before it becomes unnoticeable. I am thankful for this product as it has helped heal my scar and has rejuvenated the look of my skin.</li>
    <li> I had bad scar on my arm from falling off a bike as a kid and, for as long as I could remember, I had been researching and trying a variety of treatments and creams to minimize the appearance of it, but nothing seemed to work for me – until I stumbled on Scarinex. After a few weeks I started seeing results and I was ecstatic. It’s simple enough to use and most importantly it was affordable. I’m so glad I stumbled upon it and I have definitely recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Growing up I played a lot of sports and loved skateboarding. My youthful days left me with scraped knees with scars on my legs. I scar with keloids that are raised and look extremely ugly. I always would wear pants to hide them.I found the Scarinex treatment and started applying it to my scarred knees. My husband was the first one to comment on how nice my legs looked. My raised scars started to go down and the skin was smooth again. You couldn&#x27;t tell that there was ever a huge keloid there and my days of always wearing pants was over. I&#x27;m looking forward to our next evening out when I get to wear my favorite dress without feeling embarrassed about my knees. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical to try Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal after reading some of the negative reviews, but I decided to try it based all of it’s positive reviews and I am so happy that I did.  I had these huge, dark and disgusting stretch marks on the upper part of my thighs and the backs of my calves that I got while I was pregnant. I thought I would never be able to wear shorts again. You can still see where my stretchmarks were if you look really hard, but they are pretty much gone! I haven’t been using it for that long, but I’m sure, eventually, you won&#x27;t be able to see them at all. I only wish that I had taken before and after pictures to show everyone!</li>
    <li> I had rotar cuff surgery on my shoulder nine years ago. The surgery went a bit wrong and I have a horrible scar on my shoulder. I have tried everything from expensive creams, to plasters and home remedies. I bought Scarinex six weeks ago and the results are amazing. The ridges on the scar have disappeared and it is now a light pink colour rather than bright red. I will keep using it on the scar and I plan to use it on my stretch marks next.</li>
    <li> Just recently I had shoulder surgery and was concerned about the scarring it would leave.  After using Scarinex I got great results in having little to no scarring from the surgery.  Scarinex is actually two products in one: the first is the actual scar cream, which helps the healthy skin cells with the actual scar, and then the scar gel helps the body heal the actual scar.  Scarinex really helped to calm my worries that I would have a horrendous to scar.  I don’t, and that is thanks to Scarinex.</li>
    <li> I am clumsy and like to play sports- it is a terrible combination. As a result I’ve ended up with small scars all over the place. Unlike guys, for us ladies these scars are more unsightly then a chance to tell a good story! I decided to try Scarinex: Advanced Scar Removal Treatment to clear up some of the old scars on my legs. Haven’t looked back sense!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have some pretty nasty acne scars, anytime I get a zit I get a scar and there&#x27;s only so much concealer you can use. I&#x27;m really pleased with the results so far, they&#x27;ve definitely lightened up a whole lot and it&#x27;s making my complexion much more even. It does take time though so you have to be patient to get the results you want because it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. Using as directed is definitely important because I&#x27;ve tried some stuff and not really followed the instructions and it didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a good price balance between the super pricey stuff from the doctor and the cheap drugstore creams and this really does work. I have to admit I use the skin rejuvenator over my entire face and not just the scars and my whole complexion looks better for it.</li>
    <li> When I was a kid I fell off my bike and ended up with a fairly large and obvious scar on my right cheek.  As a kid it didn’t bother me so much but as I got older I began to feel like it was the first thing everyone noticed about me.  Before people even got to know me they would be asking how I managed to get the scar.  Finally, one day I decided I’d had enough and bought Scarinex: Advanced Scar Removal Treatment.  I wasn’t really expecting it to work because that seemed like too much to hopeful but after just a short amount of time I began to notice a big difference! I’m amazed at how well it has worked and would definitely recommend it for others.</li>
    <li> I was told about Scarinex Advanced Scar Removal Treatment from a good friend of mine.  I have a cesarean section scar right below my pants line.  Although it is not visible to others I just really wanted to erase it from my body.  I started applying the Scarinex as directed and began to see results in just a few applications, the redness of the scar started fading and the surface was smooth.  I would recommend Scarinex to anyone who wants real results.</li>
