### Positive Reviews

      <li>Excellent product I will recommend it</li>
      <li>Great to use with the Miyako Sumi incense,</li>
      <li>Even if you don&#x27;t burn resin, this is great to burn your coils, sticks, cones, etc in.</li>
      <li>Great ash.</li>
      <li>Good purchase.</li>
      <li>but this is a good start for insulation.</li>
      <li>Work good at the furneral</li>
      <li>good for 10-15 uses.</li>
      <li>This stuff is good filler for an incense bowl and provides a nice place for a charcoal burner to rest.</li>
      <li>and i am glad i did!</li>
      <li>Very nice, easy to get everywhere though.</li>
      <li>The problem is the picture makes you think you&#x27;re getting a nice sized bag</li>
      <li>Its a great product i bought two bags because i always think more the better</li>
      <li>P.S.this ash is very fine and light, so if you blow on your charcoal, the ash will fly all over</li>
      <li>very easy.</li>
      <li>Very fine, but not functional.  </li>
      <li>Very very fine powder.</li>
      <li>This ash is very fine and makes my incense burn cooler and longer.</li>
      <li>The ash is great and is exactly as described for incense burning.</li>
      <li>Very fine white ash, perfect for incense.</li>
      <li>That gives you more control over the amount of smoke produced from the resin.</li>
      <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
      <li>I love it .</li>
      <li>Just remember to buy more than you think you&#x27;ll need.</li>
      <li>so then I tried filling up my bowl all the way to the top to see if it would make any difference</li>
      <li>I just wish there was a better product description so that I was prepared for the size of the bag.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to disposal of it, the charcoal and resin, after I&#x27;m done so</li>
      <li>Glad to have it without having to drive all over.</li>
      <li>This could be remedied by a heavier bowl or one that includes a mesh top that would allow for a more controlled adjustment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Looking for an authentic and quality ash product?</li>
      <li>Ok, buy it.</li>
      <li>Good amount for price, keeps the containers from getting too hot.</li>
      <li>The coal was able to breathe and burn fine in the ash.</li>
      <li>very fine, clean ash.</li>
      <li>At first I was concerned that I would need two, but once it was all in the bowl it filled it quite nicely.</li>
      <li>However, when I put the ash into the incense bowl it filled it about 2/3 of the way.</li>
      <li>I opened this and started pouring it into my bowl, and it filled up before the bag was even half-empty.</li>
      <li>Nothing is free.</li>
      <li>It is actually a very useful in the incense burning process.</li>
      <li>ash is very fine and used in more traditional incense burning.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly</li>
      <li>If you want a soft, smooth way to burn your incense on charcoal, nestle it in the ash once it&#x27;s heated, then put some ash on top.</li>
      <li>As for the amount you get, this stuff is so light that 1.7 ounces is pretty generous and keep in mind that the price includes shipping.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described burns clean no bad after cent lets the coal to breath</li>
      <li>I was very surprised and pleased.</li>
      <li>....if you need this rare item you can buy it with confidence.  </li>
      <li>Pure and clean.</li>
      <li>This is a high quality product, very very worth purchasing if you like incense at all.</li>
      <li>to my own devices, I probably would have filled the bowl with clean white sand but my significant other is Taiwanese and convinced me that this ash is the correct material to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am glad I ordered this because now my herbs burn nice and slow.</li>
      <li>It works good but the bags are small like it reads on other reviews you better of ordering 2 or more.</li>
      <li>It keep heat absorption to reduce brass burner to get hot.</li>
      <li>If you purchase this please make sure you order enough.</li>
      <li>I was able to fill my burner and still have enough to refill it if needed.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product and plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>I first decided to buy this Ash for incense burning was thanks to krazyboytx from youtube form one of his videos about incense burning.</li>
      <li>but i think its also a good way of remembering your past times using it.</li>
      <li>Now its some what bothersome if you&#x27;re trying to entice certain deities or set the mood for your spell work,</li>
      <li>/&gt;Judging from the illustration, I thought I would receive quite a large bag</li>
      <li>Ash is as fine as any perceptible solid gets (think talc powder).</li>
      <li>This is a fine white powder ash.</li>
      <li>And fill it you must because the ash is so fine that the sticks will fall over if there is only an inch or so in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
      <li>I bought a bag of this white ash to fill my bowl (http://www.amazon.com/Wisteria-Bowl-With-Handles-Shoyeido/dp/B001B61J9I/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hi_21) and one bag fit very well.</li>
      <li>It works really well, and I would buy again</li>
      <li>I really didnt know what this was for, but I bought it anyway.</li>
      <li>very economical.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lovely white soft powder.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have with it, is that it isn&#x27;t enough and the price is kind of high.</li>
      <li>I usually just burn incense to make my own ash</li>
      <li>This will release less smoke and will smell even better.</li>
      <li>Works great in the bottom of my incense burners and I was surprised that a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I could see this being an issue if you use a shallow bowl because it is so fine and light.</li>
      <li>, 4\\&quot; high</li>
      <li>product, i highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>then i just added a little layer of ash on top of the charcoal to make resin burn slower.</li>
      <li>This white ash is very fine and goes airborne quite easily, so be careful while shaking it into your bowl.</li>
      <li>Take your incense burning to a new level.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t stay pure white for long, but incense ash is soft and smooth as well, so it will increase the amount of ash.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I almost made a huge mess as I was distracted while emptying the bag.</li>
      <li>What surprised me is not the fineness of the ash, or the almost mystical way it holds the incense stick, allowing the final combustion to occur at higher temperatures completely consuming the essence of the stick.</li>
      <li>or you can put a layer of ash on top of the white (or black) sand if you like to bury your charcoal in it.</li>
      <li>It consists of pure white volcanic ash finer than flour.  </li>
      <li>It is fluffy and extremely light</li>
      <li>but wow.</li>
      <li>High quality white ash used for Kodo ceremony and incense burning needs.</li>
      <li>i filled up my marble container with white sand half way.</li>
      <li>Even though ash is light, it&#x27;s still small.  </li>
      <li>I ordered 2 because I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to leave the bowl only 2/3s full without room for my eventual error... probably spilling the bowl or some other folly</li>
      <li>am now left with what amounts to a bag of white chalk, and it&#x27;s about as much use to me as a bag of chalk</li>
      <li>So, it is great as a base in an incense burner on which to place a smoldering charcoal disc (tamping it down first with a hefty espresso tamper works really well).</li>
      <li>I gave it a 4/5 rating because first off because after using it the first time i felt that there was some left over resin that got stuck behind in the ash.</li>
      <li>I put the ash into my little incense bowl and the ash is so light the little stick just topples over flinging the ash with it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great to use with the Miyako Sumi incense,</li>
    <li> I love it . It blocks the smell of charcoal when incense is burning. Only can be use few time then replace it. It keep heat absorption to reduce brass burner to get hot.</li>
    <li> As expected, prompt delivery, will buy again</li>
    <li> I really didnt know what this was for, but I bought it anyway. It is actually a very useful in the incense burning process. The only problem I have with it, is that it isn&#x27;t enough and the price is kind of high.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it am i doing something wrong?  I put the ash into my little incense bowl and the ash is so light the little stick just topples over flinging the ash with it.  so then I tried filling up my bowl all the way to the top to see if it would make any difference and no it doesn&#x27;t.  Useless for sticks.</li>
    <li> The ash is great and is exactly as described for incense burning. The problem is the picture makes you think you&#x27;re getting a nice sized bag but it&#x27;s actually a very small bag. Probably just an ounce or two of ash. If you purchase this please make sure you order enough.</li>
    <li> This is a bit of a specialty item as it is used in incense pots to hold stick incense upright, in our house before a Buddhist shrine.  It consists of pure white volcanic ash finer than flour.  Rub it between your fingers and you can feel no grit whatsoever.  It is fluffy and extremely light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the illustration, I thought I would receive quite a large bag but it actually is very small.  Our incense bowl is 4\\&quot; diameter, 4\\&quot; high and I needed five bags to fill it.  And fill it you must because the ash is so fine that the sticks will fall over if there is only an inch or so in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left to my own devices, I probably would have filled the bowl with clean white sand but my significant other is Taiwanese and convinced me that this ash is the correct material to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....if you need this rare item you can buy it with confidence.  Just remember to buy more than you think you&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> What surprised me is not the fineness of the ash, or the almost mystical way it holds the incense stick, allowing the final combustion to occur at higher temperatures completely consuming the essence of the stick. No, this ash has the same qualities of the famed Vibhuti from Hindu temples.  Incense burned in this ash becomes a gateway into which one casts away earthly desires and wraps one in maya.  This is not just ash, it is THE ash of Kama, the god of desire, who was burned by Shiva rather than be turned from the divine truth.    Change your life...  Buy this ash.  Become the prevarication.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for the amount you get. I would not buy this again as it&#x27;s a teeny tiny package for a big price.</li>
    <li> very fine, clean ash.</li>
    <li> i found a way to stretch the ash. i filled up my marble container with white sand half way. then i just added a little layer of ash on top of the charcoal to make resin burn slower. or you can put a layer of ash on top of the white (or black) sand if you like to bury your charcoal in it. P.S.this ash is very fine and light, so if you blow on your charcoal, the ash will fly all over</li>
    <li> Works as suppose to,(for use with incense and resins) and while the quantity is small, it is very compact. Good amount for price, keeps the containers from getting too hot. holds in heat and allows incense. especially resins to burn cleaner without the added smell of charcoal.</li>
    <li> High quality white ash with no traces of black ash. Was as advertised. I would recommend this product and plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Very fine white ash, perfect for incense.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a small amount from the reviews here, but WOW! I opened this and started pouring it into my bowl, and it filled up before the bag was even half-empty. I was amazed that such a small bag could hold so much ash. This is VERY soft and delicate ash. If you want a soft, smooth way to burn your incense on charcoal, nestle it in the ash once it&#x27;s heated, then put some ash on top. Add your incense. This will release less smoke and will smell even better. You won&#x27;t get that nasty charred smell you sometimes get using brass censers without ash or using sand. This is a high quality product, very very worth purchasing if you like incense at all. Even if you don&#x27;t burn resin, this is great to burn your coils, sticks, cones, etc in. When the ashes from the incense fall, just mix it in with this ash. It won&#x27;t stay pure white for long, but incense ash is soft and smooth as well, so it will increase the amount of ash. You could also use a small spoon and remove it if the grey incense ash bothers you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t personally say how well the ash works compared to any other white ash because this seems like this one is the only one sold on amazon. The package well... IT&#x27;S TINY!! Its smaller and about the same thickness of an iphone. I do not understand why it&#x27;s so expensive. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a large amount because of the bad reviews already left but wow.</li>
    <li> this is my first experience using ash and charcoal tablets to burn loose items such as herbs and dried plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this ash keeps the charcoal raised up so the air can circulate around it and burn evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after burning, i sift this ash through a strainer and re-use it. very easy. very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product, i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I will recommend it</li>
    <li> Will try to look for replacement.</li>
    <li> Works great in the bottom of my incense burners and I was surprised that a little goes a long way.  I will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is ash. Ash doesn&#x27;t burn, it has already been burned. Ash is as close to weightless as any matter gets (think feathers). Ash is as fine as any perceptible solid gets (think talc powder). So, it is great as a base in an incense burner on which to place a smoldering charcoal disc (tamping it down first with a hefty espresso tamper works really well). However it will never support an incense stick, period. For that, use sand or a dedicated stick holder. As for the amount you get, this stuff is so light that 1.7 ounces is pretty generous and keep in mind that the price includes shipping. Nothing is free.</li>
    <li> Lovely white soft powder. No extra particles.  Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> This ash is very fine and makes my incense burn cooler and longer. Very nice, easy to get everywhere though.</li>
    <li> I am glad I ordered this because now my herbs burn nice and slow.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4/5 rating because first off because after using it the first time i felt that there was some left over resin that got stuck behind in the ash. Like, I&#x27;ll burn my Samhain mix and some of the resin got left behind in it and it was had to fish it all out. I&#x27;m assuming after you&#x27;re done using your incense burner you&#x27;re supposed to take out the charcoal disc with resin and disposal of it properly. I just dunked it in a jar of water to extinguish it. I fell like some of the resin oil got left behind and when ever i go to use my burner, or censure, it starts to mix all the aromas together both the past and the new. Now its some what bothersome if you&#x27;re trying to entice certain deities or set the mood for your spell work, but i think its also a good way of remembering your past times using it. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to disposal of it, the charcoal and resin, after I&#x27;m done so like I mentioned dunking the disc in a jar of water is what i do. I first decided to buy this Ash for incense burning was thanks to krazyboytx from youtube form one of his videos about incense burning.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the way this ash burned, or rather how it did not burn at all.  Four of us tried everything we could think of to get it to, but no matter how we spread it, thick or thin, in a bowl or in a little pile, this White Ash does not burn.  It will ignite for an instant and then immediately put itself out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now left with what amounts to a bag of white chalk, and it&#x27;s about as much use to me as a bag of chalk would be.  Maybe I can spread it around as Christmas snow when I decorate this year.</li>
    <li> Looking for an authentic and quality ash product? Ok, buy it. But... you MAY need two. In all fairness to the seller they did include the 1.7 oz. bag description with instructions that it would fill an incense bowl about 2/3 of the way. And... that was delivered. I ordered 2 because I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to leave the bowl only 2/3s full without room for my eventual error... probably spilling the bowl or some other folly I will likely succumb myself to by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ash is very fine and used in more traditional incense burning. The benefit of using this ash is that it allows you cover incense charcoal while burning resin. That gives you more control over the amount of smoke produced from the resin. This is a must if used indoors or you risk fumigating the house and yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not run into the issue of holding up incense sticks as mentioned by another buyer. I could see this being an issue if you use a shallow bowl because it is so fine and light. This could be remedied by a heavier bowl or one that includes a mesh top that would allow for a more controlled adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a tad high which reflects my rating of 4/5 stars but this is a hard to find quality product. Go for it.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I first opened my box. I thought the bag of ash was way to small for the price I paid for it. However, when I put the ash into the incense bowl it filled it about 2/3 of the way. I was very surprised and pleased. I think the amount of ash in the bag will be enough. I just wish there was a better product description so that I was prepared for the size of the bag.</li>
    <li> Great ash. Very very fine powder.</li>
    <li> This is a good base for incense burners that are using charcoal or even sticks. Just pay attention to the fact that this is a 1.7 oz bag. Even though ash is light, it&#x27;s still small.  I usually just burn incense to make my own ash but this is a good start for insulation.</li>
    <li> I bought a bag of this white ash to fill my bowl (http://www.amazon.com/Wisteria-Bowl-With-Handles-Shoyeido/dp/B001B61J9I/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hi_21) and one bag fit very well. At first I was concerned that I would need two, but once it was all in the bowl it filled it quite nicely. This white ash is very fine and goes airborne quite easily, so be careful while shaking it into your bowl. I almost made a huge mess as I was distracted while emptying the bag.</li>
    <li> Work good at the furneral</li>
    <li> This stuff is good filler for an incense bowl and provides a nice place for a charcoal burner to rest. I usually just mix the ashes of the resin incense and the charcoal into it when I am done, and , having done so, I&#x27;ve been using the same bag for several years. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I usually use rice and this ash is soo soft that the incense just does not stay upright!  I am thinking of mixing this with rice, perhaps?  Very fine, but not functional.  I am a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Use this mixed with Activa Scenic Sand in my incense burner. It works really well, and I would buy again</li>
    <li> It works good but the bags are small like it reads on other reviews you better of ordering 2 or more. The bag it is smaller than a dollar bill so you might have to be careful how you use it. I could have given it 5 stars but the price is a little high.</li>
    <li> Its a great product i bought two bags because i always think more the better and i am glad i did!</li>
    <li> Glad to have it without having to drive all over. Short on time currently.</li>
    <li> The ash works very well as the filler for a small charcoal burner.  I was able to fill my burner and still have enough to refill it if needed.</li>
    <li> High quality white ash used for Kodo ceremony and incense burning needs. A must have for incense lovers. Take your incense burning to a new level.</li>
    <li> $6.00 for a little tiney bag half the size of a childs fist.  I expected a liter or so for the price.  good for 10-15 uses.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described burns clean no bad after cent lets the coal to breath if your into burning resin this is what you need sand and dirt give off a bad oder that taints your resin and won&#x27;t allow your coal to burn well</li>
    <li> This is a fine white powder ash. 1.7 ounces is a small amount and is around a 2/3rds to 3/4ths cup in size. I used this ash with charcoal and incense. The ash quickly became sooty and dirty from the incense. The coal was able to breathe and burn fine in the ash.</li>
    <li> Must have for Kodo burning. Pure and clean. Arrived quickly</li>
