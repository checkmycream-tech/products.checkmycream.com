      <li>Overall, good brushes for the price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping as they gunk up they do a better job, but as someone who likes her brushes clean</li>
      <li>and it was fine.</li>
      <li>These are either a very basic set (still 10x better quality than anything you would find in a drug store but cheaper than department store cosmetics) from this brand or a pretty good knock off!</li>
      <li>Better than expected, great for the cost.</li>
      <li>They do not feel cheap at all.</li>
      <li>Just OK, brushes handle seem to be good quality, can&#x27;t say the same for anything else</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow brushes are great and the flat foundation brush too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She use them from a lots of month, but they&#x27;re looking always soft and like first day.&lt;br /&gt;For sure good price and quality.</li>
      <li>I needed a new set of brushes within a specific price range/ time frame and these were PERFECT!</li>
      <li>Love these brushes, they are so soft and easy to use...and to clean!</li>
      <li>Very soft, I just wish they had the kind of brush on the side like they do in the picture.</li>
      <li>I love them so much.</li>
      <li>I guess I got lucky :</li>
      <li>Definitely higher quality than what I was expecting!</li>
      <li>These brushes arrived fast with amazon prime!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of a gross thing to hope for.</li>
      <li>Some brushes were duplicates, two were frayed but overall nice set.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft, easy to clean, hold powders well, but also drop off excess product when I tap the brush.  </li>
      <li>The brushes are soft and very full.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Exactly  </li>
      <li>I did notice the paint scent from the pleather travel case several people mentioned but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and disappeared once I let the bag air out.</li>
      <li>Exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>The only issue I have with this brush set is that it would definitely feel more complete with a domed crease brush thrown in, that&#x27;s all! :)</li>
      <li>The brushes are super soft and well made.</li>
      <li>it was a fast delivery..</li>
      <li>I was looking for nice present for my girlfriend, that is starting to learn how make-up lady, but I found very expencive prices in professional normal shop.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Different firmness for different brushes but overall they are pretty soft and feel good on my face.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
      <li>, when you open it  there will be like a funny smell but it will desapere within one hour...</li>
      <li>These brushes are sooooooo soft!</li>
      <li>Brushes are well made and seem to be pretty solid</li>
      <li>I use all the big brushes that most since I don&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow everyday....</li>
      <li>The brushes were super soft to the touch, found just one loose hair on the fan brush but no biggy.</li>
      <li>it is soooo professional looking</li>
      <li>They Are Soft, &amp; All Are Marked</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to find out</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t shed and they&#x27;re soft.</li>
      <li>I did google the brand written on the handles (Make Up Forever) and found the brand to be recommended among professional makeup artists and retailing around $35.00 a brush.</li>
      <li>So soft and usefull it has almost all the brush you need</li>
      <li>Nothing wrong either loved how soft they feel</li>
      <li>but love using the small brushes to help with highlighting and contouring!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll have to come back and update my review but overall first inpressions: The quality and quantity far exceeds the price.</li>
      <li>I have been dying for a set of brushes but the retail cost is just too high; I was reluctant to order because of the price, I am big on quality.</li>
      <li>The bristles do not come out onto the face, a problem I have experienced with the very expensive Bare Escentuals (Bare Minerals) brushes.</li>
      <li>I also tried yanking the tops off of the brush handles just to test their durability, they seemed to be glued on pretty firmly</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Beautiful brushes that are soft and builds great color. I would suggest this to anyone looking for an upgrade but not wanting to spend a bunch of money.</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT! Excellent quality and presentation. Loved that every pencil have its name.</li>
    <li> Perfect size. Nothing wrong either loved how soft they feel</li>
    <li> Better than expected, great for the cost.</li>
    <li> the are still in one piece after several months of usage.</li>
    <li> These brushes are okay. If you are just getting starter brushes, then these will do. The bristles are very soft. One of the brushes are received had excess glue which was stuck on the handle. A couple of the brushes were also a little frayed. I think a couple of the brushes were also mislabeled, not that I mind because I probably will be using each as I please. 2 of the brushes were also the same, I&#x27;m not sure if it was supposed to be like that or not. Overall, good brushes for the price! I haven&#x27;t used them yet, so I will update when I get around to using them.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Just perfect !</li>
    <li> I love this brush set it is soooo professional looking</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Very soft, I just wish they had the kind of brush on the side like they do in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they are so soft and easy to use...and to clean! I use all the big brushes that most since I don&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow everyday....but love using the small brushes to help with highlighting and contouring! Would definitely get them again if needed to in the future!</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture. Great deal. Nice brushes. Love how they are labeled.</li>
    <li> Got it today.. n its perfect.. bristles r soft..cnt wait to try.. n it was a fast delivery..thank u..</li>
    <li> Just OK, brushes handle seem to be good quality, can&#x27;t say the same for anything else</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for christmas! I love it so i know she will! Brushes are well made and seem to be pretty solid</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon! The brushes are super soft and well made. I used them for my Halloween makeup and they worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love them  !!!!👌🏼👌🏼</li>

    <li> Great brushes and a lot of them for a good price. Haven&#x27;t yet had any problems with hairs falling out.</li>
    <li> Great. They feel like they are expensive quality. I love them so much.</li>
    <li> Very nice set. A wide variety of brushes to use. No hair comes out of the brushes when applying makeup. Nice holder to keep them all organized.</li>
    <li> Seriously Love These Brushes! They Are Soft, &amp; All Are Marked Exactly  What They&#x27;re  For. So Great For Beginners.</li>
    <li> I will give a 5. So soft and usefull it has almost all the brush you need, when you open it  there will be like a funny smell but it will desapere within one hour...excelente for the price</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Definitely higher quality than what I was expecting!

I also tried yanking the tops off of the brush handles just to test their durability, they seemed to be glued on pretty firmly so I&#x27;m not sure why people were complaining about that? I guess I got lucky :P. I have not used them to apply make-up at this point so I&#x27;ll have to come back and update my review but overall first inpressions: The quality and quantity far exceeds the price. The only issue I have with this brush set is that it would definitely feel more complete with a domed crease brush thrown in, that&#x27;s all! :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are better quality than I hoped for at the price I paid.  The handles are sturdy.  The bristles are soft, easy to clean, hold powders well, but also drop off excess product when I tap the brush.  The bristles stay in the handles, too, instead of coming off on my face.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like or use the roll-up case the brushes come in, but I do.  It&#x27;s a handy way to store the brushes, and it makes the set look really impressive when I open it up.  Each of the brushes has its name or function on it so I can find what I&#x27;m looking for even if I don&#x27;t know what each brush is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really great set - versatile, fun and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great set, amazing quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Some brushes were duplicates, two were frayed but overall nice set.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t shed and they&#x27;re soft. But they are not dense enough to pick up color and deposit product onto the skin. I end up using three times as much makeup as before, with not a lot of payoff; it&#x27;s really frustrating. I&#x27;m hoping as they gunk up they do a better job, but as someone who likes her brushes clean it&#x27;s kind of a gross thing to hope for.</li>
    <li> I was looking for nice present for my girlfriend, that is starting to learn how make-up lady, but I found very expencive prices in professional normal shop.&lt;br /&gt;Lucky that I found wonderful price for this kit selt from XCSource on website.&lt;br /&gt;Good time of delivery and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful design, useful to keep in bag, and my girlfriend was very happy to received them.&lt;br /&gt;She use them from a lots of month, but they&#x27;re looking always soft and like first day.&lt;br /&gt;For sure good price and quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooooooo soft!</li>
    <li> I do like these brushes. There is minimal shedding. You need to wash them to get rid of the smell. The eyeshadow brushes are great and the flat foundation brush too. But I do think  the blush and contour brush need to be thicker. the length of the bristles could be shorter to achieve that. Have ordered brushes with that description for now. Hope XCSOURSE makes the change to these brushes though!</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived fast with amazon prime!! Literally the very next day...sunday delivery too! I have been dying for a set of brushes but the retail cost is just too high; I was reluctant to order because of the price, I am big on quality. I am not a makeup artist but rather someone who learns from youtube tutorials and how to&#x27;s. These brushes are well constructed. They do not feel cheap at all. Different firmness for different brushes but overall they are pretty soft and feel good on my face. The bristles do not come out onto the face, a problem I have experienced with the very expensive Bare Escentuals (Bare Minerals) brushes. Each brush comes inside the case protected in plastic wrap with some brushes including additional protective covers to store your brushes in and retain their shape. I love the eye liner brushes and eyeshadow brushes. I did google the brand written on the handles (Make Up Forever) and found the brand to be recommended among professional makeup artists and retailing around $35.00 a brush. These are either a very basic set (still 10x better quality than anything you would find in a drug store but cheaper than department store cosmetics) from this brand or a pretty good knock off! Either way I am happy with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to begin playing with different looks; so far very happy and excited about my purchase!</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful! They came quickly and nicely packaged. The brushes are soft and very full. The pouch smelled slightly of sharpie but thats okay i just let it air out and it was fine. Each brush had a plastic protector over the top and they looked perfect. Ive washed them a few times and only a few bristles have came out. These are wonderful brushes and i would recommend them to anyone!</li>
