      <li>and this helped me get the look of much more hair.  </li>
      <li>(In order to have 11 more words, I&#x27;ll use these now.</li>
      <li>I also have Pureology&#x27;s Levitation Mist, which works much better for my hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased that I was able to find it here and not have to go to a salon</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I had used this product before with outstanding results.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair but using this amplifier makes my hair feel and look nice and full.</li>
      <li>and I have tried many, many products and get fabulous results from Pureology products.  </li>
      <li>For fine hair, I have not found any product that works better than this for doubling the look of hair volume.</li>
      <li>I have very fine short hair, and it works great.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive this product as I love Pureology products.</li>
      <li>but the other products are simply great!!!!</li>
      <li>You have to play around with the correct amount to use for the effect you are desiring but that is easy to do.  </li>
      <li>This volumized my fine hair with out stickiness.</li>
      <li>Searched forever for a product that would give my baby fine hair volume without drying my hair out.</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine and colored hair</li>
      <li>Love this product and is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Love that it protects my color and gives my hair so much body.  </li>
      <li>It is a quick learning curve.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product for sure.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Either way, it is great ~ and with LIMP hair, I try everything.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that I use everyday to help give my hair some volume.</li>
      <li>Love the brand and expected more from this product...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Pureology products, such as their mousse, but this one is the best for me.</li>
      <li>product gives my hair just the right amount of volume.</li>
      <li>The Pureology volumizer gives just the right poof to frame my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works well, my straight hair curls better, but I still have a lot of static in this Michigan dry winter.</li>
      <li>I could not live without this product, as I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it but not always available at salons that carry the line.  </li>
      <li>But I am happy that at least I get those 8 hours after I freshly wash my hair.</li>
      <li>Brazilian Treatment makes my hair silky, smooth, shiny -- but with my fine hair -- extremely flat to my head.</li>
      <li>The seller took the opened bottle, put a piece of tape on the top to keep it from popping open and shipped it.  </li>
      <li>I am a loyal user of Pureology shampoos and conditioners, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this particular product.</li>
      <li>I have long hair that is think but very fine and prone to oiliness.</li>
      <li>Give it a try but remember don&#x27;t use too much or you won&#x27;t get the right results.</li>
      <li>This product, no matter whether I used a pea-sized or dime-sized amount, made my hair more flat and greasy after about 4 hours.</li>
      <li>Definitely not the right product choice if you have fine hair.</li>
      <li>The amplifier makes my fine hair feel sticky and coarse when first applied and that feeling doesn&#x27;t change while blow drying.  </li>
      <li>Well... I love the shampoo and conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and my scalp is not dry anymore!!</li>
      <li>I bought this since I have really fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have much body generally</li>
      <li>I have a short, layered cut to give baby fine hair some boost and wanted a product that maintained lift and shine to the hair after blowdrying.</li>
      <li>The cost a little more but the results are worth every penny.</li>
      <li>but I am sooo much happier and my hair care is cut to a fraction of the time -- and</li>
      <li>would much rather recommend the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I have it cut in a mod bob that is just below the chin with lots and lots of texture.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like it</li>
      <li>Really wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I have very thin, fine hair and thought that the pureology products were a good idea.</li>
      <li>Pureology products in general do a super job.  </li>
      <li>Love the product, BUT it came postage due $1.07 when I am a Prime Member?</li>
      <li>Pureology blow dry amplifier is a liquid that has a great control without being sticky or heavy.</li>
      <li>but I think I will go back to my tried and true Redken BodyFull line.</li>
      <li>Less is more in this situation.</li>
      <li>Excellent product (she says) and difficult to find locally.</li>
      <li>Over time as the treatment wears off, I get a little more body.</li>
      <li>and though I have smooth skin and hardly a wrinkle, looking 10 or more years younger than I am -- I am also \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with teen-age break-outs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of good reviews on here and a couple other sites that sell this product, but so far, haven&#x27;t seen the results I expected.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel-like formula</li>
      <li>I get so much volume out of my hair with moderate effort.  </li>
      <li>It really puts volume into my hair which lasts until my next shampoo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possible I rush doing my hair in the morning and haven&#x27;t really taken the time to use this product like it&#x27;s supposed to be used.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair dry and very flyaway.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I have found that it leaves my hair very dry and full of static.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am not able to use most mousse products and other volumizing products -- they make my face break out.</li>
      <li>I like to amp up the volume and then get a Meg Ryan messy look (a little more refined though).</li>
      <li>It did not add volume to my fine, limp hair, and I think it may actually have weighed it down.  </li>
      <li>I have really thin fine hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair. This is a great product that I use everyday to help give my hair some volume. Use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> No more fine, limp, flat hair for moi since I found this stuff. Love that it protects my color and gives my hair so much body.  Ive used gazillions of hair thickeners that have all broken out the skin around my face and back of neck - basically wherever my hair would touch- but not this one. I&#x27;m thrilled to find that they do not test their product on animals either - thank you Redken!!</li>
    <li> This line of Pureology products is the best ever. The cost a little more but the results are worth every penny. This volumized my fine hair with out stickiness. Gives a great fullness.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before with outstanding results. I have very fine hair but using this amplifier makes my hair feel and look nice and full. I ordered it expecting it to be the same as I had used before which was a spray, this one is a liquid that you pour a little in your hand and work through wet hair. Works just as well!  I am pleased that I was able to find it here and not have to go to a salon</li>
    <li> Love the brand and expected more from this product...oh well, guess that is why it was on sale real cheap.  The amplifier makes my fine hair feel sticky and coarse when first applied and that feeling doesn&#x27;t change while blow drying.  I have a short, layered cut to give baby fine hair some boost and wanted a product that maintained lift and shine to the hair after blowdrying. Definitely not the right product choice if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Well... I love the shampoo and conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and my scalp is not dry anymore!! BUT the Blow Dry Amplifier is simply destroying the work of my shampoo and conditioner! It makes my hair sticky and dry... so I can not give it any stars even though I had to give one but the other products are simply great!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair and I love it.  I&#x27;ve tried other Pureology products, such as their mousse, but this one is the best for me.</li>
    <li> My face breaks out with everything. I have naturally curly hair and I do a Brazilian Blow-out (Keratin) treatment to remove the curls (yes -- the one with formaldehyde -- the others just do not work as well -- I did a cost benefit analysis -- yes I risk my health a bit but I am sooo much happier and my hair care is cut to a fraction of the time -- and no stress about rain or humidity).&lt;br /&gt;The Brazilian Treatment makes my hair silky, smooth, shiny -- but with my fine hair -- extremely flat to my head. Over time as the treatment wears off, I get a little more body. But in the interim -- and it is a long interim -- I&#x27;ve been looking for something to put volume in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not able to use most mousse products and other volumizing products -- they make my face break out. I am almost 64 and though I have smooth skin and hardly a wrinkle, looking 10 or more years younger than I am -- I am also \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with teen-age break-outs. (I didn&#x27;t have them as a teen-ager --only started when I was past 30.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gives my hair just the right amount of volume. I wear my hair long -- about an inch or so below my shoulders. The Pureology volumizer gives just the right poof to frame my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - it lasts about 8 hours. Than my hair starts to flatten. Turning my head over and blow drying the poof back in doesn&#x27;t work. Another commentator here says use the product every day. I haven&#x27;t tried that but I am thinking about it. I am a little worried that excessive amounts will start the break-outs again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I find a system that works -- I will report back here. But I am happy that at least I get those 8 hours after I freshly wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal user of Pureology shampoos and conditioners, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this particular product. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of good reviews on here and a couple other sites that sell this product, but so far, haven&#x27;t seen the results I expected.  It&#x27;s possible I rush doing my hair in the morning and haven&#x27;t really taken the time to use this product like it&#x27;s supposed to be used.  So far, I&#x27;m disappointed, but will keep trying and will continue to buy other products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife but actually I use it now to. The shampoo lathers easily and seems good for every day use.Will defintely buy it again.Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get some volume using this, but alas, nothing. I have average hair, not too thick and not fine. I&#x27;ve always had to tease my hair to get volume and was hoping that this would help give me some volume without teasing. The result after blowdrying my hair with this product is the same flatness I get as when I don&#x27;t use any product. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Hated it.  It did not add volume to my fine, limp hair, and I think it may actually have weighed it down.  I also have Pureology&#x27;s Levitation Mist, which works much better for my hair.</li>
    <li> This works great to use with my hair blower/air brush as I can control my hair better while styling.  You only need a small amount depending on how long your hair is. It works for me!  Try it to see if it works for you!  I use the shampoo, conditioner also.</li>
    <li> I got this because I LOVE Pureology&#x27;s root lift spray. I decided to try another of their volumizing products. What a mistake this one is, though! I have long hair that is think but very fine and prone to oiliness. This product, no matter whether I used a pea-sized or dime-sized amount, made my hair more flat and greasy after about 4 hours. I used in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Yes, it makes my hair look fuller, but at the expense of it looking dry &amp; fried! Even though I used a small amount, it leaves a gummy feeling on my hair. My hair looks 100 times better when I DO NOT use this product!</li>
    <li> For my baby fine, thinning hair this product is great!  You have to play around with the correct amount to use for the effect you are desiring but that is easy to do.  It is a quick learning curve.  It leaves my hair fuller and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and thought that the pureology products were a good idea. Unfortunately, I have found that it leaves my hair very dry and full of static.  Sorry, but I think I will go back to my tried and true Redken BodyFull line.</li>
    <li> I use the Pureology Serious Colour Pure Volume Shampoo and Blowdry Amplifier together.  I get so much volume out of my hair with moderate effort.  I love this product line!  I like the smell it reminds me a little of Aveda.  I think the blowdry amplified gives me a little shine and also helps prevent blowdry damage.  I am a fan!    A little about me:  my hair has a little bend but is mostly thick yet fine in texture.  I have it cut in a mod bob that is just below the chin with lots and lots of texture.  I like to amp up the volume and then get a Meg Ryan messy look (a little more refined though).</li>
    <li> Gave this product five stars because it gives my hair the longest holding set of any similar product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This is great for adding body to fine hair, like mine.  Seems this brand is not being handled anymore from my SALON, and also TARGET.  Miss it, and now hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it is great ~ and with LIMP hair, I try everything.</li>
    <li> I bought this since I have really fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have much body generally and I had heard that the Purology Volume Shampoo worked well (but didn&#x27;t want to use it since I&#x27;m not a fan of their shampoo), so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot instead. Really wish I hadn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a clear gel-like formula and I don&#x27;t feel like it adds any extra volume or lift- even with blow drying with a round brush. It leaves my hair with a weird product-feeling and I really don&#x27;t like it overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would much rather recommend the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; spray in after shower one, Chi hair protectant oil, or even Bumble and Bumble blow dry cream.</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine, thinning hair.  This product was introduced to me two years ago by my hairdresser.  I only use about a dime-size dab in my hand, distribute it through my damp hair, and blow dry.  It really puts volume into my hair which lasts until my next shampoo.</li>
    <li> Searched forever for a product that would give my baby fine hair volume without drying my hair out. You don&#x27;t need much...about the size of a penny and scrunch into the hair. A little goes a long way. But boy what results. No dry straw hair like other products and the volume stays all day. My hair stays touchable all day too. Give it a try but remember don&#x27;t use too much or you won&#x27;t get the right results. Less is more in this situation.</li>
    <li> Love it....have used it for years and it works awesome for fine hair.....it just makes your hair do what you want it to do..</li>
    <li> Excellent product (she says) and difficult to find locally. (In order to have 11 more words, I&#x27;ll use these now. Whatever happened to succinct?)</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair that is usually difficult to work with, but this product does wonders to make my hair much more manageable. I could not live without this product, as I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product as I love Pureology products.I was very disappointed when they quit making the volumizing product I&#x27;ve been using for some time but decided to give this one a try.It makes my hair dry and very flyaway.I don&#x27;t have any problem with static electricity when I don&#x27;t use it so it&#x27;s not just the weather.Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It works well, my straight hair curls better, but I still have a lot of static in this Michigan dry winter.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it does what it says and it smells good, so I a, satisfied with this product. Only thing is that its sticky</li>
    <li> The supplier that sent me this product put something else in the bottle.  I have been using this amplifier lotion for a long time, and know how it smells!!  The product I received was something else.  I won&#x27;t buy this online again.</li>
    <li> This product adds nice body to the hair without interferring with the hair&#x27;s color or shine.  Pureology products in general do a super job.  This is just one more great product from this company.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it but not always available at salons that carry the line.  Happy you are there for me!</li>
    <li> Pureology blow dry amplifier is a liquid that has a great control without being sticky or heavy. I have very fine short hair, and it works great. Used like a gel after washing.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. I have to go out and buy it regularly. she says it is the best stuff for her hair she has found and money is not in the equation.</li>
    <li> Great hair product for fine hair!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair.  This helps give it some&lt;br /&gt;body.  Sometimes, I use a root lift in addition.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Works well and makes hair look awesome!  Would highly recommend this product for sure.  Beach spritz look.  Makes me think of summer.</li>
    <li> Love this product and is worth the price.  boosts my blond hair with blowdrying and keeps it&#x27;s volume for the rest of the day.  You barely need to use any, so this bottle lasts and extraordinarily long time.</li>
    <li> I have really thin fine hair and this helped me get the look of much more hair.  I love it</li>
    <li> I have fine and colored hair and I have tried many, many products and get fabulous results from Pureology products.  Yes it is expensive but you only use a small amount and it will last a very long time.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Sadly, this is my second purchase on Amazon for a Reflexology product that I got burned on.  This product is not only a knock off, but the seller does not take care or pride in their shipment.  Half the product was all over the envelope it was shipped in.  The seller took the opened bottle, put a piece of tape on the top to keep it from popping open and shipped it.  But they never accounted for the fact that the entire cap screws on.  So it came unscrewed and as I said, all the product is all over the place.  Don&#x27;t waste your money here with this product.</li>
    <li> The wife likes it and she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it, so I say it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> My hair is typically flat and this works to give it a llittle extra help.</li>
    <li> Love the product, BUT it came postage due $1.07 when I am a Prime Member?</li>
    <li> For fine hair, I have not found any product that works better than this for doubling the look of hair volume.</li>
