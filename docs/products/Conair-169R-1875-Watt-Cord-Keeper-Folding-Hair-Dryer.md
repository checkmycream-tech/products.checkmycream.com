      <li>I will update my review if they do the right thing.</li>
      <li>I am purchasing a different brand today and hope their mechanism for retracting the cord is better.</li>
      <li>space.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer part works pretty well</li>
      <li>; evidently that is not going to happen.  </li>
      <li>and this is the first one I&#x27;ve had a problem with.</li>
      <li>and when I straighten it, I need the heat setting to be hot.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I did think it was louder (or higher pitched) than I was used to.</li>
      <li>First, I want to say that I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a year now.  </li>
      <li>my hair has neither fried nor head seemed too hot.  </li>
      <li>First, the dryer&#x27;s heat is way too hot.  </li>
      <li>At first, the dryer was working well.  </li>
      <li>I always use it on the hot setting and</li>
      <li>following is added on April 10, 2013 (amazingly, exactly two years to the day of the original review!)</li>
      <li>The cord keeper was a nice add-on that I wasn&#x27;t looking for, but after using it for some time, I liked the fact that the cord has not become a twisted tangle of cord.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an extremely loud hiss that sounds like an industrial factory operating at full capacity, inches from your ear.</li>
      <li>but I normally just use the high and cool button, and yes it makes a lot of noise</li>
      <li>and i love that the cord retracted and the small size of the hairdryer to fit under my sink.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Excellente product, is really handable</li>
      <li>When searching for a new dryer, one of my first criteria was to find something NOT made in China.  </li>
      <li>The original was purchased several years ago.</li>
      <li>Yes I actually replaced the original one TWO times.</li>
      <li>It dries pretty quickly, and when measured up against those of friends, seems to dry faster than theirs.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight, dries hair pretty fast, folds, practical when traveling, cord goes in when pressing a button, has low and high only</li>
      <li>I mainly leave my hair wavy, but straighten it once in awhile.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just a high pitch, as suggested by one reviewer.</li>
      <li>It disturbs me that AMAZON keeps selling items after they are clearly lemons!!</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews before my purchase, because the critiques about how loud it is are absolutely on the mark.</li>
      <li>It was great and helped me to perform feats with my ridiculously thin hair!  </li>
      <li>The concept of the dryer is great, but the performance is poor!</li>
      <li>So, it baffled me as to why a dryer used probably 10 times would break down so easily.  </li>
      <li>If it fails, I may or may not purchase another like it, although it certainly does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only did the hair dryer come light blue (not pictured), but I had to pay to return it....</li>
      <li>but it is extremely loud!  </li>
      <li>I specifically ordered from this company because I thought they had the old stock color of purple, not the light blue that is the current color.  </li>
      <li>that we have to put up with inferior goods made by corporations willing only to pay slave-labor wages so they can reap excessive profits for the top 1% of the owners...</li>
      <li>It worked the first time on the low setting.  </li>
      <li>first, I disassembled the unit, removed the button, and placed it externally on the rear housing of the dryer - held by tape.  </li>
      <li>Clearly from the picture, the item offered was PURPLE.  </li>
      <li>I was drawn in by idea of a folding handle and retractable cord, but the cord is already failing to retract completely</li>
      <li>The cord didn&#x27;t always retract and the motor burned out completely.</li>
      <li>However, lately I haven&#x27;t been able to push the switch into the \\&quot;High\\&quot; position.</li>
      <li>The cord does not retract very well, you have to shake the dryer to get it to work and the cord is too short.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless you are comfortable disassembling a rather complex device, and then re-assembling it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this modification.  </li>
      <li>Third, the dryer is way too loud.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve only used the dryer about 3 times so far).</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is not quite as loud, but as I explained earlier, the air flow is so wimpy at this setting that you might as well not even bother.</li>
      <li>Further, unlike many other dryers, the cold button allowed full velocity.</li>
      <li>The cord is not very long.</li>
      <li>As far as noise goes, I never used to dry my hair, so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I saw one of these at a hotel and i love that the cord retracted and the small size of the hairdryer to fit under my sink.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately -  3 years into purchase the button to retract the cord broke off. I would probably rebuy it, but will be very careful with the button. . . Drats, now I have to wrap the cord around it. . . .</li>
    <li> I was drawn in by idea of a folding handle and retractable cord, but the cord is already failing to retract completely (I&#x27;ve only used the dryer about 3 times so far). I thought 1875 watts would mean a decent air flow, but it&#x27;s only so-so. I have to keep it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting to get my hair dry within a reasonable amount of time, and my hair isn&#x27;t that thick or long.    However, my biggest complaint is the EARSPLITTING noise! I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews before my purchase, because the critiques about how loud it is are absolutely on the mark. It&#x27;s not just a high pitch, as suggested by one reviewer. It&#x27;s an extremely loud hiss that sounds like an industrial factory operating at full capacity, inches from your ear. The \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is not quite as loud, but as I explained earlier, the air flow is so wimpy at this setting that you might as well not even bother. I&#x27;m going to try and return this thing before I go deaf.</li>
    <li> This is a great little dryer with lots of power.  The cord keeper feature is great for traveling, as well as just storing at home.  A great value too.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer before going abroad for two reasons, dual voltage and it can be folded and takes up very little space.  I was also traveling domestically prior to my departure, so it I thought it would serve my purposes well.  In the US, I love this dryer!  It was great and helped me to perform feats with my ridiculously thin hair!  When I traveled to West Africa this summer, on about the second use it sort of blew up!  Not only that, it took out the electricity of the entire house where I was staying!  It worked the first time on the low setting.  Perhaps that was the better option.  Needless to say, it never functioned again and I had to bury it.  When I returned, I actually bought another.  Next time, I&#x27;ll simply buy a dryer that is compatible with the country where I am traveling.  This is a great dryer, and for the money, you just can&#x27;t beat it!  I love that the cord retracts and that it folds up.  It takes up very little space in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> First, I want to say that I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a year now.  I like it and it&#x27;s still working fine.  I had to modify it, though.  Keep reading...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer was purchased for home use, with occasional travel in mind.  When searching for a new dryer, one of my first criteria was to find something NOT made in China.  Forget that; evidently that is not going to happen.  Next, I wanted a rather compact dryer, but not a mini dryer. Check.  Further, I wanted something which would blow completely cold air.  Check.  A retractable cord and/or folding handle would be nice. Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this dryer knowing it had received some poor reviews.  The most predominant complaint seemed to be the failure rate of the cord retraction system.  Unfortunately, I found this complaint to be correct in my case.  My cord retraction system started failing within a week of initial use.  I am an helicopter mechanic by trade, so I am used to complex machinery - therefor I tore down this dryer to find why the retraction mechanism failed so quickly.  The retraction push button is shaped somewhat like a \\&quot;T,\\&quot; with the top of the \\&quot;T\\&quot; being the part of the button you push on to engage the retraction.  The \\&quot;post\\&quot; of the \\&quot;T\\&quot; is a post, somewhat thicker than a round toothpick, and about an inch long.  The part is plastic. This post contacts a (steel) release in the ratchet mechanism that, when pushed, releases the ratchet and allows the spring to retract the cord.  The \\&quot;post\\&quot; part of the \\&quot;T\\&quot; is too long.  When in use, the post quickly bends, taking a \\&quot;set,\\&quot; and staying bent.  Once the post is bent, the ratchet cannot be disengaged. This is the flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I disassembled the unit, removed the button, and placed it externally on the rear housing of the dryer - held by tape.  This effectively shortened the length of the \\&quot;post.\\&quot;  Later, when I had time, I disassembled the dryer again and trimmed a little over 1/8 inch from the post ...I may have taken off 3/16 inch, butno more.  I assembled the dryer with the button in its original position. It has worked fine ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are comfortable disassembling a rather complex device, and then re-assembling it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this modification.  It wasn&#x27;t that hard to do, but the re-assembly is not for the fainthearted.  I do this type of thing in my line of work, so it was okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained that this dryer is too loud.  I don&#x27;t find that to be the case.  Even if it is a mite louder than some other dryers, it moves a ton of air.  Further, unlike many other dryers, the cold button allowed full velocity. This, I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like this dryer.  I doubt it will last 20 years, which is how long my Taiwan-made Clairol dryer lasted.  If it fails, I may or may not purchase another like it, although it certainly does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad that we have to put up with inferior goods made by corporations willing only to pay slave-labor wages so they can reap excessive profits for the top 1% of the owners... Sadder yet is that we as consumers purchase these items.  In the case of hair dryers, it seems we have no choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is added on April 10, 2013 (amazingly, exactly two years to the day of the original review!):  Just wanted to mention that the drier is still going strong. My \\&quot;fix\\&quot; has held, and I am satisfied with the unit.  Frankly, it&#x27;s lasted longer than I expected!</li>
    <li> Actually painful for my ears. I returned it after one use, so can&#x27;t comment on any other features. Back to the drawing board...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Conair blow dryers almost since they were invented (I&#x27;m 63) and this is the first one I&#x27;ve had a problem with. First of all, I did think it was louder (or higher pitched) than I was used to. Cord, folding, etc. works fine. However, lately I haven&#x27;t been able to push the switch into the \\&quot;High\\&quot; position. I thought maybe it had to do with the reset button or something, but no luck. If I still have the receipt, I&#x27;ll try to return it and get something else.</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for over a year and have been pretty happy with it.  The cord works fine for me as does the folding feature for storage.  I always use it on the hot setting and my hair has neither fried nor head seemed too hot.  I use it about 3-4 times a week.  As far as noise goes, I never used to dry my hair, so maybe I forget what a hair dryer noise level is acceptable, but this seems o.k. by me.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of those hair dryers, one for me, one for my daughter. After mine broke (2 months later), I used my daughter&#x27;s and it worked for maybe another 3 months. The cord didn&#x27;t always retract and the motor burned out completely. The concept of the dryer is great, but the performance is poor!</li>
    <li> Of the five items I received from ..., this is the only one that did not live up to expectations. I don&#x27;t think one should have to have an engineering degree to use a hair dryer.  I was unable to get it to work, and even if I could have, it was much to heavy. To sum up, it was quite unsatisfactory.</li>
    <li> At first, the dryer was working well.  Then I started to have many problems.  First, the dryer&#x27;s heat is way too hot.  I have thick, wavy hair and when I straighten it, I need the heat setting to be hot.  But this was so hot that if I left the dryer in one spot a few seconds too long, my hair would fry.  Second, the cord retracted a couple of times and then it never did it again.  (This was one of the reasons why I bought the dryer).  Third, the dryer is way too loud.  Finally and worst of all, when I first bought the dryer it would always shut down after a few minutes, but then it finally died (in the middle of straightening my hair) and will not work again!  The thing is I used the dryer about once a week.  I mainly leave my hair wavy, but straighten it once in awhile.  So, it baffled me as to why a dryer used probably 10 times would break down so easily.  I bought the dryer 2 1/2 months ago and didn&#x27;t keep the receipt or the box.  If you buy this piece of junk, then I would suggest keeping the box and the receipt because you&#x27;ll need to return it too!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer because my very old conair that I loved, quit working.  I liked the idea of the cord retracting, which is why I bought it.  The cord does not retract very well, you have to shake the dryer to get it to work and the cord is too short.  I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
    <li> I bought this blowdryer a few months ago and all of a sudden it just doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore... this is after the cord retraction feature already broke earlier.  I never dropped it or handled it roughly, so it is quite a mystery.  Please save some money and the environment from more trash, and pass on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how quiet a hair dryer is supposed to be, so if this one is really noisy, then it&#x27;s news to me, and I guess I have never had a quiet one before.  It dries pretty quickly, and when measured up against those of friends, seems to dry faster than theirs.  The cord keeper was a nice add-on that I wasn&#x27;t looking for, but after using it for some time, I liked the fact that the cord has not become a twisted tangle of cord.  The folding handle makes it a bit easier for the traveler to pack it in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is a little heavier than the hair dryers I have used in the past.  It works fine.  The cord is not very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Conair Cord Keeper Folding Hair Dryer for about a year with none of the problems mentioned.  I use it daily.  The cord retracts like it should, it winds up easily, and the motor has never cut out on me.  I like the size and the way it folds up for space saving.  The retractable cord is a nice feature too.  I would recommend this product as mine has been a great little dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for travel.  I have wavy almost curly hair.  Every day I blow dry and flat iron my hair to make it strait.  When I tried this dryer on a trip, I didn&#x27;t need my flat iron!  It is now my primary dryer and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this dryer because she liked the features of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Folding handle for easy packing&lt;br /&gt;*Power cord retractor&lt;br /&gt;*Multiple voltage operation for USA and overseas use&lt;br /&gt;*High power for quick drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thought it would be an ideal dryer to use at home and take with us when we travel because it would be easy to pack and take up less space.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer part works pretty well but it is extremely loud!  You can hear it two rooms away with both doors closed.  The retractable cord mechanism broke and I had to fix it.  This is one of the main features that we purchased it for and it broke so easily that it was a shame.  It seems that this part breaking is quite common among the product owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a working 1875 watt, dual speed hair dryer but with the noise and quality it loses 2 stars.  If I hadn&#x27;t been able to fix the retractor it would have lost 3 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works but we are not totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> Lasted 12.5 years. Purchased on Amazon on Feb 2002.&lt;br /&gt;Still working but the on/off switch is now broken.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this hair dryer. Yes, I like the fact that the cord is hidden, but the dryer is very loud and it seems like the cord mechanism will not last too long. I would not buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer a while ago, and it is alright.  It does take a while to dry my hair, and the cord keeper doesn&#x27;t work unless you feed it in after you untwist it.  It is VERY loud, and every few minutes I have to step out of the bathroom or stick my head out the window because my head is on fire. I would shop around before getting this.</li>
    <li> It disturbs me that AMAZON keeps selling items after they are clearly lemons!!</li>
    <li> Excellente product, is really handable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about 5 years. It just started to heat up on me after so many years. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  It&#x27;s light weight, dries hair pretty fast, folds, practical when traveling, cord goes in when pressing a button, has low and high only but I normally just use the high and cool button, and yes it makes a lot of noise but it does what it is supposed to do. Pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular hair dryer for many reasons, one of which was the color.  Clearly from the picture, the item offered was PURPLE.  I specifically ordered from this company because I thought they had the old stock color of purple, not the light blue that is the current color.  Not only did the hair dryer come light blue (not pictured), but I had to pay to return it....$12.65!  That was 2/3 the cost of the hair dryer.  If the company who sends it doesn&#x27;t have the correct info for ordering, I think I should be reimbursed for the shipping charges.  We&#x27;ll see what they do!  I will update my review if they do the right thing.</li>
    <li> Yes I actually replaced the original one TWO times. The original was purchased several years ago. In short order the button to retract the cord broke so it was fussy to make work but I used it for ages. I replaced that one eventually and the second one broke just the same way. Mind you both hair dryers continued to work but it was irritating that that darn button broke AGAIN when the retractable cord was the reason for purchasing this model. Anyway bought a THIRD one and guess what? No...actually this time, although the button isn&#x27;t broken yet, the cord will NOT RETRACT all the way so I give up with Conair. I am purchasing a different brand today and hope their mechanism for retracting the cord is better.</li>
    <li> Finally.  A blow dryer with a cord that does not hang in the sink or drag water all over the place.</li>
