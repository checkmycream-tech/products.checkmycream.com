      <li>The best brush-styler-dryer I have tried!</li>
      <li>I am still experimenting with the amount of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or dampness that works best.  </li>
      <li>I hope I&#x27;ll be amending this with the formula that works best for me!</li>
      <li>Works good!</li>
      <li>The barrel switch on the device is great.</li>
      <li>Great for when you are in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Bright color</li>
      <li>do a good job styling hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great styling tool and its very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Nice brush size.</li>
      <li>This is a great idea -- to use hot air for curling hair instead of a heated iron.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s very cheaply made with wiggly plastic parts.</li>
      <li>Wish it had more power</li>
      <li>I was eventually able to get my hair out.  </li>
      <li>So ladies if your in the US, and wanna get this, make sure you buy a converter too; not that I could tell you which one.</li>
      <li>This one feels kind of cheap</li>
      <li>I love about this brush</li>
      <li>has a generous size tip on the brush end for gripping and does not get</li>
      <li>My daughter just could not unroll it without having it tangled in her hair despite trying many times.</li>
      <li>Although I loved the fact that it has a cool tip and a tangle free brush that has a curl release switch, I found the product to be a bit flimsy.</li>
      <li>I wanted to be writing a review about this for all mom&#x27;s saying that this was the best time saver tool I&#x27;ve ever bought; I wanted to be saying how easy it was to use and how I&#x27;ll never go back to blow drying and styling after.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the ideal brush-type-styler/dryer that will last more than a year and  still be affordable.</li>
      <li>The most I can hope for is a smooth line with some curve to it.  </li>
      <li>so it is easy to spot.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have problems with tangling, and it did dry my hair on top and put kind of a nice shape in it, but my hair looked sparse and frizzy.</li>
      <li>Feels cheap or flimsy to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>The unit is light weight and it has a curl release button which keeps your hair from getting tangled up in the brush.  </li>
      <li>The length and width of all the outlets in my house won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>The Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Styler is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve used so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  </li>
      <li>I had a hot air brush similar to this one many years ago and loved it.  </li>
      <li>For myself, I think I&#x27;d have better results with a 1/2 to 3/4 inch barrel, but I can&#x27;t be certain</li>
      <li>However if wanting a more intense curl, I&#x27;ll opt for rollers.</li>
      <li>I still need to use the blow dryer to get my hair on the dryer side of damp, but then this hot air styler does the job and is easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>but that is fine since it is not expensive.  </li>
      <li>does not get very hot.  </li>
      <li>It is a great idea but unless there was a way to pull down the spines --- they always get caught</li>
      <li>It definitely needs a converter of some kind.</li>
      <li>I suppose that since it&#x27;s right up by your head with your hair wound around it it wouldn&#x27;t be safe to have it as hot as a normal hair dryer.</li>
      <li>The air is warm not hot, so its safe for all ages to use, plus its really lightweight.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The top half of the brush seems to get more air output than the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On my thick hair the high mode worked the best and the low mode is better for thinner hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light-weight, easy to handle, and does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly be reaching for this styler to curl the ends of my hair and my bangs when damp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s competitor, which I have used for years, has a higher and more powerful drying cycle without sacrificing the same features found on this model.</li>
      <li>Here, after curling up you have to roll this hot air styler backwards.</li>
      <li>I like that the Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Styler is a two in one beauty product.</li>
      <li>This one is a hot air styler not a hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t always turn on the first time.  </li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t the kind of &amp;#34;blowdryer&amp;#34; you get with the newer high-powered ones that dry my hair in  no time.  </li>
      <li>The price was right but the unit is very flimsy and the switch is touchy.  </li>
      <li>in all, I love this blower-curler - so much that it is the only hair appliance I schlep overseas</li>
      <li>Very fast shipment &amp; the price was reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I know I&#x27;ll be using it on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair to achieve a quick stylish look far quicker than my own.</li>
      <li>It has traveled to 3 continents, has accidentally been plugged directly into a 220v socket (smoked), and, after a cool -off, kept going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not heavy in weight and seems to be pretty powerful.</li>
      <li>Just be certain you understand this is not a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>However, on shorter and thinner hair like my daughter has, styling time is much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it is a 1-inch barrel, but there is not too much else</li>
      <li>It locks in place to curl and when pressed again it gently releases the hair.</li>
      <li>Obviously, with a 1&amp;#34; barrel, the curler isn&#x27;t as effective on shorter hair (would like a smaller barrel option, but this may not be doable with a blower), but I can get some curl with the tip of the brush.  </li>
      <li>But for deep curls, a regular curler would work much better.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;one-step&amp;#34; dry and style is a process I want very much to work, so I will keep using it until I find success.  </li>
      <li>it felt really lightweight in my hand, and it took a bit to get used to having the other hand free.</li>
      <li>I would recommend spending a few dollars more and getting a higher-wattage model.</li>
      <li>There is a high and low heat settings, but it just doesn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
      <li>Hard plastic bristles, as opposed to brush-like bristles that cause static and tangling -  3)</li>
      <li>This styler left much to be desired.</li>
      <li>My hair is thick and longer than shoulder length, so even though this product saves me time in drying and curling simultaneously, to achieve a more pronounced curl takes a while.</li>
      <li>To use this product, one needs to dry one&#x27;s hair first and use it as a styler at the end of the drying process.  </li>
      <li>It mainly works well in giving my hair a moderate curl.</li>
      <li>styler has a high and low mode to chose from.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a dryer and round brush when blow drying my hair for years, but getting the top really dry can be a challenge</li>
      <li>My hair is left shiny and soft, not rough and frizzy.  </li>
      <li>As flimsy as I found it, I was surprised that it actually has GFCI plug.</li>
      <li>Typically my hair gets tangled on hot air brushes, but not this one.  </li>
      <li>However, as a dryer it falls far short with very little blowing power and hot air.  </li>
      <li>This Hot Air Styler has the stiff plastic bristles that I prefer when I straighten my hair.</li>

<li> It is not useful as a dryer, especially if you have a lot of hair.  </li>
<li> I have long, thick hair, and this product took a long time to dry my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best brush-styler-dryer I have tried!</li>
    <li> This is an awful product. The hair release doesn&#x27;t work and just leaves a tangled mess. Also, it&#x27;s very cheaply made with wiggly plastic parts. Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s refund policy for items that don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair tool I&#x27;ve ever used. Perhaps mine was faulted, but I used it on two occasions as ( described in the instructions) and both times it caught and tangled itself in my hair. Not the end of the world. Just a waste of money and bad purchase.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviewers.  I followed the directions and my hair got caught in it all tangled up.  I was so annoyed.  Thank goodness I was eventually able to get my hair out.  The curl release did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This styler left much to be desired. Although I loved the fact that it has a cool tip and a tangle free brush that has a curl release switch, I found the product to be a bit flimsy. As flimsy as I found it, I was surprised that it actually has GFCI plug. There is a high and low heat settings, but it just doesn&#x27;t get that hot. I like the size, it is a 1-inch barrel, but there is not too much else I can say that I like about this product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Great for when you are in a hurry.  Wish it had more power so it dries faster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a dryer and round brush when blow drying my hair for years, but getting the top really dry can be a challenge so I was hoping this tool would make it easier. After being so used to the weight of an ac dryer it felt really lightweight in my hand, and it took a bit to get used to having the other hand free. I suppose that since it&#x27;s right up by your head with your hair wound around it it wouldn&#x27;t be safe to have it as hot as a normal hair dryer. I didn&#x27;t have problems with tangling, and it did dry my hair on top and put kind of a nice shape in it, but my hair looked sparse and frizzy. I think part of the problem was that I am used to a 3/4 inch round brush and this barrel was 1 inch. Due to my hair type, length and style I have always had problems styling my hair with a 1 inch round brush. For myself, I think I&#x27;d have better results with a 1/2 to 3/4 inch barrel, but I can&#x27;t be certain it wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy so I don&#x27;t think I can turn in my hair dryer just yet.</li>
    <li> I wanted to be writing a review about this for all mom&#x27;s saying that this was the best time saver tool I&#x27;ve ever bought; I wanted to be saying how easy it was to use and how I&#x27;ll never go back to blow drying and styling after. That is what I hoped would happen, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Not because the product was bad, but because I couldn&#x27;t even plug it into my plugs! The length and width of all the outlets in my house won&#x27;t fit. It definitely needs a converter of some kind. So ladies if your in the US, and wanna get this, make sure you buy a converter too; not that I could tell you which one. I wish I had known beforehand. :(</li>
    <li> Works good! Not heavy in weight and seems to be pretty powerful.</li>
    <li> This Hot Air Styler has the stiff plastic bristles that I prefer when I straighten my hair. Nylon bristles just don&#x27;t do it for my thick, wavy hair.  I still need to use the blow dryer to get my hair on the dryer side of damp, but then this hot air styler does the job and is easy to handle.  My hair is left shiny and soft, not rough and frizzy.  It would work especially well for shoulder-length and shorter hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea -- to use hot air for curling hair instead of a heated iron. It is potentially safer to avoid burning hair. A regular curling iron clamps on and when heating is done you release the clamp. Here, after curling up you have to roll this hot air styler backwards. My daughter just could not unroll it without having it tangled in her hair despite trying many times. It is a great idea but unless there was a way to pull down the spines --- they always get caught</li>
    <li> What I do like:  1) Price -  2) Hard plastic bristles, as opposed to brush-like bristles that cause static and tangling -  3) it comes apart for cleaning  - 4) has a generous size tip on the brush end for gripping and does not get hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:  1) It is not powerful enough to dry rapidly. It&#x27;s competitor, which I have used for years, has a higher and more powerful drying cycle without sacrificing the same features found on this model. The competitor&#x27;s model only lasts a year, however, then has to be replaced. It just stops working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For long-hair users especially, the slow drying cycle on this Vidal-Sassoon will be frustrating. I have short hair and it seems to take too long for me. I would recommend spending a few dollars more and getting a higher-wattage model. I&#x27;m still looking for the ideal brush-type-styler/dryer that will last more than a year and  still be affordable.</li>
    <li> Nice brush size. Two heat settings . Very lightweight, but that not necessarily a good thing. Feels cheap or flimsy to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Does do a good job styling hair.</li>
    <li> I had a hot air brush similar to this one many years ago and loved it.  I have tried numerous brushes and still haven&#x27;t found one like it, until now.  This one is a hot air styler not a hair dryer.  The air is warm not hot, so its safe for all ages to use, plus its really lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this brush is the curl release button.  Typically my hair gets tangled on hot air brushes, but not this one.  The curl release lifts my hair off the bristles and my hair drops easily.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great styling tool and its very easy to use.  Just be certain you understand this is not a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and difficult to style.  The most I can hope for is a smooth line with some curve to it.  This styler works, but it takes a while.  There really isn&#x27;t the kind of &amp;#34;blowdryer&amp;#34; you get with the newer high-powered ones that dry my hair in  no time.  I am still experimenting with the amount of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or dampness that works best.  The &amp;#34;one-step&amp;#34; dry and style is a process I want very much to work, so I will keep using it until I find success.  I hope I&#x27;ll be amending this with the formula that works best for me!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Very fast shipment &amp; the price was reasonable.  KW</li>
    <li> Looking for a blower-curling brush with ball-tip bristles? I searched and searched, but could only find one made by Vidal Sassoon. I purchased that brush about 4 years ago, and have used it daily ever since. It has traveled to 3 continents, has accidentally been plugged directly into a 220v socket (smoked), and, after a cool -off, kept going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vidal Sassoon blower curling brush seems to be a younger sister in a different color. The size is the same. The ball-tip bristles are the same length, and the blow force is identical. The plug is a slightly different shape and the controls are styled differently, but the options are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance is identical too. I use the blower-curler on both damp and dry hair. Obviously, with a 1&amp;#34; barrel, the curler isn&#x27;t as effective on shorter hair (would like a smaller barrel option, but this may not be doable with a blower), but I can get some curl with the tip of the brush.  The top half of the brush seems to get more air output than the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the curl lock feature so cannot comment. My ball-tip bristles (a must according to my hairdresser) seem to hold my hair well enough without this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this blower-curler - so much that it is the only hair appliance I schlep overseas (I am a small suitcase traveler).</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair, and this product took a long time to dry my hair.  Next time I use it, I&#x27;ll either let my hair air dry for longer before using it, or I&#x27;ll use this to finish up drying after using a traditional blow dryer.  That being said, I do like how curly my ends are.</li>
    <li> I like that the Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Styler is a two in one beauty product. It mainly works well in giving my hair a moderate curl. However if wanting a more intense curl, I&#x27;ll opt for rollers. My hair is thick and longer than shoulder length, so even though this product saves me time in drying and curling simultaneously, to achieve a more pronounced curl takes a while. However, on shorter and thinner hair like my daughter has, styling time is much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This styler has a high and low mode to chose from. On my thick hair the high mode worked the best and the low mode is better for thinner hair. The barrel switch on the device is great. It locks in place to curl and when pressed again it gently releases the hair. The brush part features flexible ball-tipped bristles that go through the hair with ease.  Though I always use caution with hair styling tools, I don&#x27;t have to fear getting burned while using this one. It&#x27;s light-weight, easy to handle, and does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly be reaching for this styler to curl the ends of my hair and my bangs when damp. I know I&#x27;ll be using it on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair to achieve a quick stylish look far quicker than my own. Final verdict is that on thick hair, styling time for curls is far longer than using it on thinner hair.</li>
    <li> The price was right but the unit is very flimsy and the switch is touchy.  Doesn&#x27;t always turn on the first time.  I&#x27;ll keep it but wouldn&#x27;t order another one.</li>
    <li> High temperature for thick hair and low temperature for thin hair.  Bright color so it is easy to spot.  Soft tip to prevent stabbing yourself.  The Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Styler is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve used so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  This one feels kind of cheap but that is fine since it is not expensive.  It takes a few minutes to get going, but I have the time.  I find that it does take some coordination, but I usually have that, too.  I like this little creation.</li>
    <li> I already owned this product and was just replacing the one that wore out.</li>
    <li> The dryer is labeled as a hair dryer and styler all in one.  However, as a dryer it falls far short with very little blowing power and hot air.  It is not useful as a dryer, especially if you have a lot of hair.  To use this product, one needs to dry one&#x27;s hair first and use it as a styler at the end of the drying process.  As styler, it works quite well.  The unit is light weight and it has a curl release button which keeps your hair from getting tangled up in the brush.  If you wish to have some extra fluff in your hair, this works well.  But for deep curls, a regular curler would work much better.</li>
    <li> disappointed.  does not get very hot.  volume of air not sufficient.</li>
