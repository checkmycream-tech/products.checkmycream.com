      <li>I LOVE ANYTHING BY TOM FORD</li>
      <li>I bought this as my husband wanted it, but though he loved the perfume, he agreed that paying $90 for a 1.7 Oz is a bit too much.</li>
      <li>This perfume isn&#x27;t for people who like a light or medium scent.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s too heavy for daytime, but perfect for a special date or evening out.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice mature, not overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>Bottomline is that the fragnace stays long so it makes it good because that is what I look forward to when i wear a perfume</li>

      <li>I really like the smell of this parfum.  </li>
      <li>This cologne smells too much like baby powder for my liking.  </li>
      <li>I only spray it on for special occasion&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>The scent actually lasts long, but i would have thought the scent would be a strong one,as it is for men.</li>
      <li>If you like Old Spice stick with that.</li>
      <li>Smells like Old Spice for $80.  </li>
      <li>Packaged well, good value, should last a long time if kept in dark dry place.</li>
      <li>great smell but very expensive</li>

    <li> I smelled this cologne from the Details magazine. Purchased the small bottle, what a mistake. This cologne is one of best cologne I have EVER purchased. I only spray it on for special occasion&#x27;s. Ladie&#x27;s always give me compliments.</li>
    <li> Sexy for a night out - deep, rich florals and a hint of sandalwood (?).  Reminds me of a nightclub in Morocco or Rio.  I think it&#x27;s too heavy for daytime, but perfect for a special date or evening out.  This perfume isn&#x27;t for people who like a light or medium scent.  I think it&#x27;s a great unisex perfume - both my husband and I wear this scent.</li>
    <li> My son enjoys this, It arrived ahead of time, and does have a pleasant scent.  But  I get buy with a less costly after shave</li>
    <li> It is a nice mature, not overpowering scent. A refreshing change for a young man. We recommend giving it a try</li>

It last the hole day and has a fragrance unlike any others.</li>
