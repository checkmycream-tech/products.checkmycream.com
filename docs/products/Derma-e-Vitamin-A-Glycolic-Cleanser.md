      <li>You&#x27;ll realize how amazing it is when you receive compliments on how beautiful you skin is :) :) :)</li>
      <li>But I still give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s really a great face wash that tightens your skin and gets it extremely clean.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results I would find.</li>
      <li>I have used the fragrance free before and loved it.</li>
      <li>it also smells amazing and refreshing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural, exfoliates, controls oil, smells wonderful, and moisturizes!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it works wonderful, leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>The fragrance in this is light, it lathers very nicely, and I notice a huge difference from using it</li>
      <li>Very light</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful, yet mild cleanser for the whole body.  </li>
      <li>This wash evens it out perfectly, keeps my skin clear and helps with fine lines and balancing.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it</li>
      <li>but again I need more in a cleanser.</li>
      <li>I use this wash in combination with the Glycolic toner, and I am acne free!</li>
      <li>Perfect for daily cleansing combination skin.</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get better than that...</li>

      <li>I have had better cleansers......</li>
      <li>Love how it cleans the skin without drying it</li>
      <li>Love this and will buy again and again.</li>
      <li>I have used this cleanser for about 2 months now and love the way the skin on my face feels.</li>
      <li>Glycolic acid increases cell turnover, keeps debris out of your pores, and helps keep your skin moisturized and looking healthy.</li>
      <li>This is the second product that I had used happily for a couple of years and now they&#x27;ve changed it so it is no longer good for all skin types.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>but I wanted to find a way to incorporate Vitamin A as well without having to use too many products.</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Yet another derma e product that was changed AND NOT FOR THE BETTER.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Will purchase again, great product</li>
    <li> This is my go to face wash.</li>
    <li> When this item arrived I was very disappointed. The bottle is not leak-proof and it had a weird funny smell.&lt;br /&gt;But believe me! After using it for a few days, my skin just loves it! I had never had a cleanser that would leave my skin so soft, fresh and clean. There is no greasy &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; left after you wash it off. I have had acne since I can remember and this cleanser is just for my type of skin. I&#x27;m glad I found it and I&#x27;m not ever letting it go! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product has become my replacement for my complete face / body wash care. I absolutely love the smell which is refreshing and not heavily scented. I utilize a moisturizer right after since it does dry your skin out but I&#x27;m always left feeling that it has drawn out all impurities from my skin and breakouts have lessened as a result.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good enough cleanser, don&#x27;t know about the anti wrinkle....who knows. I smells just like baby shampoo....</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have used this cleanser for about 2 months now and love the way the skin on my face feels. Much smoother, softer and more supple. I will definitely continue to use this and purchase again as needed.</li>
    <li> The more I use this brand, the more impressed I am. Glycolic acid increases cell turnover, keeps debris out of your pores, and helps keep your skin moisturized and looking healthy. I don&#x27;t want to say young, because I don&#x27;t necessarily believe in &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;, but your face is your calling card and when it looks good, you feel good. The fragrance in this is light, it lathers very nicely, and I notice a huge difference from using it (and if I don&#x27;t use it for a couple days). It is gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> Contains retinyl palmitate - bad ingredient.  Caused itchiness and made my neck and facial skin feel very rough to the touch.  Am tossing this out immediately.  I do not have sensitive skin, so this product is really bad.</li>
    <li> I have had better cleansers......</li>
    <li> I feel this cleanser works pretty good, it does lather just enough, it seems to take off my makeup pretty well also.</li>
    <li> I am 50 and still get an occasional pimple, have large pores on my chin, and an oily t-zone.  I LOVE this cleanser. Smells great, lathers great, and my skin feels clean and smooth after using it.  Highly recommend this cleanser and their Derma E Age Defying Antioxidant Hand Creme too!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser! It makes my face soft, smooth and clean. Also, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and I&#x27;m allergic to everything!</li>
    <li> Good cleanser.  Balances your skin well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with the dry or tight feeling like others can.  Not a high enough percentage of Glycolic Acid for my skin though.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very fresh smelling, and has a nice light texture. There&#x27;s no greasy \\&quot;film\\&quot; left after washing with this cleanser, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out. In fact, it seems to have helped with my combination/T-zone skin. The dry patches on my cheeks are gone and my oil is better controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is also brighter, as the glycolic acid does help to naturally exfoliate those dead and dull skin cells that tend to build up on the face. It&#x27;s suprisingly gentle as well. At night when I wash, I allow this to sit on my face for about 60 seconds to allow the glycolic acid to do it&#x27;s magic. It has a slight tingle to it, but nothing serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to cleanser. I would recommend it for anyone who has troubles with combination to oily skin.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product at Whole Foods. I have been detoxying thru juicing and eating Vegan for over a week now. My skin used to be like porcelin! Since I have been detoxying, my skin was sallow and just no radiance at all! I LOVE to get in the shower now and massage my face with this VIOLET smelling product for like 5 minutes everyday! My skin looks more plump and small wrinkles are disappearing. I have used it for 4 days now. It is the BEST smelling facial cleanser I have ever ran across and its all natural! Im stocking up!</li>
    <li> Love the features/benefits but HATE the fragrance.  This would be 5 stars without fragrance or with an essential oil instead of artificial fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very light it also smells amazing and refreshing I ordered it for my daughter for her white heads it really works .</li>
    <li> I like the way it lathers up when I wash my face.  Must just be careful not to get carried away and use too much.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The Derma product does not come with a sealed bottle, and this particular product smells weird, maybe just me, but I don&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. For a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cleanser it performs very well. I have always had trouble finding effective natural products, and I think it&#x27;s because I was using the wrong type for my skin. This one really does work well.&lt;br /&gt;I have mild adult acne and I can control it with this and some other products (like salicylic acid and benzyl peroxide and a weekly scrub). It definitely keeps the dead skin off without any irritation. After trying it I stopped to see if it was making a difference and after one weekend I started breaking out, so it works very quickly and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance, it is stronger than other natural products. I would have to think if you are sensitive to fragrances this is going to be really annoying. I don&#x27;t mind it so much, it kinda has a nostalgic grandma scent. Like cheap rose fragrance, but for me totally tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;It does not remove make up well, I use something cheaper for that (Cetaphil for Oily skin).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now with fantastic results!! I had been using a similar but more expensive face wash that had Glycolic Acid and I liked what it did for my skin but I wanted to find a way to incorporate Vitamin A as well without having to use too many products. I found Derma e here on Amazon and it had everything I was looking for in one product and it was much less expensive then the other brand I had been using. Right away I could tell that Derma e was a quality product. It is a gentle wash that does suds up a bit but does not overdry out the skin and my face feels very calm and happy after I wash with this product. I have had no breakouts since starting Derma e, and in fact I am happy to report that my skin has improved even further since starting!! I am definitely hooked and you have gained a lifelong customer in me and YES I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with acne or out of wack PH skin!!!</li>
    <li> Love It!  It smells great and leaves my face smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cleanser. I have been happy with all of my derma e purchases and have bought many products for my daughter as well.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the glycolic toner. I can&#x27;t say enough about this cleaner,  it keeps it glowing, clean, soft, radiant, and best of all my acne scars are disappearing.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I just wanted a simple non-drying cleaner for everyday use. This works for that purpose. It does give a little lather, slightly scented, and great pump. I do love derma e products for my skin, and I would recommend for everyday use.</li>
    <li> love the smell. It does not irritate and seems to clean my face well. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice - very happy</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am in my late 20&#x27;s &amp; have the most oily skin with large pores.  It is also sensitive and tends to get really red and blotchy after I wash my face.  This is the very first cleanser I have ever used that left my face looking normal, &amp; feeling clean and supple after using it.  For that alone, it is a great cleanser.  On top of that though, it has cleared up my face and (with the help of Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Mattifying Moisturizer) kept my face completely oil-free.  Completely. Oil. Free.  It doesn&#x27;t get better than that...it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Derma e products are seriously the best. Perfect for sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Skin. I have never had another product leave my skin so clean and so soft. Love this and will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Great for oily/combination sensitive skin. Leaves my skin feeling fresh,clean, and smooth. Keeps pores small. I like to leave it on for a few minutes before I wash it off at night. You&#x27;ll realize how amazing it is when you receive compliments on how beautiful you skin is :) :) :)</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim from ULTA a week ago and I...actually really like it. It hasn&#x27;t changed my current pimples majorly, but it does leave my face soft, smooth, and helps with all the oilyness it tends to produce. I also haven&#x27;t had any new, terrible breakouts. I have combination/oily dark skin. It has helped with my laugh lines (they were never terribly deep, but now they&#x27;re a lot softer).</li>
    <li> After washing with this cleanser only one time it removed the dead cells as advertised and my skin didn&#x27;t have that tight feeling that other soaps leave.</li>
    <li> I have used products before with glycolic acid and was looking for something different. this wash is great! my acne is starting to clear up and this product does not dry out my skin. I also use salicylic acid acne pads and this does not interfere with those. I will def. be buying again.</li>
    <li> this was a nice find.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and is really skin friendly.  I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I liked this. Used it all. Buying from Whole Zfoods</li>
    <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience with my (mostly) normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I was looking for an exfoliating cleanser and found this through GoodGuide.com. I use it as a part of my evening routine and find it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Since using this cleanser, I have not had any breakouts or other skin issues. The price is reasonable, especially considering the high quality ingredients such as glycolic acid and papaya extract. I also really like the pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: This cleanser has a mild, flowery scent. I like it but those with sensitivity to fragrances may want to reconsider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: EWG.org gives this product a moderate hazard score because of the fragrance and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A). These ingredients are potentially concerning, especially for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love this cleanser! It has everything I want and nothing that I am trying to avoid, all at a reasonable price. I try other cleansers but I always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 months and I love it and now I use it with my vita cycle spin brush and my face feels amazing after!!! I also use the toner and face lotion.</li>
    <li> Be careful when ordering. This is not the face soap you get. They picture and describe a cleaner with no added fragrance but sent a face soap with mango in it. When I used it the soap made my face break out. I have used the fragrance free before and loved it.</li>
    <li> LOVED this! Definitely ordering more. Made my skin feel amazing, haven&#x27;t had any cleanser come close to this one. Minimizes pores like no other, balances skin. Must try</li>
    <li> My friend said my skin was glowing the first day I used this.  I have never had a compliment on my skin in my life before this</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it works wonderful, leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash. The first few times I used it there was a menthol-like feeling afterwards, I wouldn&#x27;t complain to feel that all the time. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now - great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. After using it one time, my face felt clean and felt firmer. Since I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks my skin looks brighter and my pores appear smaller. Not trying to toot my own horn, but I have very few wrinkles or lines so I cannot comment on the anti wrinkle facet of this product.</li>
    <li> The smell, the clean sensation you gut is wonderfull... and it really cleans, specially when I have to clean my make up....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly as I usually wash all my makeup off first with soap, then use this cleanser afterwards. Nice smell but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin since using this product.</li>
    <li> I had some blemish issues and began using this cleanser a few months ago (along with Aqua Glycolic toner) and it has made my skin look great!  I went in for a facial today and the esthetician actually said to me that I have some of the nicest skin she&#x27;s seen. Can&#x27;t get better than that!  It also removes eye makeup well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling gross, like some cleansers.</li>
    <li> Love this wash. I am 30 with oily but sensitive pre aging skin. Have gone through tons of washes that eirther made me break out or dried my skin out. This wash evens it out perfectly, keeps my skin clear and helps with fine lines and balancing. Also great for the price. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that floral fragrance is listed as in ingredient.  What a shame.  If it didn&#x27;t smell so fragrant, I would have at least tried it.  This is not a good product if you have fragrance sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Foams up good, and skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have what I&#x27;ve always considered to be very sensitive skin. I standardly opt for dye and fragrance free products and avoid makeup overall, except blemish concealer (and the rare all-out [or should I say all-on] makeup for very special occasions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews of skin products, although I&#x27;m way up there in skin sensitivity, I might actually be at the bottom of the very top tier or the top of the next tier down. I&#x27;ve tried many skin cleansing products over the years, including Purpose soaps (burns) and washes (residue), Neutrogena sensitive soap (not sensitive enough), 40 Carrots (residue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blemishes that come and go. Skin on my face is oily overall, but on rare winter occasions somewhat dry. People say I look younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this product has a light fragrance (this was a concern when I first received it), this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I purchased and have been using this wash since mid-February 2014. I wash with it when I wake up and just before bed. It leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and a (very) little taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is obvious by the myriad of reviews on any product, your experience can differ from mine. For me, I would absolutely purchase it again. I like it that much.</li>
    <li> Derma e Vitamin A Glycolic Cleanser really cleared up my acne and&lt;br /&gt;fade my dark acne marks too. My skin has never felt so good since&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product. I would recommend this product to&lt;br /&gt;anyone who has acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using derma E cleanser for almost two years and absolutely loved it. I recently purchased this cleanser through Amazon and noticed that the label was different which was disclosed in the new packaging. However, I found the cleanser to feel thinner and smelled different than before. I am very disappointed because I felt like I finally found a cleanser that I swore by. Will not be purchasing again, have moved on to another natural cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve had acne on and off for about 10 yrs.    NO ALCOHOLS, ONLY DECYL GLUCOSIDE as detergent(foaming agent), NO SLS or Cocamidopropyl betaine...so no drying, irritating effect.    I don&#x27;t know how effective the Vitamin A is in a wash, but Glycolic Acid works the best as a cleanser for my skin.    Note: Glycerin is a drying agent on the skin contrary to popular belief! It attracts moistore from your pores to the surface of your skin. It especially acts very drying when used in a wash or shave cream because the moisture is drawn to the surface only to washed away. Unfortunately it is in about every skincare product. That is the only ingredient I don&#x27;t like in this wash. I&#x27;d rather see lanolin instead. Lanolin (antifungal and antibacterial) acts as a skin protectant and locks in moisture while letting your skin breath naturally.</li>
    <li> Love how it cleans the skin without drying it</li>
    <li> Really drying for sensitive skin. Use once a week.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would love anything MORE than I love my Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Acne Control face wash. I sometimes read reviews and buy products based on those reviews, only to be very disappointed. But this is not one of those times. I was worried the first day I used this because my skin was tight, so I thought it would get hard and eventually peel because of the glycolic acid in it. Thankfully, that didn&#x27;t happen! My skin looks younger right after I wash my face, it&#x27;s squeaky clean, tight, and after I use my Mia 2, Obagi Toner and add my Persagel, the oil is literally reduced for 24 hours on my face by 95%. I have the oiliest skin on earth based on genetics and nothing controls it until I placed this into my regimen. I really hope Derma E never stops making this. I am hooked for life, thank you! And thank you all for giving it 5 stars, it was 100% true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - REMOVED 1 STAR: I should have waited a little longer before I wrote my review. Unfortunately, with my cystic acne, it took almost 3 weeks for it to come out (after not having any issues for 1 year with my Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Acne Control face wash). In just under 3 weeks, I had a flare up of cystic acne (boils under the skin that do not come out) and I was obviously disappointed. I removed 1 star because it&#x27;s going to clog up your pores in a few weeks if you have cystic acne like I&#x27;ve had my entire life. But I still give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s really a great face wash that tightens your skin and gets it extremely clean. I&#x27;m only going to use it 2 times per week now, but I&#x27;m back to my steadfast and true regimen of using the Clarisonic Mia 2 [the regular Mia has one speed, which is lower than the higher speed with the Mia 2], Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Acne Control, Obagi Toner with real cotton round pads and my PersaGel (Clearasil can&#x27;t get their product right so I went to PersaGel and haven&#x27;t looked back!). Just wanted to let you know in case you have cystic acne, too.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time changing up my face care regime because as I approached 30 my skin really started changing, black heads, scattered small pimples, oily under makeup, congested, etc. After many many months I fell in love with the Derma E line. My go tos are this Glycolic Cleanser, there Vitamin A Moisturizing Gel, and the Hyaluronic Acid Night Cream (use it both day and night). My skin is fair, sensitive, combo on the side of oily, and prone to light acne and blackheads. This regime has transformed my skin to hydrated but not oily, diminished my congested enlarged pores, and generally evened out my skin tone. I think it is even helping with the light wrinkles I have forming. I am waiting for my current eye cream to run out so I can try one of the Derma E ones. The only thing I used outside of this brand on my face is a Say Yes To Tomatoes Mask on my nose here and there to really unclog the pores. I also use the Colorescience Calming Primer which is basically like a tinted Moisturizer with SPF and I put that over the night cream I mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros for this Cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;-Very small amount needed so lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;-Nice natural foaming action gets rid of makeup (including my mascara and eyeliner,yay!)&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliates my skin without irritating it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it is just this cleanser or the combo of the 3 products I use above but I never get that flaky skin anymore that gets in the way of flawless makeup.</li>
    <li> I love the microdermabrasion scrub from derma e, so I was excited to try their cleanser. This is quickly becoming my favorite non-drugstore skincare line. In general, they take these ingredients that I thought my skin was too sensitive for and put them into products that really end up working for me! This cleanser was another product like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s just a great cleanser. It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin, it lathers well, it rinses off cleanly, and it takes away about 95% of my foundation (so performance as good as or better than other cleansers I&#x27;ve used). There&#x27;s no smell and after using it twice a day for a few days, I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity reactions. The glycolic acid is helping clear up some breakouts, as well (glycolic acid is commonly used in peels. (I&#x27;m using a lot of other products, some of which are also &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle,&amp;#34; so I can&#x27;t directly speak to that aspect of things. But if you are wanting to avoid products with hyaluronic acid and/or collagen and still want to look for something with anti-aging benefits, definitely check this out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would caution you about would be to use sunscreen since glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid and, especially in combination with vitamin A, may increase sun sensitivity. I&#x27;ve been using an SPF 30 facial sunscreen in combination with this product and it seems to be doing the trick.</li>
    <li> I have recently switched from soap to cleanser.  After going through a couple of pricier cleansers, this one is the best.  I have already ordered more.  I love it.  I am 41 and this is definitely helping my face look clean, young and it really helps with wrinkles used with Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure.  A previous review recommended this combination and she is spot on!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel very clean without stripping it which is critical when you are serious about anti-aging products. I would definitely repurchase this, It is also very affordable as this size will last quite awhile and is a better deal than many of the anti-aging cleansers sold at drug stores. Great find.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! Shipping and product condition was perfect. Love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful cleanser for anyone who has problematic skin as it relates to acne &amp; hyper-pigmentation.  This cleanser has to be one of the best smelling cleansers I have ever used.  I have too much experience with medicated and non-medicated cleanser for my acne skin and I can assure you, that you will not be disappointed by purchasing this.  Hope it serves you well as it has done for me!!  I certainly will be reordering again and have told many friends &amp; family about it!! If I could I would give this product 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  No breakouts unless i forget to use it.  I use it with heritage rosehip w/glycerin &amp; hydraulic acid pure.  All from on here. The best face regiment ive ever used.  I got the idea off another customers post.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, yet mild cleanser for the whole body.  Not only does it clean wonderfully, it also takes care of any unwanted pigmentation and leaves the skin &#x27;glowing&#x27;.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! My skin has never been better!</li>
    <li> great cleanser and love the smell!</li>
    <li> I really line this product and your face is free of breakouts and gives you a nice glow after using.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser.  This product has made such a difference in my skin and it&#x27;s appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product so much.</li>
    <li> This is a very cost effective glycolic cleanser, which is why I bought it.  But the product I received is intended for those with oily skin (stated on the bottle that was shipped to me, but the amazon image shows it indicated for all skin types) and I find it far too drying to use as a daily cleanser on my face.  I would not have purchased this if the listing had made this clear.</li>
    <li> Good product, not super-great. It made my skin feel nice, and helped cut down oil production but it didn&#x27;t take care of my (mostly hormonal) acne (not surprisingly) or coloration problems. I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a glycolic rather than a salicylic based cleanser, and appreciate animal and eco friendly products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it has not been a cure-all fix-all product for me, but it has been the best daily cleanser I have come across so far. I will most likely buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and non-drying cleanser effectively removes all traces of make-up. Seems to have a gradual exfoliating effect as my complexion is much smoother and clearer over time. Balances dry and oily areas (no sulfates! &amp;#60;3) so skin is comfortable without moisturizer and without make-up. This cleanser has been an essential for me for more than two years. Amazon price is about the same as retail store- maybe less than some. Great for all skin types!</li>
    <li> Overall this product is ok because it is light, oil free and smells good. As far as effectiveness of the product I would say next to non. I still have discoloration and my skin tone is not even. I wonder if Derma E makes a stronger glycolic percentage.  This one is only 10% and my skin doesn&#x27;t even burn or tingle from it. I know that when using glycolic acid products one way that a person can tell that it&#x27;s working is a tingle or burning sensation and this has neither. Not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great sized product that cleans my skin very well and leaves it soft too. My skin is very oily so this cleanser is a great help in leaving my face with a matte finish and leaving it soft too.</li>
    <li> I like using this because it cleans without harsh soap additives. I use this along with the vitamin a one that does sudd up.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin (dry and oily areas) and I really like this product because of it&#x27;s eco-composition first of all and it&#x27;s performance: it is soft enough to not irritate the skin yet efficient enough to really make you feel you have glowing clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t quite strong enough to take care of local peeling (due to clumbsy over-dosage of vitamine A on my part ;) but I can use a stronger one locally; This makes it a great product for everyday cleansing because it does it&#x27;s job without resulting in over activating the skin as it often happens with stronger products. Perfect for daily cleansing combination skin.</li>
    <li> As a complicated skin sufferer, I  could never seem to find acne control without overdrying and erupting my ezcema. Also, at 42, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for anti wrinkle cleansers. This one is all that and more! It&#x27;s natural, exfoliates, controls oil, smells wonderful, and moisturizes! I use this with Thayer&#x27;s Rosewater Toner after, and Ann Webb&#x27;s SKIN products, and my skin has that wonderful, smooth, firm, &amp; healthy glow! Use this cleanser if you suffer from acne, want to exfoliate at the same time, and treat wrinkles - all NATURALLY!</li>
    <li> Not sure. I bought them for my son who lives in LA. He says if he doesn&#x27;t use it his face looks like a pizza.</li>
    <li> Yet another derma e product that was changed AND NOT FOR THE BETTER.  This is the second product that I had used happily for a couple of years and now they&#x27;ve changed it so it is no longer good for all skin types.  I had ordered the old product and received the new without any notice that it was no longer a product I can use. Amazon was helpful in getting my money back since this is useless garbage to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding replacement products for all the derma e I&#x27;ve been using for years since they appear to be abandoning their long-time customers and changing their products to not support those of us with sensitive/dry skin.</li>
    <li> Rarely do I use such a product and like it 100% but this makes the grade. It&#x27;s expensive for an all over body wash but that&#x27;s how I use it. A little goes a long way on one of those nylon poofs. The fragrant is light and lovely and nothing leaves my skin feeling finer than this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I liked this but, I am not one to wash my makeup off before getting in the shower so if I have makeup on the face wash doesn&#x27;t work well and doesn&#x27;t remove it very well. I got this to try something new because I love the micro microdermabrasion scrub from derme e. I just stopped using this and went back to my Yes To Carrots face wash.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face product!</li>
    <li> I do really like this Glycolic cleanser, it is soooooo gentle for a glycolic based cleanser. A lot of times when you use a glycolic cleanser it will be so strong it irritates your skin and you get the redness or yep the peeling effect of it, but not with this one, and you get the vitamin a in it as well yeah another benefit. I use this with my pretika sonic cleansing brush and my skin just loves it, you can tell a big difference in using this only a few times. Pores what pores, and it helps re-texturize your skin which is what you would expect using a glycolic cleanser. The only down thing is it goes out of stock a lot, because it is poplular and it is a bit pricey, but there is way more higher priced cleanser on the market so, but you will love this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I switched to this cleanser because I wanted something that was paraben free and cruelty free. I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results I would find. I usually have a slightly uneven skin tone and this removed my rosy cheeks! It cleans very well. Removes makeup nicely. It has a nice lite scent. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. A nice product.</li>
    <li> I think this is a nice mild cleanser. I&#x27;m 70 years young and I like all of the Derma E products that I have purchased so far. They have made my skin noticeable smoother!</li>
    <li> It is apparent that no one worries about what kind of ingredients they put on their face day after day. For this and all the other cleansers made by this Co look at Phenoxyethanol. Go to Bubble &amp; Bee and look it up under chemical of the day.&lt;br /&gt;There are even comments by chemists trying to counter the bad rating but they get politely put down. If you use cosmetics daily, many if not most loaded with endocrine disruptors and carcinogens please look up the ingredients and caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Cleans thoroughly. I have dry sin and although the product is intended for oily skin I haven&#x27;t seen much drying probably because I&#x27;m suing a good moisturizer. I had my hair dyed the other day and some of the dye was on my skin however, when I used this product to wash my face, the dye was on my washcloth (I never experienced dye coming off the skin this easily).</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of different face washes to treat persistent acne and an oily complexion. I use this wash in combination with the Glycolic toner, and I am acne free! My face doesn&#x27;t dry out, and my complexion has never been better.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware -- the last ingredient is \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; and it smells like the world&#x27;s worst perfume.  Like something women might have worn in the 50&#x27;s.  Can&#x27;t stand the smell!</li>
    <li> I love the smell .its not too strong.i must say the product did nothing for my dark spots and discoloration but it does clean very well and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.and it has helped with my acne.i wish the percent of glycolic in this was higher</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this AMAZING cleanser- and I won&#x27;t ever use another. I&#x27;m 41, and my skin has problems. Nothing serious- clogged, enlarged pores. One or two zits (cystic) a year. Just kind of blah. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my face has a much healthier glow, and has a more even tone and color. Pores are clearer, and it&#x27;s GREAT for those little lines ladies my age get. Makes them just about unnoticeable. I follow up with Reviva Labs Firming Eye Serum and smoothe 40 Carrots Carrot + C Vitamin Serum all over my face and neck. I started taking care of my (although congested) skin 20 years ago, and my skin is still firm and without wrinkles or &#x27;crow&#x27;s feet&#x27; and I believe that this cleanser has been an affordable Godsend!</li>
    <li> I like this product and have bought it several times. It cleans your face without drying it out. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gentle on the skin and does not dry my skin out</li>
    <li> I use it daily. Helps to thoroughly clean the skin</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mild glycolic cleanser and gave derma e Vitamin A Glycolic cleanser a try. It&#x27;s very gentle on my face and it has lasted longer than I expected, a little bit goes a long way. I break out with 1-4 acne once a month and found this product very helpful for me. I have the T-zone and this product has really helped with shine control, etc. I always apply a non-oily moisturizer after washing my face with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Very good fascial cleanser.  Impossible to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using Clarins with great results but I wanted to try Derma E since I read good results on it. However, it caused me to breakout and I&#x27;ve switched back to Clarins. I have minor adult acne and I have had problem skin since teenage years. My skin is beginning to clear up again.</li>
    <li> My face feels more fresh and clean after I use this product. Hard to tell if it&#x27;s helped my skin look younger/ fewer wrinkles because my acne gets in the way.  :)  Smells very pretty.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is extremely gentle. Great for sensitive skin. I need something more powerful. I have acne prone skin and I have a few pimples after using this. Maybe it is purging my skin but I doubt it. I use acid peels dead sea masks etc. So I believe that my skin is purged. I will say this makes my skin super soft. I need that tingle though from a higher concentration of glycolic acid. I use my microdermabrasion crystals with it now. This is a good product but just not for my needs. Looking for another glycolic cleanser with a higher concentration of the acid in it. I do like the fact that this has papaya in it but again I need more in a cleanser. If you have sensitive skin this is for you.</li>
    <li> I started using this cleanser at the same time started using the Derma e Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Oil with Vitamin E.  Together these two products have transformed my face.  Make sure to leave this on your skin for at least a minute or two before rinsing off.  I also bought the Derme e Vitamin A Glycolic scrub that I sometimes used instead of this cleanser.  I am in my forties and am constantly confused with being in my twenties.  The Derma e product line is pretty awesome in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> After about 10 days of using this product, combined with the matching toner, my skin is soft, smooth, pores appear smaller. My dermatologist actually recommended this product &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I took her suggestion. I will definitely be stocking up on it. This is now my go-to cleanser. It&#x27;s not as drying as anti-acne cleansers. Nicely scented too.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It is the perfect balance of exfoliation and gentleness....it keeps my pores clear but without completely drying out my skin. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I hate salicylic acid cleansers because they make my blackheads worse. This cleanser is amazing, helps remove dull skin, and keeps breakouts under control.</li>
</ol>
