    <li> Perfect to use right out the shower on towel dried hair. You only need about a dime size amount for long hair, less for shorter hair. If you use too much product it tends to make hair greasy looking. Argan oil enables hair to dry faster as well as keep the hair moisturized, shiny, soft, and more manageable. It&#x27;s also great for frizz, before blow outs, straightening, and restoring health to damaged hair from coloring and lightening. A little product goes a long way, this bottle will last you months so it&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
    <li> This KA, By Norra B  Argan Oil Hair Treatment Hair is fantastic. Love how its organic! Only the best ingredients that will make your hair feel fantastic. Plus will take away the frizz out of your hair. You only need 2-3 drops. Its a miracle treatment on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Organic Argan Oil Treatment for weak, limp and lifeless hair. Perfect for Frizzy, Dry and Damaged Hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Organic Argan Oil, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Jojoba oil, Shea Butter, Sunflower Oil, Vitamin B5 &amp; Grapeseed Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I am always on the look out for products that will help my hair feel great and look better and I&#x27;ve had friends recommend argan oil and argan oil products. It seems that I&#x27;ve been hearing about argan oil everywhere now and I have since researched it a little more. I procured some pure argan oil some time ago and I loved it and wanted to try other products that used argan oil in them. When I had the opportunity to try and to review this argan oil hair treatment, I was very eager to put it to the test. I received this product for a discount in exchange for a genuine critique and I was eager to try it.

    <li> Fantastic hair oil.. The benefits are well written about so I wanted to try it out for myself.  After just one application it made my hair feel so smooth and silky. Very good</li>
    <li> I was buying all expensive Argan oil&#x27;s before this one and they haven&#x27;t compared. This brand is by far the best I have used. I love this product for several reasons; but my top reason is for helping with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it about 4 times since I received it. Put a tiny bit on your hand and rub it on the ends of your hair while it&#x27;s still wet, blow dry, and VOILA.... your hair is AMAZING. It&#x27;s silky, soft, and frizz free. It only takes a pea sized or smaller amount, so this stuff last a while!!! It also is excellent for rubbing on skin on any dry areas or just if you want to feel silky smooth. It would be a great and natural knot remover for kid&#x27;s hair as well!!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the look of the bottle too. Completely happy with the purchase of this oil and will be referring all my friends!!</li>
    <li> I put this in my hair and it brings a great gloss to it</li>
    <li> I have very curly frizzy hair and I used this on it right out of the shower and my hair held it&#x27;s curl without frizzing. This is indeed a win for me I&#x27;ll have good looking Summer hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil treatment several times and I really like it!  A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t go crazy with it as you can always add more.  It makes my highlighted hair feel so smooth and like real hair, not dry and stressed out.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the list of ingredients.  It looks more like a list of chemicals and not all natural ingredients as I thought it would be. Except for a couple of ingredients listed, I didn&#x27;t recognize anything else. I avoid putting it directly on my scalp. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Love!!</li>
    <li> My wife tried this over the weekend for her brother&#x27;s graduation.  The wind and sun were strong all day.  We walked around town and even into the woods for graduation photos.  Throughout the day, her hair looked amazingly beautiful.  Her hair was smooth and had a healthy shine to it. This is a great product, and I will be happy to buy more for my  wife.</li>
    <li> I like to use argan oil treatments on my hair, but sometimes they can be too heavy for my finer hair. Norra B&#x27;s treatment is rich but it soaks into my so it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy like treatments that just sit on the hair. The instructions say to apply after shampooing, but I use a color correcting conditioner, so I conditioned, rinsed and dried my hair as normal then applied the treatment to the bottoms half of my strands. My hair was left shinny and smooth, even my brittle ends which is my biggest complaint as a light blonde, after I blew my hair out. I also like to treat my thirsty ends at night and I found I can apply a small amount of Nora B&#x27;s argan oil treatment to just my ends when my hair is dry and then brush it through with a natural bristle brush. It makes for a good setting product for flyaways after styling. The sent is light and floral, which I really enjoy. All in all a great multitasking product in an easy to use bottle! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> Only used this twice but it made my hair super soft. I have very damaged, fried hair and this makes it feel so much better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in my hair and in my childrens hair. I notice the difference and have been impressed with the shine it gives. It helps with frizz and repairing slip ends. I was given this product to test test/review. I will continue to keep this product in stock.</li>
    <li> I absolutely am addicted to this Argan oil treatment.  I have been a big fan of Argan oil and I can usually tell if a product has it in it or not.  This oil has the traditional smell and texture of Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil comes in a nice little leak proof portable bottle.  You really need very little for an application.  Just a pea size squirt was plenty for styling purposes.  This product left my hair smooth and shiny. I also used a bit more and left it overnight in my hair.  When I rinsed it out in the morning my hair was amazingly bouncy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great Argan based hair product.  Worked perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Made my hair so incredibly soft &amp; manageable!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly to the roots, could new wear it anyways but All over my head in yes curly. I love now that I am older and know somewhat what to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift from Norra B. Argan oil hair treatment and just thought this is one that will last for a few hours once my hair dries then we go back to dry hair all over my head. Was not true was not the case, it has been two days and my curls are still here strong, hair is still moisture and my curls are still curled. That is a miracle for this dry hair that is mainly going grey. I will say that when it is wet just apply about a dime size in the palm of your hands and massage it all of that area then to each parts of hair that you have not applied it to previous. I was shocked and happy this little bottle that it some in I thought what? Yeah, I was wrong and they were right on target my ends aren’t dry my scalp is moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay another for my list to know what to your on my colored, curly hair.</li>
    <li> great stuff you have to try this!</li>
    <li> I apply this argan oil hair treatment after I wash my hair which is 3-4 times a week I have been using this product for about 2 weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference but I did notice that it has strengthen my hair which use to break very easily it also doesn&#x27;t look as dry as it use to it looks more nourished, smooth and feels soft. This oil is light it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel or look greasy. I will continue to use this oil because it has been helping my dry and damaged curly hair.</li>
    <li> I never put things like this in my hair. Absolutely glad I got this for review. From the very first use I was hooked. Didn&#x27;t make it oily or greasy. It instantly made my hair soft and silky and added natural shine. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Really nice stuff. Glad to review this. A lil goes a long way. Really leaves the hair shiny and soft. Nice light smell, cute bottle. Serum is not too thick and not too watery. Great for summer time abuse from sun, pools and salt water. Really nice serum</li>
    <li> After using this product one time my hair felt so soft and it smells great. It makes my hair less frizzy as I have naturally curly hair and this calms the hair down. I am experiencing less breakage. My hair is so manageable and shiny. I really like this product and recommend it to anyone with really dry hard to manage hair.</li>
