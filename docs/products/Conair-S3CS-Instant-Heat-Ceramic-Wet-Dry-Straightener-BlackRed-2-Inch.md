<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter it worked great gave it to my niece my daughter as gone all natural now so do not need this anymore my niece says it is working great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;wet&#x27; setting but when used normally it is a great straightener.  Heats up quickly and leaves hair feeling silky.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I was expecting this straightner to really wow me, but i was dissapointed. It took forever to dry DAMP hair and the end result was a total blahhhhh i would never repurchase! the curve plates totally suck as well! the curve plates are nothing but annoying make the drying process even longer. maybe this might work on somebody with really fine hair but for the rest of us ......... NO!</li>
    <li> Worked well for a few years on thick hair. The wet-dry feature was pretty much useless though, i did like the curve on the plates though.</li>
    <li> We purchased this product a few years ago because of the 2\\&quot; iron surface.  We were very happy with how much quicker it made straightening our hair and just taking the frizz out. Heats up very quickly, has different heat settings that allow you to straighten both thick and thinner hair without burning.  The curved iron surface is the best part of this straighener in that it makes your hair look naturually straight and not flat ironed with the straight ends, rather it slightly curls the ends under! Great Purchase.</li>
    <li> I hunted all over my town for a new one of these irons for a week &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it. So I hopped on here &amp; looked because I absolutely LOVE it!! I&#x27;ll never use a different one again! It heats up fast, great on wet hair as well as dry &amp; no frizz from it either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually on my second one of these straighteners. The first one I bought lasted almost 5 years and it recently gave out. I was so happy to find that they are still made. I have long wavy coarse hair that&#x27;s cut in long layers and my main reason for using it is to calm the frizz after blowing my hair out straight. I do not want that poker straight hair where my ends are sticking straight down, not a good look for me. The curve in this appliance though allows me to gently curve my ends under or flip them out. I have never had any problems with the ceramic coating, even though I use a keratin treatment AND a shine enhancer before using the iron. It does get pretty hot though and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the highest setting, but I was able to easily find the setting that works best for me. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I searched the web for another Conair arched flat iron like the one I had bought 2 years ago. Never had luck until now. I found this one on Amazon. It is fabulous. It had a really wide 2 inch bed, and curved plates so when you straighten your hair is doesnt look like straw on the ends like the rest of the flat irons.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter and I use this every morning. It is still new but is working well. It feels sturdy and my daughter has been able to work it without burning herself. I love the auto shut off feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener over a year ago. I fell in love with it. I have very thick hair, so the high heat is awesome and helps with time. With flat irons I have spent well over $100 on, used to take me over an hour to straighten my hair completely. With this, 15-20 minutes and I&#x27;m set.    I had to buy a new one though because suddenly it just stopped working after a year. I used it every single day, and even some of my friends used it. It would be on for at least 4 hours a day, so it had a lot of usage. But I&#x27;d rather spend the $25 on this for a new one every year than $100 for a top end one, that I never used because I didn&#x27;t feel like spending 1-2 hours for my hair to be straight.    Oh, and the curved plates are awesome too. I hate really stick straight hair. Giving the ends a little flip under makes your hair look naturally straight.</li>
    <li> I first used this product from a friend&#x27;s sister and I loved it.  I have wavy thick hair and it worked great. Plus, it was pretty fast.  I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same sections of hair over and over again, just once. The wet to dry feature is pretty good, but makes my hair a bit frizzy and poofy, so I go over my hair again after its dry, on the normal setting. Also great for \\&quot;flipping\\&quot; or curling in the ends on layered hair as well.  My old one was starting to act out so I purchased this one on Amazon. since I couldn&#x27;t find any at any department or beauty/cosmetics store near me, or even within the whole state.</li>
    <li> Love this product, bought two to keep when one fails.  Only wish it would last a bit longer than it does.</li>
    <li> This straightener works wonders on thick hair with the higher settings and it is easy to hold and work with. The wet/dry setting also is perfect but be careful not to use it on a high setting or all your hair will be is frizz. It withstands alot and lasts for a bit longer than its two year warrenty. This is my second one (the same type) because my last one lasted for three years but alas the warrenty is again only two years which is actually pretty reasonable. I recommend this over any straightener ever.</li>
    <li> This works great,,,,love how it is wet dry, I don&#x27;t use on really wet hair but right before it is dry it really irons nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel like its frying your hair.</li>
    <li> Only had it for 5 months and the thing blew up this morning, sparks flew and caught on fire, will never buy a Conair product again!!</li>
    <li> Hi!    I bought this product because I had a $25 gift card to use on Amazon and this was about that price plus S&amp;H. It&#x27;s a good product. Clunkier and more dificult to handle than my old one which was slim and sleek and very light. This works great as a straightener. But I used to use my old one to curl my hair too... which I cant do with this one.It will do a little flip at the ends but nothing more. The curved iron is kind of fun though.Also, if you buy this with the intention of using with wet hair all the time to save a step by not drying your hair... you will be disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t really dry and straighten at the same time. All in all its a pretty decent tool if you just want to make your hair be straight... but mine doesnt take much work anyway. It&#x27;s fine and not very wavy at all.</li>
    <li> I really like the item that I purchased from Amazon but in buying from Amazon there site is not secure and someone charged items to my account that I had not purchased. Will never shop with them again!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite straightening iron, and I have owned four of them now. (I would give it 5 stars, but they do have to be replaced around every 9 months to a year.) It is the only ceramic iron you can find with curved 2-inch plates, which make all the difference in performance. Made with high-quality materials, the iron works great, with auto turnoff feature and wet-dry function. Arrived quickly and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone else.</li>
    <li> This is the best, quickest straightener I have ever found! I have thick hair and my six year old has soft thin hair. Works wonders on both! I haven&#x27;t played around with the wet function much but the regular one is HOT and makes your hair silky smooth. You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several staighteners over the years.  However the Conair S3CS is curved and the only one I&#x27;ve every liked.  It&#x27;s the best in my opinion because of the curve.  This is my 3rd one. They last about 2 1/2-3 years because I use it a lot and leave it on too long some tines.</li>
    <li> The Conair Wet-Dry Straightener is great! It heats quickly and retains the proper temp for straightening!  I hadn&#x27;t used a hair appliance for over 15 years.  This item is VERY user friendly!  I tried it with dry and damp hair.  Both times I achieved the results I was looking for. I LOVE the curved barrel design! No \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; lines!!!  I would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Ran across my 1st unit in a store and bought it.  LOVED IT! I am absolutely useless with a round brush and blow dryer.  But I need the lift this iron provides.  Yes, it does get hot, but it provides long lasting volume like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  Can never find these in stores anymore, so I am glad Amazon has them!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple months ago and it continues to amaze me.  It is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever had.  I spend a fraction of the time on my hair and it looks better than ever.  This is the 3rd straightener I&#x27;ve owned and it well surpasses the others.  My last one had flat plates with rounded edges so that it wouldn&#x27;t kink the ends of my hair, but this disign, with the curved plates, is much better.  I can choose to either play up the curve and have a nice rounded end to my hair or I can keep it arrow strait.  I can also use it to give my fine hair much needed volume.  The size of the plates are perfect for bangs.  I love that I can use it on either dry or wet hair.  I thought that it would fry my wet hair and damage it, but it&#x27;s designed in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t do that.  Even if I&#x27;m running late, all I need is 5 minutes and this iron will turn my wet hair into a polished look.  You just have to towel dry so that your hair isn&#x27;t dripping wet and press the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; button on the iron.  The icing on the cake is the swivel cord and auto timer.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> I use this straightener several times a week, and it gets much hotter, and closer to the root, than my spendy Solano straightener (which I now only use on rare occasions). This is my second Conair (the first one just died after a couple of years), and I&#x27;ll use it til it dies, too! Though I don&#x27;t use the wet function ever (it&#x27;s not hot enough for my hair), you still can&#x27;t beat the performance for 25 bucks. If you&#x27;ve got thick, wavy hair like mine, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this \\&quot;straightener\\&quot;.  I thought it would be a great item because 1) it&#x27;s a wet to dry iron --meaning you can use it to dry and straighten your hair at the same time; 2) it&#x27;s curved design would allow me to curl my ends easier; and 3) the way the ceramic plates lay flush with the body of the iron, it&#x27;s less likely to snag my hair like my other ceramic iron.  But the design is so awful that the plates do not fit perfectly together!  The section of hair I attemped to dry &amp; straighten (yes, I only completed ONE section before I determined that this thing was going back to the store!) did not dry completely. Nor did it get straight, even after I ran the iron the length of my hair 6 or 7 times. Definitely a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was a little doubtful with this straightener.  It&#x27;s no CHI or Babyliss, but Hey, It&#x27;s Cheap!  I gave it a shot, and it made my hair silky and straight. I love it! People complimented me and said my hair looked better than before. It&#x27;s made of plastic, so it&#x27;ll break fast, but i wouldn&#x27;t mind buying another one. Although this product doesn&#x27;t provide SALON results, it straightens FAST, heats up fast, and do fun flips for layers and such, and makes your hair silky and less damaged.  hat are you waiting for?  GET THIS STRAIGHTENER!!!!</li>
    <li> it works great for me.. and the price is excelent  it warms really fast... ys great i donnt even need to use my blower anymore  i just have my hiar to dry naturaly and then i use this iron and is so fast 15 min im ready and i have curly and long hair and i live in panama were its really frizzy place with lot of humidity so im veary pleace with this... i recomend it</li>
    <li> Es la mejor compra que he realizado en mucho tiempo, mis hijas y yo la usamos mucho, alisa nuestros cabellos largos apenas en 10 min. Lo mejor de todo no necesitamos ir a la peluqueria.  Es cheverísima.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for years and it just now broke...unfortunately. This straightener is great because it gives you lift when you straighten compared to just making your hair look unhealthy and flat. I really like the design as well, which is curved instead of just flat and straight. I had no problems with the straightener. The coating never came off and even though I&#x27;ve had this thing for at least 3 years, it still looks brand new and I straighten my hair most of the time. I have really, really thick hair and this works better than any straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. I even prefer it to a Chi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m incredibly picky, but love this flat iron! I get compliments on my hair all the time and I get people asking me what kind of flat iron I use. Well, when a friend loved mine and begged to have it, I gave it away, thinking, I&#x27;ll just go pick up another one. Well, I went to the store I had originally purchased it from, and they were out of stock! I was so thankful to find it here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I had a conair before that I loved so I decided to buy this extra one. This hair straightener heats up really fast, but the wet dry feature is not as powerful as the previous one. Also the handle could be more ergonomic. It straightens hair just okay but I think  my previous one still works better. The looks overall are better but function wise it could use some improvements.</li>
    <li> I have crazy hair! Thick on some parts, wiry curly on others, flyaways, frizz. It&#x27;s nightmare when I don&#x27;t straighten or curl it.&lt;br /&gt;I have desperately tried so many irons within my price range but this is the only one that has worked for me. And I love the curved design because I can give a shape to my hair that I would not from a regular straightener.&lt;br /&gt;It gets very hot that sometimes I burn myself but I have grown to be more careful. Also, I don&#x27;t use the wet hair feature because that makes my hair feel dehydrated. It&#x27;s better to use on hair that is dry enough and with Moroccan oil or some other heat protecting serum. My hair is still a nightmare when I don&#x27;t take care of it but at least I have this to help :-)</li>
    <li> This product is great! usually i dont have time to blow dry my hair and then flat ironing it.This is so two in one! dries my hair quick and straightens it quickly. It leaves my hair dry though but I use John freida serum and works great with my hair! so love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly a year and I&#x27;ve only been happy with it.  It works great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. My sister had one and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Was glad to see it on the Amazon site. Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. Great for straightening, adding curves and volume. I highly recommend, although I would never consider using any straightener on wet hair.</li>
    <li> This straigtner works as good as you can expect for the money. It is not very good with wet to dry, in fact I always wait for my hair to dry naturally now before using it. Using a straigtning cream or spray is a must because without either my hair is kind of brittle and sticky. I live in florida and I can say that these are NOT good for humidity because my hair usually ends up frizzy and curly after just 5 mins outside. I also have to re-straighten my hair in the morning after doing it at night because it just doesn&#x27;t last. Mine are still working after 2 years, however which is longer than some, but I am currently looking into buying a better quality one that will stand up to the floridian weather.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. The red coating has worn away and it really smells when you heat it up and it makes your hair smell really bad.  I desperately want a chi!</li>
    <li> Only got two use of it and is broken soon after i brought it , it broke after 2 or 3 uses I dont like it at all it was a wate of my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for about 3 weeks now and have really put it to the test. The first week I had it, we were on vacation and the weather was in the 90s and extremely humid. Not only did the iron straighten my hair, but it also helped prevent the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; that I  normally would have had. Because it was so hot, I kept my hair in a pony tail for most of the week, but the tail was silky and shiny and &#x27;curved&#x27; at the ends for days. Now that I&#x27;m back in my air conditioned office, I don&#x27;t have to worry about the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; but my hair is still smooth and bends at just the right spot.    So glad I found this; it&#x27;s perfect for my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Remington Wet 2 Straight straightner, it was absolutely amazing! The conair is okay, it does heat up really fast but it does not dry my hair (I have really thick hair) like the Remington did. Also the curved plates are nice but does not really work on stubbornly straight hair! So if you have really thick hair I would not purchase this but if you have thinner hair I think it would probably work.</li>
    <li> I have had no problem with this iron. I got it so that I could curl my ends easily and flip out the ends also. The flipping out has been difficult for me to get the hang of but that&#x27;s probably me and not the iron&#x27;s fault. But when I just want to quickly curl my hair under it does a quick and beautiful job! When I use the wet/dry feature it&#x27;s just because my hair is damp and I don&#x27;t have the time to dry it 100% of the way. I don&#x27;t expect the iron to dry my hair but it DOES flatten and curl it even while damp when I use that button. My hair comes out shiny and lovely in a flash with this iron. Not really any ripping or damage at all. Of course I use a leave in conditioner/volumizer before I heat style my hair and I set it to a heat setting of \\&quot;15\\&quot;. Great buy for a reasonable price, love the curve of the plates and even the red color and look of the appliance. I wouldn&#x27;t trade it in for a more expensive Chi or whatever even if I were rich!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and it is a wonderful hair straightener.  The straightening plates are 2\\&quot;, which provides a larger surface area and reduces the amount of time needed to complete your hair. At the same time, the plates are rounded and provide just the right amount of body to your hair as opposed to traditional flat straightening plates.</li>
    <li> Before I tell about the problems I&#x27;ve had with this straightener, I need to mention that I absolutely LOVE the design. The curved plates are awesome for giving volume at the roots and flipping my layers out or under. It makes (well, made) my thick, wavy, frizzy hair extremely straight and shiny, and the price is nice and low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I guess you get what you pay for when quality is concerned. The \\&quot;ceramic technology\\&quot; they spout on the package simply means the plates are ceramic *coated*, not solid ceramic. Fine with me, except about a month after I purchased it, the coating was already wearing away on the plates! I only use it about three or four times a week, so it&#x27;s not like I was putting unusual stress on it. I&#x27;ve continued to use it for the last year and a half, however, and haven&#x27;t had any additional problems until recently. There seems to be something wrong with the heating mechanism now, because I went to use it the other day, and when I touched it to my hair, it literally sizzled and singed the section I had in it on contact! Now I have this ugly frizzy spot right next to my face that I am just praying will grow out quickly. I used it a couple times after that, testing on my ends before putting it through my hair (getting a haircut soon, so no big loss if they singe), and have had the same thing happen about 25% of the time. I&#x27;ve since been wearing my hair in a ponytail and am shopping for a new flat iron (with SOLID ceramic plates!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had these issues, but it really does make me sad that mine started falling apart so early on, because the design really is great. Too bad :(</li>
    <li> This flat iron is excellent for your real hair. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot so it will not damage your hair. If you are buying this to use with a weave or wig you better buy something else, usually the cheaper the hotter. The coating on this iron is very durable as I have had it for 5 years now and it has never peeled or anything and I use it about 2 times per week. You can use it on damp hair and dry hair and it works both ways. It will leave your hair very soft and manageable and will not dry it out. I love it, but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars as, even though it has a temperature selector, it cannot get hot enough to use on my weaves (I like to change my style up sometimes). Also, the cord is not very long so you have to have an outlet close by your mirror. If you only need this for your natural hair and you don&#x27;t want to buy something expensive this is an excellent choice for you.         PROS: Ceramic        Not very hot (won&#x27;t damage your hair)        Durable (has been working for over 5 years and going)            Swivel cord (so it won&#x27;t get shortage, never had a prob in 5 years)        Big (can cover a large area in a small time)    CONS: Cord a bit short (shorter than a cheap one my friend gave me)        Doesn&#x27;t get very hot (not good for human hair weaves or wigs)</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for my daughter and found myself using it all the time. Its curved surface makes it easy to flip your hair out at the ends. If you turn it over, flip your hair under , or keep it perfectly staight. It has a dial to adjust how much heat  and a switch to straighten wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> ....that this is the third one I&#x27;ve purchased. I wore the other two slap out after about four years of use apiece. To date I&#x27;ve not found another straightener with a curved barrel (I LOVE that feature) and I&#x27;ve not found one of such great quality/functionality at so low a price point. Conair makes a great haircare product.</li>
    <li> I had been using the [[ASIN:B00006K112 Conair CS15TCS Professional Straight Styles Straightening Iron]] for a few years that I originally bought because it was inexpensive and worked fairly for seldom use on long hair.     Because my hair is short and I style it more precisely now it is imperative that the ends of my hair do not flip out and hang very straight, so I thought I would try this after I borrowed my friend&#x27;s.   Well, it worked like a charm! Now I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time blow drying and styling my hair with a round brush because this straightener really does most of the work. (Now I only have to use the round brush and dryer for volume.)    Pros:    * Heats quickly  * Maintains temperature  * Easy to handle and grasp  * Long cord that swivels to reduce tangling  * Can be used on wet to dry hair   * Low cost; Excellent value!  * Does what is says!      Cons:    * On the hotter settings (Levels 25-30), the plates are so hot that I am not able to grasp the unit nearer to the top for better control. But this is probably due to the design (the vents for use on wet hair release a lot of heat).       Some things to keep in mind:    This straightener was $25 and made in China, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to have the quality or life expectancy of a $150 straightener. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is \\&quot;chintzy,\\&quot; though.  For the price and the results, the value is excellent!    Also, this unit gets very hot on the higher settings! So hot that it will burn some people&#x27;s hair, especially if it is thin, dry, or brittle. Of course, that is the price you pay for heat styling, so proper precautions should be taken (conditioners, heat protection lotions/serum, etc).</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakage like other irons I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t work well on wet hair - it takes a long time.  I found I can blow dry my hair and use the iron in less time.  Overall a good product and concept.  My main problem is the quality.  The first one I purchased lasted a year and then over heated causing my hair to burn, the unit started smoking setting off the smoke alarm and shooting sparks out the cord.  The second unit last about 6 months and this one quit heating up.  It got warm to the touch but nothing more.  Overall I am happy because of the price and how it makes my hair look everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this when my CHI died.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money to replace it so based on the reviews I thought I would give this a try.  It&#x27;s no CHI but it gets the job done.  It heats up quickly and straightens pretty well.  The only real difference is that it doesn&#x27;t curl as well as the CHI.  Overall, it&#x27;s worth the price and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> We purchhased the straightener in February and it stopped working by March 15th.The warranty is only 30 days so we are out of luck buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I just got this product and I love it.  The curved plates helps curl my ends under but not much it is just right.  I had bought a straightener recently for $150.00 and it did not work that great for the money so I returned it.  This one was so much cheaper and works like a charm.  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased the 2in Chi flat iron and was not totally wild about it as it was a little bit cumbersome and I am not adept at turning the hair under with it. I then saw this one and decided to try it. I have returned the Chi iron to Bed Bath Beyond where I purchased it for about $180. I like this one better because it is lighter (therefor easier to use) and it is much easier to turn hair under at the ends with the curved feature (that is my favorite feature). I find no difference in the looks of my hair. I have not tried to use it with wet or damp hair yet, but couldn&#x27;t do that with the Chi anyway. I have very thick shoulder length hair. I used both irons on close to the highest temperature and they worked equally well and quickly. I decided that for the price that I paid here for this iron, that even if it does not last for a long time, I can buy another one several times over before spending as much as the Chi had cost and I like this better anyway!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a cheaper iron on Amazon recently and it was awful. Wasnt expecting much when I ordered this. Much to my surprise it works really good! I have had several compliments on my hair since I started using it. Love the wet to dry setting, as I use that every time. It heats up in no time and straightens nicely. I like the flip idea, or you can just make it straight. I cannot justify paying for a chi, but this is a good iron, that doesn&#x27;t cost alot. If it breaks, you can buy 4 or 5 of them for the price of one Chi!</li>
    <li> This strighter seems to work realy well,    I dont know what the deal is with the vents though,   they dont realy do anything, because they are located too close to the edges to seemingly actuly do   anything,      Overall, the streigtner is great!!!    I recomend this one to buy.   Very good buy</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, i bougth tis   product for my sister, and just work ONE TIME...  AND AFTER THAT .. NO MORE....  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I received this only 3 days after purchasing it on Amazon.com and I was thrilled when it came. I read many excellent reviews and thought it was worth a shot. I have thick, naturally wavy long hair, so anything that claims to make styling easier, I&#x27;ll try. I first tried it out of the shower- I rung my hair out and glided it through- it didn&#x27;t do much except steam a little bit and left my hair just scorching hot and damp. I tried it for about 10 minutes with no success. I finally ended up just blow drying my hair and then using it after my hair was dried.     It glides easily on dry hair and straightens it nicely with a slight curve at the ends. Be careful when pulling hair through the iron, since stands can get stuck on the sides of the plate and your hair can be pulled out. All in all it&#x27;s a nice straightener- but only when your hair is dry.     If you are looking for the wet to dry aspect- go for the Remington Wet 2 Straight iron- it works fabulous!</li>
    <li> It was a good price but broken a few months later. Just stopped heating up. Idk if id recommend this.....</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I have wavy hair and everytime I had tried an iron it let my ends look so straight and I do not like it, and with this iron I am able to set my ends the way I want it. It gives you shine and it is good to be able to use it when your hair it is not completely dry.    I recommed it...</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for a couple of years now and have liked it, but recently when i plugged it into the outlet, there was a loud popping sound and a spark flared (from the outlet) causing me to have to  reset the outlet.  We just built our house last year and honestly I wondered if there was a problem with the outlet (however I&#x27;ve never had a problem before).  The straightener still worked, so I continued to use it, although it made me nervous.  A couple of days ago, I turned it on and this time a loud popping sound and a flare came happened within the actual straightener (where the irons are) and it died.  I searched online to see if there had been a recall, because obviously this could be a safety hazard. I haven&#x27;t found a recall but saw that another reviewer had the same thing happen.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this straightener due to this safety issue.  I noticed it&#x27;s no longer sold at Target where I bought it, although again I bought it two years ago or so.</li>
    <li> this is the best hot iron my four daughters&amp;i have ever bought.and we have bought at least 10!the reason we knew about this paticular one is because one of my daughters friends brought it over.love it,enjoy.well worth the 28dollars we paid for it.we have spent alot more $ on the other brands but this was awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past. Great product, but my last one only lasted about a year...hoping this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener over a year ago when I had long hair. I&#x27;ll admit I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I was supposed to use it, so I put it on the shelf and forgot about it until recently when I cut my hair shorter. WOW! It&#x27;s amazing! I always dry my hair completely with a hair dryer before using my straightener, because I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair. I just love the way it flips my hair under or out and it stays like that all day! I am getting another one just incase anything happens to mine! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter.  She liked the feature of it being used for wet or dry hair.  Would reccomend this for anyone who styles hair.</li>
    <li> Hair is fine and straight . I was hoping it would hold loft a little longer and get a little hotter.but is does come in handy for my straight hair. I have since switched to steam rollers for more body in less time</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Love the straightener.... it has the bend for a slight twirl at the end of the  hair which makes the end result of the hair amazing!!!  i have super thick hair and gives the right amount of volume without making it look too flat!!  I love CONAIR products!</li>
    <li> Never used one before today &amp; didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;d found such a good deal ~ my friend likes it much better than her current (&amp; more expensive) one, so I&#x27;m back to order a 2nd.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 months now. I have very thick hair and have used this nearly every day. I am very happy! It works great! I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the coating coming off the plates and I LOVE the curved surface!! So versatile! I will say I do not use it on it&#x27;s hottest setting and I do not really use it with products in my hair...I wonder if that would effect the coating coming off the surface as other reviews said happened?? I do not think I could ever buy another straightener that doesn&#x27;t have the curved surfaces...it&#x27;s my favorite feature!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener is a good product for an inexpensive price.  The fact that you can \\&quot;flip\\&quot; the ends of your hair is a nice touch.  It doesn&#x27;t give your hair that \\&quot;just been straightened by an iron look\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Love this iron. I have long frizzy hair and this was the fastest iron wet/dry.  I just accidentally broke mine it was stuck under the couch and broke and now I cannot find another one.  Need to find one ASAP.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightner, its amazing.....this is the best product i have ever used so far. It suits to my Indian long hair. My friends love it and a couple of them have ordered it after seeing mine. I got it for just $20 and its been working excellent since last 1 and half years. I have no complains about this product.</li>
    <li> I love this one and now I am saying goodbye due to the fact that it died on me this week! I have to say though I have had this product for over 7yrs and never had a problem with it till now! I love the design and I cant find this item any more. Best cheaper version to the chi in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I use this on my trips to south america were humidity its at the highest and it work wonders on my hair this and a good hair serum I was sleek and nice the hole day</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all right. My only straight iron, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can tell you this:&lt;br /&gt;1) It sometimes pulls hair out of my head, which I don&#x27;t like, and&lt;br /&gt;2) The ends of my hair get damaged when I use it, and I always use a spray-on protector with it.&lt;br /&gt;I thought these things were supposed to be better for your hair than curling irons, but this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> this was junk only lasted a year and my daughter didn&#x27;t like it even when it did work so we found different ones</li>
</ol>
