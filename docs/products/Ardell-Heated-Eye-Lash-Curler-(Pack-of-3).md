      <li>I love to curl my eyelashes</li>
      <li>Bought one of these eyelash curlers so many years ago when there was no selection.  </li>
      <li>My favorite eye lash curler.  </li>
      <li>And yes, eventually the top part will crack and catch your eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I use this product on a daily basis and the fact that there are three in the purchase is an excellent buy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE 3 PACK</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better brand.</li>
      <li>i am so glad this product comes in pkg.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this out</li>
      <li>but when it is hot does a good job.</li>
      <li>Shipped out very quickly too :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works fine, just not one of my favorite models for a heated lash curler.</li>
      <li>Warms up quickly &amp; easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Regardless of what some reviewers wrote, I found them fairly easy to use.</li>
      <li>The curler was comfortable in my hand and was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This works fine for what it is.  </li>
      <li>But the job it does is SUPER!</li>
      <li>I am 57 years old and what used to be full, wonderful lashes have thinned and become straight.</li>
      <li>It is a great quick natural beautification.</li>
      <li>It works best if you have a little mascara on before using it.  </li>
      <li>It was available in drugstores.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.</li>
      <li>It does get warm enough to curl but it doesn&#x27;t get as warm as it used to, which curled for hours.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing this excellent performing and reasonably priced curler again.</li>
      <li>I use it both before and after mascara application (waiting until firmly-tacky and VERY carefully pull it away to not tear out lashes), as well as the morning of second-day-mascara which allows a brilliant degree of laziness for a mascara-only girl.</li>
      <li>Love this eyelash curler so much!</li>
      <li>I say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
      <li>it actually had for the most a very good review, however after trying all 3 of the items I recieved not a single one of them warmed up.</li>
      <li>I bought this lash curler at a trade show, as a trade show special for $1.</li>
      <li>so much I got one for her Christmas stocking :)</li>
      <li>and I want to quickly curl my lashes.</li>
      <li>The curler heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>The price was rigiht and there were 3 of the curlers..should last me so many more years.</li>
      <li>It might be better to invest in one that costs a little more but is more reliable.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t hot enough to leave a good curl.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty sturdy!</li>
      <li>The three pack is a great bargain and each eyelash curler lasts a few years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d wonder if it would burn me) and it was actually curling my lashes with no effort of my own.</li>
      <li>the price it was worth a try&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>They are worth it though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i get a more natural curl from mechanical curlers</li>
      <li>No other model was anywhere near as good</li>
      <li>Then I curled my right lash for about 8 secs</li>
      <li>Received yesterday and used right away just to try out -</li>
      <li>It curls like a dream and really gives me a boost of confidence being able to get nicely curled lashes every time with so much ease - 1000 times better than the metal type curlers I&#x27;ve used in the past!</li>
      <li>but luckily he was able to put the pieces back together</li>
      <li>Quality isn&#x27;t always the greatest as far as lasting, some last longer than others.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian with very straight hair and lashes.</li>
      <li>comes exactly as packaged.</li>
      <li>the second one is doing okay.  </li>
      <li>I love this and will definitely buy it again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis and the fact that there are three in the purchase is an excellent buy.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this brand before and It seems to hold up fairly well.  The heat is a good level for accomplishing what you want.  Gives you a nice curl.</li>
    <li> The curler heats up quickly. I recommend using rechargeable batteries. My lashes look amazing with this curler with no damage.</li>
    <li> When it said &amp;#34;pack of three&amp;#34; I assumed it was talking about the curling pads -- but it was three whole heaters...IOW: you get what you pay for which is not much. You have to hold the &amp;#34;on button&amp;#34; the entire time you are waiting for it to heat up, it then kinks your lashes rather than curls them, and even the crappy kink doesn&#x27;t last. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
    <li> the one i had before this was also a cheapie, but it had an on/off switch, and worked nicely.  the problem with IT, was the case cracked down by the battery compartment, and i couldn&#x27;t keep the battery door on anymore.  now THESE, do NOT have an on/off switch, you have to hold the curler closed to heat it up, then use it.  the first of the three that i tried would not heat up sufficiently for use.  the second one is doing okay.  it&#x27;s just a pain that i have to sit there and hold it for it to heat up.  definitely will NOT be my choice next time.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best eyelash curler I have ever used and I have tried a plethora of them! It sits nicely on the lid, doesn&#x27;t pinch and creates a beautiful, natural looking curl that lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t create a kink in my lashes like some with a metal curling piece do. It heats up well even with the rechargeable batteries I use. I have been using this product for years and can get 6 to 9 months or more out of one with everyday use. I will definitely be purchasing this excellent performing and reasonably priced curler again.</li>
    <li> I love this item.. use it everyday, gave one to my sister and she loves it too.. does not damage my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Really works on my lashes...I am 57 years old and what used to be full, wonderful lashes have thinned and become straight. This thing curls them and they stay curled all day. Use as instructed and it works...</li>
    <li> I had to return this. Product didn&#x27;t heat up enough to at least make a difference plus the opening was so small it&#x27;s difficult to maneuver you lashes in and get a good curl.</li>
    <li> I have tried this several different times, It just doesn&#x27;t seem to curl good I&#x27;ve had it on as long as 30 seconds if not longer.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and love them.  My complaint is that when some of them don&#x27;t work it isn&#x27;t that great of a deal.</li>
    <li> This heated curler is totally useless, does not get hot enough. Wastage of my money. I am sticking to my regular Mac lash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 10/07/13: Yup found it lying at the back of my drawer and tried it out again....same story. Also, instead of curling my lashes uniformly, it actually crimped and clumped the lases in the middle of my eye.  The ends of my lashes don&#x27;t get curled anyways, and when I try to do the ends, it ends up ruining the curled areas! Ugh!! Maybe for someone with smaller eyes but definitely not for me.  Back it goes..to the dark corner of my drawer. As for it being a heated curler...the temp gets barely warm. Duh!</li>
    <li> I bought this lash curler at a trade show, as a trade show special for $1. I wish then I had the foresight to buy more! I have since bought a number of them as well as another (more expensive) brand. This one, though over time the price has increased, is by far the best one for the money. Quality isn&#x27;t always the greatest as far as lasting, some last longer than others. My first one lasted the longest. But the job it does is SUPER! Any make-up artist will tell you never to curl lashes with mascara on them. It can break off and pull out the lashes. Also, to preserve your lashes, always, always remove eye make-up before sleeping. Your lashes can break off overnight, and using a cheaper grade (some of the expensive ones aren&#x27;t higher grade) mascara can cause lashes to become brittle and break. I hold the heat on my lashes from 10-20 seconds per eye, then apply my mascara and it works great! For those of you who say it crimps the lashes, back off, don&#x27;t hold it so tightly against the lashes. It will work. I even gave one to my niece and she LOVES it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a different brand of curler that I had lost. This curler did not heat well and the curl does not hold. I miss the old curler which was a Trim, but they seem to have stopped making that one since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better brand.</li>
    <li> this eyelash curler was a waste of money. it&#x27;s the first \\&quot;heated eyelash curler\\&quot; ive tried so idk if others would work but this one doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> This is the only lash curler I have found that actually works on my lashes. Ardell heated eye lash curler is priced better than other products and heats up enough to actually curl stubborn lashes. I&#x27;ve tried several products and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought the three pack as a backup for the one I already have.  I have had this one for at least 5 years and changed the battery only once.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It works great!!! I don&#x27;t curl my eyelash everyday, so it&#x27;s hard to curl, but when I curl using this product, it curls a lot faster than any of my other curlers.</li>
    <li> Warmed up but it wasn&#x27;t hot enough to leave a good curl. I did leave it on my lashes for about a minute +&lt;br /&gt;I had 3 of them...they are all in the garbage!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Easy to use. Value for money. I have tried many,this one is by far the best! Gives a gear curl to the lashes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does take a few minutes to heat up, which I typically don&#x27;t have in the mornings, but it does work well. It does not rip out your lashes like some regular curlers. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Works like they say it does.  I don&#x27;t use it every day but will be giving some of them away as Christmas presents, as well.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic little thing!  I&#x27;m over the moon about this curlers.  Received yesterday and used right away just to try out - my lashes are still holding the curl 18 hours later, even without mascara.  For the last few years, my lashes have thinned, straightened and were growing sort of every which way, so much that they even bothered my sight!  I&#x27;m 65 now, and even after upper lid surgery there was not much improvement in getting my lashes out of my line of vision.  I had tried 4 or 5 different regular curlers, and even tried heating the curler over the flame of a lighter (not recommended!).  Yesterday when I first experimented, I really put some pressure on these, used them like the old curlers, and got a really sharp curl.  Next time, I know I can just hold firmly for a few seconds for a more natural curl.  Should have bought these years ago!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have very long spindly lashes and was using a regular lash curler for years which never really curled my lashes.  I went looking on Amazon for a heated lash curler and found this one.  This product is great!  If you use it properly it will curl your lashes and they will stay even without mascara!  What I did was I heated it for about 10 seconds first.  Then I curled my right lash for about 8 secs and then my left for 8 secs. That time I did not put on any makeup and several hours later I noticed the curl was still there!  Then the next morning the curl was still there! I also like that it doesn&#x27;t really get too hot because I was afraid of burning my eyes, skin or lashes.  I would recommend this product to anyone! I keep one in my bathroom, and one in my travel kit and plan to give one to my sister.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever purchased--especially since the last time I did, I gave the other 2 to friends (mine has since broken) though it is plastic and can break.  When I tried to re-order however, (1) is now the same price I paid for 3!</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BEST HEATED EYELASH CURLERS. I LOVE THE 3 PACK AND WHEN MY FRIENDS ASK ME HOW MY EYELASHES STAY SO CURLY, I TELL THEM ABOUT THIS EYELASH CURLER AND GIFT THEM WITH ONE.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these things - have been using them for years on a daily basis - work wonders to curl my normally straight eyelashes for hours.  Used to use a regular eye lash curler, once I got my hands on the heated version I have never looked back!</li>
    <li> have used these for years!  One only that will curl my straight, stubborn lashes.  Used to purchase under Subscribe &#x27;n Save.  And yes, eventually the top part will crack and catch your eyelid.  But, still the best ever. Will need to eventualy reorder, but disappointed to see how expensive the shipping is......  Found much cheaper on Drugstore.com....</li>
    <li> A few years back, I was using this same Ardell eyelash curler. It died on me after so much use. When I searched, I couldn&#x27;t ever find a &amp;#34;heated&amp;#34; eyelash curler anywhere, or this same brand for that matter. None of the local beauty supply stores had them, Walgreens didn&#x27;t have them. So recently I searched on Amazon and FOUND IT. I&#x27;m so ecstatic, this thing is awesome, and for the . A few words of caution, however:&lt;br /&gt;1.  NEVER get it wet.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Hold the switch for at least 20-30 seconds to warm it up before using. (I usually occupy this time by brushing my teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;3.  I recommend crimping at the base of your eyelash, then slowly (but gently) pulling the curler. Stop curling just before you reach the ends of your lashes, because they will ferociously curl at the ends! If you pull the curler and ease into the middle of the lash, the curl will look more natural instead of extreme! Just my two cents!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this product: it&#x27;s clunkier than I expected and my lashes don&#x27;t fit well- the shape feels too flat. I&#x27;ve had these curlers for a long time, and waited to do the review; it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d buy again. It&#x27;s not convenient, in that you can&#x27;t throw into your bag and head out the door. It is safe though- they made sure there was no way for the heat to start without actually pressing and holding down</li>
    <li> It takes forever to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;You have to hold it in place to heat it up.&lt;br /&gt;Does not curl eyelashes very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to heating my regular eyelash curler up with the blow dryer; this method works much better.</li>
    <li> takes a while to heat up; you have to hold it for about a minute but when it is hot does a good job. comes exactly as packaged.</li>
    <li> The curler was comfortable in my hand and was easy to use.  It performed without having any difficulties.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Was so excited when I read the other review&#x27;s of this product, thinking I could finally find a way to get my lashes to curl. This product is okay, but it does no better for me than a regular eyelash curler that does not require batteries.</li>
    <li> I use to find these in stores and then they vanished, I ordered another brand online and they were awful, thankfully I found my favorite ones on Amazon, I bought 6 just to make sure I have them on hand. LOVE the way they curl my lashes.</li>
    <li> This item works great! I have no complaints I never knew there was such a thing until I  was browsing the makeup.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this in the stores at least 15 times. It always was a curler that would last a few months and needed new batteries every week, but it still did it&#x27;s job well when it was working. Then, it became impossible to find in stores. I purchased it on Amazon, and although it is the same product, the packaging looked a bit different than in the stores. It doesn&#x27;t heat up as well, so they may have changed something. It does get warm enough to curl but it doesn&#x27;t get as warm as it used to, which curled for hours. It might be better to invest in one that costs a little more but is more reliable. It&#x27;s still better than a regular non-heated curler.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;ll buy more, too!!</li>
    <li> i am so glad this product comes in pkg. of 3......it&#x27;s great for curiing lashes and does NOT pull them out however you need 3 as before long the top cross bar splits......super glue doesn&#x27;t hold it for long &amp; you have to change batteries frequently.</li>
    <li> Received 3 heated eyelash curlers for just over $12. However, they are the quality you would expect, not the best, but they do the job. When one breaks you have another, of course until you get to the last one.</li>
    <li> I have been looking in stores for this eyelash curler for months.  My last one was about to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these curlers.  They keep my lashes curled all day long.</li>
    <li> Hardly makes sense to spend $$ on a cheap plastic eyelash curler - when I discovered I could heat my metal eyelash curler with the blow dryer and get the same effect!</li>
    <li> I ordered six of this product.  I love to curl my eyelashes and this is the perfect way to do it!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, good product for the price and nice to have a 3-pack.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler so much! It curls like a dream and really gives me a boost of confidence being able to get nicely curled lashes every time with so much ease - 1000 times better than the metal type curlers I&#x27;ve used in the past! My husband accidentally knocked mine off the mantelpiece and it smashed on the bricks (I was so upset!) but luckily he was able to put the pieces back together and it&#x27;s still working - so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty sturdy! I am buying one for my sister, friend and Mum as I think this little tool is life-changing :)</li>
    <li> This is sold at Fred Meyer stores for $9. It is the only heated curler I&#x27;ve ever used. I like that it both crimps like a standard curler AND heats. I use it both before and after mascara application (waiting until firmly-tacky and VERY carefully pull it away to not tear out lashes), as well as the morning of second-day-mascara which allows a brilliant degree of laziness for a mascara-only girl. It gives a very dramatic curl when used on barely dry mascara. I blast it with cold air after if possible (car AC usually), or hold the lashes up with my finger until cooled. It&#x27;s soooo tempting to try a wand brand. I&#x27;ll update to compare if I do. I say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> If zero stars were an option, that would be my rating.  Very difficult to use (have used the standard metal curler since I was 16) and did not noticeably heat up.  Use your blow dryer on a regular metal curler, real results!</li>
    <li> This works for when I get ready at the gym and I want to quickly curl my lashes. My lashes stay curled. It is a great quick natural beautification.</li>
    <li> Great curler love that it heats up and does a great job. Had the same model and lost it when my bag was stolen. No other model was anywhere near as good</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is a waste of time and money.  It does not work at all even when following the directions to a T.  This is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had been using this eye lash curler for years.  It was available in drugstores. $12.00 for one. Then it disappeared off the shelves. It is a wonderful invention. Getting 3 for the price is a great deal. I found that in using the heated eye lash curler gave me more control than using the metal curler and your eye lashes hold the curl longer.  I am so glad that I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This works fine for what it is.  It works best if you have a little mascara on before using it.  I kept 2 of them and gave the 3rd one away.  The first one never worked again after the first battery died.  The second one seems to be doing OK.  It is on the second battery now.  The annoying part is that you have to hold it to get it to warm up.  I suppose they do this to keep you from forgetting to turn it off, but I had rather turn it on then when it is ready use it and not have to hold it while I am waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fine, just not one of my favorite models for a heated lash curler.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this out it actually had for the most a very good review, however after trying all 3 of the items I recieved not a single one of them warmed up. I can assure you batteries were new and in correct position, but no heat at all as if there is a missing connection. The bar is supposed to change color but it did not. I will stick to the old fashioned eye lash curlers!</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 pack and the first one broke in three days of receiving the package. The second broke two weeks later. By this time I gave up. This product does not curl your lashes, it barely can cling to life long enough to work.</li>
    <li> Great product! Wish they still sold these in stores. Shipped out very quickly too :)</li>
    <li> Bought one of these eyelash curlers so many years ago when there was no selection.  Mine finally gave out and tried to find one again.  Of course Amazon would have it.  The price was rigiht and there were 3 of the curlers..should last me so many more years.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying these. I have straight lashes, but with this heated lash curler you would never know it! I won&#x27;t ever do without one again. My sister liked mine so much I got one for her Christmas stocking :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a heated curler like this after my kids broke my previous one by using it as a pretend phone. This is just like the one before and it works very well for me. I don&#x27;t even have to wait for it to completely heats up. It curls my lashes without any pinching which I always get from all the other curlers. This is the only curler that keeps my lashes curled all day. I just love it. This is the only one I will use. I am so glad I have 3 of them.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought of using heat to curl your lashes! Makes sense you curl your hair, but boy!  What a difference this makes!  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Having short, thin lashes I was worried that these wouldn&#x27;t work for me, but they do!  Regardless of what some reviewers wrote, I found them fairly easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. I buy them in multiples because they do eventually get hairline cracks that can pinch your skin. They are worth it though. I just think of them as a makeup product I need to replace when it &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; out. I use this on my lashes before mascara. I&#x27;m Caucasian with very straight hair and lashes. This is the only curler I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
    <li> This lash curler has a very sharp plastic edge where your lashes get crimped. It does not even feel warm to the touch. I would give it a Zero star rating if I could.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye lash curler.  Best one I have purchased</li>
    <li> Warms up quickly &amp; easy to use. Works great. 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought. 1st lasted a couple years before it broke. Tried a different kind of heated eyelash curler &amp; hated it. Burned through batteries quickly, took forever to heat up &amp; barely worked. Ardell is the best.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler for the price, can&#x27;t beat it!  The three pack is a great bargain and each eyelash curler lasts a few years.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to work.&lt;br /&gt;Before I am finished applying mascara the curl is gone.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Used it few times&lt;br /&gt;It bends my lashes instead of curling them&lt;br /&gt;i get a more natural curl from mechanical curlers&lt;br /&gt;For the price it was worth a try&lt;br /&gt;Will give the other 2 as gifts, hopefully they will have better luck</li>
    <li> You tube video helpful in deciding which one to order. Was pleasantly surprised that price included a 3 pack. Gave two as gifts! Would buy again. Seller prompt! Eyelashes stayed curled all day!</li>
    <li> At first I was wondering, how am I suppose to get my lashes into this?I moved it around my eyes trying to get my lashes and thought, &amp;#34;This is weird.&amp;#34; I went on youtube and saw some reviews and after I figured out how to use it it was really nice. I could feel the warmth coming from my curler(not so hot I&#x27;d wonder if it would burn me) and it was actually curling my lashes with no effort of my own. They look really natural and it didn&#x27;t hurt to use the curler. The price is also outstanding, one of these babies are about $12 for one. I love this and will definitely buy it again.</li>
