      <li>Easy to &amp;#34;thaw&amp;#34; out by just putting the bottle in warm water for 5 minutes.</li>

      <li>Coconut Oil has many benefits for skin and hair.</li>
      <li>I love this coconut oil.</li>
      <li>The label says unscented, and it is mostly unscented in application</li>
      <li>Totally safe and non chemical.  </li>
      <li>I love the feel of coconut oil.</li>
      <li>Amazon is the best place to buy the Fiji products because anywhere else you will be paying double the price.</li>
      <li>I ordered all the Fiji products, the lotion, the soap, I love the soap and can&#x27;t wait to get the lotion and try it.</li>
      <li>I love how shiny it makes my hair</li>
      <li>I had to cut the top off to get any out.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, and after I wash my hair, I like to apply this and massage it in at the scalp and then put more throughout my curls</li>
      <li>I just unscrew the top and squeeze into my hand, so no biggie.</li>
      <li>I have many tattoos and use this to moisturize.</li>
      <li>I knew better but thought I would give it a try.</li>
      <li>Great for adding to bath for soft skin and no ring</li>
      <li>Great price AND organic all natural product.</li>
      <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t too appealing although it said fragrance free.</li>
      <li>Just what you would expect from a quality coconut oil nothing less and more important, nothing more... (expect the coconut scent and hardening below 76F) Perfect!</li>
      <li>This is a dream come true!  </li>
      <li>Not a bad thing at all in my book!</li>
      <li>Would not recommend for easy use by elderly for this reason.  </li>
      <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
      <li>The coconut oil itself seems fine.</li>
      <li>They are amazing and pure products.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;d allow the oil to come out smoothly.</li>
      <li>and it looks great, with a hint of shine left in it.</li>
      <li>That said, it does say scent free on the label but there is a hint of coconut smell.  </li>
      <li>Even though it does say fragrance free, it does have the slightest smell of coconut.</li>
      <li>I liked this product but the bottle was not practible especially when the oil solidifies and you need to warm it up to get it out.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>- that was until we took it out of the original container.  </li>
      <li>In the winter it&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Works great on dry skin in winter months as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean and pure!!</li>
      <li>Love product, works really well for all types of skin.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic daily moisturizer, has also reversed and healed severely dry and cracked heals and is awesome as a lip balm.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin</li>
      <li>delivered quickly...</li>
      <li>This product will thicken if not left in a warm place.</li>
      <li>It feels so good to put on when you just get out of the shower while you are still wet so it can soak into your skin.</li>
      <li>This product is nice, but it definitely is not &amp;#34;fragrance Free&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>The aroma alone will leave no doubts that every cent spent on it, is in facts a good</li>
      <li>You know when you buy it that it is solid at room temp and that you have to warm it up to liquify it, but that&#x27;s a pain to do and get right.</li>
      <li>Great product, just have to warm it up some when its chilly at room temp.</li>
      <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product for its many uses for skin and hair!</li>
      <li>I have a large tub of coconut oil, but I got this squeeze bottle to keep in the shower (which stays warm enough to keep it between a semi-solid to outright liquefying it when the shower is running) - MUCH easier to wrangle the squeeze bottle in the shower.</li>
      <li>It sinks into my skin very quickly to be honest and does not give me any irritations.</li>
      <li>I was running it under hot water during the winter to thaw the oil.</li>
      <li>The cooler your room temperature is, the more solid the oil will become.</li>
      <li>so EVERY time you use it you have to melt it under hot water or use the microwave.</li>
      <li>It gets solid when the temperature drops under 70 degrees, so I make sure I put it under the water while I shower or run it by the sink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just went back several weeks ago to get another bottle. It went on my unaffordable list. Sad to see that the price had actually doubled. Within weeks of using this coconut oil, my skin has become softer. After using it in my hair, it seems to restore the shine and make it manageable. This product will thicken if not left in a warm place.Lol. I was running it under hot water during the winter to thaw the oil. An excellent product with a light scent of coconut not to assail the senses, but is there. Organic and excellent. Highly recommended to pregnant women and those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Bought as recommended moisturizer for HCG weight loss protocol. Fantastic daily moisturizer, has also reversed and healed severely dry and cracked heals and is awesome as a lip balm.</li>
    <li> Visibly un-processed and of excellent quality. Leaves no over-powering scents. Solidifies at room temperature because it doesn&#x27;t have any additives. Easy to &amp;#34;thaw&amp;#34; out by just putting the bottle in warm water for 5 minutes. Feels great on my skin and absorbs quickly with no residue. I&#x27;ve used it to shave and it moisturizes skin and helps reduce cuts and bumps.</li>
    <li> This item was very difficult to squeeze out of the bottle, you had to warm it up.  The scent wasn&#x27;t too appealing although it said fragrance free.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find moisturizers for your skin and hair that contain Pure Organic Coconut Oil, and with just one ingredient: Organic Cold Pressed Coconut Oil, this bottle is very precious! The Coconut Oil in this bottle from Organic Fiji is wonderful to the skin and hair. Before usage, I put the bottle in a warm container, so the oil is heated. My favorite usage from this oil is to use it as a moisturizer on my hair, and it works perfectly. It makes my hair very shiny and super pillowy soft. I have curly hair, and after I wash my hair, I like to apply this and massage it in at the scalp and then put more throughout my curls and then I braid them and when I wake up in the morning, my hair is ready to go after I take it out and it looks great, with a hint of shine left in it. I like how the only ingredient in this is Coconut Oil. Coconut Oil has many benefits for skin and hair. For hair, it makes it soft and shiny and increases hair growth when massaged into the scalp. I have a jar of Coconut Oil in which I massage into my hair each night, but it has many other ingredients like Mineral Oil with is harsh on the hair, so I am glad that there is a Coconut Oil moisturizer with only Organic Coconut Oil as its only ingredient. For skin, I like to use this mainly in the morning after I cleanse my skin. I use it and treat it as a day moisturizer and it is incredibly delicate on my skin. It sinks into my skin very quickly to be honest and does not give me any irritations. Overall, I highly recommend this product for its many uses for skin and hair!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product because it is not smooth and have a lot of particles in it and hardens like a rock</li>
    <li> Excellent product, easy to apply and absorbs quickly into skin. Not greasy.  Moisturizers dry skin for an entire day. Works wonderfully on hair, and is easy to wash out. I will buy this product again.  Worth the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this item and have used it for about a week now. Have dry skin and this lotion really moisturizes well. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent and uses natural ingredients while moisturizing without clogging my pores. I use it everyday and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> delivered quickly...product is great...i use it as a leave in conditioner because I can have frizzy hair...need only a dime amount so it should last a long time. If you put too much your hair may look greasy so you need to assess for yourself.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried coconut oil, this is a good one. It&#x27;s clean and pure!! The BEST skin moisturizer and &#x27;believe it or not&amp;#34; a great natural sunscreen!! SPF 20-28. Apply every 2 hours. Will give you an unbelievable tan, Try it!</li>
    <li> This is a is a great product. I have many tattoos and use this to moisturize. Couldn&#x27;t be happier, it has a subtle scent of coconut which isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for dry skin.  It does have a slight coconut smell that goes away after a bit.  And even works as a sunscreen too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil. It works better than expensive moisturizers and is soo good for you. Totally safe and non chemical.  Before using this my skin would be scaly and dry by mid day, but not anymore. I can even go a day without using it and my skin still feels soft and hydrated. I even use this coconut oil as a deodorant by applying a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though: It gets solid when the temperature drops under 70 degrees, so I make sure I put it under the water while I shower or run it by the sink.</li>
    <li> Ugh!  I had to cut the top off to get any out.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil for your skin.  I use it as soon as I get out of the shower.  You have to run it under hot water, because it does stay solid, but liquefies very quickly. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin oh so soft! Even though it does say fragrance free, it does have the slightest smell of coconut. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best eye make up remover and hair conditioner ever. Works great on dry skin in winter months as well.</li>
    <li> Great for adding to bath for soft skin and no ring and it is ORGANIC! Great stuff! Not slimy, no fragance, just pure wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> Helps moisturize dry skin</li>
    <li> This is a great natural moisturizer - pleasant (very light) coconut scent.  Only bad side is how thin (and prone to mess) it is. But a little oil on the floor is worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is nice, but it definitely is not &amp;#34;fragrance Free&amp;#34;. It has fairly potent&lt;br /&gt;coconut fragrance which make me want to eat this oil. The description should&lt;br /&gt;be &amp;#34;no added fragrance&amp;#34;; not &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love product, works really well for all types of skin.  Especially for winter, when skin dries up.</li>
    <li> Its organic raw cold pressed coconut oil, what more is there to say.  ... That said, it does say scent free on the label but there is a hint of coconut smell.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it is noticeable.</li>
    <li> The coconut oil itself is great, as always. I am disappointed the easy squirt top feature isn&#x27;t bigger so it&#x27;d allow the oil to come out smoothly. Coconut oil will harden and melt according to temperature, so when it hardens in the cap, it&#x27;s hard to dislodge it and clear the clog. I just unscrew the top and squeeze into my hand, so no biggie.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is the besy moisturizer, hands down, for hair, face, and body. We use it as a diaper cream for our babies too. So all four members of our family use this one product. It absorbs well so your clothes don&#x27;t get sticky or anyything and a little goes a long way. Why only 3 stars? the packaging is terrible. Coconut oil solidifies easily, so it&#x27;s hard to get it out at all times. It is impossible to get the last tenth out. I tried all kinds of temperatures, squeezing, keeping it upside down for days. SO, you can&#x27;t get to 10% of the product. Believe me, I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got the jar. Much easier. But you have to get over sticking your fingers into it and getting it in your nails.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are organic and this is a nice heavy moisturizer. Coconut oil is chock full of saturated fats, medium chain fatty acids and proteins that have numerous health benefits when used and are generally thought to be replenishing, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Viscosity; At room temperature, it is thick and about the texture of Eucerin cream. As such, it will not squeeze out of the pop cap on the bottle and you will need to provide some force to get it out of the bottle.  Would not recommend for easy use by elderly for this reason.  I would think that this product would best be delivered in a jar. The thickness is an advantage to re-hydrate dried out skin.  If you heat the bottle slightly, then it liquifies to the consistency of baby oil without the slipperiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Scent: The label says unscented, and it is mostly unscented in application but you can still smell more of a hint of coconut aroma in the application. A little too much for me as I don&#x27;t like scents at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I recommend the product as its advantages out way its detriments.</li>
    <li> It feels so good to put on when you just get out of the shower while you are still wet so it can soak into your skin. I ordered all the Fiji products, the lotion, the soap, I love the soap and can&#x27;t wait to get the lotion and try it. Amazon is the best place to buy the Fiji products because anywhere else you will be paying double the price. They are amazing and pure products.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff... Currently pregnant and its great for my skin and it smells like a coconut, which makes me hungry every time I use it lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  good for your  skin and face</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair  as well as for my daughters hair once a week. Our hair is stronger and shinier. I feel it has brought my hair back to life. In the winter it&#x27;s great for dry skin. A must have!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, just have to warm it up some when its chilly at room temp. A little dab will do you so this will most like last close to a year.</li>
    <li> I have heard about this oil and wanted to try it, but I did not want the coconut smell. This is a really good moistureizer for my skin and I don&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;m at the beach.</li>
    <li> Too over price for something small not as i thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> excellent. my second order.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My skin looks and feels amazing after using this for almost 2 months. I also really like the soft coconut scent that the unscented one has.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i would change is that i would package it in a tub so it&#x27;s easier to get out. The oil is so pure that it&#x27;s in solid form unless you run some hot water on it in the sink. I like to just scoop some out and apply it; it melts as i rub it on my skin. I think it&#x27;s easier to use if it is still a little bit solid than when it&#x27;s a (really messy) warmed liquid oil. I&#x27;ve remedied this by re-using an old facial-wipe tub and putting it in there.</li>
    <li> tried many different ccnt oils. This one is absolutely fantastic, you&#x27;ll be addicted for good with no reserves. The aroma alone will leave no doubts that every cent spent on it, is in facts a good investment!&lt;br /&gt;If your relationship is in jeopardy, massage your partner with this and they&#x27;ll serve you breakfast in bed.</li>
    <li> You have to heat it to loosen up the solid oil, but I just keep it in the shower with me so it&#x27;s not a big deal. Great price AND organic all natural product. Great for dry dusty skin in southern Cal. Smells delish. Much more expensive to buy in the shops.</li>
    <li> This is the best coconut oil I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  A little bit goes a long way to moisturize and soften the skin and it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Smells great and moisturizers skin.  No leftover greasy feeling.  I use it in replace of lotion.  Will order it again.</li>
    <li> Nice organic, coconut oil lotion - I however do not feel that I will purchase it again because I already purchase organic coconut oil for kitchen use and I really do not see a difference between that and this product.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is not liquid at temperatures below 76 so EVERY time you use it you have to melt it under hot water or use the microwave. I knew better but thought I would give it a try. Nothing against the quality or manufacturer, just a bad bottle for coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Just what you would expect from a quality coconut oil nothing less and more important, nothing more... (expect the coconut scent and hardening below 76F) Perfect!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for so many use. Face, hands, body, and hair. I love the feel of coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Like the fact that the product is 100% coconut oil. Feels good after application, not greasy at all. Like the subtle coconut fragrance too. Only down side is that I have to soak it in hot water prior to use - but I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> The coconut oil itself seems fine. But unless either you keep your place really warm or you want to strength-train your hands every time you use it, you&#x27;ll be better off getting coconut oil in a jar. The cooler your room temperature is, the more solid the oil will become. It&#x27;s pretty solid at normal temperatures, and can be just about impossible to get out of this bottle without removing the cap.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but the bottle was not practible especially when the oil solidifies and you need to warm it up to get it out. would have worked better in a round tub or can you can scoop it out of</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve barely used it. The smell is too strong. You know when you buy it that it is solid at room temp and that you have to warm it up to liquify it, but that&#x27;s a pain to do and get right. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product it&#x27;s hard and you have to heat it in hot water to use it.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s unprocessed raw organic coconut oil, so below 76 degrees it&#x27;s a solid. I have a large tub of coconut oil, but I got this squeeze bottle to keep in the shower (which stays warm enough to keep it between a semi-solid to outright liquefying it when the shower is running) - MUCH easier to wrangle the squeeze bottle in the shower. It says &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but perhaps it should say &amp;#34;no added fragrance&amp;#34; - because it smells like um...fresh coconut. Not a bad thing at all in my book! Great and convenient for shaving, then slicking a thin layer of it all over before stepping out of the shower and patting dry (definitely need a good slip-proof bath mat if you don&#x27;t already have one down) - coconut oil is WONDERFUL for all-day moisturizing. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT---BUT PROBLEM IS GETTING PRODUCT OUT OF CONTAINER -------USUALLY HAVE TO PUT CONTAINER IN WARM WATER BEFORE USING</li>
    <li> I bought this a message oil for my wife as she likes to have her back rubbed, but I don&#x27;t like all the oils on my hands.  This is a dream come true!  I has a very light scent, and is very enjoyable - a little goes a long ways.  The only down fall, which I am willing to over look, is that you need to warm it slightly to use it (I put it between my legs).  We also have been using it on my daughters hands, and it is doing a good job at healing them from the red dry skin - without any pain. I will buy some more when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/17/13  Addition:  We have now melted the oil and divided it into 2 smaller wide mouth containers and can now use it easier.  Also at about 73 degrees or summer time, the oil is softer.  We also put it in warm water and this made it useable - that was until we took it out of the original container.  Still the best oil we have used!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using it for the past few weeks and it has left my hair and skin amazingly smooth and supple.  Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very nice massage oil.</li>
    <li> Smells like coconuts and becomes solid in colder weather -- this stuff is the real deal. I love how shiny it makes my hair but I find that the moisture it provides doesn&#x27;t last even if the shine does.</li>
