      <li>I am sure I will order from here again.</li>
      <li>The women in my family have all use this product over several generations and we look like we have great skin!  </li>
      <li>This version feels better that the one you can buy in USA</li>
      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, and it has kept my skin nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>(which is more important now than it was 30years ago!).  </li>
      <li>Great product really helps diminish lines pretty scent too:)!</li>
      <li>Not only is this the best cream i have ever used the size of this dual tin pack is unbelievably huge.</li>
      <li>I love how this stuff smells, and more importantly, works.</li>
      <li>and I have loved this product from the very beginning.</li>
      <li>I hope they will always have it available.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Nivea Creme for almost 30 years now and I attribute it to my skin being in such great shape.</li>
      <li>Not until recently did I find out that Nivea differs greatly, depending upon where it was manufactured.  </li>
      <li>but mine is from Germany and no it does not smell of cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>Then I found this gigantic tin which is the original packaging and one of the original sizes.  </li>
      <li>I love this cream so much.</li>
      <li>The Seller was true to their word as when it would be delivered.</li>
      <li>but so far, it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>But the product itself is good stuff overall.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave leave a greasy residue like other products and it smells great...</li>
      <li>This is just a quick comment about the plastic container for the 6.8oz container that sells for close to $10 here in NYC: Sometimes the LID cannot be unscrewed.  </li>
      <li>It was my first Nivea product purchase and I am now a huge fan.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for &amp; delivered in two days!</li>
      <li>I placed my order 2 days ago and it arrived in time with Amazon prime, the metal tins are not in the best condition, but other than that this is either the original product or so similar to it that I can not tell the difference, and I use Nivea since my childhood.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Just received my second order, same quality, very satisfied with the company. :)</li>
      <li>RIGHT</li>
      <li>It was recieved very very fast.  </li>
      <li>This is a great hard to find creme.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad Nivea is smart enough not to change this product!</li>
      <li>Just make sure you give it a twist when you are still in the store and make certain you can open it.  </li>
      <li>Nivea really suits my skin and makes its soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My mom has been in love with this product for a long time (decades) and it has been consistent and dependable.</li>
      <li>The formula, scent included, is pretty much how I remember it to be from years (and decades) ago.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great on rough, dry heels that crack.</li>
      <li>She has been using Nivea cream since the late 60&#x27;s and finds it to be the best for her dry skin.</li>
      <li>Do not forget,  price is so reasonable.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really care anyway.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Oh, and it gently takes off eye make up also.</li>
      <li>its the original german formula in super giant tin.</li>
      <li>The order arrived from New Jersey at the very end of the delivery-date range.</li>
      <li>I tried it for extremely dry skin and it has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I travel to Europe frequently, where the German version now smells of cheap perfume and does not feel creamy.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to find the product in the stores, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>The order was quite tricky to place here on the Amazon website early in January 2013 (due largely to a VISA gift card that wasn&#x27;t certified or confirmed or whatever).</li>
      <li>and I have always trusted Nivea thick creme for extra dry skin and it proves itself great every time.</li>
      <li>The price is much higher than in Germany of course, but still lower than in the local stores here.</li>
      <li>and wow.. what a difference!  </li>
      <li>If it is one of the ones that is fused it absolutely cannot be opened by normal human hands of any size or strength.</li>
      <li>Even the tin is largely unchanged -- except, that is, for the now-raised &amp;#34;Nivea Creme&amp;#34; tin-lid lettering and the darker shade of blue.</li>
      <li>This cream is in a flatfish tin can, but has the same amount of cream in the large size you get in the drug store.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Nivea since I was 15 years old</li>
      <li>My skin is always soft and no wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 69 years old without a wrinkle.</li>
      <li>When I go to get a pedicure, the pedi-tech tells me my feet are so soft.  </li>
      <li>It really has a different consistency.  </li>
      <li>I refill the travel tins from this huge tin for travel and the little tins last forever.  </li>
      <li>THE BACK OF MY HANDS THAT ARE DRY AND WRINKLED THANKS NIVEA</li>

<li> And these tints with each 400 ml, which is a lot, will last for a long time.</li>
<li> When the big Nivea Creme tin is finally empty, I have a nice-looking permanent container left over for storing small items or for craft projects - you can&#x27;t really do that with the plastic package one.</li>
<li> One tin will probably last about a year, assuming you don&#x27;t use much when it&#x27;s hot and muggy outside.  </li>
<li> Now that I am 30, my sister suggested that I should use some other more expensive products on my face.</li>
<li> HELPS WITH WRINKLED DRY SKIN</li>
<li> I prefer it over the lotion for the really dry part of my body (hands, feet, elbows, chest, etc).  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t stand dry chapped hands, and this is my go-to potion.</li>
<li> For anyone that has extremely dry skin, this is the creme for you.</li>
<li> In winter when you want something to help those dry hands and elbows, this is the stuff.</li>

    <li> This cream is in a flatfish tin can, but has the same amount of cream in the large size you get in the drug store.  I use Nivea cream nightly on my feet and hands.  It does wonder for softening calluses and keeping skin hydrated.  I prefer it over the lotion for the really dry part of my body (hands, feet, elbows, chest, etc).  I hope they will always have it available.  The Seller was true to their word as when it would be delivered.</li>
    <li> This is just a quick comment about the plastic container for the 6.8oz container that sells for close to $10 here in NYC: Sometimes the LID cannot be unscrewed.

    <li> HELPS WITH WRINKLED DRY SKIN IT IS NOT GREASY SOAKS RIGHT IN USE DAY OR NIGHT. I EVEN USE IT ONE THE BACK OF MY HANDS THAT ARE DRY AND WRINKLED THANKS NIVEA</li>
    <li> I really love this cream. It&#x27;s thick, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Your face still feels moisterized when you wake up. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this Nivea creme.  It is exactly what I was looking for &amp; delivered in two days! I use it on my face, hands &amp; feet at night.  This product is awesome!  My bestfriend&#x27;s family used to send it to her from Germany &amp; I&#x27;d pinch a bit from her when ever I could &amp; now, I have a tin for me &amp; a tin for her!  Best stuff around.  Goes on thick &amp; creamy and then sinks right in! It is not a light cream, it is ment to be heavier &amp; richer.  Oh, and it gently takes off eye make up also.</li>
    <li> My mom has been in love with this product for a long time (decades) and it has been consistent and dependable.</li>
    <li> The BEST hand creme I&#x27;ve ever used! It was my first Nivea product purchase and I am now a huge fan. Deeply moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make hands sticky or slimey. Also great for after shaving your legs.</li>
    <li> I use this product from head to toe and I love it. I tried it for extremely dry skin and it has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Love Nivea!</li>
    <li> Even though this Nivea was made in Malaysia, it feels, smells and rubs to skin the same as the German one, I was using, when I was living there.</li>
    <li> Know it from one of my friend, so just bought for test.  Actually it is a very nice product,  for face and neck,  very smoothly and make skin very comfortable.  Do not forget,  price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> This version feels better that the one you can buy in USA</li>
    <li> i love this product. its the original german formula in super giant tin. i use it on my hands then blot my face with my hands. My sister also used product and, i kid you not, we get compliments and questions almost weekly about how amazing our skin looks. Our mom just asked a what we were doing so we gave her a tin too! Not only is this the best cream i have ever used the size of this dual tin pack is unbelievably huge. It was recieved very very fast.  This product is bookmarked for me as i will 100% be ordering again. Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am German, living in the states and of course I am missing the products of my home country. I placed my order 2 days ago and it arrived in time with Amazon prime, the metal tins are not in the best condition, but other than that this is either the original product or so similar to it that I can not tell the difference, and I use Nivea since my childhood. The price is much higher than in Germany of course, but still lower than in the local stores here. And these tints with each 400 ml, which is a lot, will last for a long time. I am sure I will order from here again. Thanks for the great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received my second order, same quality, very satisfied with the company. :)</li>
    <li> Not until recently did I find out that Nivea differs greatly, depending upon where it was manufactured.  I travel to Europe frequently, where the German version now smells of cheap perfume and does not feel creamy.  This particular Nivea Creme is just wonderful, smooth and creamy.  I hope they never change it!!</li>
    <li> Years ago Nivea was recommended to me while I was traveling in Europe. I have been using Nivea Creme for almost 30 years now and I attribute it to my skin being in such great shape. People always tell me I look at least ten years younger than I am (which is more important now than it was 30years ago!).  While I do like the other Nivea products the creme is the \\&quot;original\\&quot; product from decades before I was even born. Use it every night and a bit in the morning, especially if it&#x27;s a cold bitter winter day. I use it as lip balm in a pinch, it&#x27;s great on burns, cuts, scrapes, rashes, calloused feet, sunburns, and even as a nail moisturizer. I&#x27;ve gotten many guys hooked on Nivea Creme over the years because they tell me it&#x27;s great for moisturizing and works well on shaving cuts, razor burn and work-calloused hands.  I am allergic to a lot of perfumes and even though the container says it has a scent it has never bothered me. The creme comes in several product sizes, from small travel tins to the jumbo one sold here.  I had been buying the intermediate size container in plastic but was not very happy with the packaging.  Then I found this gigantic tin which is the original packaging and one of the original sizes.  One tin will probably last about a year, assuming you don&#x27;t use much when it&#x27;s hot and muggy outside.  I refill the travel tins from this huge tin for travel and the little tins last forever.  When the big Nivea Creme tin is finally empty, I have a nice-looking permanent container left over for storing small items or for craft projects - you can&#x27;t really do that with the plastic package one. Some things are just good from the beginning and I&#x27;m glad Nivea is smart enough not to change this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great hard to find creme.  I use it all over my body, especially my hands and feet.  When I go to get a pedicure, the pedi-tech tells me my feet are so soft.  Claims she doesn&#x27;t &#x27;mind&#x27; massaging them.  Lol.  For anyone that has extremely dry skin, this is the creme for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nivea creme from Mexico for years.. I didn&#x27;t realize that there was a difference depending on where it is made. National Dealz who sells on this site responded immediately to my request for ingredients by sending a photo of the label.  I just purchased the Nivea from Indonesia.., and wow.. what a difference!  It really has a different consistency.  It feels a lot creamier.  I will be buying more of this as I believe Nivea has kept my skin looking really good way beyond it&#x27;s expiration date!!</li>
    <li> Nivea puts out one of the few creams that I can use as I have atopic dermatitis.  Many creams and lotions aggravate my problem but this one has worked for me for many years.  It&#x27;s also great on rough, dry heels that crack.</li>
    <li> Yaw!  Just receive mine and was cremey loveyyy.... Hope keep german made.... Ill be buying moreeeee....</li>
    <li> Although the packaging that it came in was spoiled. But the creme in itself is a great product and I have always trusted Nivea thick creme for extra dry skin and it proves itself great every time.</li>
    <li> Two big pots of Nivea creme, as promised. I love how this stuff smells, and more importantly, works. In winter when you want something to help those dry hands and elbows, this is the stuff. Thicker than anything else out there, also quite greasy. Good for bedtime. I can&#x27;t stand dry chapped hands, and this is my go-to potion.</li>
    <li> Love love &amp; love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy AB</li>
    <li> I love this cream so much. It&#x27;s part of my night skin care routine and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea where it was fabricated &#x27;cause it doesn&#x27;t say, so maybe it was made in Germany? It works the same as my past ones so I don&#x27;t really care anyway.</li>
    <li> Very thick and does soften the skin. I like that it has no smell.</li>
    <li> Very good cream,restores lost moisture in your skin.Perfect for winter season and can be used after shave.Nice value for money.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome</li>
    <li> My wife has me order this item from Amazon due to it&#x27;s great price.She has been using Nivea cream since the late 60&#x27;s and finds it to be the best for her dry skin.It doesn&#x27;t leave leave a greasy residue like other products and it smells great...</li>
    <li> One of the cans came all dented but outside plastic wrapping was not damaged so, I think it&#x27;s OK. I just used for one night but so far, it&#x27;s nice and it reminds me of when I was a child.</li>
    <li> While in Europe, I noticed lots of people using this and so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Stuff works great and the merchant shipped fast.</li>
    <li> My husband is using this and it took care of his alligator skin when nothing else worked.  I don&#x27;t know about other skin creams and lotions, but this one works for us.</li>
    <li> The order was quite tricky to place here on the Amazon website early in January 2013 (due largely to a VISA gift card that wasn&#x27;t certified or confirmed or whatever). The order arrived from New Jersey at the very end of the delivery-date range. But the product itself is good stuff overall. The formula, scent included, is pretty much how I remember it to be from years (and decades) ago. Even the tin is largely unchanged -- except, that is, for the now-raised &amp;#34;Nivea Creme&amp;#34; tin-lid lettering and the darker shade of blue. You just have to rub the thick white stuff well into your skin. Perhaps especially if your skin isn&#x27;t -- ahem -- entirely hairless...</li>
    <li> Great product really helps diminish lines pretty scent too:)!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day after washing my face. My skin is always soft and no wrinkles. Beats the expensive facial products in price and performance. The women in my family have all use this product over several generations and we look like we have great skin!  Great for after sun and feet.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea since I was 15 years old and I have loved this product from the very beginning. Now that I am 30, my sister suggested that I should use some other more expensive products on my face. I did that for a while and I can tell you that I was one unhappy person. I have shifted back to Nivea and once again am the happiest person. Nivea really suits my skin and makes its soft and smooth. I would recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is slightly thick and some people might find it difficult to apply but it&#x27;s an excellent cream for winter and it keeps my skin from drying up. I read other reviews where people said that the cream they bought was made in Singapore, Thailand etc but mine is from Germany and no it does not smell of cheap perfume.</li>
