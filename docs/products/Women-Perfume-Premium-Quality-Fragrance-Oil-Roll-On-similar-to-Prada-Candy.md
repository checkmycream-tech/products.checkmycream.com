      <li>Nice product!!A</li>
      <li>Just received it yesterday &amp; I love how this smells on me, it goes exceptionally well with my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>I have bought these popular fragrances for so many years:</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised out how awesome this smells.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to everyone who wants to smell delicious AND save money on the brand-name original.</li>
      <li>actually liked their version better than the original!  </li>
      <li>This is truly great AND at reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay fragrance for the price</li>
      <li>I love it already:).</li>
      <li>Glad I bought I three 3 bottles for gift to drop in for friends for Christmas</li>
      <li>I love these oils</li>
      <li>Very simply, this is a truly wonderful product.</li>
      <li>She has had so many complements at work and friends.</li>
      <li>I really love it &amp; will surely purchase it again.</li>
      <li>I love it....</li>
      <li>You willl love it.</li>
      <li>but I also purchased one for my daughter and I am sure she will like it as well.</li>
      <li>I felt confident &amp; sexy wearing this.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed my purchase</li>
      <li>but I would recommend :-)</li>
      <li>i did that but love it on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will buy more if this product.</li>
      <li>I will add that this oil as with many oils can be paired with parfum, edt, &amp; body sprays to make your own unique scent..</li>
      <li>It is A sweet musk a touch of warm sugar &amp; sort of creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will soon buy the original Prada Candy!</li>
      <li>most of the day, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order VERY quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells , the smell is strong and I don&#x27;t need to use alot</li>
      <li>No matter if you already love the original Prada Candy (like I do)</li>
      <li>it self does not last very long nor does it have great silage, so this would be the best choice since it is an oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To get the most of this oil apply it correctly to clean, exfoliated,</li>
      <li>and I can easily freshen up when I need to on the go.  </li>
      <li>I applied the oil to my pulse points after my shower, it is still strong &amp; lingering on my skin.</li>
      <li>you are a vanilla caramel sweet musk type you will love it.</li>
      <li>honestly, it is nothing like smelling fresh &amp; clean &amp; yummy.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear them and it saves on using the perfume up so quickly as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very true to the original smell.</li>
      <li>And on top of that, I couldn&#x27;t believe the Super Fast Standard Shipping (caps intentional, it was that awesome).</li>
      <li>Maybe nice to have in your purse to touch up the real thing.</li>
      <li>I actually own a bottle if Prada Candy and this roll on is a really close facsimie.  </li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s no sign of it fading away or needing to be reapplied, unlike the original.</li>
      <li>the expense is not astronomical and I&#x27;m pretty sure you could return it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, to Compare:  As I write this, ladies and gents, I am still enjoying the Prada Candy-ness of this roll-on oil - in a pretty, understated way.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this on a recommendation of a friend.</li>
      <li>smells better than the real thing!</li>
      <li>This fragrance oil roll on smells exactly like the original and the fragrance lasts longer!</li>
      <li>The smell is very close to Prada Candy (not quite) but the Prada Candy sample that I have does not provide a scent that lasts more than about an hour on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I keep smelling my arm because I just love it so much.</li>
      <li>smells good and last for along time...</li>
      <li>this oil is just ok it does not smell like real thing and scent</li>
      <li>i love perfume &amp; when i find something i really like i use it like it has gone out of style...</li>
      <li>this is very close to the perfume, the silage is even better then Prada Candy.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Serina&#x27;s Bow tiq :)&lt;</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s an oil, and even a small amount is elegantly fragrant - and has excellent, but soft, sillage.</li>
      <li>The original Prada Candy IS on the pricey side, I have to admit, but I&#x27;ve always thought it was worth the cost.</li>
      <li>does not last.shipping was quick</li>
      <li>Quick Take:  If you&#x27;re on the fence, hop off.</li>
      <li>have many coach love ,Beyoncé heat ,Beyoncé midnight heat , Ed hardy hearts and daggers ,Prada candy , juicy viva la juicy and quite a few more .all</li>
      <li>It smells very much like the original scent but for a fraction of the cost...</li>
      <li>fortunately it is such an amazing smell</li>
      <li>but it has a nice enough smell.</li>

    <li> smells good and last for along time...</li>
    <li> OOOOOHHHH MYYYYY IIII LOVEEEEEE ITTT!!! This is such a fantastic buy. I am even wearing it tonight to bed after my shower. it smells yummy and last and last and last. I keep smelling my arm because I just love it so much. Glad I bought I three 3 bottles for gift to drop in for friends for Christmas but now I am not going to give this one... I will give the other scents which smell nice but this one is nicer.BUY IT!!!!! You willl love it.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever writing a review on amazon in over 5 years bc the product was that good.  Serina needs to keep doing her thing.  I have bought these popular fragrances for so many years: Prada candy, Versace crystal noir, and donna karan cashmere mist.  I cannot believe how they smell exactly like the real thing, how long lasting, and fast shipping. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> smells better than the real thing!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about the fragrances I purchase .I have many coach love ,Beyoncé heat ,Beyoncé midnight heat , Ed hardy hearts and daggers ,Prada candy , juicy viva la juicy and quite a few more .all I can say is the fragrance lasts a long time and it&#x27;s very close to the original scent . I love these oils</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells , the smell is strong and I don&#x27;t need to use alot just a little bit goes a long way, I definitely will purchase another one soon!</li>
    <li> Prada Candy frangrance oil. Roll On smells sooo great,it lasts pretty good&lt;br /&gt;All day. I love it already:). I would order more later .</li>
    <li> This fragrance oil roll on smells exactly like the original and the fragrance lasts longer! I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I have the real perfume of Prada Candy and this Oil Roll On is almost the exact fragrance.  I use the oil and perfume together and it last all day.  I get so many compliments when I wear them and it saves on using the perfume up so quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Smells very good. Can wear alone or with perfume or oil. Get compliments as people think it is the actual perfume.</li>
    <li> Serena really is an artist because this is almost exactly the same.  Additionally, I am looking forward to the fragrance lasting more than an hour (since Prada&#x27;s product fades almost immediately).  It has a little bit of a muskier, spicier undertone (almost like Hanae Mori) but can dry a tad powdery rather than amber-y.  Will definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> This company gives you a great opportunity to try all those scents you need wear longer than the one spritz you get from the fragrance counter.&lt;br /&gt;I actually liked their version better than the original!  (The name brand scent wore off way too soon for the price).  The oils used in these formulations allow the scent to linger much longer...most of the day, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order VERY quickly. I&#x27;m taking my own advice and ordering the other &#x27;flavors&#x27; that I&#x27;ve been wanting!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 18 months (I ordered two bottles) and have used it sparingly and I can tell you that it still to this day has the same smell as it did the day that I purchased it.  This is a high quality fragrance oil and I plan to purchase more and try a different scent.  I love the rollerball because it fits great in to my purse and I can easily freshen up when I need to on the go.  The scent is long lasting and I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments.  It smells just like the actual perfume too.</li>
    <li> Just received it yesterday &amp; I love how this smells on me, it goes exceptionally well with my body chemistry. I applied the oil to my pulse points after my shower, it is still strong &amp; lingering on my skin. This oil is the right amount of sweetness &amp; musk... on me it is a very sensual smelling, rich caramel that is a really yummy scent. It&#x27;s not heavy but you will definitely notice the scent  &amp; so will others. I think i will make this my signature scent because it smells that good on my skin!!! I feel this fragrance can be worn anytime by itself or layered. I&#x27;m using it as is for now. I&#x27;m not getting the powdery note like others however, there is a lightness to the aroma to where it is not overpowering at all. I really love it &amp; will surely purchase it again. Thanks Serina&#x27;s Bow tiq :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i had to come back and give an update on this oil... i love it so much, If it came in a big bottle i would indeed have to have it. It was a blind buy as i have never smelled the real Prada Candy but after reading so many great reviews i purchased the oil to see... well as i said i just adore this roll on fragrance. I have managed to make it last a month with 1/4 of it left 😒 i love perfume &amp; when i find something i really like i use it like it has gone out of style... fortunately it is such an amazing smell it was never offensive if i happened to put a few extra dabs on 😋 my only wish was that i would of purchased at least three.... but this fragrance is long-lasting Both on the skin and in general depending on how much you use at a given time. Okay onto why i fell in love with this particular scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s sensual smelling but not overwhelming, it goes well for day &amp; night and a couple applications before you go to bed is a treat for yourself or your company, i got complimented a lot... my mother, sister, friends &amp; my boo... he said damn you smell good. 😘 honestly, it is nothing like smelling fresh &amp; clean &amp; yummy. It goes hand in hand with confidence.I felt confident &amp; sexy wearing this. It went with my personality.. i find it to be a very sensual, alluring smell. Very seductive. I will add that this oil as with many oils can be paired with parfum, edt, &amp; body sprays to make your own unique scent.. i did that but love it on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a vanilla caramel sweet musk type you will love it. I still never noticed anything powdery about it. I believe that is the benzoin note but it develops differently for others perhaps. It is A sweet musk a touch of warm sugar &amp; sort of creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most of this oil apply it correctly to clean, exfoliated, Moisturized skin.. that way it really melds with your skin &amp; natural body chemistry. Apply to pulse points. Find a scent to pair it with; it will enhance &amp; amplify the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sillage i will give it a solid 3.5 out Of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;longevity is excellent 5 of 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Had staying power of ten plus hrs, even longer if it clings to your apparel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not rave enough about prada candy oil. I really want Serina to make larger quantities available. I need a ten ounce squirt bottle of this golden liquid. Ugh... i&#x27;m almost out of my current one but i just ordered Katy Perry Meow EDP to pair with it so i can try &amp; stretch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway..... thanks for reading my rant but extra thanks to Serina&#x27;s Bow tiq 😍💖👌👍👏</li>
    <li> It does not remind me of Prada Candy at all but it has a nice enough smell. The shipping was fast but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I would have liked the fragrance to be closer to Prada Candy.</li>
    <li> As an oil, I was hoping the fragrance would be compatible to the real fragrance and have a long lasting smell.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Candy, but it&#x27;s not exactly made by Prada.  However, I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in Atlanta&#x27;s oil businesses, and thisoil beats paying $90+ for the actual fragrance.  smells quite similar to the original and keeps me smelling my wrist.  Thanks for the swift delivery!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed my purchase it arrived in a very timely manner and the scent of the oil is very nice its not as strong as some oils can be but overall I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great price, great size. I can travel with it, put it in my purse. It is almost spot on to the real deal.I highly reccomend and look fwd to trying other scents they may have. would make a great gift too!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised out how awesome this smells. (Party Candy smelled awful.) THIS SMELLS GREAT! It has an oil base to it which makes it last LOOOONG! If this review is HELPFUL, please click on &amp;#34;Helpful Review.&amp;#34; Thank you, Stealth_Hawke (Giving you stealthy, unpaid, up front reviews.)</li>
    <li> Quick Take:  If you&#x27;re on the fence, hop off. This is truly great AND at reasonable price. I have never been so impressed with an &amp;#34;impression of&amp;#34; type product. To my nose, this roll on is %99.9999 identical to the brand name, luxe isn&#x27;t the word, Prada Candy... just MUCH longer lasting and more affordable. And on top of that, I couldn&#x27;t believe the Super Fast Standard Shipping (caps intentional, it was that awesome). No matter if you already love the original Prada Candy (like I do) or you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and portable way to try it for an extended period - to see if it&#x27;s really for you - I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Details:  To give you a frame of reference about my &amp;#34;expertise&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve been wearing the original Prada Candy steadily since it was introduced in August of 2011. My birthday is in August and it was a random gift from my Mom. I&#x27;ve used it every single day since, unless I ran out and had to wait to get more. The original Prada Candy IS on the pricey side, I have to admit, but I&#x27;ve always thought it was worth the cost. I don&#x27;t live near a store that sells it; the closest retail outlet is about 45 min away, but I generally order mine online from eBay or Amazon, because, to be blunt, it&#x27;s usually cheaper. That said, I love the uniqueness of &amp;#34;Candy&amp;#34; enough to spend my hard earned money on it, something I don&#x27;t really NEED, because I never feel &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to Compare:  As I write this, ladies and gents, I am still enjoying the Prada Candy-ness of this roll-on oil - in a pretty, understated way. I rolled it on one of my wrists early this morning as soon as it arrived, to immediately be shocked by the almost exact (and I do mean EXACT) similarity to the beloved original. It is now approx. 7:30 PM (almost 12 hrs later) and there&#x27;s no sign of it fading away or needing to be reapplied, unlike the original. I can&#x27;t say it enough, I was so pleasantly surprised and pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cherry on top was that it took a little under two days to arrive. Very simply, this is a truly wonderful product. I must add that I literally NEVER write reviews, but I just had to tell the world how immensely impressed with this product I am. As someone who doesn&#x27;t take spending money lightly, even a little bit, I was hesitant and skeptical, but as soon as I smelled this, I was sold. Completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line(s):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Even if you hate it (which is very unlikely, in my opinion) the expense is not astronomical and I&#x27;m pretty sure you could return it. I will probably order a few more of these to safeguard against a discontinuation, I just like it that much. Unless they discontinue it, I&#x27;ll never be without this amazing roll-on oil again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Since it&#x27;s an oil, and even a small amount is elegantly fragrant - and has excellent, but soft, sillage. One bottle of this will last. The artist (Serina, perhaps?) who created this mix is a real genius, with a nose for notes and fragrance in general. I admit, I will still keep a spray of the original on hand, because I think it&#x27;s cool and refreshing after a bath, shower or long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- BUT ...and it&#x27;s a big one.... I will always layer the Prada EDP spray with this oil. Then, what I do buy of the original &amp;#34;Candy&amp;#34; will last much longer since I won&#x27;t be using as much all the time. If this oil could someday, somehow, be transformed into an Eau De Parfum spray (and hey, maybe even a lotion, shower gel and body scrub!?) Prada might be in real trouble... at least when it comes to the &amp;#34;Candy&amp;#34; sales.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this on a recommendation of a friend. I wear prada candy exclusively but hate paying the $80+ price. This unfortunately is not close at all. It also feels like an oil (obviously) but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so different feeling on my skin. It&#x27;s an okay fragrance for the price but if you are trying to get a prada candy replica, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Very nice. This is so close to the real thing.  My only problem is that one of the vials didn&#x27;t have the cap on tight so some of the product was leaking out of the bottle when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and boy was she disappointed.  I ended up buying the real thing.  She says it smells nothing like the real thing.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! I&#x27;ve been craving Prada Candy since I smelled it in Vogue magazine a couple months back but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $80+ (guess because its new?) for it. I am one of those people who&#x27;s very picky about fragrances and there have only been about 6 that I liked that complimented my personal scent in my entire life and I&#x27;m 32! Then I stumble upon this! Soon as I put in on my wrists I was in love! Smells exactly like the real thing! And lasts longer too!</li>
    <li> I love it.... It smell amazing</li>
    <li> Loved it !!! Got one for my mom also. It last longer than the expensive spray in the stores. It&#x27;s just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> A surprisingly excellent buy...the fragrance lasts for most of the day! It smells very much like the original scent but for a fraction of the cost...best ones are Prada Candy and J&#x27;Adore Dior</li>
    <li> It smells good I thought I would try one to test it out because I never wore oil before but I can still smell it and it has been on me for over 10 hours. I like it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  It smells WONDERFUL and I get rave reviews when wearing it.  I would recommend it to everyone who wants to smell delicious AND save money on the brand-name original.</li>
    <li> I have ordered another one of these for my wife and she has not used even half of the other bottle.  She has had so many complements at work and friends. This is a very sweet perfume and last a long time.  She keeps it in her purse and just puts a small amount on her wrist.  I love it when she wears this one!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very true to the original smell. Im very happy I bought this. It last a long long time. And now I&#x27;m just adding words so I can hurry up and end this review lol</li>
    <li> this oil is just ok it does not smell like real thing and scent does not last.shipping was quick</li>
    <li> I actually own a bottle if Prada Candy and this roll on is a really close facsimie.  I carry it in my purse and use it when my Prada perfume starts to fade later on during the the day.  Will buy more if this product.</li>
    <li> My sister wears Prada Candy and I liked the way it smelled on her. I decided to purchase this from this company due to cost and it actually surprised me with its long lasting smell. The oil is longer lasting and I never have to reapply the perfume. Nice product!!A little sweet smelling but I also purchased one for my daughter and I am sure she will like it as well.</li>
    <li> Came in earlier than I expected, the fragrance itself is just perfect in my opinion and lasts long! I&#x27;m really happy that I made this purchase I will soon buy the original Prada Candy!</li>
    <li> I have the real thing. This is close-ish. Actually, really not that close, but smells nice enough. Not long lasting, however.</li>
    <li> It did smell close to the real thing but not much scent.To weak . Maybe nice to have in your purse to touch up the real thing.</li>
    <li> It doesnt smell like prada candy but it did smell good so I kept it and the company that sold this shipped really fast</li>
    <li> I love it! It shipped fast and smelled as expected!</li>
    <li> Smells very close to original Prada Candy. Great to carry in purse and for traveling.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> great fragrance...  I love the compliments when I wear this beautiful fragrance. It last long and applies gently on skin.</li>
    <li> Smells similar to Prada Candy. I ordered on a Tuesday and got it by Thursday. The scent formula lasts a lot longer than general perfume. Not the real thing (clearly for $10) but I would recommend :-)</li>
    <li> If you like smelling like a diaper, this is probably for you. Otherwise, anyone with any olfactory senses will be highly disappointing with this malodorous monstrosity. I&#x27;ll be throwing this away. Not worth the shipping to send it back.</li>
    <li> The smell is very close to Prada Candy (not quite) but the Prada Candy sample that I have does not provide a scent that lasts more than about an hour on my skin.  This is close, also very pleasant and the scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Be it I own Prada Candy this is very close to the perfume, the silage is even better then Prada Candy.  Prada Candy it self does not last very long nor does it have great silage, so this would be the best choice since it is an oil.</li>
