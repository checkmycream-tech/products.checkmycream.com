      <li>Quite nice</li>
      <li>and  she said it smells so good. :)</li>
      <li>But I just love the way it smells, it&#x27;s just gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I love wearing this toilette</li>
      <li>Did not get the one with the silver top.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s what is important!</li>
      <li>The Style is considered Elegant.</li>
      <li>A wonderfully sophisticated scent that is feminine without being overly floral.  </li>
      <li>Staying power is pretty good, too.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for every day wear but special enough for evening as well.</li>
      <li>Too strong.  </li>
      <li>It was love at first smell with this one!</li>
      <li>Fragrance smelled fresh,  with strong scent.  </li>
      <li>I have LOT of perfume - but never landed on one that I absolutely love so much that I always want to wear it, until this.</li>
      <li>Quick to ship</li>
      <li>So sexy and classy!</li>
      <li>so I wanted to buy a bigger bottle of this amazing scent.  </li>
      <li>Fresh.</li>
      <li>Very passionate perfume and amazing smell.</li>
      <li>and I like the odor very much</li>
      <li>This is a very haunting and unique fragrance, and I really like it.</li>
      <li>When I first applied this scent, it had a flowery and sort of &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>But within minutes, the fragrance softened to a mysterious floral aroma, which I absolutely love.</li>
      <li>When I first sprayed this on my wrist, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>The Notes are Pink Pepper, Mandarin, Cedrat, Rose, Peach, Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Amber.  </li>
      <li>Younger person toilette this would make a wonderful date night toilette, long lasting.</li>
      <li>I had expected it to be more of a soft fragrance, but it is pretty strong...</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced and she loves it.</li>
      <li>It is a warm scent, not too heavy and the Eau de Toilette smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long.  </li>
      <li>I was not aware of the fact that you can return perfumes to amazon, so be sure to smell it somewhere before purchasing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>If you want to buy perfume for your wife or significant other, this is the one.</li>
      <li>not sure it is authentic</li>
      <li>Soft floral  </li>
      <li>The scent was a bit too floral and definitely too intense.</li>
      <li>After a few minutes it became a deep lovely fragrance.</li>

    <li> I had a small tester vial someone gave me so I wanted to buy a bigger bottle of this amazing scent.  This price was one of the least expensive I found online and it arrived promptly, well packaged and smelling amazing.  The Notes are Pink Pepper, Mandarin, Cedrat, Rose, Peach, Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Amber.  The Style is considered Elegant. Feminine. Mysterious.  It is a warm scent, not too heavy and the Eau de Toilette smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long.  You may want to layer (lotion, too).</li>

    <li> Loved it and would purchase again! Quick to ship and it smells very nice. My daughters keep trying to borrow it from me!</li>
    <li> When I first sprayed this on my wrist, I didn&#x27;t like it. The scent was a bit too floral and definitely too intense. It smelled too old-fashioned for me. But within minutes, the fragrance softened to a mysterious floral aroma, which I absolutely love. This is a very haunting and unique fragrance, and I really like it. Staying power is pretty good, too.</li>

    <li> This fragrance is one of a few that do not aggravate my allergies. Simply uplifting floral notes.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had expected it to be more of a soft fragrance, but it is pretty strong... I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t like it, but won&#x27;t purchased it again.  I was not aware of the fact that you can return perfumes to amazon, so be sure to smell it somewhere before purchasing.</li>
    <li> This is one of my faves. I get a lot of complements wearing this perfume :) A must have!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful. Fresh. Great for day or evening. My only problem was that the scent does not last. For the expensive price, I expect that.</li>
