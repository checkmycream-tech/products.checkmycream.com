      <li>Nice on/off switch.  </li>
      <li>The straightener itself is nice, but it says auto shut off in the description, but it doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
      <li>Easy to use with good results..</li>
      <li>setting easily straightens my hair with one pass!  </li>
      <li>Excellent for really short hair.  </li>
      <li>knowing what I know now, I would go with a better quality Straightener.</li>
      <li>AND IT CURLS EVEN THE MOST &amp;#34;HARD TO CURL&amp;#34; PIECES OF HAIR.</li>
      <li>This straightener is perfect for short hair styles and smoothing your roots!</li>
      <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
      <li>The size is perfect and the multiple heat settings are very useful.</li>
      <li>worth every dime and a more!</li>
      <li>Very good for styling short hair.</li>
      <li>The ceramic plates are not level with the housing and therefore easily create crimps in the hair.</li>
      <li>My first hot iron like this worked great for about 3 years.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>It works great for short hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it without that, so it is now just a travel straightener</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this \\&quot;straightener\\&quot; that I use for a curling iron...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very hot on the highest level.</li>
      <li>heats up fast and does the job!!</li>
      <li>This heats up quickly and is hot</li>
      <li>The 1/2 inch size is perfect for getting close to the root especially for those of you with a tight curl.</li>
      <li>Heat control is useful, it heats up quickly, and is light enough that I can keep it on a rubber hook that is stickied to my bathroom</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>I think the heating mechanism is out on this hot iron.</li>
      <li>I can curl and heighten my hair styles quickly and easily after blowing dry with the hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>It has a smooth no snag surface that runs with easy down the strands of hair.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no static on your hair after using this iron which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>GAVE THIS 5 STARS BECAUSE IT HEATS UP FAST.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
      <li>works very well</li>
      <li>It heats up fast so it is ready when you are.</li>
      <li>This one is light, which makes it easy to hold, but feels like it could easily break if handled wrong.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and the high heat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and you can hold it comfortably for a long time.</li>
      <li>this product is a great size if you have a pixie cut like I do or if you just want a smaller flat iron to create smaller curls in long hair.</li>
      <li>The plastic on the other side of the heater doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other sizes, which makes it easy to put right up against your skin without causing damage.  </li>
      <li>The plates are close to the edge so you can get right next to your scalp!  </li>
      <li>The plates are half inch wide which is good for short men&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I currently have a &amp;#34;pixie cut,&amp;#34; which is ridiculously short on the sides / in the back, with some extra length on top.  </li>
      <li>I have a 1 inch Conair that looks similar, but is much weightier and has taken years of abuse without dying--even after being short-circuited in an outlet overseas, it still works.  </li>
      <li>but I am able to grab the outside of the iron at the tip and not burn my fingers, something I can&#x27;t say about other, more expensive irons.  </li>
      <li>Back in the 70&#x27;s, we just wore our hair long and straight and I never had to learn about curlers, curling irons, etc.  </li>
      <li>I have stick straight short hair with partial unruly gray and have given up on perms.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product but my finger always gets caught in the clamping mechanism. For some reason</li>
    <li> I have stick straight short hair with partial unruly gray and have given up on perms.  I couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;do\\&quot; the curling irons because of the kink it left.  Back in the 70&#x27;s, we just wore our hair long and straight and I never had to learn about curlers, curling irons, etc.  This 1/2\\&quot; iron is great!  I can curl and heighten my hair styles quickly and easily after blowing dry with the hair dryer.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this earlier!  The swivel cord is a blessing...never buy an iron without a swivel cord.  I tried other irons but they did not have the swivel...what a mess!  This heats up quickly and is hot but I am able to grab the outside of the iron at the tip and not burn my fingers, something I can&#x27;t say about other, more expensive irons.  Oh...and I forgot about the auto shut off...another great feature!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this \\&quot;straightener\\&quot; that I use for a curling iron...except thank you Revlon!</li>
    <li> I currently have a &amp;#34;pixie cut,&amp;#34; which is ridiculously short on the sides / in the back, with some extra length on top.

This straightener works perfectly for those super-short pieces and hasn&#x27;t burned my ears or face even once.  The plastic on the other side of the heater doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other sizes, which makes it easy to put right up against your skin without causing damage.  It also heats up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lower star is because it does feel a bit flimsier than other straighteners that I&#x27;ve owned.

This one is light, which makes it easy to hold, but feels like it could easily break if handled wrong.</li>
    <li> Took forever to find a 1/2 inch flat iron with variable heat.  Bought one with out previously and it fried my hair.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I have very short hair and this gives it a bit of lift and &amp;#34;almost curl.&amp;#34;  Got compliments on my hair today and I like the look of it.</li>
    <li> GAVE THIS 5 STARS BECAUSE IT HEATS UP FAST. I HAVE A SHORT HAIR CUT AND IT CURLS EVEN THE MOST &amp;#34;HARD TO CURL&amp;#34; PIECES OF HAIR. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This straightener snagged my hair and pulled it out.  This is not a desired result in a flat iron.  I doubt you would either.  Beware!</li>
    <li> The straightener itself is nice, but it says auto shut off in the description, but it doesn&#x27;t have it. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it without that, so it is now just a travel straightener and I have to find another one.</li>
    <li> It works great for short hair.</li>
    <li> heats up fast and does the job!! i like the thin plates cuz i only use it on my bangs.</li>
    <li> I recently got my hair cut very short and needed a hair straightener that could work with shorter, thicker strands of hair. The size is perfect and the multiple heat settings are very useful. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> This straightener is perfect for short hair styles and smoothing your roots! The plates are close to the edge so you can get right next to your scalp!  I have curly hair and the high heat setting easily straightens my hair with one pass!  Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
    <li> The plates are half inch wide which is good for short men&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s not heavy and you can hold it comfortably for a long time. There&#x27;s a manual heat setting dial, a power LED and on/off switch on the set. There&#x27;s no static on your hair after using this iron which is a good thing. This thing isn&#x27;t expensive. The only thing I wished it had was dual voltage compatibility. Otherwise, this thing is good.</li>
    <li> This straightener has been a great companion in cosmetology school. The 1/2 inch size is perfect for getting close to the root especially for those of you with a tight curl. It has a smooth no snag surface that runs with easy down the strands of hair. I don&#x27;t have a single bad thing to say about this straightener!</li>
    <li> I think the heating mechanism is out on this hot iron. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot on the highest level. I&#x27;ve owned this iron before. My first hot iron like this worked great for about 3 years.</li>
    <li> Easy to use with good results.. It heats up fast so it is ready when you are. Good buy from Revlon.</li>
    <li> Very good for styling short hair. I use it to curl my hair back and to the sides. I have 2 inch hair.</li>
    <li> The price is great but the product lacks quality. It pull a little while you&#x27;re using it. knowing what I know now, I would go with a better quality Straightener.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast.  Nice on/off switch.  Does a good job.  Thanks!  Excellent for really short hair.  Would buy from again.</li>
    <li> If I could have rated a 0 I would have. I initially contacted the company about this product but  never received a reply. When my flat iron came it had someone else&#x27;s hair in between the plates. I took pictures of everything. Im not doubting the performance of the item but I will never know because of the way mines came. I will probably purchase another one from another company. Totally not satisfied especially with the customer service!!</li>
    <li> works very well I love it !!!</li>
    <li> worth every dime and a more! this product is a great size if you have a pixie cut like I do or if you just want a smaller flat iron to create smaller curls in long hair. The only con about this porduct is that it doesn&#x27;t have the auto off feature!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with the design of this iron. The ceramic plates are not level with the housing and therefore easily create crimps in the hair.</li>
    <li> Does as it should, was well priced(comparable with it&#x27;s competitors) and I am happy with the product. Heat control is useful, it heats up quickly, and is light enough that I can keep it on a rubber hook that is stickied to my bathroom wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent for men, shorter hair, travel, or quick adjustments.</li>
    <li> Not that great. When I use this product, it leaves my hair frizzed. (Black hair). I found a great product that leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
