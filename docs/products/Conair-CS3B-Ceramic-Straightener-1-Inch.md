      <li>It was not the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>And that&#x27;s my honest review.</li>
      <li>It looks like a toy honestly.</li>
      <li>It feels very cheap.</li>
      <li>It works best if I straighten hair in smaller sections.</li>
      <li>no temp control on it and the material is kind of cheap.</li>

      <li>Easy To Use, Effective, Gentle, Good Value,</li>
      <li>I was replacing my pink one that died within six weeks although it works excellently, you will be replacing it often.  </li>

      <li>i have thin,super fine medium length hair</li>
      <li>but it does a fine job.</li>
      <li>It feels cheap in your hand.  </li>
      <li>so I use this just to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>This iron is cheap.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The model felt cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Cheap straightener.. does not work well.</li>
      <li>It is nice and light and heats up fast.</li>
      <li>straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heated quickly</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why this has as many high reviews as it does.</li>
      <li>This straightener does not get very hot.</li>
      <li>I was pretty excited to get this.</li>
      <li>I have fine, relatively straight hair and this tool doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve liked it if the backs of the hair were a little more rounded</li>
      <li>and I liked its features, but when the basic engineering is a dud, what difference do \\&quot;added features\\&quot; make ???</li>
      <li>It just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>Right when you take it out of the box you will feel disapointed.</li>
      <li>When I got this out of the package, I realized that the heating plates did not line up and had about a 1 mm gap at one end (which hair slid right out of).  </li>
      <li>But no matter how it worked at first, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the straightener broke after 3 months.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even get that hot.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s as hot as it gets on the click of the on switch.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>When this hair straightener is fully heated I can hold the hot piece with my hand.</li>
      <li>It makes great curls as it&#x27;s small so you get nice, tight curls.</li>
      <li>I used this flat iron for the first time today, and will update this review after using it more.  </li>
      <li>It gets warm but not hot.</li>
      <li>I did not want to spend more than $15 for a flat iron because I&#x27;m a college student</li>
      <li>Works very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough, I could place my hand on the heat sections, and I&#x27;d be fine.</li>
      <li>If you are using a straightener for really wavy or curly hair</li>
      <li>I have straight hair</li>
      <li>I doubt it will straighten a whole head of hair.</li>
      <li>When this product arrived I was so excited, finally, a straightener that people claimed that worked!</li>
      <li>It looks a little cheap out of the package, but I was pleasantly surprised that the outside didn&#x27;t seem to get overly hot, and i love the swivel cord feature.  </li>
      <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised about a $17 hair straightener, but all the positive reviews and recommendations here were misleading.</li>
      <li>While it was quick to heat up, the single default heat setting was nowhere near strong enough to even do anything.</li>
      <li>I mostly bought it to take out of country, but it was a waste.</li>
      <li>I just hope it doesn&#x27;t break easily like my previous one.</li>
      <li>I think the reviews for two different conair straighteners are combined on this site, so just a heads up if different heat settings are important to you.  </li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t put it on low to use with cheap, synthetic hair or if you have fragile hair.</li>
      <li>Feels cheep in my hand, doesn&#x27;t have a temperature dial and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a cheap flat iron that will do it&#x27;s job properly, this is it!</li>
      <li>This straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
      <li>I imagine this thing will not do the trick because it simply isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
      <li>The straightener heats up really fast, so I&#x27;m not wasting energy by turning it on and waiting until it&#x27;s hot enough to actually use.  </li>
      <li>Beauty Conscious  </li>
      <li>Kind of a poor way to ensure customer satisfaction.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually straighten her hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s narrow enough that I can use it for my bangs without creating a stupid-looking bump in them, but easy to manage just like a full-size straightener.  </li>
      <li>Does not do much for my hair because I have dry frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>With straighteners I&#x27;ve used in the past, I&#x27;ve struggled to get my hair looking really sleek and straight</li>
      <li>it barely even heats up and doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
      <li>The only use I can find for this is maybe, MAYBE to even out a kink or two in someone&#x27;s naturally mostly-straight hair, or as a cheap-looking paperweight.</li>
      <li>For a few months, the straightener seemed to work pretty well, but only for finer hair.</li>

<li> THIS IS NOT THE SAME FLAT IRON</li>
<li> I kept the hot pink because I couldn&#x27;t take the time to return and exchange such a small item.  </li>
<li> so you save time with this flat iron.</li>
<li> However, I haven&#x27;t tried it on dry, curly hair yet; I&#x27;ve only used it to finish straightening done with a hairdryer.  </li>
<li> but it did not get hot enough to work well on my hair which is not even very thick</li>
<li> However, the vendor&#x27;s delivery was fairly slow and they shipped hot pink!  </li>
<li> Maybe it was just my fault for not researching enough about it before buying it, but it was already incompetent compared to my old straightener that I had been wanting to replace.</li>
<li> I thought maybe I could at least use it as a backup or travelling straightener, so I tested it out on my naturally curly hair.</li>
<li> Was a total waste of my money.</li>
<li> I just have to be really careful and not iron my hair when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
<li> I have short,  shoulder-length hair,  thick, fine-to-medium coarse hair.</li>
<li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair, and it didn&#x27;t do the trick for me.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t damage or burn the hair like some other products.</li>
<li> My hair is straight but frizzy, I use straightener in the morning on dried hair to tame the frizz and to enhance the shape, usually takes 10 minutes or less.</li>
<li> Not worth the money, or time.</li>
<li> I wanted to point out that, unlike the comment in a previous review, this model does not have adjustable heat settings.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the silver model is different from the black &amp; pink models.</li>
<li> It is a large disappointment.</li>
<li> Opened the packaging that had already been opened and was poorly taped back together, and realized that it had no heat settings.</li>
<li> waste of money.</li>
<li> Purchased this straightener for my sister and it stopped working after a few months.</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t waste money on things like these.</li>
<li> The ceramic plates feel really different from the straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past (only touch them when cold, of course!)</li>
<li> There is a small gap between the plates when pressed together.</li>
<li> I got mine in the mail today, it came in the wrong color for one, but I decided to look past that as long as it worked well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this straightener to replace the lower quality Conair straightener that I had for years before it broke during airline travel.  I&#x27;m by no means a hair stylist, but I think this straightener is great.  It&#x27;s narrow enough that I can use it for my bangs without creating a stupid-looking bump in them, but easy to manage just like a full-size straightener.  The ceramic plates feel really different from the straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past (only touch them when cold, of course!) in a way that sort of glides across hair.  That means it doesn&#x27;t catch on bumpy areas of hair as others I have used did.  The straightener heats up really fast, so I&#x27;m not wasting energy by turning it on and waiting until it&#x27;s hot enough to actually use.  With straighteners I&#x27;ve used in the past, I&#x27;ve struggled to get my hair looking really sleek and straight and this one does a much better job.  However, I haven&#x27;t tried it on dry, curly hair yet; I&#x27;ve only used it to finish straightening done with a hairdryer.  Again, I&#x27;m no stylist, but this does the job for me, really great for the price.  I just hope it doesn&#x27;t break easily like my previous one.</li>
    <li> Works very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot. One thing I hate tho is that strands of my hair tend to get stuck where the metal meets the plastic and breaks it. I just have to be really careful and not iron my hair when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
    <li> Pros:Easy To Use, Effective, Gentle, Good Value, No flyaways, Smells great  Cons:None  Best Uses:Dry/Damaged Hair, Frizziness/Flyaways  Describe Yourself:Beauty Conscious  Hair Type:Wavy Hair  Bottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend    Its a beautiful straightener at a great price. It does the job in no time. There is no need to throw away money on expensive straightners when there is this one available! Go ahead and get it!</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to get this. Was I ever wrong. This thing has two settings, on &amp; off. It doesn&#x27;t even get that hot. I am very disappointed....</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. I did not want to spend more than $15 for a flat iron because I&#x27;m a college student and I can&#x27;t waste money on things like these. It works well for me. It takes no more than 20 seconds to get hot so you save time with this flat iron. It makes great curls as it&#x27;s small so you get nice, tight curls. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does not have a temperature dial on it so you can&#x27;t put it on low to use with cheap, synthetic hair or if you have fragile hair. I don&#x27;t mind that though because I know how to make it work for me. If you are looking for a cheap flat iron that will do it&#x27;s job properly, this is it!</li>
    <li> It is nice and light and heats up fast. It doesn&#x27;t damage or burn the hair like some other products. I would&#x27;ve liked it if the backs of the hair were a little more rounded but it does a fine job. Great value!</li>
    <li> This item is cheaply made, has no heat settings and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. It feels very cheap. Wish I would&#x27;ve saved my money. The cord was way too short also.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe. I was looking for compact and dual voltage. It did that part well but it did not get hot enough to work well on my hair which is not even very thick</li>
    <li> This straightener does not get very hot. There is no temperature control so it&#x27;s as hot as it gets on the click of the on switch. I have straight hair so I use this just to smooth it out. If you are using a straightener for really wavy or curly hair I imagine this thing will not do the trick because it simply isn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT THE SAME FLAT IRON AS THE OTHERS PICTURED.  I was replacing my pink one that died within six weeks although it works excellently, you will be replacing it often.  The silver iron is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IRON.  I feel duped, swindled, fill in the blank here for bad words.  They advertise as if it is the same iron in just another color.  Not so.  This iron is cheap.  It feels cheap in your hand.  It does not heat up enough to straighten your hair.  Also, it does not \\&quot;grip\\&quot; your hair.  I do not have thin hair and my hair still fell out of the iron.  It is junk.  Get something else.  There is a reason it is twelve dollars.  I am mad because I cannot stand all of the trouble it is to return it along with postage, etc.  It just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Right when you take it out of the box you will feel disapointed. It looks like a toy honestly. Doesn&#x27;t have heat setting just the on and off switch. Doesn&#x27;t get hot just warm. Nd I doubt it will straighten a whole head of hair. Wast of my 13 dollars.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived I was so excited, finally, a straightener that people claimed that worked! No such luck! It doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough, I could place my hand on the heat sections, and I&#x27;d be fine. It is a large disappointment. Not worth the money, or time.</li>
    <li> this straightener sucks, i just threw mine out. it barely even heats up and doesn&#x27;t get the job done. I have fine, relatively straight hair and this tool doesn&#x27;t do anything. waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I got this out of the package, I realized that the heating plates did not line up and had about a 1 mm gap at one end (which hair slid right out of).  To send it back to the company, I would have to pay shipping both ways.  Kind of a poor way to ensure customer satisfaction.  I will not try another Conair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener heated quickly and I liked its features, but when the basic engineering is a dud, what difference do \\&quot;added features\\&quot; make ???</li>
    <li> no temp control on it and the material is kind of cheap. It is made of plastic.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  However, the vendor&#x27;s delivery was fairly slow and they shipped hot pink!  Doesn&#x27;t look like silver to me!  I kept the hot pink because I couldn&#x27;t take the time to return and exchange such a small item.  Still not very happy every time I&lt;br /&gt;pull that awful color out to use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this has as many high reviews as it does. I got mine in the mail today, it came in the wrong color for one, but I decided to look past that as long as it worked well. Opened the packaging that had already been opened and was poorly taped back together, and realized that it had no heat settings. Nothing but an on/off switch. Maybe it was just my fault for not researching enough about it before buying it, but it was already incompetent compared to my old straightener that I had been wanting to replace. I thought maybe I could at least use it as a backup or travelling straightener, so I tested it out on my naturally curly hair. While it was quick to heat up, the single default heat setting was nowhere near strong enough to even do anything. It doesn&#x27;t even work on curly hair! The only use I can find for this is maybe, MAYBE to even out a kink or two in someone&#x27;s naturally mostly-straight hair, or as a cheap-looking paperweight. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised about a $17 hair straightener, but all the positive reviews and recommendations here were misleading. And that&#x27;s my honest review.</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron for the first time today, and will update this review after using it more.  I wanted to point out that, unlike the comment in a previous review, this model does not have adjustable heat settings.  It does have an on off switch.  I think the reviews for two different conair straighteners are combined on this site, so just a heads up if different heat settings are important to you.  The CS5OBC, selling for under $15, is a very basic model.  It looks a little cheap out of the package, but I was pleasantly surprised that the outside didn&#x27;t seem to get overly hot, and i love the swivel cord feature.  I don&#x27;t use a straightener often, and at this price point, this one meets my needs.</li>
    <li> It has been three years since I bought this straightener, and I have been using it every morning since.  It works best if I straighten hair in smaller sections.</li>
    <li> i have thin,super fine medium length hair this does a wonderful job in straightening and travels well...would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my girlfriend and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to her hair. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually straighten her hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener in Silver because of its price and good reviews. Unfortunately, the silver model is different from the black &amp; pink models. There are not enough images of the silver model on the page to show it only has the ON/OFF sliding switch on the side. This model does NOT have the temperature adjust knob as shown in the Black/Pink model pictures. That was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model felt cheaply made. There is a small gap between the plates when pressed together. I have short,  shoulder-length hair,  thick, fine-to-medium coarse hair. My hair is straight but frizzy, I use straightener in the morning on dried hair to tame the frizz and to enhance the shape, usually takes 10 minutes or less. This straightener does get the job done, but it took longer. It was not the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does support dual voltage, but it does not have to auto-off feature.</li>
    <li> Purchased this straightener for my sister and it stopped working after a few months. For a few months, the straightener seemed to work pretty well, but only for finer hair. I have thick, naturally wavy hair, and it didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. But no matter how it worked at first, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the straightener broke after 3 months.</li>
    <li> Very cheap! Does not do much for my hair because I have dry frizzy hair. I mostly bought it to take out of country, but it was a waste. I ended up buying a more expensive international voltage straightener.</li>
    <li> Cheap straightener.. does not work well. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Feels cheep in my hand, doesn&#x27;t have a temperature dial and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten my hair. Was a total waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This is the most useless piece of crap I have ever purchased on Amazon. When this hair straightener is fully heated I can hold the hot piece with my hand. It gets warm but not hot. Its like a toddlers 1st hair straightener or something. Useless!</li>
