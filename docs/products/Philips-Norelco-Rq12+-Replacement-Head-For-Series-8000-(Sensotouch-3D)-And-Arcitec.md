<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this replacement blade.  I have a 8000 3D and needed new blades, the price of these was so high that I thought I would try the new 93xx razor.  I like the razor AND THE RAZOR HEAD (SH90/52) FITS THE 3D RAZOR!  So you can save 20 bucks and get the other replacement blades and they would pretty nicely.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am a longtime Norelco user. I have used Norelco for almost 20 years now. Over the years, I have owned 3 Norelco shavers and they were all good. This shaving head is the best I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this head so good? It shaves closer than any other head, including the original RQ-12. It also shaves fast. It shaves areas which I had trouble shaving such as the stubble right beneath my nose with no issues. What else would you want in a shaver?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about the noise. Yes, it does have a higher frequency buzzer sound. But who cares? This is a shaver, not an audio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained that it it pulls too much hair and it hurts. I suppose that&#x27;s possible if you have thick AND LOT of beard. But then again, if you are such person then practically every shaver will hurt little more just because there is lot more plucking and shaving going on. For me, this shaver is not painful at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about the plastic head. Hello, this isn&#x27;t an iPhone. Do you really care whether your shaving head is plastic vs metal? If you do, then in my opinion, you should start worry about something bigger like your health, retirement plan, and global warming etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this shaving head shaves closer and faster and can cut mustache in areas where the previous RQ-12 was deficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)Shaves close and fast.&lt;br /&gt;2)Can shave areas where the previous RQ-12 was deficient.&lt;br /&gt;3)Norelco claims this shaves 30% better than its predecessor, and I believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)Not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;2)All the negative reviews on this shaver head, in my opinion, are unwarranted.</li>
    <li> It fits and works. It is larger and cuts differently. Had to relearn the shaver.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is absolutely terrible. I was very happy with my purchase of the Norelco razor with the original heads and now I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off. The new head feels terrible and sticks against your face. The blades don&#x27;t shave as closely as the old head and they constantly pull at your hairs. I ended up getting more irritation than I ever have in the past. This truly is a terrible product and its bad enough that I&#x27;m considering getting rid of my Philips Norelco and replacing it with something else.</li>
    <li> With all of the bad reviews I was concerned about having to purchase this RQ12+ replacement head for my shaver.  I was pleasantly surprised that it shaves just as well as the old RQ12.  It is clearly a different design and the cleaning operation is different as well, but I haven&#x27;t found cleaning it to be any problem at all.  You just pop the top off and rinse it.  Reading the instructions is worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think it is way too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, once you have this redesigned head on your shaver, you can buy just the replacement cutters and combs in the future.  This is Phillips product SH90 and it is a bit cheaper than buying the complete replacement head.  I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet - just putting it out there as I didn&#x27;t see it mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> Since I could no longer find the RQ10 and Norelco says this fits that series, I bought it. It fits, as they say, and seems to shave well (first try), BUT a caution in &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; should be noted. With this larger head, the shaver will no longer fit in the travel case/charger. You have to take the head off to charge it or travel.  UPDATED REVIEW after 214 days of use, alternating with my old RQ10 for travel.   The RQ12+ is the worst of the Phillips/Norelco heads I have used in the last 30+ years. This should be brought to the attention of management and engineering. Someone really missed the boat. I will not buy another one.  In the 214 days since I bought my RQ12+ head, I have used it 136 times. The other days I have been traveling with the RQ10 head that was more than a year old when I bought the RQ12. The following comments are therefore based on using the old (worn) RQ10 36% of the time, altering with the RQ12+.  1. The results are very clear. The RQ12+ gives you a 5 o’clock shadow by noon. Yes, there is a clear, 5 hour difference in closeness.  A few times I’ve had to shave again in the evening.   2. There is an extra millimeter o so between the cutting area and the outer edge. This makes it much more difficult to shave close to the nose and ears.  3. There appears to be too much flexing in the floating units, as it requires much more facial expressions and stretches to actually cut. Without a good convex mirror, varias hairs are left long.  4. For whatever the reason, the RQ12+ requires going back and forth many more times from different angles and directions, taking between 150 to 190 seconds per shave, vs the 65 to 85 seconds for the RQ10. For what it is worth,that is 6 hours a year. But it also means an extra minute in the morning routine for getting ready for work. And, as noted above, the shave is still not satisfactory and by noon will be very noticeable.  5. That extra time means less time between charges. With the RQ10 head I can (and have) easilyextend a trip from 2 weeks to 3 without having brought the charger. I don’t like to take the charger as it is one more thing to remember when packing to return home. And anyone who doesn’t have the RQ10 charging case would have to take the fragile stand.   Was this change made for cost reasons? I have to doubt that, as you sell it for a lot more than the RQ10.   I will give credit for the easier snap off blade assembly for cleaning that you have on the RQ12+.  But at this point I have to think about the day my heads wear out. I will NOT buy another RQ12 head. If you haven’t fixed the problems I will probably start trying the Chinese knockoffs of the RQ10. They are poorly rated on most reviews, but can’t be worse than the RQ12+. Maybe someone will get it right.</li>
    <li> Noticeably closer/better looking shave than the older design RQ12 head. I have used the older RQ12 heads for at least 4 years and enjoyed them on my Sensotouch 3D.  The new design shaves quieter and much quicker than the old style head (the last one I had kept on the razor for probably 16 months... because of other people&#x27;s poor reviews on the new design). I liked the flip-out cleaning of the older head style, but this new one is still pretty simple to clean daily.  The new head does a much better job of trapping/holding the shaved whisker in the head.  The old one made quite a mess all over and I had to be very careful to be over the sink while using it. Overall I am quite pleased with the new design&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> Horrible on explicative all downgrade in quality of shaved and comfort from Norelco. I managed to pull two years of effortless and smooth shaving with the original RQ 12 heads that came with my 7100 unit the 3d head as it was called. When it came time to purchase a replacement head I noticed that people were selling them for as much as $300 but that Amazon said a new item this item the plus version was now available. This is by far the most surprising thing to happen in modern retail with which I can agree and I&#x27;m a part of. I&#x27;ve had a Norelco since early high school and every several years I would purchase a new or model and now over a decade latermy streak of satisfaction with Norelco has ended. This is not just a case of me whining and saying the razors aren&#x27;t as good. They are genuinely bad and I&#x27;ve even given them more than a month to &amp;#34;&amp;#34; adapt to my face. They miss hairs that aren&#x27;t even some of my course or hairs on my face andgrasp and pool at hairs that are more than a day or two old. I found that my shaving time has gone from as little as two or three minutes to nearly 10 minutes to get my whole face as I have to repeat areas with increased precision  on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin on my face and razors were very troublesome for me and the early Norelco models were even worse that would cause very painful razor burn and rash however these are more expensive models that I purchased in my 20s were we noticeable improvements with features as indispensable as using with cream as needed or in the shower and most importantly a smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t require repetitive motions over the same area and essentially beating The time it took me to shave with a razor blade and getting pretty much just as close without the need of going against the grain and risking ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am genuinely frustrated because I can&#x27;t handle a beard it makes me very itchy after about one week and once again I&#x27;m stuck with a shaving method that is extremely irritable to my skin and as a medical professional I have to stick to either clean-shaven or carrying and grooming  the beard&lt;br /&gt;Which May be fine for plenty of guys out there but it doesn&#x27;t look good on me and I don&#x27;t find that to be an alternative to not shaving. I really don&#x27;t think I should pay $300 to third-party sellers to get the original replacement blades when I got a great deal on Amazon in the first place of only $140 for the entire shaver with the jet clean system.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done my part leaving a very negative review about what is truly a negative product it&#x27;s not an opinion it&#x27;s as you will see from plenty of other men this is truly a step down as nobody would buy a replacement part unless they have already used the product with original parts. They are less comfortable, less efficient, painful in some instances, and not as dissectible as the previous version where you could take apart the heads individually quite easily hear the pop off connected and you must manipulate a plastic lever. Also you can&#x27;t focus in on the save the mustache area using a single head as I was used to as Norelco may claim this new model has more motion I find that to be simply a lie as I still have the original head and it is much more flexible and has greater contour to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having finished up my Amazon review I recommend you do what I did and contact Norelco support asking if they&#x27;re willing to sell you the old model and when they say they discontinue it express your dissatisfaction and reference the fact that not only on Amazon but other consumer sites the product is receiving very negative reviews but even when you take the average the product is ratedmuch lower than his predecessor. And these are never off those higher end models this is the kind of stuff that is great for companies like Braun</li>
    <li> Finally I could get a new head for my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone ran out of the RQ-12. I searched high and low. Not only could I not find the head, I could find an explanation for why no one had them except for crazy $169 type prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally this head shipped and all became clear. RQ-12 has been replaced with this upgraded yet perfectly compatible head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a shaver that could handle my fine gossamer thin hairs all the way up to my wirey ape thick hairs along my neck line. The RQ-12 was good but this new replacement head is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the wait but I could have been happier if there had been some transparency on the upgrade process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo for making my shaver instantly much better. I&#x27;ve never had a shaver company do that for me before.</li>
    <li> Based on the many negative reviews here about this item I was really concerned that I would not be happy with this shaving head. I ordered the RQ12/62 anyway thinking I might end up buying a different shaver if it didn&#x27;t work well for me. With quite a bit of doubt about the quality and functionality of the product compared to the original RQ12 that came with my Sensotouch 3D, I used the RQ12/62 for the first time today and must say it was great - at least as good as the original head and probably significantly better. It was a very close shave, smooth, no tugs or pulls as reported in many reviews. I only use the shaver with gel and maybe that&#x27;s why my result is so good. Possibly dry shaving with it is not as good, but regardless, with gel is the way I use it and am extremely satisfied. The cleaning after the shave is simple and fast - different than the RQ12 but easy nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Seems to work just as well as the old style head that it replaced. Time will tell if it will last as long as the old style.</li>
    <li> To expansive and not as good as the one came with the machine</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t repeat what everyone else has already stated about the poor quality of this replacement and the horrific handling of this change for the top end of their shaver line, but I did want to at least add another substantiation of the poor attempt at a cheap replacement here.  Time to switch brands.</li>
    <li> I found these replacements better than the original RQ12, great service from Amazon as usual. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Agree with all other reviewers. Never had issues till Norelco decided to change this head and made it super-expensive and worse. Have had Norelco for many years and this is my last one.  On the other side, when the RQ12 head was in short supply I rediscovered the pleasure (and the much cheaper prices) of shaving with a blade. I recommend you do the same!</li>
    <li> Greatly evolved shaver head delivers a close and comfortable end result.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever- thank you Norelco engineers!</li>
    <li> I could not figure out how to replace the head of my Sensotouch 1250x razor with this new replacement head so I called Philips customer/product support and, after 30 minutes on the phone, they could not tell me what to do. I finally spoke to a supervisor and she was as clueless as the representative I first spoke to. No help and don&#x27;t know their products. I&#x27;m returning it and never using Philips again.</li>
    <li> It is a great razor head but the cost is ridiculous.  It needs to be replaced once a year at 60$ really adds up. It almost makes you want to buy a cheaper razor with affordable heads.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people complain so much about this replacement head? It is an upgraded head for my Arcitec and much nicer then the original head. It works better than what I had which was the original head that was 4 years old. I always had to finish with a razor but not with this new head.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original but works well</li>
    <li> I have been using this replacement head for about two months now, and I think that this&lt;br /&gt;is just a &amp;#34;Cheap&amp;#34; replacement for the original head. The shave quality isn&#x27;t nearly as good&lt;br /&gt;as the original RQ12, and after spending the money on my shaver, it is really a shame that&lt;br /&gt;I have to now endure this substandard replacement head.</li>
    <li> It works, and cuts just fine.  Can&#x27;t say that I like it as well as the other one , but I am getting used to it.  It really is not that hard to clean because the whole top with the blades in it snaps off and you can put it under the faucet to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still bitter that Philips Norelco sold the product with a much higher end shaving head and then decided they were going to cut their own costs and provide a much cheaper (in design, not cost to consumer) model replacement head.  Seems like a &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; move to me!  This is the last product I will be purchasing from them because of their dishonestly to the customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, yes, this does work but it is far from what I expected when I purchased the new shaver.  If you have one of the shavers and do not feel like throwing it away just yet, you will find that this replacement works OK.  You will have to fork our more money than it is worth but, if you are willing do to so, this will give you a sharper cut than your worn out blades.</li>
    <li> Not good. The original one is much better, but much more expensive! Based on the price for the shaver device, the heads are the trap.</li>
    <li> Works great. Better than original equipment. Better, closer shave!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product that has greatly diminished in value from the prior model. It&#x27;s performance is inferior and the quality of the product is poor. Instead of wasting my money on another replacement head, I will instead move to yet another razor.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ask me how but they are just different from the OEM head and not for the better.</li>
    <li> Very happen. Much easier to clean!</li>
    <li> this is a real cheaply made head. the blades rattle against the head and the quaility of the shave is much worse than the original head.</li>
    <li> Not a good as the original RQ12 replacement head - doesent seem to shave as well. Hopefully Phillips will make the original RQ12 available again.</li>
    <li> Well satisfied. Gives a close shave. I use Lectric Shave as a prep.</li>
    <li> This head is larger than the original RQ12. Also feels a bit more scratchy on the face. Definitely preferred the old head over this one.</li>
    <li> It works fine, a big improvement over the first design.  This was a design failure by Norelco and it should have been replaced free of charge!</li>
    <li> Works a hole lot better then the old one did! Gives a much closer shave! Love it!</li>
    <li> After reading the mostly negative reviews, I delayed ordering this for several months. I contemplated tossing this Norelco and replacing it with a Braun but I had one of those before and it had its own issues.  Given the ease of returning products on Amazon, I took the risk on this new shaving head. I&#x27;m sure glad I did.  I can&#x27;t say whether or not this is superior to the original head in shaving performance since my memory is about as long as a gnat&#x27;s life but I can say that it&#x27;s a vast improvement on the worn out head.  It makes shaving easy again.  It&#x27;s easy enough to clean. This experience makes me doubt the persnickety reviews of this and many other products I read about on line.  Maybe this isn&#x27;t a perfect shaving head but it works perfectly for me. My advice is to buy it and not worry.</li>
    <li> These refills tend to dig into the face and pinch the skin. The actual shaving of the beard is OK but are a bit louder than the older style. I too am waiting for the blades to fall out of the razor. Very cheaply made....guess Norelco needs the money more than the quality!</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous writers about the RQ12 replacement head for my 1260x; I prefer the original head design which seems to be unavailable. Further, why are we forced to buy the whole head? Why can&#x27;t I buy just the replacement blades like I used to with my previous model? At $65 to buy the RQ12 replacement head, I might just spend my money towards a Braun razor and try it. Sideburn trimmer on the 1260x is also worse than my previous model.</li>
    <li> I like the older style replacement better.</li>
    <li> Received the replacement heads but they do not work as well as the original heads.</li>
    <li> It separates from the shaver on almost every use.  I miss the original hinge to open and clean.  For the price it does not meet expectations.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is pure junk compared to the original head. I want the original head that was of superior quality and so easy to clean. Norelco is going to lose a lot of customers with this ripoff.</li>
    <li> They had a great razor in the old style and then they completely screwed it up. i used norelco for thirty years and now i am looking at other brands.</li>
    <li> My original shaving head got dull fast and you can&#x27;t get these things sharpened!  I have a very thick beard and buying a new head was the only option.</li>
    <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> This head is absolute crap. It pulls hairs and hurts the skin. I am shocked that Philips think this is an acceptable switch for the RQ12. I will be looking for a new shaver. What does Philips have to say about this? And why does Amazon keep stocking this junk and selling it for over $50!</li>
    <li> This head is a cheap replacement for the RQ12 original head. The three cutter heads used to fold open on original RQ12 model and allow you to easily clean both sides of the razor head.  With this replacement model you have to pry it off the razor head to clean underneath. I used to get a years use out of the original RQ12 razor head.  I have only used this one for four months and the razor is already signaling that it is time to replace the head. It does not shave as smooth even with careful care to clean the head after each use.  Value Engineering (a method to redesign products and take cost out) strikes again. Considering that you pay about $200 for the original system and about $50 for each replacement head, this has gotten to be a real rip off. I looked at the new razor design at Costco yesterday and it is the same cheap design as the this replacement head. No Thanks! I will be looking for a new brand to replace this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> New design fits tight, quieter and much easier to clean . . .</li>
    <li> This replacement head was easy to install and works great.  It shaves as good if not better than the original RQ12 head that came on my razor.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the plastic construction as others have.  It is a bit of a pain to take it all apart and clean out the individual shaving heads, but it is difficult and it does help the shaver to do it once a week or so.  Overall, I think this is a good replacement head.</li>
    <li> Hard to understand function</li>
    <li> So, I made the mistake of trying to think this thing is plug and play. Yeah, don&#x27;t do that. Read the instructions! It&#x27;s very important! Otherwise the razor won&#x27;t work well. My dad said his just didn&#x27;t cut very well, mine cut my face like a straight edge. Make sure you read the instructions. Very critical step. Can&#x27;t stress that enough...     5 stars because the plus version is 100x easier to clean than the RQ12, which just flipped open, and when you went to bang out the hair from the razor, it would just close. Stupid design.</li>
    <li> Great item especially at the lower price.</li>
    <li> notmas good s the originals</li>
    <li> Not like the original.</li>
    <li> I purchased the RQ12+ replacement head for my Arcitec razor.  I bought it because it was advertised as a RQ10 upgrade replacement.  It works so much better than the RQ10, smoother on the skin and the ability to rotate the cutting heads, and open completely to empty cuttings and wash out easily.  The cutters pivot on two planes which keep the cutters against the skin continually and give a great shave.  A honest upgrade to an already great shaver.</li>
    <li> A sub-par replacement for the original SensoTouch shaver head (the original one where the 3 blades actually popped open for easy cleaning).  I am extremely disappointed with Norelco.  I had been a loyal customer for a long time (I have purchased 4 Norelco shavers over the years), and was delighted with the performance of the 1250x when I bought it; the shaves were close, comfortable, and cleaning was easy - simply flip open the 3 individual blade housings after my daily shower-shave, rinse under running water (in the shower) and once a week, run it through the cleaning station -- all was good.  Then around the 12-month mark, it was time for the head to be replaced (very early in 2014)....and when I went to order a replacement, I saw that the price of the heads was astronomic, both on Amazon and elsewhere....all $100+, often reaching even higher, absolutely ridiculous levels!  Searching the internet quickly made it obvious that Norelco was no longer supplying those heads, and they had left their loyal customers to fend for themselves against opportunistic sellers and their crazy price mark-ups (read \\&quot;gouging\\&quot;).  Now that is one thing any company worth an iota of common-sense will not do....to not have replacement components instantly available for a highly rated product that is designed for periodic part replacement.  And then to add insult to injury, when they FINALLY do start supplying replacement heads again, it is with this sub-par head!  It does not flip open for easy/thorough cleaning, but more importantly, it does not shave anywhere as close as the original RQ12 heads.  When I first got this replacement head, I thought that maybe it needed a week or two of \\&quot;breaking-in\\&quot; before coming up to snuff (by the way, the original head that came with my shaver needed no such breaking-in and shaved very well from Day 1), but nevertheless I gave this replacement head the benefit of the doubt.  But much to my dismay, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t going to get any better, and that it shaved no better than my 12-month old original (and now worn) head.  So after first feeling let down by Norelco around the lack of reasonably priced replacements for the better part of 2014, and then the sleight-of-hand of replacing the original with a cheaper replacement (but with no commensurate reduction in price to match the reduction in performance), I have concluded that I am ready to part ways with Norelco shavers.  I am hearing great things about the Braun 799cc wet-dry shaver, so am on the lookout for an upcoming sale so I can finally switch over.</li>
    <li> If you get a good shave with this POS replacement let me know. I just threw out my Norelco 3D and cleaning apparatus and went back to my Gillette. What was I thinking!</li>
    <li> This is a quality replacement head.  Yes, the older style was a little better, but it was still plastic.  Easy to clean (just pop off and rinse), and I get a shave as good or better than the old style (the shave is better when compared to a year-old cutting blade, but can&#x27;t do a fair comparison without a NOS unit).  Glad I didn&#x27;t listen to all the negative reviews here.</li>
    <li> Bought it as replacement for the original head for my Ultra Sensor Touch 3D. Even though it  is different from the original, it works. The original used to open as a flower and I could rinse it without having to remove the shavers (the very top of of the RQ12 replacement). I would have preffered one like the original, but it seen Norelco has discontunued the production of the original replacement part.</li>
    <li> These hurt at first because it is a closer shave. Takes some getting use too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the RQ12 replacement heads for my SensoTouch 3D.  The R12 replacement head is $150 and the RQ12 was only $50&lt;br /&gt;While the RQ12 do work, its design is poor.  Cleaning the RQ12 involves opening up the head, removing a cheap plastic ring and cleaning the blades.  Cleaning of the R12 is much easier.  Moreover, because of the design of the RQ12, all hairs are captured inside the head, it makes the need to clean the heads more frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unlikely to replace the RQ12 heads next year with similar blades and do to the cost of the R12 replacement heads, it may make more sense to replace the entire unit with a newer model.&lt;br /&gt;When I pick a new electronic razor --I will pay more attention to the cost of replacement blades.</li>
    <li> This one is a redesign and is not the flawed design that many reviews speak of. No longer has flip blades for easy cleaning. But it makes my shaver good as new.    Edit- Pulled off 1 star. While it works okay, it does not shave ANYWHERE as good as the original RQ12 design.</li>
    <li> It is better than I thought it would be. Not pleased with Norelco with the cost of replacement heads but htis one is good!</li>
    <li> shaves very well and is much easier to clean than the heads which it replaced</li>
    <li> This is not Sarah Cullen but Shawn Cullen (shared Amazon account).  I have used both this replacement head and the obsolete, now ridiculously expensive older model.  This one is just as good at a fraction of the cost.  The shave is close and consistent, there is no difference.  This head does not feel more cheaply made than its predecessor.  It is not more difficult to clean than its predecessor.  I&#x27;m not sure what all of the whining is about other than its different in construct - you pop the top off versus flipping up each individual cutter head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just as easy to use, is the same quality, and shaves just as well.  I would not (and won&#x27;t) hesitate to buy it again in a year when I&#x27;m due for a new shaver head.</li>
    <li> Was a long-time user of Norelco rotaries, then Braun and Panasonic foil, then DE razor, now back to Norelco.  I previously used a 1280 and 1290x, and this replacement head provides a shave that is better (for me) in comfort, closeness, and speed compared to the older flip-top, as well as being easier to clean - pop off the top plate with the heads, rinse shaver and heads under hot water, replace.  I didn&#x27;t follow the negative comments about cleaning - rinsing the plate with hot water does a very thorough cleaning job on these heads, and fewer hinges, springs and wires compared to the flip-top (in fact, none) to get clogged up with gunk while shaving.  You would likely never remove them individually except to replace them - something you couldn&#x27;t do on the older Norelcos.  These heads cut closer and with less irritation, and are quieter as well; comes with the plastic head guard and removal tool.  A quality replacement.</li>
    <li> poor design, bring back the old style, dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Wrong replacement head for my razor. Lousy s have with new heads .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wrong parts</li>
    <li> Philips always make very good products. This one is no different.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;, even if it is easier to clean, and forget about sharpening the rotory blades.  With the current shaving heads angles, I find that I have to shave much longer to get the same smoothness that i got with the RQ12.  Thanks for asking</li>
    <li> Though it is sold as a replacement head it is not as convenient and efficient as the original. It is a little larger and not as flexible.</li>
    <li> Used this to replace my old head, and yes, it is different, but I have to say it really is working better than my old blades providing a much closer shave (then again, the old blades were about 5 years old).  It does come apart for quick cleaning, just remove the blades from the head using a notch at the top and rinse the entire blade compartment under hot water.  It came with the little orange contraption to remove the blades for heavy cleaning, and it does work well.  Is it durable?  I can&#x27;t answer that as I have only had it a few weeks, but for the price, I think it is well worth it and I am very pleased at this time.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this if you have a SensoTouch 3D Norelco razor. Norelco claims on the packaging that this is the proper replacement head but it is not. The head does fit, but the design is completely different. I tried this shaving head, but it provided a shave that was both poor quality and painful.</li>
    <li> The controversy over this replacement head caused me to prolong replacement of my original as long as I could. I really stressed over buying this because of all the negative reviews. I&#x27;m happy to say they are completely unfounded. I have a difficult to shave face and I loved how the other blades moved and always gave me a close shave. This new head gives me an even better shave in less time and is much easier to clean. Granted, the support material for the blades is made of plastic which ended up having no bearing on the performance of the blades what so ever. It did make the shaver lighter, which is not a bad thing in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level of detail and machining that went into the the old style did give the shaver a step up in perceived value, but at the end of the day it really comes down to how well it shaves your beard right? Well I&#x27;m happy to say it still performs admirably in that department.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews for this product. The head that it replaces, the Norelco RQ12, was gimmicky and fragile. It also looked expensive to manufacture, which undoubtedly led to Norelco replacing it with the RQ12+. I get a much better shave with the RQ12+. In fact, it is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor. I switched to blades years ago to get a closer shave without irritation but got tired of cutting myself, sometimes quite badly. I decided to give electric razors a try again when I found that I could use this Norelco wet and with shaving cream. Yes, I have to go over an area several times but I find that with a lubricating shave gel I can get a shave as close as a blade without irritation. With the original RQ12, I would still nick myself occasionally. With the RQ12+, I&#x27;ve never had that happen. Don&#x27;t believe the haters. This replacement head is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed that they made this cheaper replacement model which works almost as well and costs more now. Not quite as easy to clean and after a month I really don&#x27;t think I can get as good of a shave dry as the old model. Wet shave is as nice as the old one though.</li>
    <li> I found these new blades in the modified head to be superior to the original.  They are easier to clean by simply pulling the top off of the head and brushing out the whiskers.  This was harder with the older head.  The shave seems quite close, but this could be due to the fact that the original blades were a year old when the razor said they needed to be replaced.  I saw others have complained about this new style, but I see nothing to complain about.  I have to be careful and not lose the tool they sent to remove the blades from the head, but other than that this seems to me to be some improvement.  My only complaint is to why they are so expensive.</li>
    <li> A significantly less desirable shaver head. The original head on my Sensotouch 3d was of a much higher quality. This new version may fit like the original, but is not an equivalent replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an Arcitec shaver for several years.  I thought it was a very good shaver, but upgrading to the RQ12+ head was amazing.  Shave time is improved by at least 30%.  Long hairs that alluded the old head are gobbled up, no problem.  Sideburn edging is much sharper without using the edge trimmer.</li>
    <li> Better pricing than the original I required</li>
    <li> I have been very skeptical of buying this product due to the reviews of the item on this site.  I have put off buying a new shaving head for my Norelco 1290X shaver for that very reason.  I purchased the shaver in December of 2012 and have not replaced the head until now.  Silly me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review:  All that I can say is WOW!  I have long since forgotten what a close shave was until installing my new heads.  Now I remember why I was so excited to get my Shaver.  It actually shaves better than when new, if that is possible.  I have a very tough beard, and had resorted to going back over my face with a trimmer type shaver after I was through shaving with the Norelco.  No longer necessary.  And as for the cleaning of the new head........again........WOW!  Super easy and super effective.  I never got close to my shaver being this clean, even when using the Jet Clean system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this head for anyone with a shaver that utilizes this model.  It is like getting a new shaver every time that you change heads.  I have no idea how long this head will continue to perform like this, but compared to my old one, it is light years ahead of where I was after 2 and a half years.</li>
    <li> I initially chalked up all the negative reviews to disgruntled customers that couldn&#x27;t deal with something being different.  This is Norelco after all and I&#x27;ve been nothing but pleased with my shaves up until now; especially with the 1250X, to date the best electric I&#x27;ve ever used.  Then I received the RQ12+ as a gift and realized how very wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;The hair pulling, the sandpaper closeness, the poor hair pickup, the increased passes, the longer shave time; it&#x27;s all there and as described by hundreds of other reviews.  I particularly noticed that it was virtually incapable of shaving my neck, no matter how many passes at whatever angle and approach I made.  The final nail in the coffin for me, was after 3 weeks of poor shaves, I stopped halfway through my latest and put my old RQ12 back on.  Even with 11 months of usage on it, it shaved remarkably better and quicker than the RQ12+&lt;br /&gt;So, give this RQ12+ a try if you must, but my recommendation is to use your original model until your face bleeds and then seek out a whole new electric.  Personally, I&#x27;m taking a few years off from Norelco when my original RQ12 gives up the ghost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short because others have already repeated the basic points I want to make. This new replacement head is a piece of junk. The heads and the rings that are supposed to hold them in constantly fall out of place. They&#x27;re small and hard to reinsert, even though I did my best to follow the microscopic instructions. They don&#x27;t properly lock into place, and they can easily get lost. The previous replacement head design was far superior, but I guess these new ones are cheaper to manufacture. I&#x27;ve had enough frustration though. I contacted Norelco twice but they were no help at all. I will see what Braun or Panasonic have to offer. Like others have said in their reviews, I only wish I could rate this zero or negative stars.</li>
    <li> much worst then the old and original model. Do not reccomend.</li>
    <li> Do not like the RQ12+ as much as the&lt;br /&gt;RQ12 that was on the shaver when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> More than I expected, works great</li>
    <li> not as good as the original</li>
    <li> I read through all these reviews and very nervously bought one of these replacement heads, because there&#x27;s no better alternative.  And while I share the concern that swapping in different replacement heads to a product like this is not a great practice (one of the reasons i bought this razor was on the expectation there would be decent replacement parts available), i have to say that when all is said and done - the replacement works fine!  There&#x27;s lots of reviews to the contrary so maybe i&#x27;m an outlier, but this new head works great for me, it&#x27;s quiet, easy to clean, and i notice no change in the quality of the shave.</li>
    <li> What a scam - The original RQ12 head was perfect this is a cheap version that performs poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is bait and switch from Norelco, you buy the razor with a superior head and the only replacement is sub par.  I&#x27;ve been a customer for life, but this makes me ask why.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the naysayers say otherwise.  The new head which is a replacement for the old RQ12 head and also fits a new series of high end shavers from Norelco, works very well.  The head design is different, but the shave quality is as good or better than the old original head that I had on my shaver, which was the original RQ12 head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers are claiming that this shaver head is unsatisfactory, however my advice would be similar as if somebody was transitioning from an old electric shaver to a new one, or from blade shaving to electric shaving.  As with any new shaver, you have to give your face and skin a little time to get used to the new cutting head.  Shave slowly, don&#x27;t apply too much pressure and be gentile, at least until the blades and screens are a bit broken in and your face is also conditioned to the new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the old RQ12, the new head is two pieces, no more individual opening shaver heads.  The bottom piece is the geared drive unit which mates up with the shaver power handle, the upper piece holds the three shaving heads.  The three shaving heads move independently, same as the old RQ12, however they seem to have more axes of motion.  An orange &amp;#34;wrench&amp;#34; comes with the replacement head set which allows you to unlock the individual blade from the foil head for removal and cleaning.  This is unlike the old RQ12 in which each blade head flipped open on a hinge.  That is actually the biggest structural difference between the two heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the automated cleaning system and this head works find with the wet automated cleaning cycles.  The head is also quieter than the old head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is basically an improvement to the shaver, without having to go out and buy a new shaver.  Norelco has had the forethought to provide older shaver owners a built in upgrade to the shaving technology on their newer shavers by virtue of selling current shipping replacement heads to older shaver owners.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco can take there products and shuff it up there royal asses after raising there regular RQ12 razor $200 plus!!!</li>
    <li> I needed a little help to understand how to install the new cutting head but all is fine now</li>
    <li> Waste of money!!! My one year old blades cut better.</li>
    <li> I initially did not purchase the RQ12+ after reading many of the negative reviews. But then I decided to try it after reading a good point raised by one of the reviewers regarding the fact the RQ12+ head comes with the new shavers but that no one reported any issues??  I received my new head last week and I&#x27;m getting a nice close shave.  It&#x27;s hard to compare between both heads when you have the new head (RQ12+) but only a &#x27;perception&#x27; of the experience with the original head (RQ12).  Perhaps it would be more objective if someone performed a comparison test using both heads when they are both new, RQ12 and RQ12+.  It could very well be taking me longer to shave using the RQ12+ as oppose to the RQ12.  Hard to say since I bought my razor over two years ago and did not use the razor for 8 months because I did not buy the RQ12+ due to negative reviews.  Bottom line, it might take me a few minutes longer to get a close shave than the original head, but I&#x27;m Ok with the time factor...the important concern for me is that I get the close shave...which I&#x27;m getting.  Perhaps Norelco could have made an improvement to the RQ12+ over the past few weeks or months just prior to my purchase??</li>
    <li> Ignore the 1-star reviews; this &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; version is far superior in performance to the original RQ12, to the point where it is as good as a regular razor blade. The only drawback is the head, to be cleaned, comes off entirely and has to be air dried. The head isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; in any way, but a major, major improvement that has allowed me to stop with manual shaving.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as represented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll echo the many other 1 star ratings for the Norelco RQ12+--it just doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as well as the original blade, but what&#x27;s a guy to do? My wife thinks it is strange I have 5 different shavers in the medicine cabinet because none of them shave well in all areas. Each of the 5 shavers is the top of the line for Panasonic, Braun, and Norelco. The Braun is a good dry shaver but doesn&#x27;t shave as close as either the Panasonic or Norelco. 15 years ago the Panasonic gave an incredible shave--quick and close. Then they changed the tolerance on their replacement heads as has Noreclo and neither shave as close or fast. In fact, with this new Norelco RQ12+ replacement head I have to go over and over and over an area from different angles to get the smooth shave I want. So I can still get a decent shave, but it takes twice as long and isn&#x27;t as good as the original shaving head. I also tried a Noreclo 2D head and it shaves about as well and is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very cheap replacement shave head. Not as flexible as the one that came with my razor. Does not shave as well as the one it replaced. I contacted Norelco and all they could say was that this is the only replacement available.</li>
    <li> I liked the new design when I received it 6 months ago. I don&#x27;t any more. The original design lasted me a full year. In that year, I did not notice a degradation in the quality of the shave. After 6 months with the new design, I can not get the shave to be close and will order a new replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes me want to switch back to a Braun!</li>
    <li> The shave is not very smooth and it pulls the hair. Not a superior product for the price. Seems more gimmicky than functional.</li>
    <li> You  cannot simply lift up the blades and run them under hot water to clean them.  They have plastic retainers that go all over the place when you lift off  the blades.  They are not the same blades as you receive on the 1250X46. I might returnn them if I can get the old replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Anybody who claims this head is better than the original is somebody who obviously never used the original. The only reason I bought my Senso Touch 3D was because of the unique pivoting flexible design which I use exclusively on my head. I feel cheated that the head design had been discontinued and never would have bought the razor in the first place if not for the flexible head design. The original head spread and flexed to keep good contact on my skull for a nice quick shave that gave a clean bald look. This substandard cheaply made head, despite being brand new and supposedly top of the line, doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my well used 2 year old original style head. The original design glides over my skull, actually cutting the hair. The junky feeling replacement head sticks to my skin and is laughably deficient in cutting hair- leaving strays all over the place that I have to hunt for so that I can spend 10+ seconds trying to get this head to shave them off. It takes almost twice as long to get the job done now compared to the old head design, which I thankfully kept. A complete waste of money- a bait and switch ripoff as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> When I first received this, I thought it was terrible compared to the original head.  I even wanted put on the old head, but then I thought, what the heck, I bought it already and might as well try it out for a couple more times like one of the review said.  After about the third shave, I noticed that it is at least as good as the original head.  However, like another reviewer said, you just press on the face lightly; not as hard as the old head.  So try to be patient with it, guysl</li>
    <li> Husband does not like it. Even though it says it replaces the original one, It does not work as well.</li>
    <li> The new product does not allow the heads to be lifted up to be rinsed.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but the replacement heads were so bad that I feel the need to. Not only did they not work as well as the original heads they also fell apart after 2 months of very light use. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was so hesitate to buy this model due to so many bad review. However my previous head was two years old and I don&#x27;t want to pay the double price for the old model which is ridiculous high price. I want to give it a try because the old RQ12 has a big design flaw, e.g. It can&#x27;t hold the facial hair very well. Whenever I used it it drop the hair all the time. Very annoying! In addition I didn&#x27;t feel significant improvement over RQ11. Fortunately, I found the new model fix this problem very well and I will never need to worry about it. I think that is why lots of people complain it&#x27;s hard to clean but I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a new issue. It does has different feeling as the old model and it does its job no worse that the old one, my feeling is it&#x27;s actually better. I take off one star because the build quality looks really not as good as the old one.</li>
    <li> At $180 for the proper replacement heads (RQ-12) and $200 for a complete new razor, I will buy the 1290X and spend the next year looking for a new brand of shaver. The Rq-12+ is junk.</li>
    <li> These are slightly different than the ones my husband has.  They don&#x27;t flip open for cleaning like the previous ones.  But they still work well just not as easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The Norelco shaver and RQ12 fill all the shaving needs I would desire.</li>
    <li> A real reduction in quality without a corresponding reduction in price.  I&#x27;m done with Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s all the negative comments? It fit great, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and the shave was better than the original. Price is still a little steep but considering the cost of the older all metal heads this is a bargain. Also, the beard shavings don&#x27;t stick to it after shaving like the original blades. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This does not fit the SensoTouch 3D or razors claiming to need and RQ12 head.  Its a nightmare trying to figure out the right replacement head or blades so I think I will be switching to a braun.</li>
    <li> No issues with product.  Worked with my older model just fine.</li>
    <li> Tend to pull and not cut cleanly.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco for 20 plus years and this is the first product in which I have been disappointed.  My old heads were quieter and smoother, but I tossed them too soon.  Now considering buying a new razor - $200 plus???</li>
    <li> Excellent result. Specialy when using wet. I have been using Philips shavers for 54 years . This new shaving head suites me well. Great close shave.</li>
    <li> The Sensotouch 3D razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used: comfortable, easy to clean, and extremely quiet. But I was dismayed to learn that the old RQ12 replacement heads (with the three flip-up covers) were no longer available--other than from gougers who are charging two or three times the normal price. I was way overdue for a replacement head so, despite some negative reviews, I was forced to order the RQ12+. But when I got it, I was pleasantly surprised!  The RQ12+ is as easy, if not easier, to clean as the old design. You just lift off the top, run it under hot water and shake it off. The head snaps on with a tighter seal than the old design so the razor doesn&#x27;t leak whiskers onto the counter while you shave. But the biggest improvement is that the edges are narrower and tapered downward. The old design had a wide, flat border around the circular heads, making it very difficult to shave the area immediately below the septum (middle of the nose).  The negatives are not too bad, in my opinion. The razor is still quiet but I would say just a touch louder with the new head design. The new v-shaped cutters are a tiny bit less comfortable for the first few weeks, but now it feels fine and my shave time is reduced. All in all, if given a choice between the old and new design offered at the same price, I would select the new design, though I would be happy with either one.</li>
    <li> Better shave and it seems to use less battery power</li>
    <li> This should receive negative stars. The head is a garbage plastic knockoff of the previous head - compare the two, it&#x27;s very apparent. The cheap plastic heads are very uncomfortable and it&#x27;s impossible to get anything near to a clean shave, even applying a heavy amount of pressure. Anyone rating this over two stars is clearly delusional or in Philip&#x27;s pocket to boost the 1-2 star rating they previously had. Reading the five-star reviews makes it apparent that is what&#x27;s happening. I definitely won&#x27;t buy from these clowns again - they&#x27;ve always had problematic products and their customer service is abysmal.</li>
    <li> Excellent! fits the 1050x</li>
    <li> This is in no way a close replacement (pun intended). It does not work as the original head. It is noisy and hard to clean. I think that Philips should reimburse people who paid for this junk and send them original heads instead. I paid almost $200 or the shaver (here on Amazon). The shaver is decent, perfect and easy to clean, but this replacement head rendered it useless. I do not recommend this replacement heard.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well and I will buy more</li>
    <li> This replacement head is not the same as the one that originally came with the shaver. It doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave a pulls your hair out instead of cutting it. Apparently Norelco changed the design.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original blades. Quite overpriced. Not happy and will consider getting a razor from a competitor.</li>
    <li> the replacement head worked great!</li>
    <li> Good...Better than the last one</li>
    <li> The new design of the Norelco RQ12+ provides a much better closer shave. It is much much easier to remove and clean compared to the original head. The replaceable blades should be more economical than replacing the whole head when the blades wear out.</li>
    <li> New and improved replacement heads for shaver than orginally purchased with. Recommended by Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have an older Sens-a-trac Norelco and this set of heads fits perfectly and gives the best and quickest shave of any of the previous shave heads I have owned.</li>
    <li> Do not cut as well as the original head model, but still do a good job.</li>
    <li> I purchased the RQ12 Plus to replace the more than 1 year old RQ12 head in my Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3D shaver. Once I replaced the RQ12 with the RQ12 Plus in the shaver, I noticed a significant degradation of shaving performance. The shave I got was uneven and not nearly as smooth. There is nothing Plus about this version. It feels very cheap and should be more properly labeled RQ12 Minus. Wet shaving with shaving gel was the only way to get a decent shave with the RQ12 Plus. I have since removed the RQ12 Plus from the shaver and reattached the older RQ12 head.. Despite having been used for more than a year, it provided a much better shave. Knowing that the lifespan of the RQ12 head is not unlimited and not willing to spend $180+ for a new RQ12 head ($254 on sale at the Norelco site), I have opted to purchase a Braun 790cc-4 shaver for about $150. This is my first Braun purchase and am very happy with its shaving performance. I had been a longtime customer of Philips Norelco but I believe they have lost me as a customer with the very poor design of the RQ12 Plus.</li>
    <li> Roughest shave ever!  I&#x27;ve had my Norelco for years. I had to replace the head only to find out the manufacture changes the head with some cheap plastic junk.  It cuts and pulls. Poor quality and cleaning is a hassel. I miss the older model.  I&#x27;ll be buying a different brand Electric shaver. Thanks Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> We would give it a zero if we could.  Bought the original Senso3D in February of 2014 with the original RQ12 head.  It was amazing and the original head last for 15 months.  Despite the bad reviews, we decided to buy this replacement head even though it is for the RQ12+ and not the original RQ12.  It is no longer easy to clean.  The head covers to not hinge open like the original so it is much harder to clean them and let them air dry.  We purchased this new head and began using it in May 2015.  It is already beginning to tug and not give a close shave after 5 weeks of use.  We spoke to Philips Norelco customer service.  They replacement head is not under warranty and they would not replace the head.  The offer was a 15% coupon off their site and free shipping.  This head is still listed on their parts site for $79.95.  No thanks!  I told them we will not be buying another head and we will not be replacing this shaver with a Norelco.</li>
    <li> Great upgrade for my Arcitec shaver. Much better shaving performance than the original and it just plugs straight in.</li>
    <li> It Isa very good replacement head that gives a good close shave</li>
    <li> very disappointed in quality of shave</li>
    <li> I read some negative reviews but I had no choice - this is the only compatible blades for my Norelco razor. Some of the positive reviews claim that although this head appears cheap, it shaves as well as the original RQ 12. It does not. I have used this for about a month now. You have to spend half an hour to get a clean head shave. Half an hour!! It really does not shave cleanly. And it definitely does not work as well as the original RQ 12. Considering how Norelco has tied me in with my razor purchase, this will be my last Norelco. I will not purchase more blade beyond this one.</li>
    <li> Worst blades ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very rough to use ur skin gets very hard after wards</li>
    <li> A well known manufacture is now making junk . It&#x27;s time to look for another electric razor.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband&#x27;s sensor touch 3D when the razor keeps telling us to change head. After reading all the bad reviews I still want to give it a try since it&#x27;s the only thing available, and I thought maybe it&#x27;s not that bad. But it is. It works worse than the two years old head. So much for the pulling and hurting, it doesn&#x27;t shave! I&#x27;m so glad that I kept the old head so I can switch back. This is just a waste of money. Philips please listen to the complaints and continue the original RQ12!</li>
    <li> Was advised that the older model has been discontinued and hence to buy the new &amp;#34;improved one&amp;#34;, but in reality this is a utter pathetic shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to get hold of the older model, which fared sooo much better than this. This one jst does not shave it, one has to use a normal razor blade to do a proper shaving. I mean the whole point was to cut time from traditional shaving method and this now adds double the time plus does not shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY BE AWAY FROM THIS, get the older model instead.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband.  He how has it for more than 4 months.  At first he said it was not much worse than the original.  He now says its the worst shaver he has had.  He is very disappointed as before replacing the head it was the best shaver had ever had.  he had the original heads for more than 1 year with no issues.  Now the new heads clearly are causing ingrown hairs, razor burns, etc.  He may leave Norelco and go to another brand because of such poor experience with the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> It should be one piece not two paces</li>
    <li> Many folks don&#x27;t like this redesign of the shaving head, but I found that it performed just as well as the RQ12.  The old design was a little easier to clean (heads pivoted out), but with this one the entire assembly pops off easily for cleaning.  Unlike the old design, the cutters are replaceable, but I haven&#x27;t tried to replace them yet.</li>
    <li> I wanted to be okay with the Big Change/Switch-a-roo Philips Norelco did on us with this newly designed replacement head.  It&#x27;s a boondoggle of the biggest kind.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with it for 3 weeks or so and it&#x27;s about as good as my old former-designed head I had been using for a year.  Shaving takes longer, it pulls/catches (heavy beard here), you can&#x27;t use it in the shower any more and I&#x27;ve got razor burn/ingrown hairs/skin rash on my neck/throat area all the time now.</li>
    <li> Fit great and worked like it was designed. Would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> With this replacement head Norelco has ruined a great razor.  BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL REPLACEMENT HEAD AT A REASONABLE PRICE!!</li>
    <li> I did not think it was the right replacement head because it looks so different, but the provider assured me it was, and it was very easy to install.  It works better than the original head and is much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> This was my second RQ12 I have ordered, this one cannot be taken aprt for cleaning, the original head and the last one I ordered could be&lt;br /&gt;taken apart for cleaning, this one does not come apart.&lt;br /&gt;I might have to look else where for one that can be taken apart.</li>
    <li> Believe it... believe the 0 star/1 star reviews. So I had a coupon + subscribe and save discounts and still I feel like I was ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly why did Philips change the design of the head. My old sensotouch 3D head lasted 4 years and only now just started pulling a little. (of course I also dropped it and bent some pins). But to be honest, the 4 year old original head shaves BETTER than this hunk of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to have pulled hairs, and no shaving capability... waste your money on this. I am so disgusted with this replacement that I am going to go back to my 4 year old original shave head and find a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did Philips destroy their own product. I guess I am going back to Braun.</li>
    <li> Well, I fell for that!! All the negative reviews put me off ordering this for quite some time, while I researched whether the original was still available,. Kept forgetting to do that research and probably used my old head for a few months too long. So, I eventually decided to order this - and it&#x27;s absolutely fine.  The design is a little different to the original but I prefer it. The shave is perfectly good for me (can&#x27;t tell the difference from when I first purchased my shaver) and I find this new design - where the whole three-head piece pops off - to me much easier to clean that the original (where each head flips back individually).  So, all in all, a shame I waited so long. Very happy with the replacement. Change isn&#x27;t so bad after all...</li>
    <li> Definitely a cheaper, lighter, more plastic version of the head that came with the shaver.  Have shaved with it a couple of times and it shaves just Okay.  Wish I could try it against the original head to know if it&#x27;s worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I fell for it. I assumed it couldn&#x27;t be that bad. Wrong. This thing catches my chin in the blade holder and pulls like heck. Big disappointment. Time to buy something else.</li>
    <li> OK product, not great</li>
    <li> this last replacementhead is not as soft as usual. rough on the face</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Not the same quality as the previous head. Have used it for 6 months it no longer gives a smooth shave. I had to switch back to the original head to get a smooth close shave. If you buy this plan to replace it in 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> This is a bait and switch from Philips Norelco for the SensoTouch 3D razor. You received a great razor head when you purchased the SensoTouch 3D which gives a good shave and was easy to clean. The head opened up to allow full access to clean with hot water. This replacement does nothing of the source and is just a hunk of cheap plastic that is a pain to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A SENSOTOUCH 3D --- I am returning this and I will not be purchasing Philips Norelco razors again as I can&#x27;t trust them when I need to buy a replacement head apparently. If you can&#x27;t trust a company to provide replacement parts that are as good as the original you should not buy from them.</li>
    <li> Just like sveryone else here, I couldnt believe the baldes were crap when I got them. Ive such a great experience with original blades. I decided to give them a try and have been using them for the last month. Eventhough they tugged and pulled hair, didnt shave close and were unconfortable, i decided to give them a chance. Maybe they need to be broken in I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now given up and putting on the year old blades back, which work much better than the brand new crappy replacements. Wait until theres a resolution. Dont waste your money!!</li>
    <li> After all the horrible reviews and poor performance on a previous Norelco shaver, I was concerned about using the RQ-12+ replacement head on my 1260X.  But I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  It no longer has the flip out heads, but shaves a little better and is much better in containing all the stubble, which used to spray out all over the place.  The entire head now snaps off for cleaning, which is not a big deal.  I find that I now rinse it out after every shave.  On first start up it was a little noisy, but after a couple of shaves, it seems to be a little more quiet than the old swing out system.  The kit did come with the orange wrench, should I want to more thoroughly clean the heads, or if I want to replace just the cutters and screen in the future.  I found the construction quality to be similar to the previous design, with no more or less plastic parts.  All in all, I am satisfied with this design.  I would have given it 5 stars except that I think that over $50 is still a steep price for a replacement cutter head,</li>
    <li> Bought these even after reading the other reviews since there isn&#x27;t any other option currently. These are terribly uncomfortable to use and don&#x27;t shave as well as the previous design. It feels like using a cheap knock-off of the original design.</li>
    <li> I bought this a little over 5 months ago as a replacement for Phillips Norelco SensoTouch 3D model 1250X. I am highly disappointed to say the least. I rips at 2 day stubble like an old dull single blade disposable. They have changed the design of the way the blades flex, and FAILED miserably. Not as good as the original and wish I would have just got a new razor.</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned ordering this after reading some fo the reviews but, can I say, &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;? I was about to give up on my Norelco XL. It was taking soooo long to shave. I have an extremely heavy beard and have to shave twice a day even if I use blades and cream. Then, I somehow lost one of the cutters when I was cleaning the heads so I had to order a new head set. My shaving time has been cut to 25% of what it was. Yes, there is some additional pull but, perhaps that&#x27;s because the razor is actually cutting something. Good close shave it one quarter the time. I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it. The design, by the way, is totally different. The individual heads don&#x27;t flip up. The Whole head comes off in one piece. Really a much more sturdy design.</li>
    <li> It works and cuts good.</li>
    <li> It shaves, but it&#x27;s a definite downgrade from the original RQ12. My year-old RQ12 head pulls about as much and gives about the same shave. Not impressed. I&#x27;ll be looking for another electric razor.</li>
    <li> I got this norolco replacment today and it is horible .It dosnt shave it pules hair ..I am going and shave with my old head it is about 2 years old but much better shave then this one</li>
    <li> Works as expected (1+ month of daily use). No major difference with the previous generation IMO. Cleaning is not more difficult (it is actually easier), and I could not detect any sign of cheapness or poor construction.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews because I find this head to be superior in every way.  The blades pivot at more angles than the previous model and cut far better, requiring a lighter touch to your face and neck.  Daily cleaning is easier by simply snapping the blade unit off and rinsing it as a single unit instead of the 3 flip-up components on the original head.  It is not cheaply built as some state as it is constructed of the same materials as the original. It is simply a newer and more efficient design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always considered Braun&#x27;s foil head shaver as able to provide a closer shave. Norelco as a more comfortable shave. This new head on my Norelco now matches my old Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my Norelco SensoTouch 3D.  Then I shaved one side of my face with the new unit and the other with the old.  Could not see a difference in shaving closeness. After 24 hours still no difference.  I returned it to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and they refunded me my money.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that the reviews were just people complaingin over a design change.  Some of it is, but some of it is true.  This new replacement head is not as good at leaving you with a smooth shave.  It isn&#x27;t impossible to get the same shave as the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; RQ12, but you definately have to work harder to achieve it.  If I could find the standard RQ12, I would happily replace my recently purchased RQ12+.  I will say that the RQ12+ is easier to clean...but that is about the only thing that is better than the part it replaced.  Philips, not that you watch reviews, please come out with a new revision that gives us a better shave with the easier cleaning!!</li>
    <li> Well I decided to take a chance after reviewing a lot of the reviews on both sides. This was a replacement for my Sensotouch 3D with the original RQ12 head and I always wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This does give a nice close shave as good as the old RQ12 only if you shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleaning is more cumbersome than the original. Not that great a deal but it simply is, the original you just flipped the blades up and washed under hot water without having to worry about scalding your hands. This one you have to pop the whole head off to wash, your hands will get hit with hot water while rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are the kind of person who may skip a day or two then it doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of the old head and takes twice as long to get a close shave. When daily shaving though no issues and as good as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s definitely more flimsy, lower quality. The parts came apart very easily when I gave it a quick flick with my wrist to get rid of excess water after cleaning and ended up in pieces all over the tubs floor. This of course ended up with me sending it back for a refund because if you get the blades out of their original placement in the head you will get degraded performance per their documentation.</li>
    <li> not so great, fell apart after several months</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews... This replacement head shaves just as great as the original did.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Great shaving system.  Norelco recommends replacement every year.  I find replacing every six months is better with my (heavy) beard.</li>
    <li> In theory, this should be an improvement from the old RQ12.  It pivots on more axis than the old RQ12.  The individual blades can be removed and replaced instead of throwing away the entire head, like the old RQ12.  The individual blades are less expensive than the old RQ12 and the RQ12+.  So once you own the RQ12+, you can spend less and buy the 3 individual cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the big issue with the RQ12+ is the quality of the cutters.  Initial shave with a brand new RQ12+ is awesome, 5 stars.  A closer shave then I ever got from the old RQ12, which worked great for me.  The old RQ12 could cut through my beard of steel exceptionally well for about 6 months before needing replacement.  The cutters stayed sharp enough to give a smooth shave without discomfort and after 6 months it was worth the cost to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new RQ12+ stays sharp for about 3 weeks.  Then it&#x27;s garbage.  The benefit of more flexibility on it&#x27;s axis is far out shadowed with it&#x27;s ability to tear out hair or just skip over hairs without cutting.  Norelco designed a better head in the RQ12+ but lost all quality control with the cutters.  After years of Norelco use, this is my last one.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!</li>
    <li> Terrible replacement.  What is wrong with Phillips Norelco r&amp;ad department.  If this is the best they can do, I will be switching to Braun.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shaving head.</li>
    <li> Almost a month now and so far working just fine since the day I 1st used it. I just found out that when its time to replace I can opt for the SH90  replacement blades. Its a good thing that I made sure that I kept orange tool that will allow me to replace just the blades and not the full enclosure. I will see if I could send another review after at least 6 - 12 months of use.</li>
    <li> Thank you received fast and secure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Norelco shavers and really cannot compare with others since it has been a long time since I used any other. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product. However I have one complaint: after cleaning the razors, putting back the plastic rings is quite difficult. In other words not easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Much better design , thanks</li>
    <li> Purchased this replacement head for use on my older Arcitec 1060X. Wow - they are great. Better than the original set. Close/smooth shave. Cleaning them took some getting use to but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. I&#x27;m moving on to another shaver. I took it down to clean it since it wasn&#x27;t cutting close and cannot put the orange bracket back.</li>
    <li> Does not give a very close save and is hard to remove for cleaning. The previous style in which the entire head was removable for cleaning was much better and, by far, easier to manipulate. If they don&#x27;t fix this problem I will be moving on to another brand of shaver.</li>
    <li> Sharp and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> easy to clean shaves very close, nice!</li>
    <li> I have been using this new RQ12+ Replacement Head for my  Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver for almost 3 weeks now, shaving every other day. First, their claim of a 30% closer shave is an overstatement. I find that it shaves about the same way as the original RQ12. As for noise, it is not as noisy as the RQ12 was when I replaced it. But it is very possible that just as with the original RQ12 the RQ12+ will get noisier as it wears in. However, the noise when it starts cutting into the beard is louder, more noticeable. The big difference from the original RQ12 is when you remove the top to clean it. It feels flimsy and cheap. I am afraid that the water flowing out of the faucet might knock it out of my hand and damage it. The plastic rings that hold the cutters in place looks very thin. Feels like it could break at any time.  Update 03/06/2015 I am adding a star to this Norelco Replacement Head. In the month I used this new replacement head I had no irritation on the neck.</li>
    <li> Orange retainer ring falls out each time head is taken apart to clean.  I see no way to get another ring (s) set of 3 rings is to return the entire head.</li>
    <li> Is Philips trying to rip us off? I&#x27;ve always used norelco shavers but never expected a part (rq12/62) not to be available in the market. This is Philips we are talking about. Isn&#x27;t it supposed to be the leader in this field? Guess not. I&#x27;m going to change shavers over Christmas. Braun, here I come.</li>
    <li> These are a replacement for the RQ12.  I have never heard so many winers on a review.  These work as well or better than the regular RQ12 blades.  They are way easier to clean as well.</li>
    <li> The build quality is subpar in comparison to the razor head it replaces. It feels and looks like cheap plastic. My 16 month old shaver head that came with my Norelco 1290x shaved better than the new one.  I then went online and tried to buy the original head but the price inflated into the hundreds of dollars.  I complained to Norelco but they didn&#x27;t offer any resolution. The representatives said that they were very much aware of how unhappy so many of their customers were with the revised design but their superiors in corporate refuse to offer their customers any relief. Very poor customer service, especially considering how expensive the product is. If you own a Norelco shaver then you might as well purchase the RQ 12 plus. You pretty much don&#x27;t have a choice. After a couple of months of using it, I noticed that it did eventually shave better, I assume due to it&#x27;s self sharpening feature, but still inferior to the original head. What a shame, they really are going to lose a lot of customers because of this.</li>
    <li> i use the 1280 series&lt;br /&gt;excellent cutting!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Decided to ignore the negative reviews and give this product a shot based on the quality I&#x27;m familiar with from Phillips Norelco. I regret that decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is actually a Norelco product, not a knock-off. It comes in the correct packaging, sealed, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took it out and had my first shave with it this morning. I ended up putting the old head back on to finish my shave because it was THAT BAD. It doesn&#x27;t make good contact with your face. The razor pulled hairs out instead of just cutting them, making for a VERY painful shaving experience. It missed hairs consistently. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m a contender for &amp;#34;Best Freddy Krueger Costume in February&amp;#34; given the amount of times I had to go over certain areas try to get the hairs. There are actually spots that I gave up on because I just couldn&#x27;t bear to go over the spot again. The head sounds like they just put rusty gears in the head, as the thing is loud and sounds scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m upset that I&#x27;ve now paid in excess of $300 on a razor I do not feel comfortable using anymore. Thanks, Phillips! Way to protect that bottom line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about spending the money on this head because you already spent the exorbitant amount of money on the shaver itself, please do yourself a favor a do a google search for &amp;#34;sunk cost&amp;#34;. Then, go spend your money on a new shaving system that actually works.</li>
    <li> As everybody else states, this new heads are horrible. They scratch a LOT, they feel like your are pushing a super sharp but beat-up blade against your skin. Worst sensation ever!&lt;br /&gt;My electric razor is now useless and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this, even if you&#x27;re desperate, it&#x27;s still horrible, you should just keep your old RQ12.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why people are complaining about the replacement for the RQ12. I read alot of the complaints but still decided to order the RQ12+ because I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a new system. I just received the order today and decided to shave to test it out. Wow! It gave me a better shave than the original heads. It literally felt like I shaved with a blade. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is that I agree with some people about the build quality. It does feel cheaper than the original head and is louder to me. These are sacrifices I am willing to make to get a better shave! Granted,  this is my first shave with the RQ12+ but I am impressed. I will probably update this review in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers have indicated, it does not provide the closeness of the RQ12.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the previous model: it &amp;#34;tugs&amp;#34; on the whiskers.  I will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> The cleaning for the replacement head is very time consuming &amp; tedious</li>
    <li> The biggest problem for me with this new head is that there is far to much friction on my face. I like to dry shave, but when I run this head over my face, it sticks to the skin and seems to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; the skin along with it. It&#x27;s like you have to use cream to get a smooth shave, which is silly since if I have to do that I might as well use a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Worst blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone seems to be giving this product such a low rating. I too replaced an old style RQ12 with this new one and the shave experience is as good or better than the older style. I use a 1250X shaver so no issues at all with the head so far. I was even able to shave (pun intended) about 5 mins off my morning routine and that&#x27;s a welcome change. I&#x27;ll have to update this after using it for awhile as I see how this new RQ12+ compares to the old RQ12 over time, but from my first experience, it&#x27;s a winner so far. I&#x27;d recommend it to others...</li>
    <li> As I had had such a terrible experience with the Norelco 9300 (see that review) I thought I&#x27;d get some new blades for my old Norelco 1250 as it really isn&#x27;t a bad razor. I couldn&#x27;t find any of the original type on the Amazon site, just the same ones as in the Norelco 9300 and they are not user friendly to remove, clean and replace (now where did I put that little plastic gadget to remove and replace the blades?) and not only didn&#x27;t shave as closely but also irritated my skin. I decided to call Norelco and a gentleman there, while I was on the internet at the official Norelco site, suggested the &amp;#34;RQ12&amp;#34; as they were the old blades, which incidentally Norelco is not making any more. I bought two packs thinking they&#x27;d last me 2 years and then I could look for a new razor. Norelco (well Philips) sent the RQ12+, the new ones that I detest! And they were a lot more expensive than the same blades on Amazon! It took 8 telephone calls over 2 weeks to finally get them to send me a return authorization! Clearly not Amazon friendly and I would strongly recommend not purchasing anything from the Norelco site (and also not purchasing these replacement blades). Incidentally the old blades are available here and there on the &#x27;net, for about $150 a set! Which strongly suggests others don&#x27;t like the new blades either.</li>
    <li> larger than the previous model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st shaves are great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then comes the time to clean the head which is a pain (to remain polite) - you can open it then spend half an hour to mount it again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 or 4 stars ? hmmm...difficult to say as in the previous model you could not opn the head to clean it&lt;br /&gt;let&#x27;s say 3 as after assembling it I have this bad feeling something will explode inside</li>
    <li> While still expensive this head is easy to replace and now I will be able to just replace the cutters.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace my original shaver head, only used it a few time so far, but it seem to work perfectly, giving a good close shave.</li>
    <li> They are like I was expecting, than you</li>
    <li> It was a sufficient replacement head for my arcitec.</li>
    <li> My husband is happy with the replacement head.  It fits his 1060X Arcitec shaver with no problem. He took a chance in ordering this one, hoping it would fit his Arcitec model as the description said.  He said the blades in the  new head move more freely than in his old one, and should make the head easier to clean.  His replacement head before this one was the older version of the RQ12, which he was also very happy with.  He has had the new RQ12 replacement head for only a few days, so I will update if he encounters any problems.</li>
    <li> I really look forward to getting my replacement head as it shaves quicker and smoother.</li>
    <li> Quality is lacking, cheaply made and grinds like a worn out bearing. Cleaning is a mess. Definitely not as good as the originals and very pricey for what you get.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good quality as the original or the previous style of replacement head.  Doesn&#x27;t open with hinges for cleaning, so you must remove the entire cover, and then aren&#x27;t sure if you are replacing it with the same alignment.  After a few weeks, it seems to be shaving fine, but is a little harder to get a smooth, finished shave than the previous style of shaving head.</li>
    <li> Well, it was time to replace my RQ12 and see what the issue is with those new replacement heads... I do agree that they feel cheaper than the old style. For me these are a lot easier to clean than the old style. Easily pull the entire cover up and there you go, easy access. The old way you had to open each individual blades and they would close when trying to dump the dirt out of the shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel they are less comfortable than the old style. Anyhow I think it was a big mistake from Norelco to just stop making the old style and force this change on users that were counting on replacement heads that matches what they have...</li>
    <li> Horrible replacement for the original.  Face hurt after every use.  If you can find something else don&#x27;t buy this.  Problem is there may not be anything else.  Shame on Norelco for making such an inferior product to replace an exceptional product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this replacement head and in Philips Norelco. I&#x27;ve used their razors for over 20 years, and have moved up with every advancement in their technology. After paying a premium price for the sensotouch 3D razor a year ago, I expected to find a like replacement head for the 3D technology that was less than half the cost of the razor. What I found was a recommended replacement head that is at least two generations old. I read the posts, but felt I would try it anyway since my razor is so new. Big mistake. It&#x27;s not a good replacement head. My original head still shaves better than this replacement head. I guess it&#x27;s time to move to Braun; Consumer Reports scores it higher anyway. Good bye Norelco. From the posts, it looks like a lot of us are moving on. Hope the corporate profits are worth the loss in customers.</li>
    <li> After switching from the original shaver head that came with the SensoTouch 3D to this replacement, I find that the device no longer cleanly shaves my face. I end up with huge patches of fuzz even in places that I went over several times. This new head is also cannot be opened up to clean like the old one, so gets gummed up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really lame that Norelco would retroactively downgrade their top-of-the-line product by discontinuing the old shaver head and giving us a new one that doesn&#x27;t work. I now have to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> horrible replacement blades.didn&#x27;t shave close.original with unit was much better,couldn&#x27;t lock the orange blade holder</li>
    <li> right fit and that is hard to do there are so many razors</li>
    <li> Norelco shot themselves in both feet here.  The new RQ12Plus replacement head is, to be blunt, a piece of crap.  I&#x27;m on my third original RQ12 head,  about a year old now, and it clearly outperforms the Plus model.  One shave was enough and it went back.  Rough shave, hard to clean, irritating to skin.  This one sure raises questions about Norelco engineering and marketing.</li>
    <li> This is my first review after years of buying Amazon products but this was one of the worse Product I have every bought. It doesn&#x27;t work and you are better off not shaving at all!</li>
    <li> I purchased these replacement heads reluctantly after reading through the many negative comments concerning the revised design.  But I was also curious to see the changes and evaluate for myself.  Well, the replacement heads are a significant improvement over the original design.  The improvement I appreciate the most is how they have made the heads easier to clean.  The top pops off as one unit and is easy to clean out as compared to the original heads that each opened separately.  I wish I had ordered these earlier because they perform much better than the original heads.    I don&#x27;t understand all the extremely negative reviews referencing plastic.  As far as I can tell the heads are identical to the original heads with the only difference being the improved ease of opening the unit for cleaning.  I think the negative comments must be coming from paid reviewers from other razor manufacturers or who have some other bone to pick with Norelco.</li>
    <li> Thank you. met needs and was delivered quickly. Blades are performing great.</li>
    <li> This is the new replacement head and is not manufactured as well as the original. However it does work just as well as the other one did. Saying that, I was never real excited over the original replacement head either. They work very well for maybe two months and then get dull very quickly. No way you can get a year out of them and I do not even shave every day. This one is a bit harder to clean because you have to remove the heads from the plastic frame. The original, you just popped it open. Not a big deal but slightly different. I does seem a bit noisier but not to extreme. I haven&#x27;t had this one long enough yet to see if it stays sharper for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of electric razors but I use it to avoid razor cuts.  This replacement works fine.  They say you should replace the head every year; I don&#x27;t think that is necessary.  Especially when  they cost as much as they do.  Bottom line it does the job.</li>
    <li> Have used Philips/Norelco electric shavers for decades.  I typically replace heads annually &amp; buy a new shaver when the technology changes significantly.  The replacement RQ12+ heads are a huge improvement over the very good heads that came with the Sensotouch 3D shaver because they are easier to clean &amp; shave even closer. Outstanding product - but expensive.</li>
    <li> Easily the worst shaving head I have ever used. The whole time you use it it feels like its scratching at your face, and after enduring that pain you find that the shave was not very close. The ORIGINAL RQ12 head was AMAZING, this replacement is a pile of spit. I actually switched to using a safety razor because of this. I would come back in a second if they went back to the old design, but it does not look like that&#x27;s going to happen any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s really sad is that they are still selling shavers with the old head on amazon and costco, and in a year from now all those new owners are going to have to put up with this garbage too. This is no way to do business.</li>
    <li> produces quite satisfactory shaved</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews in that the older RQ12 blades seemed to work better, particularly in the neck area.</li>
    <li> This updated head unit snaps in place amd fits my several year old Norelco Arcitec 1050x...seems to shave fine so far.</li>
    <li> An excellent replacement head, much quieter than the original and a closer shave. Also comes with a new plastic cover; very pleased.</li>
    <li> Well, I gave it a try.  All the reviews were negative, but what else could I do since I already owned the 8000 series razor.  No RQ12 available for purchase, so upgrade I did. Not an upgrade at all. It randomly pulls while cutting and doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the RQ12&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  Also, the cleaning instructions are much more involved and difficult than the RQ12; once a month you have to remove each blade and clean it separately.  Only you have to do one blade at a time, because they are fitted to the associated head; mix up the blades and you spend some time with painful shaving - this according to the instructions.  Also, every shave, you have to detach and clean the head, then leave apart the head from the body while they both dry.  The RQ12 flip open drying was so much more convenient. Bottom line, you have to upgrade sooner or later - no other option that I can see.  So Norelco seems to have it figured, market is captured so why not increase profit margins by putting out a lower quality product for the same price.  Disappointing may be time to try a different brand. Someone should start a class action lawsuit - if only I was a lawyer. UPDATE : I switched back to my 1 year old RQ12 and the difference was amazing - even after a year of use, my RQ12 is nite and day in terms of closeness and comfort compared to the new RQ12+.  The RQ12+ reminds me of the old arctic razor I bought a long time ago, same razor burn, random pulling, and stubble remaining after a two pass.  When I updated to the 8000 it was like I&#x27;d found nirvana; I ended up buying it as gifts for relatives, it was so excellent.  I really hope Norelco brings the RQ12 back into production, else I&#x27;m going to keep this old blade as long as I can then start hunting for a new razor company.</li>
    <li> Head is apparently an update and is different from the original model.  However it works very well and actually gives a broader shaving surface.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco 1255x razor and was delighted with it for years, replacing the heads with RQ12 (original) yearly. Now, they have redesigned the wonderful RQ12 and replaced it with the RQ12+ (should have been called RQminus). After a long non-availability of the RQ12 (with the shortage bringing absurd prices), they come out with this cheaper, inferior replacement. Shame on you Phillips Norelco. I was so disgusted that I purchased a Braun 790cc-4. It shaves just as close, if not closer, and has reasonably priced and readily available replacement blades. I had several Norelco razors before the 1255x. Now, my son and I are both DONE with Norelco forever. Corporate greed once again takes advantage of loyal long-time customers.</li>
    <li> These heads work much better than the original, especially on an aging face with various degrees of hair thickness.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about ordering these new Norelco replacement heads because of some bad reviews, but I have fallen in love with them.  To me they shave closer than the older and much more expensive flip up heads.  They are also just as easy to keep clean.  I have had them for several months and all I do is rinse the head out under the hot water faucet after each shave.  I have yet needed to remove the blades themselves to keep them clean.  The short rinse once a day does the trick.  Way to go Norelco!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I needed to look at the reviews for a brand name replacement product but this thing sucks. The new design is loud and tugs at hairs. When I first got my SensoTouch, the two things that most excited me were how quiet it was and how comfortable the shave was...both now ruined. I assume, though I haven&#x27;t looked to confirm, that they made this change so that future replacements would be cheaper but in the process, they obliterated the goodness of the product altogether. I won&#x27;t be buying another one of these again, I&#x27;ll be looking at different shavers when it&#x27;s time to replace...if not sooner.</li>
    <li> I saw a number of bad reviews for this razor head, so I was a bit hesitant to purchase it.  However, my existing razor head had become a bit dull and it was either a new razor or a new replacement head.  The replacement head performed much better than the negative reviews would have led me to believe.  The shave, for an electric razor (which for me has never been quite as close as a blade), was close and cleanup was simple.  The item loses a star due simply to cost.  It doesn&#x27;t take many replacement blades to equal the cost of a new razor, which just seems wrong.</li>
    <li> be careful when installing your new head, it must be in the proper orientation.  Look for the key and you won&#x27;t go wrong.  My new head is excellent and at almost half the cost of others it is also an excellent buy.  Don&#x27;t let negative reviews put you off.  I am just as happy with the replacement as I was with the original.  Remember this, you are buying from Amazon.  If you don&#x27;t like it you can return it.</li>
    <li> People are adverse to change, which is why I believe the reviews for these replacement blades are so low in comparison to those of the new, top-of-the-line Norelco shavers. In my own opinion, these blades do provide a closer shave, perhaps with a bit more pulling, but not with any real discomfort. For those who complain, go try Braun&#x27;s top-of-the-line shaver. Not only will there be stubble all over your countertop, but more than likely, you&#x27;ll draw blood. Norelco shavers are easier on the skin, provide the closest shave possible and are pretty easy to clean. These blades are cleaned differently than the original equipment, but they are still pretty easy to clean and to keep clean.  But why did Norelco change the design of their blades so drastically? The answer is simple - it&#x27;s one of cost. It probably never made much sense to continue making a different set of replacement blades for every model of shaver they&#x27;ve ever made. As these blades have gotten more and more expensive, however, the need to cut costs has become much more evident. Who in their right mind would pay $100 for a set of replacement blades for a shaver that costs $200 to buy new? By standardizing on a single design, Norelco can cut costs dramatically, keeping the price much more reasonable, even though it is still fairly high. By standardizing on their latest design, we all benefit from the latest technology. The Arcitech was a disaster of a shaver that couldn&#x27;t handle more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth. Now, those old shavers will benefit from the newest design.</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 months ago and today one of the rotary blades just fell out and now it is not usable.  I paid $58 for this, so a real waste for only 2 months use.</li>
    <li> This is by  no means like the blade you received with your new Razor.  Check the other reviews, mine went dull within two months.  My other blade which I bought this one to replace.  Is much sharper now and is over 2 years old.  The Shave only last a couple of hours before I need to re-shave.  Why Norelco is selling this as a replacement is insulting to everyone who is tricked into buying it.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but necessary.  If I read the instructions right, the next time I can just replace the rotary blades themselves.  Good thing, because if I have to replace the head again I&#x27;m looking at another razor and THAT one won&#x27;t require changing the entire head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the new blades for 3 weeks and very close shave so far. Not quite as close as a good razor but these usually last right around a year</li>
    <li> I do not like this redesign and will use it until I have to replace and will change razors.</li>
    <li> I used this with my Artic as a replacement and could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe all of the hype in the negative reviews.  I was scared for months about purchasing the newly design RQ12 head for my Arcitec after seeing all of the bad publicity it was getting.  I am glad that I finally bought it, though.  While I don&#x27;t doubt that some people have had a bad experience with it, I have not.  In fact, I am getting a better shave with it than with the old RQ12 design.</li>
    <li> After many years of experimenting with electric razors, the SensoTouch 3D was the best electric razor that I found for my very tough beard. I replaced the blades with the RQ12 Replacement Head every year and enjoyed shaving with it every day. This replacement head is like a junky, gray market, imitation made in China. Norelco has lost a customer -- I&#x27;ve returned to manual wet shaving using Harry&#x27;s online shaving service and their German made blades. I am hanging on to my SensoTouch 3D razor just in case Norelco decides produce the original RQ12 Replacement Head again a make money off of blade replacement sales. Shame on you Norelco by ceasing production of a really great design and trying to force your customers into buying an inferior product! Oh, by the way, I saw Amazon is selling the original RQ12 Replacement Heads for $190!!! LOL LOL LOL LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL  LOL !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Better than the other head I used</li>
    <li> I need to replace the first replacement head I purchased.  The replacement head lasted just under three months.  The shave with the replacement head when new was just mediocre.  After three months, the shave with the replacement head is slow and poor.  The original head provided a clean, smooth, fast shave for much longer.  At the current replacement pace, I would spend $200+ this year just for replacement heads.  I won&#x27;t throw good money after bad and will go back to my old Panasonic.  Or maybe I&#x27;ll purchase the Braun Series 7 shaver which Consumer Reports rated higher than the SensaTouch 3D.  I threw away the shaver (and the replacement head) and replaced it with the Braun Series 7.  The Braun provides a nice shave.  The closeness of the shave can be adjusted.  I&#x27;ll never return to the SensaTouch.  I feel as if Phillips Norelco stole money from me.</li>
    <li> I like it and it works great. Read reviews criticizing it because it has a plastic housing now instead of metal. I put it on easily and it cuts great and feels good. I am a happy shaver.</li>
    <li> It is definitely much better than the worn out original head it replaced. It does the job and I like it! I disagree with those who object to it on aesthetic grounds. It&#x27;s not like the original, but it works! My only compliant is the annoying sound it makes.</li>
    <li> Garbage, never trusting Philips products again, after 6 months get discontinued and have to buy 3ed party razors that are a 10th of the quality.</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades!</li>
    <li> Very efficient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> not getting a good shave with the new heads</li>
    <li> This was such a disappointment, I have bought one of you least expensive which was less than what you charge for the replacement head.  I wish someone had reviewed this product honestly when I was looking for the product.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this over the original heads on his razor!</li>
    <li> It is okay. The replacement is not like the original head.</li>
    <li> Why does Amazon keep one star review rating? I am looking for zero rating for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used RQ12 for almost three years and I feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this RQ12+, I am angry with it. It already broke after I used it for less than 2 months. And it is hard to clean it . Stupid design!</li>
    <li> This replacement head was purchased on March 12, 2014.  It is 3 months old and the blades are dull and longer cut.  The first razor head that came the my razor lasted over 2 years.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> not like the original for my shaver.  don&#x27;t shave as close, burn my scalp.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very thick beard. I read a lot of negative reviews, but it worked very well for me. When you start using a new blade, it takes a while for your hair and skin to get used to it. I remember the first time I used this blade, the shave wasn&#x27;t that clean, but after 3-4 use, it improved a lot and in my opinion it works better than the old blades that came with the shaver.</li>
    <li> Hurts more than the original RQ12+ , it&#x27;s not so smooth but does a pretty good job in terms of a smooth shave .</li>
    <li> It was a different shaver head than I received last year as a replacement, but it is working fine.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I don&#x27;t miss the RQ10 one bit. The design of the RQ12 makes cleanup much faster and easier.</li>
    <li> I love the new design, it is much better then the old one.  Easier to clean and keep clean. After 4 months 2 of 3 orange retainer rings came out of the head.</li>
    <li> I really like the RQ12+.  I have been using it for about a month on a SensoTouch 1255X.  Also, I am now wet-shaving with the SensoTouch 1255X with RQ12+ head and get a much closer shave than I previously did with a dry-shave.  (I have found that liquid hand soap lathers fine and I do not need to buy shaving cream or shaving gel.)  Because of negative reviews from others, I was reluctant to buy the RQ12+ head and I also was miffed at the very high price of new RQ12 heads. However, I found that the RQ12+ works great and the price of $46.99 is reasonable. There was some confusion in other reviews and questions about the RQ12+ versus SH90.  The RQ12+ is a complete head assembly that contains the cutters, combs and holder.  SH90 is the replacement cutters and combs without the holder and can be used only after the original RQ12 head has been replaced with the RQ12+ head.  The SH90  can be used in future replacements instead of buying the complete RQ12+ head assembly.  The RQ12+ also fits and works well on my older ArciTec 1050X.  The RQ12+ head is larger than the original head and must be removed from the razor body if you are using the Power Pod charging unit with the ArciTec.  - June10, 2015.</li>
    <li> I have the Norelco sensor touch 3d and this head is the new replacement for that shaver. The old blades are no longer available. This new blade has bigger blades, you can feel the cut get closer to the skin with very little effort. It was easy to replace, just pull old head off and pop new head on and shave.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t fit but yes it does. Easier to clean too so pretty happy. Very quick delivery also so overall a success. Close shave as expected I should also mention.</li>
    <li> Purchased these to replace the RQ11 on my Norelco shaver. Not much better, plus they are more costly. I find that i am having to make several passes to get a clean cut. Once these wear out, i will just by a completely different brand of razor.</li>
    <li> It was easy to replace the head.  It seemed like it worked OK for the first week but afterwards the cutting ability was significantly reduced.  Unlike some others who have posted positive reviews about this head, I didn&#x27;t like the design. The heads flop around and makes it hard to shave under nose and other such crevices.  I also have to keep going over my face multiple times to get a close shave.  I never had to do this with my original. It is also a more bulky replacement.  I don&#x27;t like at all that Phillips changed what I felt was a winning design.  I liked the ability of opening each head and cleaning it now I have to disassemble the entire flippin&#x27; head to clean it.  That&#x27;s not the original design that I paid for and they changed it for the worse.  Effectively this makes my shaver useless now as I don&#x27;t intend on buying inferior replacements like this for $50+ dollars.  I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking but I kind of feel a little ripped-off.  I returned the head as it is pretty much useless and has increased my shave time by about 50% and without a close shave that I got with the original head.  What a shame.  Phillips,  are you listening?</li>
    <li> I bought it a s a replacement for my razor I have had for two years now (the razor not the blade head).  I replace them every 12 months.  It is a different design and although it seems to be better, I am not convinced it shaves a well (close) as the older unit I replaced.  All in all it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I read all the negative reviews and I don&#x27;t agree at all. This is a quality product. I am 100% satisfied with the shaver head.</li>
    <li> These blades do not provide as close of a shave as the ones they replaced. They also became much duller after just a few months of use. I&#x27;m getting tired of purchasing Norelco razors that fall short of expectations. I&#x27;m now looking for other alternatives.</li>
    <li> After all the negative publicity I was worried this was going to be a bad buy but in the end it was more like a neutral buy...I agree with negative reviewers that the RQ12+ is definitely a lower quality head than the original RQ12, but on the other hand my personal experience of its shave quality is there is very little difference between it and the RQ12, even after having used it for several weeks. Of course anyone else&#x27;s mileage might vary depending on beard type, shaving style etc etc, but I found nothing to complain about as stridently as some other reviewers, other than that maybe it runs slightly less smoothly across the skin, though not so much that I would consider it a problem. And I certainly don&#x27;t see it being inferior enough to make it worth paying scalper prices for one of the few original RQ12s still on the market. On the other hand, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the RQ12+ must be a significantly cheaper to manufacture head than the RQ12 - it has fewer parts to it, and just seems lighter and flimsier. So the redesign was undoubtedly for the benefit of Philips Norelco profit margin and not for the consumer, who still gets charged the same price as before, hence only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Okay product for after market</li>
    <li> I liked the previous style much better.  Cleaning  was way easier. No instructions  came with the replacement  as to what to do different. Confusing for an old fart !</li>
    <li> not as good as the blades that came with the razor.  these come off as one piece.</li>
    <li> The shaver head worked good for 3 months but the blades slowly got dull until the 4th month I put the old shaver head I had replaced after a year of use, back in.  The old head worked great, I only replaced it per recommendations of Norelco.  If this is the quality of the replacement heads, I may have to go back to a razor..yuck!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a yearly replacement of the head that came on my shaver. This is &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; but not the same... The piece from the factory features three individual hinged covers to the blades – this one removes in one piece.  With that disclaimer out of the way – performs 100% identical to the one that came in the box. I still get a nice clean shave and it&#x27;s still easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It arrived to my house when they said it would, 2 month in use it got a high pitch sound in 1 head&lt;br /&gt;and i didnt think it was going to last. So I contacted Norelco and they sent me a complete new head,&lt;br /&gt;I works great so far. This is the !st time I have ever had a problem with a Norelco replacement Head.</li>
    <li> The new design is strange and requires complete disassembly for cleaning. If provided with a choice, would not purchase this version again and go back to the old one where each head was able to be popped off.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the redesign of the razor head.  Sure it now fits multiple razors, but it is harder to clean than the original and doesn&#x27;t cut as well.  I will look for someone that has the old razor heads for sale.</li>
    <li> This purchase was typical of past experience buying replacement heads for top of the line Norelco shavers.  Should you wish to pay a premium price for poor performance, by all means, here lies your opportunity.</li>
    <li> It shaves fine, but not as well as original.</li>
    <li> These blades are easier to clean that the RQ12, but that is where the advantage ends. The blades feel rough and I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 2pm, I never had this much visible growth even by late night with the RQ12. These blades do not cut the hair short enough. I am deeply disappointed with Philips Norelco for making my expensive shaver work worse than a cheap machine.&lt;br /&gt;They need to bring back the RQ12 or lose me as a customer.</li>
    <li> The new heads work great and provide a nice shave.  I was surprised however regarding the cleaning of the heads and how they come apart.  I still prefer the old style hinged method for cleaning vs. the new method of needing to completely remove the shaver heads.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. I almost bought a different razor after reading the reviews about the new heads but decided to give it a shot. Not sure what people are talking about in the negative reviews. It actually seems to work a little better than the old ones.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is terrible.  The blades and head action are rough and tear at your skin.  The original blades were quite different in how they were made and act.  The original were very smooth and easy no matter how many day growth of the beard.  The original replacement head was $69 and this head was $44.  I would have rather paid $69 to get the original head than to save money.  I am quite disappointed.  It&#x27;s the worst Norelco shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had from 1992.  Get the original head the RQ12 not this replacement head.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original - seems to be not as sharp</li>
    <li> After reading all the bad reviews I&#x27;m one that has to make my own decisions. This new design works good for me, I think if you let your beard grow to long it might pull a little, everyday or every other no problem. Cleaning no problems as simple as the old style.</li>
    <li> Sucks. The old head works way better. Don&#x27;t know what to do now with the razor I liked so much</li>
    <li> Noisy and the foil doesn&#x27;t fit properly.  I would have preferred a replacement head similar to the original.</li>
    <li> Feels like a cheap replacement for what used to be a nice shaver, really annoyed to have such product support for something that is a cheap replacement.</li>
    <li> Product keeps falling apart and I am after 30 day return period.  Total pain</li>
    <li> I have been a very satisfied Norelco shaver customer for over thirty years, until replacing the shaver head in my 1280 model with the RQ 12+.  Pure junk.  This head is noisy and tugs at my beard, don&#x27;t even ask about a close shave.  I clean my shaver daily with the Jet Clean system and recently found the shaving blade assembly detached from the shaving head following cleaning.  The original RQ 12 replacement head sells for $188 on Amazon, discounted down from $289.  Not real good economics when considering the cost of a new shaver is ~$230-330.  Looks like I am headed back to a close shave the old fashioned way, shaving cream and razor blades.</li>
    <li> While the price is a little excessive, the product is wonderful.  My husband loves the shave and raves about it.</li>
    <li> This truly is a disappointment. It gives a decent shave so far (1-2 months), but as others have complained the housing around the blades is made of cheap plastic that catches your skin instead of sliding smoothly over it even when wet (The original head housing was made of metal and glided smoothly over my face). It kind of rattles like cheap plastic and the blades squeak if I press them too hard on my face, even when they are wet. That never happened with the original. I am really shocked that this is now the replacement head for an expensive shaver. I only bought it because I haven&#x27;t found a decent replacement shaver at the same price point as the replacement head. I gave it 3 stars only because it still gives a good shave. Otherwise, I would have given it 0 stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as my old blades were about 15 months old.  Received them quickly and tried to shave and they were just terrible.  They were not shaving the hair at all.  I had to use a disposable razor that day.  I ordered a replacement as these must have been defective.  I received them and shaved today with them for the first time.  They are just as bad.  I was better off continuing to use my old blades, but unfortunately I had already thrown them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to use your old blades as long as possible and buy a new razor.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the replacement blades.  I will probably just switch to disposable razors for a while.</li>
    <li> Cuts as well or better than the original heads is easy to clean.  Although not advertised a plastic cover/guard comes with this replacement head.</li>
    <li> This my second replacement. The recommendation to change it about once a year is correct.&lt;br /&gt;The replacements are better than my original.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and perfect product!</li>
    <li> Found them better than the blades that came with the razor when I originally purchased it and they were very good.</li>
    <li> Worked well for about a month.  Then the blades dulled and started pulling hair more often than cutting it.</li>
    <li> Brilliant marketing by Norelco if their goal is to alienate once loyal users from their products. This new head is CHEAPLY constructed, does not go over ones face as smoothly as the original head, and the blades pop out at  whim so you&#x27;re stuck trying to put it back into it&#x27;s housing half the time.  If Phillips goal was to save costs, then they did in the short-term. Long-term they lost a once loyal customer and fa future revenue stream.</li>
    <li> I really like the new heads, even the new design.  It is much easier to clean than previous versions!</li>
    <li> The updated replacement head for my older Norelco blade the RQ12 cuts far better than the prior RQ10.  I had read somewhere that cleaning the RQ12 was more difficult to clean/rinse than the RQ10 but I find it much easier to clean and care for.  I&#x27;m very happy with the updated blade.</li>
    <li> Easy to install &amp; shaves very close. But where do the shaved hairs come out when cleaned under hot water?</li>
    <li> THIS HEAD IS A PIECE OF CRAP I cannot even open the individual blades to clean them. I will never buy from this company again</li>
    <li> The delivery service was good. The product is not the same as I replaced it with. The top is hard to pool for cleaning but once you open it, the cleaning is easier. However having a special key to disassemble blades is not very convenient. I am adding this my comment after one month of use. The product is bad and I am very upset. I paid for the most expensive shaver and getting lower than average performance with this replacement head.</li>
    <li> My husband said the replacement head works just fine.</li>
    <li> This really is a dreadful replacement head.  It&#x27;s cheaply constructed and dull.  The new head construction pinches any loose skin.  I hauled out my old head and it was a big improvement even after using it for a year.</li>
    <li> the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34;  indicates this is an update or redesigned shaving head. I dont know why Norelco did this but it is a step backwards. This new head even sounds different and it just does not shave as good.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco replacement head for approximately 2 months and find the quality of the product to be totally unacceptable.. The unit does not shave nearly as closely as the original head and it is very poorly constructed. The individual cutting heads continue to come loose while shaving/cleaning and the holding devices do not work properly. I have used Norelco electric shavers for many years but no more.</li>
    <li> The heads/cutters in the RQ12+ head that I purchased became so dull after only 4 months of use, they needed to be replaced.  With the old RQ12 heads that came with my RQ1280 razor, I was able to go beyond a year before they needed replacement.  Also the protective cap broke and I was unable to find a way to purchase a replacement without buying a new RQ12+ head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying another RQ12+ head to have a working razor/ protective cap  and to decide on a new brand for the replacement for my RQ1280.</li>
    <li> It is awful.  Never again with Norelco.</li>
    <li> After reading so many negative reviews, I almost cancelled my order.  But if I had done that, I would have had to buy a new shaver.  As it turns out, I am glad that I did not cancel the order since the replacement head is ok for me and does the job.  I have been using electric shavers for over 40 years now, and they have mostly been Norelcos.  I have tried several other brands and models, but I always come back to Norelco because of the rotary action and the quality of the machine.  This replacement head is probably not as good as the original, but it does the job.  The price is more than I would have liked it to be, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This updated replacement head is better than the old head, which was identical to the one that came with the razor. The individual heads float and contour to the curves of the face more efficiently than those on the old head.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how vastly improved these heads are over the previous generation. Remarkably close shave, like with a blade but without the blood!</li>
    <li> Actually I find the performance to be quite good. The only issue I have is that now that the blade and foil assemblies can be completely taken out for cleaning why aren&#x27;t just those two packaged as replacements (just like the older generations of Norelco) rather than having to purchase the whole head.</li>
    <li> Works fine and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not as comfortable or as easy to clean as the original RQ12.  Take care not to throw away the included plastic cutter removal tool, like I did.</li>
    <li> As recommended by Norelco I purchased a new replacement head for my SensoTouch 3D shaver, which I after 60 years of using Norelco (Phillips) shaver rate as my best shaver ever. I have used the RQ12 replacement head for ca. 3 months now, and find it to be a disappointing purchase. In addition to being very uncomfortable to use, it does not have the capabilities to produce a close shave as the original head could. Finding it to be an unacceptable replacement I contacted Norelco by mail to register my disappointment and unsatifaction and inquired as to the possibility of obtaining a head of the original design. Apparently The Norelco Capital. could not be bothered since I never received a reply.&lt;br /&gt;I had fortunately kept my original shaver head, which now is back on the shaver and outdoing the new replacement in several ways.</li>
    <li> Had to brake them in. Rough shave for about a week. No more Morelos for me. The price keeps going up&lt;br /&gt;And the quality keeps going down</li>
    <li> I hate it.  The sad thing is that the head it replaced was absolutely excellent.  I went from wanting to write a 5 star review of this shaver to wanting to throw it away.  I thought I&#x27;d try it for a month to see if I changed my mind, but sadly no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throwing it away is what I currently reccomend if you are looking at this.  New head doesn&#x27;t shave.  One can scrub away at one&#x27;s face, and still be covered in random patches of hair.  And the process takes twice as long to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather have my dull old blades back on, which is what I&#x27;m going to do.  Then the whole thing goes in the garbage if I can&#x27;t find a new version of the really outstanding old head</li>
    <li> This is my second replacement head. This one is designed a little differently but works fantastic</li>
    <li> The head assembly was a little different than the one that came on the razor, but it fit perfectly and gives a very close shave without any nicks or razor burn.  My old head was a little over 18 months old, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference the new replacement head made...wish I had replaced it about 6-8 months sooner.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;newer and improved&amp;#34; replacement head is not nearly as good as the original line of replacement heads for this model shaver! I have used it a couple of times, taken it off and put the old one back on, and the old one (12 months) still gives a better and more comfortable shave. The new model is rougher, doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp, and is simply inferior. Unfortunately the &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; replacement heads are much more expensive and hard to find - probably for very good reason. Time to dump Phillips Norelco!</li>
    <li> Not as smooth a shave as the RQ12.  Feels cheaper.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for my Arcitec since the original heads were being fazed out.  I was a little hesitant because of all the negative reviews.  But I am quite pleased with it.  It only has two instead of three shaving tracks of the arcitec, but I feel like I am getting a closer shave in less time.  The whole head is slightly bigger than the Arcitec so they tell you to remove the head every time you set in in the charging travel case but I found that I could trim back some of the foam inside the case and so it sits fine now for travel.  I also find it easier to wash than the original head that opened from the inside out in three directions.  I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work after waiting almost a year past the replacement time due to its unavailability.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have a Norelco Arcitec razor that uses the RQ-10 replacement head.  Last year, the RQ-10&#x27;s were about $33.00 here on Amazon.  This year, the same head is $83.00 +/_ a dollar or two.  So I went looking for a new razor and ran across a You Tube video of the RQ-12 head being used on an Arcitec razor.  It is a direct replacement as far as fit goes, but is far superior to the RQ-10.  The RQ-12 has larger cutting surfaces and the head articulates in 8 directions, giving the head superior comfort.  The very first shave was very smooth and close.  This head was much less than the RQ-10 (by at least $25) and gives a better shave.  If  you have an older Arcitec Norelco and don&#x27;t want to toss it out or pay $85.00 for a replacement head, try this one!</li>
    <li> This thing is crap. I replaced my head after about 18 months of use and this &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; is nothing like the original. Norelco has changed the design completely. It doesn&#x27;t move independently like the old one. I am extremely disappointed in this head. Furthermore it cuts about as good as my 18 month old head. Pretty sure this will be the last I buy and will replace razor with another brand if norelco continues to make cheap and different design heads as replacements.</li>
    <li> I like the RQ12+ shaving system. It provides a nice close smooth shave. I was looking for a replacement shave head (HQ10) for my Arctic razor and realized that it has been discontinued. The RQ12 is a direct rplacement. However, my razor came with a portable travel charger and the RQ12 has to be removed from the shaver before it goes into the portable charger. The other minor inconvenience is that you have to remove the upper half of the head to rinse it under water. The old HQ10 individual shavers popped up for easy rinsing. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good replacement.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed! First shave attempt was horrible. I put my dull 2+ year old blades back on and they did a better job. Checked to make sure my shaver 1280x used these replacements. Will be contacting Philips to complain.</li>
    <li> Replaced my RQ10 head perfectly!</li>
    <li> The replacement head arrived on time. It fit  my 3D Sensor Norelco Razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> very good, works well</li>
    <li> Not like the original heads.  Disappointed to see Norelco cutting corners on quality to make a buck.  Give me the option to pay a little more for a quality razor head, please.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery works fine</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I was disappointed with this product. When you buy the top of the line razor, you have a reasonable expectation to maintain it with high quality replacement blades/heads. This cheap replacement is less comfortable than the year-old head that came with the razor. Probably headed back to Braun...</li>
    <li> Not like the original and difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe to all disappointed users. I though it can not be THAT bad ...&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is much worse than original RQ12. There is a lot of pulling which is uncomfortable. And this from a brand new head? My 1.5 years old head doesn&#x27;t have that much pulling.&lt;br /&gt;That is not top of the line quality anymore. It will go back for a refund. Philips who? No more</li>
    <li> The RQ12 heads were great.  These new replacements for the RQ12 are anything but deserving of the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34;.  They are cheap feeling, yet more expensive than the old heads that lasted forever and gave a super clean shave without pulling hairs. After one week of using the RQ12, I&#x27;ve moved on and bought a different razor.  Philips / Norelco does not deserve any more of my money for producing this garbage.</li>
    <li> the cost is a little high but they work great no substitute is worth the little extra saved money</li>
    <li> A very cheap replacement blade Manufacturer should be embarrassed selling  that it ruins the razor dosent  have a smooth shave would not buy again</li>
    <li> The retainer clips that hold the blades are plastic one broke within a month now the blade does not cut properly. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> Garbage.  Simply put. I am currently using the original RQ-12 blades that came with my senso-touch (purchased 4 years ago) after this product failed with flying colors.  These blades are completely inferior to the predecessor RQ-12 blades, and will provide a terrible experience.  The only explanations for why there are so many 5-star reviews in a sea of 1-star reviews are 1) the reviewers never used the original blades, 2) the reviewers don&#x27;t have facial hair, or 3) the reviewer are employees of Norelco.  Norelco needs to fix this product.  If they don&#x27;t believe there is any problem to fix, then they are completely ignorant to their customer&#x27;s experience. The RQ-12+ is not a product that they should be proud of associating with the Norelco brand.  Their disappointed customers should be the loudest voice and I count many among the reviews. One thing I can assure is if they re-introduce the original RQ-12 design, many lifelong Norelco fans, such as myself, that reviewed this product poorly will rejoice.</li>
    <li> This is a great value and they also work GREAT!</li>
    <li> The first 3 months the razor cut great but now it takes me two to three times as long to get a close shave.  I clean it daily and deep clean it once a week.  I have resorted back to my razor and shave cream to get a close shave again.</li>
    <li> Is not the same as the one that came with my razor. It fits, but it is not the same mechanism and i do not feel that the shave is as close as the original one.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This head essentially turns your SensoTouch 3D into the 2D, which I believe was about $100 cheaper before all the models were changed. It gives nowhere near the shave quality of the old RQ12 head. Now I will spend the money on a Braun which makes me angry because if Norelco had stuck with the old head this is a fantastic razor. New heads are garbage</li>
    <li> It may say it&#x27;s for my model but it not the same head don&#x27;t buy this model if your blades flip out from the center for cleaning. This model doesn&#x27;t do that and it pulls the hair my husband says. It&#x27;s not worth what we paid.</li>
    <li> The WORST.  Once you clean the head the retainers will not stay in.  The shave is much worse than the previous head it replaces.  Save your money, get something else and ditch your money-pit shaver.</li>
    <li> UPDATE less than 50 uses and is now too dull to use which means my $150 dollar razor is now useless  Was no sharper than the old blades that were replaced</li>
    <li> Terrible replacement for a wonderful original product. Norelco should do something about this...and quickly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad as people are rating, I think it&#x27;s more psychological matter, which is social acceptance</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned after reading the negative reviews regarding the RQ12+ (I have the RQ12). However, there were enough good reviews to take a chance and am glad I did. This fits perfectly and the shave is better than my original. Cleaning is very easy too. It pops right out and I just rinse it under the faucet and pop it back in.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Makes snapping noises at certain positions. Seemed to cut ok for first half dozen shaves, now takes twice as long and pulls. Cleaning was real easy with original version. We know companies have to make money but this is an example of severe quality fade of what was originally a really good product. Cannot recommend.  If Norelco was going to offer the cutter blades only as replacement then can understand why this type of design as would be real easy to put in new blades and coud change out more frequently at a resonable cost,(maybe).  After almost three months gradually the quality of the cut is deteriorating requiring longer and longer shave time..Just for kicks I put on my old original cutter head on to compare. It had been in continuous service daily for 13 months before I replaced it with this cheap RQ12.  It cuts quicker and does not grab. Leaving it on for now.  Norelco: Bring back the original high quality head!! Please!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually purchased the RQ12+ yet, so I cannot intelligently comment on actual shaving performance (e.g., closeness, degree of pulling, etc.), but I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed in the design differences I&#x27;ve so far noted from the original, and I am TOTALLY disgusted by the price gauging I&#x27;ve been witnessing for the original RQ12.  In short, the RQ12+ is not the shaving head of my birth. The unique features available in the original RQ12 (now absent in this &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; model) are part of the basis by which I chose the SensoTouch 3D in the first place almost a year ago. Now I&#x27;m coming up on the time to replace the head, and, based on what I&#x27;ve been reading, am fairly concerned that the overall shaving experience is not going to be at all the same as I&#x27;ve come to expect, effectively rendering my SensoTouch 3D into an entirely different shaver that I neither purchased nor wanted.  For one thing, RQ12+ doesn&#x27;t appear to pivot around the face as did the original. And, personally, I couldn&#x27;t care less about the ability to take this new head completely apart down to the fittings. One of the nice things about the original RQ12 was the ability to simply flip up the covers and rinse, virtually eliminating the need to take anything else apart. Given the price point for which the RQ12 *originally* sold compared to the price for which this newer version is selling (i.e., they were about the same price), I&#x27;d sooner replace the entire head than to fiddle around with some plastic orange tool.  But of course this entire discussion would be academic if we could simply retain the choice to purchase original RQ12 for the same price instead of the (ridiculous) $199.00 for which it is currently being advertised as of this writing. In the end, I have this nagging suspicion that the RQ12+ is something that was more designed to cost less for Phillips to produce rather than to improve over the shaving experience of the original design.  In any event, I think I might start shopping for a new electric (not a Phillips). If the shaving experience is as different as what&#x27;s being described by others, I might as well.</li>
    <li> I really liked the cleaning method on the RQ-10, but I&#x27;m getting a great shave with this new head. The monthly cleaning sounds like a pain, but I&#x27;m not there yet.</li>
    <li> barely adequate; doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as good as original</li>
    <li> The new style are NOT as comfortable as the ones i have had previously.  This is my 3td set of replacement Heads.  The RQ12+ are stiffer.  They don&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;Float&amp;#34; as much as the others did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAW</li>
    <li> Excellent upgrade from the RQ10 which I have had since I have owned my shaver. Great price too -</li>
    <li> My orginal head was straight this is at a slight angle so I have to hold it a different way to shave</li>
    <li> Cuts great. Too many reviews bash the looks of the product but I purchase for what it does and not how it looks.</li>
    <li> I was extremely dissapointed with this item.  I wanted my usual RQ12 replacement head.  Whe I searched the internet I found I could by one for $7.00 which met my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why has Phillips changed the format without advising the benefits or disadvantages to it&#x27;s users.  I am very dissapointed indeed andfeel like sending the RQ12+ back for a refund.  Bad news Phillips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found I could purchase a brand new shaver  (#1280cc) for the same price as the RQ+ heads.</li>
    <li> I actually get a closer shave (for my beard) with the RQ12+ vs. the older (and arguably better) RQ12.  However, I much prefer the older RQ12 design.</li>
    <li> Noisy with respect to the old version. The rubber gasket underlying come off from its place and could not put it in place again. The old version was a lot better.</li>
    <li> If I could give negative stars, I would! Norelco replaced a high quality RQ12 head with a poorly designed, cheap head. Not only did they ruin what was a superior razor, but completely thrashed it. This RQ12+ is a cheap replacement, is difficult to clean properly and doesn&#x27;t have the same mobility as and contouring as the RQ12. The blades pull moderately long hairs and take twice as long to do the job. The original RQ12 head was no speed demon in the shaving circuit but it did a way better job without the nuisance pulling and poor performance. After spending $200 plus for the system, I find it incredibly insulting and frustrating to have such a low quality replacement head forced upon its high end customers. The new head is a joke.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work as good as the original that came with it...at all...very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am not to picky when it comes to shaves.  However, this is a horrible cheap replacement that gives a lousy shave.  I have returned it and bought a new Braun shaver. I bought 3 replacement heads for the new shaver for $28 that are good for 18 months each. So lesson learned about the replacement head scam. Norelco has lost  a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Not at all like original.  Made cheaply, gives poor shave, does not open for cleaning.  Otherwise looks good in stand.</li>
    <li> Heads do not flip up like original harder to clean also edges are sharper so it pulls sometimes.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to all the negative reviews. Came out of the box no where near as sharp as the original, year old, head. Drags and grabs and can be rather painful to use. I use the razor for face and head and was very happy with the razor when purchased - now with the replacement head, not so much.</li>
    <li> This new head works well now but is a pain to clean. The original head was easier to clean because it just flipped open this head requires you to disassemble it .with a small tool</li>
    <li> It is working very well. I highly recommend it......Jim Henderson</li>
    <li> This is bigger than the RQ-10 it replaced.  It fits in the pod only without the protective cover, and it is a tight fit.  Instead of opening the way the older version did, the piece that holds the blades comes off, sometimes when you don&#x27;t want it to, like when it&#x27;s being rinsed.  It does clean easily.  The shave is about the same as the older one.  Overall, I like the RQ-10 better, but it&#x27;s not worth the premium price since it was discontinued.  Since I reviewed this, my experience has changed.  The plastic parts are flimsy and came apart one morning while I was shaving.  It took me about ten minutes to it back together.  Today, it was making noise while I was shaving, but it was working.  When I removed the blades to clean them, the orange cover for one of the blades came out.  Apparently it was loose and that is what was causing the noise.  I would not recommend buying this if you can find the RQ-10 at a reasonable price.  I think I will look for a third party replacement next time.</li>
    <li> This new head the company released is terrible. It is not nearly as smooth and tends to pull more often. The original head provided the best shaving experience! Why did you do this!? I am buying a new razor now because of the RQ12+. Do not buy this head if you can afford to get a different razor all together.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not as good as the original head that came with it when it was new. It&#x27;s now plastic instead of metal.&lt;br /&gt;Also if you should drop it and it all comes apart, putting it back together is no walk in the park.</li>
    <li> Perfectly happy with this replacement head. I was expecting garbage after reading the reviews, but in my experience this gives a better shave than the original head that came with the Sensotouch 3D. The price was reasonable, it cuts great, cleaning is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely would recommend anyone give this shaver head a try.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to a friend. Better than the original shaver head. Closer shave right out of the box.</li>
    <li> A lot better that the old RQ10 Head. Feels like I have a new razor.</li>
    <li> Better than the original, easier cleaning and just as sharp.</li>
    <li> I used this in my Arcitec shaver (1060X), which states to only use RQ10 heads, but this is completely compatible and was a nice upgrade for me.  This head requires less time to achieve and even close shave, glad I went with it.</li>
    <li> Much better design than the original. Easy to clean. Shave is great. Much better price than the original</li>
    <li> not like the original.  Feels cheap and rough</li>
    <li> The heads on the SensoTouch (RQ12) simply do not shave as close as the HQ9 heads I used on my SmartTouch.  They (RQ12) are also ridiculously expensive because the design requires annual replacement of the whole head unit.  I would still be using my SmartTouch but after years of use the metal blade head holders on my razor came apart and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a replacement available from Philips Norelco.  A bad faith business plan I&#x27;m sure, to force SmartTouch users to buy the newer, less satisfactory product.  Norelco better get their act together.  The quality of their shave heads and the exorbitant cost, will cause them to lose many formerly satisfied customers.  I&#x27;m currently thinking of returning to a blade.</li>
    <li> I am using this on an arcitec razor.  I was never pleased with this razor using the RQ10 head, but this head makes it a superb razor.  The shaving efficiency (quality of shave vs shaving time) is markedly improved.  In fact I shave in less than half the time it took with the RQ10.  Obviously facial hair has a wide spectrum in terms of degrees of stiffness and so you might expect a wide spectrum in terms of satisfaction with this.  My facial hair is relatively soft. Overall this is a marked improvement and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These are easier to clean but that about it.</li>
    <li> It seems to pull more on my facial hair than the original head.</li>
    <li> so so  . Not as close a shave as with originals</li>
    <li> much better than the original</li>
    <li> Philips did a disservice to all of its customers who bought a high end razor expecting to get high end results.  This cheap piece of junk makes me want to throw away my sensotouch.  It is difficult to clean and pulls rather than clean cuts.  I will never buy another philips product again.  The RQ12 was a great razor head and they went cheap with the RQ12+.</li>
    <li> Different? Yes.  Shaves just as close and as good? Yes.  As I often read these reviews to purchase products from Amazon I thought I would write this one for those on the fence about the new RQ12+ replacement shaving head.  After reading the reviews on Amazon I almost purchased a new Braun shaver for $200 instead of replacing my Norelco 1250X head with the new RQ12+ shaving head for $47.  The RQ12+ has gotten a lot of negative reviews.  After receiving mine and using it, it shaves just as good if not better than the older RQ12.  It may look cheaper or feel more plasticky but don&#x27;t let that fool you.  It really gives a good shave and after using it a few days I actually feel it is easier to clean.  The whole top of the unit that holds the 3 blades pops off with little effort and you can actually rinse it more efficiently than you could the RQ12.  So, if your on the fence about ordering one, order the one directly from Amazon for about $47 and give it a try....what do you have to lose?  Anyone paying $180 or so for the old head isn&#x27;t gaining a thing.  Give it a try and see what you think.</li>
    <li> This RQ12+ head is not the same as the original head of the Norelco Senso-Touch 3D razor. It has been highly downgraded! Rather than the 3 tracks it had before, it now has 2 tracks, one for shaving short hairs and one for the long hairs. The original head has 3 tracks, two for shaving the short hairs and one for shaving off the long hairs. The price for the head has doubled over the last seven years or so.  I have always purchased Philips Norelco&#x27;s best shaver, but the priced on it keeps going up and up at a too rapid rate! So, I&#x27;m sad to say that I am done with the Philips Norelco company and their razors. I don&#x27;t know why they have downgraded their products, but after many years of using Norelco razors, I&#x27;m leaving them for a better alternative!  I used a Braun electric razor 42 years ago. I&#x27;m going back to them. I just purchased Braun&#x27;s most advanced model for much less than the most advanced Philips Norelco razor, and on the first shave, it does an excellent job in a much shorter period of time than the Norelco Sensotouch 3D.  Goodbye Norelco, and hello Braun!  I am another ex-Norelco user due to the quality downgrade and greed of Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> I am quite disappointed with this replacement head in terms of both performance and practicality.  In terms of performance it gives a reasonable wet shave but I found using it as a dry shaver was extremely poor. The razor did a poor job of removing hair and additionally tended to pull at the skin/stubble causing an unpleasant sensation.  Secondly it is a pain to clean as the head has to be dismantled rather than flipped open as was the case previously.  Philips need to do an urgent review of this product  as the last two heads previous to this were far superior, failure to substantially improve this head will lead to an exodus to other shaver makes. Note also Philips that there are other suppliers providing &amp;#34;copy&amp;#34; heads on this website at a far more cost effective price.</li>
    <li> I have to give these shaving heads a big NO GOOD rating.  I have been using Norelco for 20+ years, this replacement head is the worst they have produced.  I don&#x27;t look forward to shaving with this razor,  it tears up the skin and takes much longer to shave, my face burns after shaving and when I clean the heads it&#x27;s mostly skin.  Norelco needs to go back to the drawing board for this razor head design or I am going to find another razor like Panasonic or Braun.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: This new version lasted 7 months but I don&#x27;t use any cream or oil. I just received a replacement and will use menin so hopefully my next update will be 12 months.   ORIGINAL: I didn&#x27;t read the bad reviews until I had replaced the old-style head, and I was very happy with the first shave. In fact, after two days&#x27; growth I thought I could actually see the path the heads had made. My neck - my own personal hardest part - is cleaner than ever in faster time. AND, I didn&#x27;t use anything - no pre-shave, cream or water. I shaved dry because I was in a hurry. Given a choice, I&#x27;d use these. Oh, and didn&#x27;t I pay $78 for the previous replacement? These are less expensive too.  So my experience was that everything that the bad reviews are saying are incorrect. I&#x27;m guessing it was some sort of group-hysteria that led folks to post and re-post the same complaints, which simply were incorrect in my case. I have an &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; face and &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; beard, so buy this replacement with confidence.</li>
    <li> This Replacement Head is unacceptable. The quality and performance is extremely poor. I have found that Norelco shavers and parts have gotten progressively inferior over the last several years. I will buying a new shaver and it won&#x27;t be a Norelco.</li>
    <li> Like having a new razor.  It is an improved model from the original head that came with my razor.  Cleans easily under running water.</li>
    <li> easy to replace, instructions not very clear</li>
    <li> My family had used Norelco for generations vertically and across the same generation horizontally. After we saw that the RQ 12+ DID NOT EVEN HAVE 3 TRACKS, THE OUTER TRACK WHICH OF THE SEVERAL SLOTS ON THE OUTER RING, THE 2ND LEVEL inward are THE LARGER GAPS WITH TEETH AND THE 3RD LEVEL WERE LITTLE HOLES IN THE MIDDLE RING FOR STUBBLE as the box displayed....   We saw that the RQ 12+ (12/62) did not have the 3 tracks WHICH THE SENSOTOUCH 3D HAD,  that which the box seemed to allude to the shaver being MARKETED BASED UPON. THIS 3-D ASPECT IS WHY WE SWITCHED TO THE 3-D SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT IS WHY I PAID THE EXTRA $100 for the 3-D instead of the 2-D! Now I have been forced to switch to a 2-D model (2 dimensions of cutting) and had paid the extra $100 along with the thousands of other individuals who bought these shavers which seem to be a bait and switch !! Norelco had made, in the 3-D system, the best shaver I had ever used and it was because of the shaving head and the design by which they had manufactured this excellent tool for a man who cares about being well-groomed. This worked for me as someone who cares to present himself as best he can to the world around him, not for notoriety, but because it makes others feel comfortable, who know that a man who cares about himself without pretension, will likely care about others.  I am amending my post in light of what Roy below, taught me regarding the ACTUAL meaning of 3D vs 2D. I thought it meant the # of different style cutting perforations in the surface of the head, but it alludes to the x,y,z axes which the shaver moves along.  Thanks Roy. I give the RQ12+ an extra star because the dimensions of movement are WHOLE SHAVING HEAD, WHOLE SILVER RINGS ENCIRCLING INDIV HEADS PUSH IN FLAT AND 3rd, THE INDIVIDUAL HEADS WITHIN THE RINGS TILT WITH YOUR FACE AS WELL.   Norelco made in the 3-D system, a great tool with which to do this comfortably without a red face from sensitive skin because of the way the original RQ 12 (12/52) glided so easily and conformed with ease, as it bent in multiple directions, to meet the contour of the face like no other electric razor ever had. I have seen the reviews of other people regarding this cheaper model, 2-D shaving head which is so much less effective and satisfying than the original 3-D system which we all paid for to use with the extra $100 plus!! Instead of ripping us off any further, Norelco needs to begin manufacturing the 3-D head again, the RQ 12 (12/52) so that we get the shave that we paid for originally. My family bought these razors and this is the last generation, unless Norelco makes a very smart decision to give us what we actually paid for.</li>
    <li> This is a sorry replacement for such a great racer head. I don&#x27;t know what Philips was thinking abut this head sucks. It constantly snags on my facial hair and is harder to wash. I don&#x27;t understand why they would replace such a great head with this piece of crap. I gave it two stars because it still does what it technically is suppose to but it does it while causing me pain. If you have any other options or ways of getting the older head without costing you a fortune, you should get it.</li>
    <li> it works and it is cheaper than the original replqcement</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco ruined a good razor with this replacement. Does a horrible job of shaving, wish I had never replaced the original shave head. they need to go back to the drawing board and create a better shave head.</li>
    <li> A little different than I expected - but better in the long run.  The heads are completely different than the ones I had previously.  BUT they are much better for the shaving/comfort experience</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original Head that came with the over $200 shaver I bought 10 months ago.  It&#x27;s nowhere as convenient as the original Head to open and clean.  It is LOUD and it pulls hair as well as gets very hot.  Makes the nice shaver I paid so much for seem very cheap now.  BAD JOB for NORELCO ripping the customers off.</li>
    <li> I am not going into any of the specifics or technical dissertation of the design differences between the original RQ12 and the new RQ12+. I will say that when all is said and done, the RQ 12+ IS NOT as good as the original RQ12.  Why change the design?  I have no idea - if it ain&#x27;t broke: don&#x27;t fix it.  The RQ12 was amazing!  It was a product that I used and coveted for 3 years.  Cleaning it was never an issue and it gave a shave closer than a blade with no irritation.  The replacement RQ12+ is a disaster.  The shave is awful, leaves stray hairs behind and irritates the skin.  I contacted Philips USA customer service who had a laundry list of excuses why the design was changed - none of which make sense to me as a consumer when there were no issues with the RQ12 design to start.  I will have to switch to another brand of shaver now.</li>
    <li> I was really dismayed reading the reviews for this prior to purchasing it.  I needed to get a replacement head for my old razor but the original heads were discontinued and this was the only compatible unit - but the reviews were so bad that I almost ended up just buying a whole new razor.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve found this to be at least as good, if not better, that my previous head.  The only downside is that each of the three razors don&#x27;t flip up for easy cleaning. At first this confounded me but then i realized the top of this unit just pops off for cleaning.  I pop it off, rinse it under the water and put it back on.  Super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#x27;t for all the negative reviews (which I don&#x27;t understand and don&#x27;t comport with my experience using it everyday), I probably would have only given it a 4 star rating (I don&#x27;t know what 5 star razor head would be) but I&#x27;ve found the unit to be so much better than my expectations (and the reviews) that I decided it deserved the extra start.</li>
    <li> Meet all my expectations, especially delivery time.</li>
    <li> This is a negative rating!  Ouch!  It hurts and removes skin!  I have shaved with a Norelco for 30 years and this was the worse shave ever!  Not even close to the original head.  Sayonara Norelco! Shame on you!  I am now looking at other electric shavers from companies that are not as greedy and interested in customer service!</li>
    <li> Poor imitation of the original blades which were great.</li>
    <li> It feels that it is not sharp and it pulls,  when I don&#x27;t shave every day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old shaver was until I put on the new one It not only cuts closer but with less effort</li>
    <li> Awful! Since I got this replacement, it pulls, doesn&#x27;t shave closely, it is nothing like the original.  My face is all torn up, ingrown hairs all sorts of problems once I put this replacement on.  DO NOT BUY.  DO NOT.  DO NOT.</li>
    <li> Although these blades do not flip open as the original blades did I find them to cover a wider area than the previous blades and that the cut is actually closer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is any better or worse than the old style head. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I got this as the replacement for the RQ12 shaver head for my SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is slightly different.  Rather than the top flipping and hinging upward to clean, the whole top half of the head lifts off.  It comes with a plastic tool so you can take apart the blades/combs, unlike the original unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems you would be able to clean the blades much better than the original RQ12, although it maybe isn&#x27;t quite as convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave with this new head is very nice.  It definitely feels smoother and gives less irritation, although the fact that I&#x27;m not using a brand new shaver head over the old original certainly makes an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have 1 minor, but irritating complaint.  The head seems to hold water inside of it, but it doesn&#x27;t drip out until the individual shaver heads have tilted some.  So basically while shaving, if I rinse it out, it holds the water in, then I start shaving and the water just drips out all over the counter, over myself, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried moving the individual heads around with my fingers some before I start shaving - it will get some of the water out, but still leaves a lot behind.  It is kind of annoying but I think I can live with it.</li>
    <li> I expected a shaving head like the original and find the replacement head to my liking. A plus is being able to change the blades on the head to lessen any future costs. Thank you for asking. Aloha...</li>
    <li> This replacement head hardly lasted 2 months. I called Norelco&#x27;s service line about warranty, and they told me shaver heads are not covered. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard either, but normally a shaver head lasts well over a year for me. Disappointed and hoping I just got one bad one.</li>
    <li> I have had the new RQ12+ for several months now and have waited to make sure that this product is given a fair review. This is a great replacement to the original RQ12 razor head, which has been discontinued. All of the complaints about poor quality, tugging on your beard, loud noises, the razor losing its sharpness after a few weeks, etc. etc., is simply not true. In a nut shell, here are the &amp;#34;Joe Friday&amp;#34; facts:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1. Very sharp blades. 2. Excellent pivoting action of each razor head, despite the fact that the three heads are seated as one unit on the pod. Each blade assembly pivots quite well and independent of each other. 3. The blades are very sharp and remain sharp even after three months of use with a heavy beard. 4. Cleaning is easy and more thorough then the previous RQ12 head. The entire 3-blade assembly unit pops off to be cleaned under hot running water, then simply snapped back on. 5. The blades are very sharp, resulting in no pulling or tugging. If there is pulling or tugging of your beard, you are using too much pressure. A light touch is all that is necessary. 6. The sharp blades and excellent pivoting action result in a comfortable shave and smooth skin. Hint: Use Williams Lectric shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1. A little more noisy than the RQ12. Why? Because its cutting more hair. 2. A little cheaper looking plastic. 3. No more hinges on the blade assembly for cleaning. You must now remove the entire head assembly, but this means the cleaning is now more thorough. The cosmetic issues are relevant to a great shave.</li>
    <li> It falls apart when removed from power unit, Spend the extra cash and get the one intended for your device..</li>
    <li> Good shave, a bit harder to clean.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase these replacement heads due to the amount of negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. I am Greek/Italian with thick rough stubble, and these new RQ12+ blades plow right through it with a smooth face as an end result. I&#x27;m getting a way better shave than I was getting with my one year old worn out blades. The blades are cutting nice and close with no discomfort. The only reason I did not rate these as a five star is because they are in fact a little too noisy.</li>
    <li> Bought SensoTouch 1250 3D Razor over a year ago and needed to replace the blade.  Ordered the RQ12+ and what a disappointment. The shave is not smooth, razor pulls and in general does not work. Takes 15 minutes to shave and then stubble is left.  Also very loud compared to the one that came with the razor and is not as easy to clean. This product is very poor quality. Should have kept the head that came with the razor.  Even worn out it worked better then the RQ12+ replacement. Now no choice but to throw my $170 1250 shaver in the trash any buy something else. Apparently the male executives at Philips Norelco all have beards.  They certainly would not use RQ12+. Or maybe, they all use Braun....</li>
    <li> Norelco changed the head design, and I do not think the new design cuts nearly as well nor as fast as the older design.</li>
    <li> a Very Sub-standard replacement head from Phlips Norelco flag ship. i have been using Norelco for last 7 years and 8000 series with original head so far is the best i thought. like other reviewers don&#x27;t understand why Philips is forcing us to buy their 9000 series and stopped manufacturing the 8000 replacement heads. this is the worst head i have seen from Norelco. very annoying.</li>
    <li> Save your money! It dulled quickly and was always noisier! That means more friction! I replaced the Norelco with a Remington. I like it much better! Not recommended for the shower though. I never used it in the shower anyhow. JZ</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this head after reading so many bad reviews, I was even considering buying a new shaver. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. This head works great, yes it doesn&#x27;t have the same premium fell as the original head but it does the job very well, maybe even a bit better than the original ones. I also don&#x27;t find them hard to clean up. I understand it is all a matter of option, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement head because my 1280X (8000 series) was indicating it was time for replacing the shaving head, and it did feel like the blades weren&#x27;t cutting quite as well as they used to.  That when I found out that the RQ12 replacement head for my shaver was (basically) unavailable, and I would have to order the new RQ12+ head.  I was a little skeptical because of all the bad reviews, but I figured I need to try it myself.  My facial hair is probably medium thickness, and a little on the coarse side.  It&#x27;s definitely not the coarsest or thickest hair.  It also doesn&#x27;t grow in all that fast (~2 days for an appreciable amount of stubble, 4-5 days to start looking scruffy - I usually shave at 2-3 days).  I am strongly considering switching back to my &amp;#34;worn out&amp;#34; RQ12 shaving head.  I find this shaving head to be rather uncomfortable by comparison, and I&#x27;m not sure the shaving results are worth it. Cheeks: This is where the RQ12+ is doing best.  It&#x27;s still more uncomfortable than the RQ12 - after shaving an area several times and feeling it to make sure there is no hair left, if I run the shaver over the same patch, it&#x27;s still a little uncomfortable, as though I can still feel the guides scraping my skin to find something to shave.  However, it is also getting a little closer shave than the RQ12. Neck and jawline:  The RQ12+ is giving me abysmal results here.  I have to go over the same patches 8-10 times to get most of the hair, and the entire time I feel poking and tugging from the shaver.  The RQ12 also had issues in this area (required repeated passes to get the hair), but was significantly more comfortable. Upper lip: With the RQ12, I could make two passes across my upper lip to get most of the hairs, and then use the pop-out trimmer to handle the hairs left near my nose.  With the RQ12+, I just can&#x27;t seem to get anything resembling an effective shave except just above the corners of my mouth.  Overall, I am pretty unhappy with this replacementhead.  The shave quality is mediocre except in easier areas, and it&#x27;s uncomfortable in every area.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it was designed for their new 9000 series and just doesn&#x27;t work well with the 8000&#x27;s (in which case either continue producing the replacement head for the 8000&#x27;s in sufficient quantity, or flat out tell us that the RQ12+ isn&#x27;t supported for use with the 8000 series, rather than telling us this is the new replacement head for our shaver), but if I received a new 8000 series that was using the RQ12+ head, I would return it and look for a different shaver, because it is so uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Much better set of heads, the original chewed up my neck :)</li>
    <li> Boy did Norelco make a blunder. This new head is very painful to use all is dose is pull the wiskers out very uncomfortable. If I still had the pacaging I would send them back !!!!!!!! I had to put my 3 year old head back on. Don&#x27;t they test these before sending them out to customers ????&lt;br /&gt;CF</li>
    <li> This is lower quality as many of the other reviews indicated.</li>
    <li> I came on time and it works.</li>
    <li> Slightly better shave than previous head, but can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s the new design or the gradual dullness of the old one. Nice design improvement for convenient cleaning. Still dislike charger-- takes up too much room. Question: will it work on 240 volts or blow up the battery?</li>
    <li> The new head is not like the original one can&#x27;t open up to clean ,any suggestions</li>
    <li> Works as well as the older replacement head.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement shaver head. Newer design provides better shave and is easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Heads were a little larger than the ones on my razor. They also did not open up as the one on my razor did.</li>
    <li> Not the quality of the original</li>
    <li> My husband thought I ordered the wrong replacement head for his shaver,  He told me to go back on line and order him the right one.  thanks to the comments I understand that the original head was redesigned. He didn&#x27;t know  you could still rinse the new ones because they no longer open.&lt;br /&gt;I have to do more research to see if I want to order new heads or a new shaver.  thanks for the comments.</li>
    <li> fast service and it was just what l wanted</li>
    <li> Not the same replacement head as RQ12.</li>
    <li> Norelco&#x27;s new replacement heads are wonderful for a nice, close shave. After a year of owning my Norelco, it was time to replace the heads. However, they no longer are hinged to open for cleaning as the previous heads were, and one must complete a difficult series of steps to remove the 3 shaving heads in order to get all debris out. While I still love my razor, it seems as though Norelco decided cost savings was more important than ease of use for the consumer. If I could still find the hinged ones, I would buy them.</li>
    <li> This head has a cheap feeling, provides a worse shave, and is harder on my sensitive skin compared to the RQ12 heads I have used with my SensoTouch 3D. I&#x27;m really disappointed that the RQ12 is no longer offered and we are stuck with this inferior product.</li>
    <li> I got this replacement head because the RO12 is no longer available. You are supposed to clean it daily by holding the heads under warm running water without opening anything.  It is impossible to tell if they actually got clean.  When I removed the cover, which they say to do monthly but I did after 2 weeks I found that they were not clean but loaded with cutting dust.&lt;br /&gt;The RO12 heads were hinged and opened for cleaning.  I searched the internet but couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The RQ12 doesn&#x27;t shave any better than the RO12.</li>
    <li> This head is not as nice as the original, but also not nearly as expensive. It pops off easily for cleaning and can be washed out from both sides to keep the cutters clear, then easily snaps back into place. The razor with head can then be placed in the automatic cleaner/charger ready for the next shave. The heads are staying clean and not gummed up like earlier Norelco models. I get as close a shave as I was getting with my previous Panasonic and Braun electric razors without having to frequently replace expensive foils. I&#x27;m finally satisfied with this arrangement. In my book, Philips-Norelco has won the battle of the electric razors.</li>
    <li> Very expensive.for a replacement blades</li>
    <li> did not preform like the original, very disappointed</li>
    <li> This replacement head works, it just feels like it is taking my face off. It is not as comfortable as the head it replaced, but it probably gives a closer shave. I have oily skin and I find this head will not move easily over the skin.</li>
    <li> works better than the originals.. Easier to clean also</li>
    <li> I apologize to all the reviewers I ignored when purchasing this replacement blade. I figured maybe they &amp;#34;just got a bad one,&amp;#34; or were &amp;#34;very picky&amp;#34; about their shave. All the 1 star reviews are absolutely correct. I LOVED the shave the original head produced, and after initially being shocked at how terrible replacement head performed and sounded I thought I would give it 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original shaver was like driving a BMW 3 series and the replacement is like a Honda Civic. It&#x27;s an absolutely shocking drop off in quality. Yes, a civic will get you where you want to go, but you feel every bump in the road and the road noise is terrible after you&#x27;ve been in the beemer the last year. Most importantly I BOUGHT A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT, and am now being FORCED TO USE AN INFERIOR PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You lost a good customer Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> Great new design. It is much easier to clean than the original that came with the razor</li>
    <li> Performs well , but is difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> Perfect, easy replacement for a great old razor.  Makes it seems like new... Dad&#x27;s very happy so that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  When the shaving head goes out or the light on the razor goes on throw the razor away! I am loath to even give this 1 star.  After nearly 2 years I needed a replacement head and bought it.  It was defective so I exchanged it for a new one.  My face looks like it has been run over by a gravel truck. Called customer service and they would send me a third head, open a ticket, and when i also complained that the razor now sounds like the drill in a dentists office I received 3 different answers from 3 different people. None of which were satisfactory.</li>
    <li> shave great firts 4 times after that back to the regular have to pass over a bunch of times</li>
    <li> Approximately 1.5 years ago i bought the Philips Norelco top of the line razor 1280x/47. The blades that came with it were amazing, the RQ12 model. Vastly superior than the current RQ12+ they are offering at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what i have heard, the supplies of the old RQ 12 began to dwindle at the beginning of this year. Incidentally that coincided with the launch of their new 9000 series which is going to replace the 1200 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow this sounds all too fishy. In order to wean off their high end customers from the older high end 1200 model and trying to con them into buying their new 9000 model, they have introduced these sub par RQ 12+ blades and marketing is &amp;#34;superior&amp;#34; to the RQ 12. THIS IS A LIE. I have tried both and essentially without the RQ 12 blades your high end 1200 series model becomes a mid/low end norelco model at best. Even their ad says that these shaver heads are for the 8000 series  and not their PREMIUM 900 series model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO THANK YOU Norelco. I will be moving on to Panasonic once my current 1280 series dies out.</li>
    <li> I like the RQ12+.  It works well; I&#x27;ve been using it for about one month now almost daily, and I have no problems to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for shaving my head (not my face) and it does a great job ... and dare I say it ... a slightly better job than the previous head design.  The caveat is that I have to be more precise with how I hold and maneuver the shaver.  With the old head, it was possible to be really &amp;#34;sloppy&amp;#34; with my shaving technique and I still got a good shave.  Now, with the new head, I have to be more precise, but I&#x27;m rewarded with a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that when I shave, I lather up my scalp with a nice shaving soap.  I find that I get a much closer, smoother shave than if I don&#x27;t use any soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems, complaints?  None, really.  I thoroughly rinse the shaver and head before and after every shave, and very rarely pop the top to clean inside.  When I do, the inside is quite clean anyway, so a quick rinse and then the top goes back on.  I have yet to remove the blades for a &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It works great, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed. The RQ12 gave a better shave faster and smoother. The blades on the old RQ12 did wear out after a year, but the RQ12+ doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as well as the RQ12.</li>
    <li> In July  2013 I bought the Phillips/Norelco Sensor 3D 1250/46 for $180.  Out of the box it did a pretty good job and was/is very quiet. I decided to buy the replacement head RQ12 for $47.33 on 5/18/15.  All purchases were through Amazon which handled the orders perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now looking to go back to a regular blade.  Understand that I do not have a heavy beard that requires the razor to work extra hard.  However, I still have to make multiple SLOW passes just to get a somewhat close shave.  Sometimes I still have to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; with my cheap Trac II that I use for close trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a real shame that to buy the exact original head that came on the razor to begin with, we are made to spend close to two thirds of the original purchase price.  I&#x27;ve owned Norelco wet/drys for many years.  My main complaint has always been that they all grow noiser with time and use.  If I could justify the cost of a Braun I would buy it today.  I&#x27;ll never go back to Phillips.  Think three times before you buy this product.  It simply is not worth your money.</li>
    <li> Fell apart in first week.. But they did send a replacement and so far it&#x27;s holding up well</li>
    <li> There is nothing Nada great about this Product!!!! This is the worst Product of the History or Century!!! It should get awarded soon!! Follow below..&lt;br /&gt;A. Don&#x27;t buy it&lt;br /&gt;B. If you have bought it, return it ASAP&lt;br /&gt;C. If you can&#x27;t return it don&#x27;t use it or throw it away!!!&lt;br /&gt;D. If you have used it already pls don&#x27;t try to clean it&lt;br /&gt;E. Because you wouldn&#x27;t able to put it back together!!! Disassemble Computer and reassemble it 10 Times easier than that!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I did read several reviews critical of these blades but my personal experience with them has been positive.  They cut well and clean easily.</li>
    <li> Much needed upgrade to my old shaver...easier to keep clean...</li>
    <li> This product works really nice, especially on my tough beard!  Also, this replacement head is easier to keep clean.</li>
    <li> 1 of the orange inserserts in shaver came lioode and i can&#x27;t get it back in place ..am only using three blades.</li>
    <li> a greatly cheapened head replacement; i sent it back.  this is a real step backward for Norelco.</li>
    <li> Bottom line:  This replacement shaves as good as the original RQ12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why then did I only give it 2 stars?  Because it only has the features of a 2D razor---the heads move only in two directions (the 3d moves in three directions) and the combs have only two openings to trap whiskers and hence the actual cutters have only two rows of blades while the 3D has three openings to trap whiskers and the cutters have three rows of blades.  I bought a Sensotouch 3D razor and paid more than the 2D model but now I&#x27;ve been downgraded to a 2D model!  Another complaint is you need the special tool (included) to remove the combs with the cutters inside.  Lose the tool and you&#x27;re SOL when it comes to a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9-1-15.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months of continuous use these heads are about as &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; as the 2 1/2 year old original RQ12 head they replaced.  After 45 years as a Norelco user, I&#x27;m switching back to blades.  Norelco has lost a good customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one advantage to the RQ12+ over the original RQ12 (besides price)...you can just order the combs with cutters and save about $10 over purchasing the entire replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the kicker---the RQ12+ gives me a shave every bit as close as the original RQ12.  In other words, for me there is no real advantage in purchasing the more expensive 3D model over the 2D model, other than bells a whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick final note---I have been a regular Norelco user for 45 years.  I have a box full of razors going back to the original two comb &amp;#34;floating head&amp;#34; model.  Some of you might remember the TV commercial with Santa riding the razor head and floating over the snow.</li>
    <li> The reviews on the old RQ12 3D head being much better than this replacement are entirely valid.  This head doesn&#x27;t shave near as well as the old head and leaves stubble and long hairs that have to trimmed. It is marginally easier to clean but that is about it. Norelco built an Edsel with this shaver head.</li>
    <li> Definitely an upgrade from the previous Arkitech design</li>
    <li> This head completely renewed the life of my razor.</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> An excellent replacement  -  Just a fraction bulkier than the original head,  but the carry / charging case was easily modified to accommodate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery,l even to New Zealand ,  was fast  and no hassle  -  I will order a spare soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RET</li>
    <li> Great feel and works very smoothly</li>
    <li> Shaver works like new included guard for head which I did not think would be included with orange key to remove cutter lose shaves ahead used with Arcitec</li>
    <li> Product fit but different size than the original and cover broke.</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned after reading some reviews that said it was brittle, and not the same high quality as the original. I have not seen this problem. I have been very happy with the shave I get with this new blade. With the original Arcitec blades, and replacements using that design, would only give me a good shave if I shaved every day. If I skipped a day on the weekend I would have to use a trimmer first, or the blades would leave about 5% of the whiskers uncut. But this blade catches even those longer whiskers and I get a nice shave even on Monday morning.&lt;br /&gt;One issue I can confirm is that these blades have a wider outer frame, so they are not able to get as close to my nose, and I have to trim that area with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> They work well, very pleased. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco Senso touch 3D 1255X, and according to the Norelco site, as well as others, this RQ12+ head was compatible, well, IT IS NOT!!  It broke within a month...&lt;br /&gt;  My razor uses an RQ12 not RQ12+, and the prices of the RQ12 heads cost more than what I paid for the razor itself.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement head for my Norelco Arcitec 1050X shaver and the original RQ10 was not to be had at a reasonable price so I contacted Norelco and they told me the RQ12 had been designed as a replacement.  I bought one and was pleasantly surprised to discover it does a better job than the original.</li>
    <li> The new heads are not as good as the originals and are a PAIN to clean ! When you do the more extensive monthly cleaning it is difficult to get the retainer ring back on and get the heads to work properly. I&#x27;m for Norelco going back to the original. Also putting heads under the faucet to rinse be prepared for the hot water to scald you.</li>
    <li> These are a replacement for the RQ10 architec razor and work perfectly.  Perfect replacement and has a much better design, in the future you only need to change the combs and blades not the complete head. Gives a good shave and is much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> It was a big disappointment! The original head that is no longer available provided a smooth, comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for at least the last 40 years and found the1250X with the original head to be the best razor that I had ever used. With the replacment head the razor feels like it is pulling rather than cutting my facial hairs. It does a poor job with hairs around my chin and neck compared with the original head. It appears to me that Norelco decided to cut cost at the expense of performance.I don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t offer replacement cutters for the original head rather than risk customer dissatisfaction with the RQ12+ replacement. And what about vendors offering the original head for a price that almost matched the razor&#x27;s original price?  At any rate, I&#x27;ll be looking for a new razor by another manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even compare this to the original blades that come with the Norelco. Shave quality is sub-optimal and cleaning it is a pain. Wish I just purchased a new shaver from Costco instead of spending $40+ on this (perhaps that is what Philips wants!)</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original.  On the inside, the blades are held in place with plastic rings that do not stay locked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have you replaced the whole shaver.</li>
    <li> Good up grade from RQ10.... Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this razer a few years ago at Costco because of all the great reviews. I loved how close the shave was, how fast it was, and how I could shave without having to think about it. However, this replacement is NOT the original shave head. It is a cheap replacement that does not shave well, isn&#x27;t as washable, and nicks you easily. Its a huge waste of money. You should instead just go but a whole new razer rather than getting this.</li>
    <li> Not the five stars some give it, but definitely not the one or two stars others rate it.  A bit noisier than the original shave head, but shaves well after a few days of beard adaptation.  Cleaning is not a problem as the head snaps off easily and drys fast.  Even the individual cutters can be removed without having to use the provided removal tool.  For the price it good deal.</li>
    <li> hard to make sure It was the correct one but it works great thanks</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled!  It&#x27;s NOT built cheaper... It has way more surface area than the old one and shaves waaaaay better. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product to upgrade my SensoTouch8300 based on the previous (negative) reviews. I&#x27;m pretty sure the negative reviews are a ploy to drive the price of the old Head replacement prices sky high. I&#x27;m an ordinary guy who shaves every day to prevent a shadow and this head is better than stock.</li>
    <li> This replacement head was worse than the worn out heads which I ended up reusing instead of the new head.  Extremely disappointing, especially as the new head was so costly!!&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend not purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Noisy compared to the orgin. but shaves so much better, I like it!</li>
    <li> Restored original performance of my razor.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This replacement is cheap.  The little orange part inside broke after a few shaves.  It doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the old one.  Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> RQ12 ( older model) are better on skin and does the job better than these RQ12+&lt;br /&gt;Not too recommended but I think you have no choice RQ12 are no longer in production!!!</li>
    <li> Ok let me start by saying I too was very weary getting a replacement set of blades based on the review.  But I needed a new set so I did it.  This review is based on my first and only experience so far (just got it today)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appearance:&lt;br /&gt;Meh  I agree it looks cheap, not much to say there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave:&lt;br /&gt;Ok so does it shave close? sure does! TOO CLOSE&amp;#62;  When getting near the upper part near the cheek where those strays are I could actually feel the blades passing over my skin.  Now if you are skinny and have thick tough skin that is not malleable to the blades you may not feel it.  But my skin is well cared for and soft so its moves very well with the razor.  I literally feel like I have razor burn!!  Now will it calm down and will I adjust?  Maybe, time will tell and I will most certainly update the review as time progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;It works.  Better or worse time will tell but for now it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone else:&lt;br /&gt;Ok heres my thing, companies change, things change.  You don&#x27;t get pissed off at car companies, coffee pot makers, hell clothing makers for changing something, you don&#x27;t boycott them for sure and swear you will never drink coffee again or wear clothes again right?  Get real!  Those reviews are nonsense.  Yes it may be not as nicely built in the sleek and stylish fashion you are accustomed but does it do the same job or better? Be Honest.  key word honest.  Some people don&#x27;t like change obviously but overall it performs the same job with a little more closeness than the previous one and that works.</li>
    <li> IT IS SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE SHAVING HEADS IT CAME WITH. (THE ONE,S THAT WERE  ATTACHED TO THE RAZOR. IN THE ORIGNAL MANUEL IT SAYS NOT TO CHANGE THE POSITION OF THE SHAVING HEADS, SO IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF EVERYDAY TO RINSE, THERE IS NO WAY THE HEADS REMAIN IN THE SAME POSITION. HEY NORELCO &amp;#34;YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. THIS LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE YOU HAD IT MADE IN &amp;#34;CHINA  DO NOT BUY THIS..  I WANT MY MONEY BACK</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m leaving Norelco over this.  It truly is a bait and switch.  I thought Norelco would see the error of their ways, but I was wrong.  The change in replacement heads is just an idiotic move by the Product Manager.  I&#x27;m moving to another razor altogether.  Someone should start a forum for &amp;#34;Where to go now after the Norelco Nick?&amp;#34;  This is just sad.    After I find a decent replacement, I&#x27;ll buy two.  I may as well as my father followed my lead into Norelco.  From &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;Run From&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> WORKS FINE AND EASY TO CLEAN</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why all the negative reviews?? These negative reviews prevented me from buying for almost a year. Really wish I wouldn&#x27;t have waited. People say it&#x27;s noisy? Nope. Doesn&#x27;t cut  well? Not that I experienced. It&#x27;s easier to clean too. Quit the nit picking people! I&#x27;ve found this product to be just as good as the original, if not better.</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco shaver head I have purchased. The first one was the exact replacement for the head that came with the shaver. When I read the reviews of the current resigned replacement, I was somewhat skeptical about its quality. So far, pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new head does not cut quite as closely as the previous one. On the other hand, it is much easier to clean on a daily basis. I think that the engineers and designers definitely made an improvement here. I have no comments about cleaning the cutters as of now.</li>
    <li> I can see how some people are angry since the previous one (RQ12) was so different with the pivoting heads.  I would have liked the RQ12 again, but this still does the job well.  You just need to change your shaving method and remove the entire head to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars, but only 4 since I paid a fortune for my shave unit, but can not get the replacement part RQ12 anymore.</li>
    <li> This razor blades don&#x27;t work as good as the factory one</li>
    <li> When I first put it on the razor I noticed it did not shave as well as the &amp;quot;worn&amp;quot; head I was replacing. After a few months of trying to learn to like it, I put the old head back on (RQ12, NOT +). I found the old head still shaved better than the new one and I will use that until it no longer shaves me satisfactorily. Then I guess I will have to switch to another shaver as this replacement head is not acceptable. Poor shave, not close and it pulls hairs. I spoke to tech support at Phillips and they seemed to be aware of the issue but said that corporate has not announced any plan to fix the issue. One post said the newer cutters from the current razor will fit the RQ12+, but the tech guy tried it while he had me on the line and said they do not fit. So for now the razor is useless once the original cutters wear out.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Dec 2015- As mentioned above I put the original head back on, planning to replace the shaver once that head was no longer working. On checking the reviews for various shavers I noticed the Norelco reviews, especially for the RQ-12+ changed after about Dec. 2014 and were more mixed. The more recent purchasers seemed more positive by a margin that made me believe a redesign must have taken place. I decided to give it one more try before chucking the shaver and ordered another replacement head. Both the new RQ 12+ and the old one look the same to my eye, but the shave is night and day different. On first use my impression was &amp;quot;I got my favorite shaver back!&amp;quot; as it shaves like it did when I first bought it. Not sure what they changed, but after two weeks with the new head I am convinced either they improved the design of the RQ12+ or my previous one was defective. Either way I am pleased with the head now and have upped my rating- it would be higher, but I want to see how long this head lasts. If it makes it a year I will be most pleased.</li>
    <li> Not the same as original head and not&lt;br /&gt;As good a shave----very disappointed...</li>
    <li> These are useless. I should have left my olds one on. This is really worthless. I&#x27;m going to sell my entire unit so I can use replacement heads that work..not kidding.</li>
    <li> This is an appalling substitute for the original RQ12.  The shave from new was pretty average and after 2 weeks use it was worse than 1 year old head I just replaced.  This turned a top of the line $300 shaver into a piece of rubbish.  Just stick with a $5 pack of disposable razors and don&#x27;t waste your money on Philips if this is the best they can offer!</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco razors for decades. My current model is the Arcitec. I typically keep the head for a long time. Rinsing with water only, and occasionally Windex. I have to say that the original Arcitec heads are a big improvement from previous models. I was skeptical about purchasing these heads because of the number of negative reviews. Honestly, from the first shave I noticed that amazingly smooth result right away. Of course, you have to expect an adjustment period and for me, I was surprised that it worked great on the first try! The head movement is dramatically different from the original, so be prepared. It does seem to have some &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34;, but they are minor and really not a problem to me. I highly recommend these as a legitimate replacement to the original arcitec heads. I also like the return to being able to replace just the cutting pieces and not the whole head.</li>
    <li> The new replacement head is a poor replacement for the old 3D head I purchased before. This one is poorly made; noisy and doesn&#x27;t come close to the old shaving head. Cleaning should be easier but in fact is hard to clean without washing out the cutting heads. The price is approximately what I paid for the old replacement head but should be a lot cheaper considering it now has a one-piece head that is removed for cleaning. I guess, after many years of using three or four Norelco shavers I will probably make Remington my next shaver unless someone can recommend a better shaver. Norelco&#x27;s top line is obscenely high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes much longer to shave and doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as close as the old Norelco 3D head.</li>
    <li> really cheap I like the old one better. DDD</li>
    <li> This is nowhere close to the original head that comes with 1290x. A year old original head outperforms this one. This is not the right replacement for 3D razors, as the individual blades do not manoeuvre at all. Don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
    <li> Works better than the original head for the SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;The silvery plastic parts look kind of funny but seem to help lift hairs for trimming well.&lt;br /&gt;While different to clean and not quite as cool as the individual popping heads it cleans very well by popping off the three head assembly and running warm water through it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as opposed to the original head this one allows for much better and easier cleaning of the drive shafts for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant due to the seemingly negative review, and I must say, I don&#x27;t see what they were complaining about.</li>
    <li> I use Norelco shavers for more than 45 years.&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of RQ12+ replacement heads. The three blades can be flat surface or curve as the skin curves.&lt;br /&gt;The prior heads used to pull hair, the RQ12+ does not.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the daily cleaning it is so easy. I separate the top portion from the bottom portion, and then with the brush, provided with the shaver, I clean it in few seconds. I don’t have to remove the three heads after each shave; that I would do once a month. I did that with my prior Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;RQ12+  shaves very well. I really like it. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> As others have stated I too have used Norelco for 20 or more years. I have replaced blades on other units over the years.&lt;br /&gt;This is is the worst rendition ever.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds funny, it pulls and does not cut close. I still have the old head and it works better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know what a different razor feels like but I probably will find out. Worst $ I have spent in some time.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Norelco electrics for more than fifty years, and this product changed my SensoTouch 3D from the best Norelco shave ever to the worst. I have gone back to shaving with a blade until Norelco drops this worthless product and gives me a replacement head worthy of my shaver.</li>
    <li> BAD! Really bad. The orange plastic inside the head got worn out. It lasted a bit longer then a month. If you are thinking about buying a new Philips Norelco, DON&#x27;T! They mess up the replacement head by making it with terrible materials to lower their production costs. Value your money, I assure you that Philips don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Great replacement head ! And I like beter then the old one (original one )! The cut is clean and fast I&#x27;m very happy  and shave guy</li>
    <li> The Replacement Head RQ12+ (this product) is not identical to the RQ12 original head that came on my Phillips Norelco Razor.  The RQ12+ cutting heads do not open from the top for each cutting head as the do for the RQ12.</li>
    <li> The stories of how bad these blades are all true. THEY SUCK to say the least. Save your money and buy another electric razor.</li>
    <li> Returned mine after using it twice. The quality of the RQ12+ is awful in comparison to the RQ12. Not only that, but the shave was physically painful... so much so, that I pulled my old RQ12 out of the drawer and started using it again. Norelco has thousands of requests on their facebook and here on amazon requesting them to bring back the RQ12, but they&#x27;re ignoring all of it. Absolutely terrible.</li>
    <li> I was concerned when ordering this item that it wouldn&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s a different head than what came with the razor when I bought it.  But since the entire head pops off and this one snaps right in it was EASY!!!  The item razor works better than new and it was worth ordering!!  Cheaper than a new razor and you can&#x27;t tell it isn&#x27;t a new one!!  My hubby is thrilled and I have to admit I am too!! No more rough stubble!!</li>
    <li> I have an Arcitec that has the pop up heads to clean.  I took a chance on this despite the negative reviews.  I am SUPER impressed with the difference in the smoothness and quickness of my shaver now.  The blades remove as one piece and lift off the head so it is super easy to clean.  I am so glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Norelco discontinued my razor (1255x Senso Touch) and recommends these blades for substitute but they are noisy and don&#x27;t cut as close as the original.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Shave is now closer than before. And I have pretty thick beard.  Update - I reattached my old shaving head (RQ12), sharpened its cutters (search internet on how to do that), and now realize that RQ12 is better than RQ12+.  Its metal screens slide over the skin much better than plastic frames of RQ12+ and RQ12 gives me closer shave.  Thumbs down</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people have had issues with this new replacement blade... but for me, it seems fine. As others have mentioned I too have noticed that it does seem to pull SLIGHTLY more then my old blades... I usually shave every day and don&#x27;t notice it. It&#x27;s fine. However if I skip a day, I notice it. If I skip 2 or more days (which I have not yet) I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll really notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us who shave every day and don&#x27;t have THICK hair, this blade works fine. I can see how others with thicker hair have had issues. And as others mentioned they did change the way it works. They do give you the orange blade remover in here, but I don&#x27;t have a reason to ever remove the blades (and you honestly don&#x27;t need the tool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People say it&#x27;s easier to remove the cover now to get to the blades... okay. I find it no different then the old design. Maybe quicker, easier to remove everything since theres no hinge, who knows...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I gave it 3/5 because it does work fine, however there is a different in blade quality over the other blades. But it&#x27;s still a fine value.</li>
    <li> This replaced my older replacement head to my Arcitec since Norelco discontinued it. One thing I noticed every time I purchased a new Norelco shaver is that my shaves were not as good as the previous razor. This has changed with this new head. My shave is as close as I remember it being over three decades ago and my shaving time is cut in half compared to the previous head. I would rate this 4 1/2 Stars if I could. The half Star is for the problem I see after shaving in that some of the stubble between the two pieces escapes. This unit should be completely sealed. Other than that, all is good. :)</li>
    <li> Harder to clean than the original ones.</li>
    <li> It feels cheaper thant the original heads, but I can see why there was a design change to this newer version.  This is simpler to clean and prevents the individual heads from becoming mismatched with each other as compared to the original design.  Overall, it still works and provides a close shave, but again, its a cheaper version of the original design.</li>
    <li> Every thing was just as we ordered and at the best price.</li>
    <li> Better head replacement for the arcitec razor.</li>
    <li> Works well, clear instructions, and an upgrade from previous replacement module.</li>
    <li> Norelco ruined a good thing by changing the design of their ingenious self-contained RQ10 shaver head. The new head has more surface area and, yes, it cuts a bit better in my experience ... but it is a step backwards in terms of convenience.  Replacing the cutting blades on this thing will require good eye-hand coordination and good eye-sight ... two things I seriously lack. That is the only reason I am giving it only three stars.</li>
    <li> I agree with most of the one-star reviews I&#x27;m reading here.  I only came to review because the cheap plastic retainer clip on one of the heads/blades is already broken... after ONE take apart cleaning.  This is the cheapest built electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned AND the most expensive.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my old Norelco triple header and will probably just bring it to a repair shop when the battery craps out.  Norelco... you&#x27;ve completely lost my loyalty.  This latest one was my fifth purchase in the last 20 years and probably my last.</li>
    <li> Not quite the original high-quality heads that came with the norelco</li>
    <li> Simple and very efficient.  Easy to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; on and off for cleaning, and is much easier to clean than the original head that came with the razor.  Also a closer shave than the original head.  I&#x27;m going to order a couple of extras while they are still available.</li>
    <li> Norelco has replaced their top of the line head with a cheap plastic head.  The first shave with the original head and the earlier replacement was a dream, with a smooth cut that felt nice on the face and a cut as smooth as a blade.  This new head is no better than a bottom of the line cheap head.  The smoothness is gone, with a rough cut worse than my 1-2 year old head.  The shave itself is very poor, with plenty of stubble left behind on the face.  In addition, the noise significantly louder and the feel of cheap plastic is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a fan of Norelco for 20+ years.  I always buy the top of the line shaver for the closest shave.  Norelco has permanently lost a customer with this cheap replacement head.  I call it cheap for its construction, but its price is certainly not cheap and definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Good product, Good price and timely delivery</li>
    <li> Total junk. I just bought a brand new one but it does not shave well no matte how hard and how long you try.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than my 2-year old head that came with the SensoTouch 3D.  Might even be a little worse.  And it seems like it&#x27;s using cheaper parts than the original head.  It&#x27;s slightly louder and squeakier.  I don&#x27;t understand why Norelco doesn&#x27;t just offer the original head model as a replacement.  I would expect better support for a $100 shaver.</li>
    <li> The RQ12&amp;#34;+&amp;#34; is NOT the same as the RQ12 shaver head.  It fits the shaver perfectly, but the heads do not pop up individually for cleaning.  Also, curiously, the shaver head squeaks while it is being used.  These heads were reasonably priced, work adequately and give a good clean shave but they are not as good as the RQ12 heads.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to replace the original shaving heads on my Norelco.  I was considering replacing the entire razor.  What a mistake that would have been.  I am delighted with the replacement head (complete with new blades) I purchased.  The new head is actually easier and faster to clean than the original head.  In fact the shave the replacement head delivers is OUTSTANDING and CLOSE.  I personally recommend these replacement heads to everyone.  It is well worth it to purchase a replacement head each year.</li>
    <li> Awful, takes forever to shave now</li>
    <li> These blades are AWFUL! It takes 20 mins to get anything near a close shave and a hour after you shave it looks like you haven&#x27;t even shaved at all! DO NOT BUY THESE BLADES!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor head. Not quite as good as the original that came on my 1250x but after a couple weeks my face adjusted well. I am very prone to ingrown hairs and at first had a hard time but like I said after 2 or 3 weeks my face cleaned up good. I put off buying this for a long time because of all the poor reviews but it&#x27;s not so bad. Will probably replace again in 6-8 months because I doubt it will last an entire year</li>
    <li> As good as most electric razors!  Would still like to know where I can get the plastic orange  rings that hold the blades in place.  I lost one of mine down the bathroom sink drain&amp;#34;!??</li>
    <li> Rough shave compared to the previous RQ12 blades.  Would like to see them bring back the flip out heads for easier cleaning.  Now only slightly better than Braun.  Disappointing change in product line.</li>
    <li> Right shaver heads, thanks.</li>
    <li> Was not like the 1 I HAVE DID&amp;#34;NT CUT AS GOOD NOR EASY 2 CLEAN</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement head for my old RQ1090 arcitec shaver and found they are VERY EXPENSIVE!&lt;br /&gt;I found the RQ12 and RQ12PLUS heads on the Norelco site and tried to find what the &amp;#34;+&amp;#34; model of the RQ12+ meant.&lt;br /&gt;I found that the RQ12+ for the series 8000 also fits the arcitec shavers and sells for less than $60.&lt;br /&gt;I got one and It is an improvement over the original arcitec head.  No, it doesn&#x27;t look the same.  Since it is for the later high end shavers it is a &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; head and floats better than the original arcitec head.  It also came with a little tool to remove the cutters for better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I saved almost $100!</li>
    <li> Very good product. It&#x27;s totally compatible with my RQ1050 and give it a new life. The original line head of this model never shave me very good, the RQ12+ is quite better. I even don&#x27;t need to use aftershave as it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin like the old model. Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> terrible. the original RQ12 was awesome. This RQ12 + is a cheap horrible excuse for a razor replacement. Phillips is just not what it used to be, time to switch brands.</li>
    <li> The new RQ12/62 shaving heads are great.  My Norelco 1290x shaves smoother than it did when it was new.  Excellent improvement over the old heads.  Good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sr-musicguy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m replacing my original 4 star review, downgrading it to 1 star. Initially, it seemed to do a decent job but over the course of several months it just kept getting worse. It used to take 2 minutes for a great shave and now it takes 3+ for a barely average one. I like the design of the new head and it is easier to clean, however it is clearly inferior. I&#x27;ve now had it a year and I&#x27;m at the point of just sucking it up and purchasing a Braun because it appears that Norelco is not going to bring the original head design back.  I never tossed the original RQ12/52 head that came with the razor even though it makes a terrible noise (I&#x27;m guessing because the plastic gears inside are worn). Just for fun, I put the old head back on and did a full shave the other day and it was fantastic. It&#x27;s like the close shave that I have been missing out on for a year!  It is my final belief that Norelco is cutting corners and their quality is suffering. If only I had known, I would have stocked up on the old heads before they discontinued them.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat reluctant to purchase this replacement head after reading so many negative reviews regarding the new design, but now that I&#x27;ve received it and used it, I&#x27;m overall satisfied with the purchase.  I&#x27;ll go into a bit of detail in an attempt to clear some misconceptions of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DESIGN:  The replacement head is identical to the head found on the new 9000 series razors, including using the newer V-track cutting blades.  The V-track blades look like little V-shaped scoops which Norelco claims are better at grabbing and guiding flat-lying hair.  Like the 9000 series, once you buy the RQ12/62 head, you can subsequently replace just the blades using the somewhat cheaper SH90/52 replacement heads.  (The heads are advertised as working in just the 9000 series but the instruction sheet that comes with this replacement head confirms the SH90/52 heads are compatible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers have posted negative responses to the fact that the heads no longer flip up to allow for easy cleaning.  Instead, the top of the head assembly pops off and the individual razor blades can be detached for cleaning by using an included orange plastic key.  Initially I was put off by this change, but now that I&#x27;ve seen it in action after several uses it&#x27;s grown on me.  While the flip up heads seemed elegant, they were somewhat impractical for sink cleaning. In the old design, both the blades and the rotor shafts flipped up, creating deep wells that didn&#x27;t always rinse clean with water from the sink.  My old razor head easily got gunked up with stubble that didn&#x27;t rinse away between manual cleanings.  Getting to the blades required carefully opening a second metal hinge on the underside of the flip-up head which wasn&#x27;t always easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design, while less elegant in appearance, seems to actually be better for day to day cleaning.  The rotor shafts remain attached to the main body of the razor and the area around the blades is shallower and seems to rinse the stubble away under the sink more effectively than the old design.  Since I shave dry, I can also much more easily just tap out the loose stubble into the sink after each shave and I notice it comes out much more cleanly than in my old flip-up head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the new design is a slight improvement.  Yes it&#x27;s less elegant (and feels less sturdy) than the previous design, but in practicality I think I&#x27;m able to much more effectively clean the razor and it&#x27;s not a chore to pop the head off compared to flipping up the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVE QUALITY:  The new razor performs as well if not better than the original head of this razor. I can&#x27;t give much comment as to whether the new V-track blades are any better than the UltraTrack blades in the original design, if only because my previous blades were so dull that my basis for comparison is stale.  I use Williams Lectric Shave as a prep and it provided a smooth, comfortable and very close, especially on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:  I&#x27;m satisfied with this product overall and am only taking a star off because both the razor head and the SH90/52 replacement heads are still significantly more expensive than the replacement blades for any previous Norelco model.  Still, the new design is practical and effective once you get used to the changes and the shave quality was excellent.  Hopefully Norelco standardizing on the SH90 blades across multiple products that will help drive down the price.</li>
    <li> The head worked as it should. It snaps on somewhat differently than the original and the other replacements I have purchased. The individual blades are somewhat harder to remove for cleaning but not to the point to lower the rating.</li>
    <li> Its a okay replacement for the original head, but the original was better. You can still buy the original, but it&#x27;s as much a a whole new razer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t BUY these heads, I made the mistake because I though they where the original, they are no were close to shaving as the original shaving heads, wish Norelco would have stuck with the originals, too late for me but it&#x27;s not too late for you DON&#x27;T buy them.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to look for a replacement razor. It won&#x27;t be Norelco for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I came back to see if Norelco had wised up to the problem with the replacement head and it&#x27;s really amazing that they have NOT made any changes or gone back to the original heads instead of the piece of JUNK they now sell. I read most of the current reviews and ALL of them are 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;NORELCO wake up you are losing customers, I ended up buying a Panasonic Razor and that&#x27;s a sale they lost and reading the latest reviews many people (long time users) are switching to another brand. I wish I could meet the person who though of making the change and have them shave with the replacement head so they can see how bad it is.Sometimes these huge companies amaze me with the way they treat their customers.&lt;br /&gt;Notice that not a single of the latest negative reviews have been answered by Norelco they have taken no responsibility for the mess they have created and the amount of customers who are unhappy with their product.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap.  Done after 1 month.</li>
    <li> Replacement part looks cheap... Not like the original part, I was disappointed with Norelco&#x27;s choice of quality for their replacement part.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s electric razor.  I rated it only 4 stars because he said it pinches his face a little which is a bummer.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this. I returned it because of the following reasons&lt;br /&gt;- the blades are super cheap quality. It&#x27;ll hurt your skin&lt;br /&gt;- The blades don&#x27;t come out like the original ones do for cleaning purpose&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t fit in smoothly to 1250X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips should be recalling this product ASAP</li>
    <li> I just purchased this. After reading a lot of negative reviews, I was not sure which model I should buy. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $140+ for the old model RQ12 and I gave this a try. At least for me, it works great, and I don&#x27;t see any problems that other people are complaining. Also with the new version, it seems I can replace only the blade and don&#x27;t have to buy the entire head. I like RQ12+ better than RQ12</li>
    <li> An improvement to the previous style!</li>
    <li> this is a cheap flimsy expensive replacement for what the original product was .i contacted phillps norelco about this and guess what,they do not care,so what they did was to go backwards and up the price and furnish  something that does not work plus you need a special tool to clean. bottom line do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is great, works on the older 9K models and 8k and gives u the same heads as I have on the 9700 model, very cool, one for travel and one for work, if it runs away during traveling, got a back up, just great, it&#x27;s the full head with three blades, not just the blades.</li>
    <li> This head shaves close enough, but is course and occasionally bites.  It is not an exact replacement for, at least, the 1255X, which is a rinesable head, which pops open to clean. There does not seem to be a way to clean this head, nor are any instructions included, except how to adapt it to your own model.  Apparently, the beard cuttings just collect in the razor and 6 months later you spend a great deal of money for another cheap plastic rplacement.  Poor business this!</li>
    <li> Improved over old model, easier to clean.</li>
    <li> change blade annually and these work great</li>
    <li> Replacement for the RQ12.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as efficiently as the RQ 12</li>
    <li> Disappointment. It is not the same head as the original one. Doesn&#x27;t perform the same way and VERY expensive. There is no explanation whatsoever and no diagram to show the differences from a head of time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of purchasing this new replacement head based on the other reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen!  This new replacement head is superior to the RQ12 in every way possible.  It&#x27;s easier to clean, it glides over my face so smoothly, and it hugs all the curves of my jawbone and neck much better than the RQ12 ever did.  I&#x27;m not sure if I just happen to get the one replacement head that works or what, but I have not experienced any of the problems other reviews have written about.  I&#x27;ve been using the RQ12+ for over a month now, and I have not experienced any performance issues with the new head.  Still cuts as well as it did on the first day.  I purposely did not shave for over a week to see if I would get any of the tugging or pulling on hair as many people have talked about.  None whatsoever!  Also, someone mentioned their replacement head did not come with the plastic cover, mine did.  All I can say is make sure you&#x27;re buying genuine Norelco products, as this one advertised right on the box it came with a plastic protective cover.  In terms of overall shave, I was impressed right away with this re-design.  This new replacement head glides smoothly all over my face in places the old RQ12 never did, especially around my chin and throat.  I would encourage everyone to try this new replacement head and make sure you&#x27;re getting genuine Norelco parts.  If you do, there is no reason why the RQ12+ should not outshine the RQ12 in every way!</li>
    <li> Not a great product compared to previous heads, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The new cutting head model is ok. It doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the original ones and I need to avaliate how it will perform as time passes. The original head that came with my Philips Norelco lasted for 2 years with an amazing edge I hope this new &amp;#34;emproved&amp;#34; version does at least the same.</li>
    <li> I am NOT pleased with Norelco&#x27;s discontinuation of the original head for my [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Series 8000 Shaver]]. I use my shaver to shave my head as well as my face and there is definitely a noticeable difference in speed and quality of shave. My old shaver head has about 6 months of daily shaves on it and it still shaves my head closer and faster than this piece of junk. I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off by Norelco and may never buy another product from the company again.</li>
    <li> Pro: Good, clean, feel of a blade. Does the job (which is &amp;#34;shaving my beard&amp;#34;). You look &amp;#34;kool&amp;#34; having an electric shaver with the self-clean machine that has the Transformers and Iron Man &amp;#34;sound&amp;#34; effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Ridiculously expensive to replace the head (paying for the luxury of an electric shaver). The blade probably cost to make is around $21.50 (should be around $43.00 with a 200% mark up cost) but they increase to 300% instead :D</li>
    <li> I just purchased the new Norelco RQ12/62 replacement head for my 1250x SensoTouch 3D shaver.  I really don&#x27;t know what all the negative reviews are about!  In my opinion, this is a better blade head than the original RQ12.  It&#x27;s shaves closer with fewer nicks, and is super easy to clean.  Give it a chance before you bash it.</li>
    <li> OK, but defiantly not as good as the RQ12. The RQ12 was almost as good as a razor. Norelco should be ASHAMED of themselves for stopping production of the RQ12!  They only reason that I can think of was that they wanted to clear the way for their new razor.  Why would someone buy their new razor when the RQ12 was (almost) perfect. My regret is that I did not stock up on RQ12&#x27;s when I could. Please Norelco restart production of the RQ12 I would pay double the price $100</li>
    <li> After refusing to pay $200 for the original RQ12, I have switched to Braun Series 7 and I am much much happier.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly do not understand why Norelco replaced their top tier blades with this terrible replacement!&lt;br /&gt;I know one role of thumb in engineering... if its working do not try to fix it..... I am terribly disappointed by Norelco.</li>
    <li> Not as bad as some people say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these blades for about a month now and, bottom line, the blades are perfectly fine - they cut closly and have not caused any pull. Admittedly the head is not as cool as it&#x27;s predecessor which allowed easy cleaning because the blades simply flipped up on hinges. With this head, you pull the top of the assembly (which holds the blades), clean and pop the top of the assembly back on. So it is not as &amp;#34;James Bond&amp;#34; as the mechanics of the original head, but works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advantage of this head is that it traps almost all of the whiskers in the assembly which very little spilling out - the original head DID the shaved whiskeres to spill out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the head does what it is supposed to do, the blades cut well and, though it is a little less sophisticated in design, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> I seen all the negative reviews and a few good ones. I took a chance and bought them. So far the blades are working great.</li>
    <li> I believe these blades are better than the ones they replaced.  I missed the tip-open feature for cleaning at first, but these pop open just as easily.  As for these being noisier than the old ones - yes, I agree.  That means they are cutting better, or am I the only user who shaves until the noise stops, telling me there are no more hairs to shave?  These pull a little bit more, but that just means they are cutting the hairs below the surface, as designed.  I do not think it is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I really do not know what all the complaints are about - I like them!</li>
    <li> I have never wrote a review before but this product is so bad I just had to respond.&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensotouch 3d and this head is a real disappointment.  The one year old head shaves better then this one!&lt;br /&gt;Have faith in the stars I should have!&lt;br /&gt; This one just got a one star so I could write this review.  If I was Norelco I would offer anyone who purchased this head a full refund!  Been using Norelco for years but will think twice before purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> I got this for Arcitec because of reviews saying it shaves closer.  It does shave a little closer but I am comparing to a head that&#x27;s a lot older than one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I did not notice when I was shopping:  This head&#x27;s blades do not flip open for easy rinsing.  I did not realize how much I rely on that feature until I bought this.  Manually removing the head retainer and shaking it gets some hair out, but you will have to go back to fiddling with the tray of head cleaner every month or so.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 01/09/2014- RETURNING THIS Product. THIS SENSOTOUCH WAS PROBABLY DESIGNED BY SOME SADISTIC who loves to inflict pain on prior sensotouch 3d users. The one&#x27;s rating this 5 star are probably enjoying the pain. Good bye norelco......Ever wonder why there are equal number of 5 star and 1 start ratings..     Previous review    Lets put it this way. it&#x27;s a kind of an OK replacement. It took me 20 mins to shave as opposed to 7 minutes of shavetime using the original, I initially used shaving foam but had to switch to shaving gel midway just to shave correctly becuase multiple passes using shaving foam did not help( based on other reviews).    The RQ12+ shaver head never gave the same comfortable feel you get using the RQ12 in terms of the smooth feeling of your face and the easiness of shaving.    But this is going to be my last norelco once the shaving head is done. My older review about the this shaver had 5 stars which stated \\&quot;Can&#x27;t wait for the next shave\\&quot; Now m like meh. Philips should rename this product to RQ12-.  IF IT AIN&#x27;T BROKE  DON&#x27;T FIX IT</li>
    <li> This is an awful, cheap replacement that Norelco obviously made to cut costs.  The material quality is vastly inferior to the previous RQ12/52 and RQ12/42 models.  The rings surrounding the blade coverings feel cheap and plasticky.  Furthermore, the gaps between the three rings creates a rough, uneven feeling on my face.  The new design scratches and pulls, where the original was nothing but smooth on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being asked to install one of these onto my SensoTouch 3D is an absolute downgrade.  I guess it&#x27;s time to look for an entirely new unit.  It&#x27;s too bad, because the SensoTouch (with the original heads) was the best, most comfortable razor I ever owned.</li>
    <li> Is the new RQ12 Replacement Head an improvement over the original?  I think it is for one major reason:  It cuts whiskers better.  Both my wife and I notice that my beard is less pronounced 24 hours later when it is time to shave again.  On the other hand, I miss the cool flip-up head design that made washing the heads very easy.  Cleaning the new design requires prying off the complete head unit.  Actually, this is not a big deal, just not as cool as the original design.</li>
    <li> It was excellent, I should have gotten it years ago.</li>
    <li> Noisy, hard to clean, does not give close shave</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement on the Arcitec. It shaves about like the original head. I dry shave and usually just clean the unit by knocking loose whiskers out of the head and then brushing it off. That takes about as long as it did with the original head. I occasionally wash the head off and that seems like it will take longer because of the need to reseat each rotor. But, because you can remove the rotors, it should be possible to do a more thorough job of cleaning them. Also the pamphlet that comes with the head implies that in the future only the rotors will need to be replaced and that that will be cheaper than replacing the whole head.  However, this head is not fully compatible with the Arcitec head. It is considerably larger and does not fit into the travel case that came with the Arcitec. The travel case is effectively useless with this head. Also, as a matter of aesthetics, it looks out of scale and the coloring is not quite the same as the original. But then this is quibble, who buys razors for their looks.</li>
    <li> Not as as much fo a heavy duty feel as the metal replacement head. But, much less expensive and works just as well.</li>
    <li> It is not at all like the RQ12 buts it works better than expected.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to take it apart to clean it.</li>
    <li> these new heads are not as sharp as the ones thet replaced.  they do alot grinding.&#x27;</li>
    <li> They absolute worse when trying to clean the heads with the extractor that comes with these replacement heads. I thought the old heads were a poor design, this model 10 times worse..  Once you remove the head to clean, be prepared to spend about an hour trying to get them back together. I&#x27;m going back to my old Braun shaver, at least I can clean the blades. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Great shave for a few months, then begins to show signs of wear. Don&#x27;t believe these will last 6 mos. as my old ones did. And these are much easier to rinse out and clean each time, just don&#x27;t think the blades stay sharp as long.</li>
    <li> It is a replacement blades for my electric Shaver</li>
    <li> I just received my new RQ12. The blades pop off of the head with little resistance and then the head and the blade unit can be rinsed. The blades can be removed wit the orange tool in the package and then you can clean them individually&lt;br /&gt;Like we have done with Norelco blades for years. Make sure you keep each cutter with its foil while cleaning. Tried my razor with the new head tonight and it seems to shave closer, more comfortably and quicker. Looking forward to more experience with it! Bill</li>
    <li> If I could give negative stars, I would. Norelco replaced a high quality RQ12 head with a poorly designed, cheap head. Not only did they ruin what was a superior razor, but bungled its customer relations in the process. This cheap replacement is difficult to clean and doesn&#x27;t have the same mobility as the RQ12. After spending $200 plus for the system, I find it incredibly insulting and frustrating to have such a low quality replacement head forced upon its high end customers. My next purchase will not be Norelco. They have lost me for life.  UPDATE 3/2016: Now into my 6th month with a Braun 7-series. Great, smooth shave. No razor burns or redness on my sensitive skin. Took a few weeks to get used to the different design and holding the razor at a 90 degree angle, but what a fantastic product. The only minor difference between the Braun 7-series and the Norelco 1280x is that the Braun is a bit noisier, but it&#x27;s nowhere near a deal breaker. So glad to rid myself of a company that completely screwed over hundreds of thousands of high-end customers with the cheap, ramshackle RQ12plus. I am a happy Braun customer. Join me!</li>
    <li> Very easy to clean, gives a smooth close shave.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it the way it works. It doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as previous/older replacements I had.</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT authentic Norelco.  Blades don&#x27;t flip up for cleaning like the originals and the entire three-blade head must be removed,  cheap design.  The worst part is the shave closeness.  The originals were amazing.  These don&#x27;t get anywhere near as close.  Disappointed</li>
    <li> Several other reviewers expressed concern that these heads only have two tracks as opposed to the three tracks that the original heads had. Since the missing track is the innermost one, there is very little difference in active shaving area. I found the blades to work extremely well, delivering performance similar to the razor with original blades. I dropped one star because the construction appeared slightly less robust than the original design.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco has lost this lifetime customer with this scam of outrageously expensive and poor-quality replacement heads.  I will be buying another shaver from a different brand.</li>
    <li> A better shave but somewhat more difficult to clean heads or change blades. An overall plus, however.</li>
    <li> The cheep plastic clips do not keep the cutters in place.   Very poor design.</li>
    <li> Love from the first use. Much better than old RQ12 (at least for my skin). As other reviewers recommend, give it 2 weeks for your skin to adjust to new shaver. It is different compare to old RQ12, but it does work. In my opinion, RQ12+ is an improvement compare to the old RQ12. Thanks Philips for the upgrade!</li>
    <li> All went very well.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> Pure Garbage. Poor design, I may never buy another norelco product again.</li>
    <li> Improvement over the head that came with shaver.</li>
    <li> Not as gd as rq12, but still gd enough for me.</li>
    <li> Not the same or as good as the original.  The rq10 was a better head. In addition I bought my 1090 razor because of the charging pod. Easy to transport. Now, norelco basically didn&#x27;t care and this new head does not fit in the pod. You must carry it separately.  Lost my trust in buying a norelco product.  Thus clearly indicates if it&#x27;s better for them they will change regardless of how thus affects the customer.</li>
    <li> Such a step back from the previous heads. I guess I have to abandon my Philips and find another brand. Too bad, the initial heads were very good.</li>
    <li> Given the less than stellar reviews, I hesitated, but realized that my old head needed to be replaced and the RQ12+ was the only option.  I was quite impressed with the new design.  It is much lighter on the top of the shaver and changes the balance of the shaver in a positive direction.  I was worried about the plastic casing, but realize that modern plastic is a sturdy as most metal housings and lighter.  After a month, the shave is consistently good and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the purchase. Yes, as with most Philips products they seem to be a bit overpriced, but the quality is still there.</li>
    <li> Have had no problems with the replacement part.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t understand how Norelco product designers thought this was an improvement over the previous model.  If you are an everyday shaver it is okay, but not any better than the old model.  If you don&#x27;t shave everyday like myself, you will not be happy with this new head. It pulls at your stubble and is very uncomfortable.  It also takes longer to shave and it is difficult to get all of the longer hairs on the neck.  My year and a half old head is way more comfortable and actually shaves just as close.  I tried this for a month and a half thinking it might get better once it wears in, but it hasn&#x27;t.  I figured the new model would do better, but I have gone back to my old head for now.  I might have to give one of the aftermarket heads that look like the old flip up style, selling on a popular auction site, a try.  They are almost half the price, and can&#x27;t be any worse than this head.  If anyone has tried these, please let me know how well they shave.  This one is a major disappointment and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> After all bad reviews I read about these heads. I ordered them anyway. I was really surprised how easy it was to replace these heads and the shave was also better than usual. From now on I believe all that has to be replaced is the blades. This should be cheaper than the heads.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Just buy a new razor.  Cheap heads that pull and irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> Within one week I noticed the shaver seemed to be struggling to cut my beard. Within 2 weeks I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> kind of a cheap made head.  norelco prducts are getting to expensive,,eventhe real expensive products dont last long.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with razor</li>
    <li> I have now used this replacement blade for 5 months.  I find it to be FAR superior to the original.  Change comes hard as we are all accustomed to habit.  Cleaning the replacement however, is a snap.  Easily pop off the three head attachment.  Do NOT remove the entire head from the handle.  Rinse the stubble from the housing then rinse the blades with hot water to inhibit bacteria.  Extend the trimmer, then hang the entire unit upside down on the charging rack and let it dry for the next use.  Nothing to it!</li>
    <li> The replacement head is better than the original head.</li>
    <li> This replacement head does not work with the 1050xcc razor. It fits on the razor, but then doesn&#x27;t fit in the cleaning system that comes with the razor. If they are going to advertise it as a replacement &amp;#34;newer version&amp;#34; of the RQ10, it should fulfill all the same requirements. It does not! Waste of time. At least amazon accepted the return so it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money also.</li>
    <li> I read many very negative comments before deciding to go the less expensive route and ordering this replacement head for my Norelco 1250X 8000 series electric razor.  But, I thought, I&#x27;ll try this replacement as there were slightly more positive comments than negative ones.  Also, I could always bite the bullet and spring for the more expensive one if this one didn&#x27;t work out.  My razor is about 6 months old.  However, my beard is very thick and it got to the point that it was taking me about 20-30 minutes to get a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to continue to use the Norelco and not revert to my safety razor because after a couple of neck surgeries, I had some rather bothersome scars.  It had gotten to the point that I was turning myself into a rather messy &amp;#34;self-sacrifice&amp;#34; every time I shaved with my safety razor.  Also, I had spent a bunch of money on this razor and I wanted to get more use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my replacement head arrived, I immediately installed it on my razor.  After splashing on some pre-shave lotion and letting it dry, I fired-up the Norelco.  As I mentioned earlier, it had gotten to the point that I was taking 20-30 minutes to get a clean, smooth shave.  With the new head, I was done in 10 minutes and it was a closer and smoother shave than I had ever received with the original Norelco head; even when the razor was brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complained that the replacement head didn&#x27;t fit their razor.  It fit mine perfectly.  Some people complained that it was more noisy to use the replacement head.  I can agree with that somewhat.  But, I&#x27;m shaving, not trying to go to sleep.  It&#x27;s NOT that much more noisy.  The ads for this replacement head claims a closer cut.  I&#x27;m here to say, that claim is very valid.  I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten as close a shave from any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned as the shave I got from my Norelco with this replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complain about the individual floating heads not opening up, individually, for cleaning, as is the case with the OEM head.  With this replacement head, the top comes off so all three floating heads are exposed for cleaning, at the same time.  Other reviewers complain about the replacement head being made of plastic.  I see their point, to a point.  But, thus far, I don&#x27;t see a reduction in quality. And, for ⅓ the cost of the original replacement head and a far, far closer shave, I would&#x27;nt care if the head were made of aluminum and wax paper; as long as it does what I want it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has been around for as long as I&#x27;ve been.  I can still remember their TV commercials with Santa riding a sled of &amp;#34;floating heads&amp;#34; over the snow, in black and white, no less.  One needs to realize that Norelco needs to produce a product that will compete with the rest of the market.  And, if they can do that by using a different material(s), sell it for far less money and still have a high quality product, they will do it.  Plus, if they allowed their quality to fall, they know they will lose their edge (no pun intended) and eventually all of their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is just my opinion, based on my experience.  I&#x27;m not trying to down-play those who have negative experiences with the replacement head.  For those who had bad experiences, I would ask them to contact Norelco and discuss the issue with them.  There may be a practical explanation as to why their experiences were negative.&lt;br /&gt;_________________________&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3/15/15&lt;br /&gt;After using the RQ12+ for about 6 weeks, I can report that it&#x27;s still performing satisfactorily.  I shave about every other day and take the razor head apart once a week for cleaning.  I break-down the head into its 10 component parts, wash each, individually, under warm tap water, allow them to dry, reassemble the components and reapply the razor head to the razor.  There is a noticeable difference in the closeness of a shave, the longer one goes between cleaning.  Once the blades are cleaned, it&#x27;s like shaving with a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I do miss the pop-up feature of the original blade assembly.  But, upon figuring out the trick to disassembling, then reassembling the razor head, after cleaning, I&#x27;m not so sure that the design replacement head doesn&#x27;t allow for a better job of cleaning the razor blades.  The &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; with disassembling, then reassembling the razor head lies with realizing that once the cover is removed, flip it over in your palm and be looking at it from its underside.  From there, you can use your fingernails to rotate the orange retaining clips counter-clockwise, then lift them out of the way.  Next, using your fingernail, pick out the razor blade from the blade cover.  Next, using your finger, from underneath the cover (remember, you&#x27;re looking at the assembly upside-down), push the blade cover out of its hole in the 3-blade assembly.  Repeat this process for each of the 2 remaining blades.  Now, clean each component.  I use warm, running tap water, from my bathroom sink.  Be sure to close the drain or place some sort of strainer over the drain so as to not lose any parts down the drain.  Should there be any any residual left, I use an old toothbrush to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow the parts to dry and reassemble the razor head by reversing the procedure. the parts are interchangeable! So don&#x27;t worry about which component came off of which razor blade.  NOTE: WHEN TAKING THE RAZOR HEAD ASSEMBLY APART, NOTE THAT THERE ARE NOTCHES ALONG THE EDGES OF EACH RAZOR HEAD COVER.  ALSO, THERE ARE TABS ON THE ASSEMBLY COVER AND ON EACH RAZOR COVER.  BE SURE TO ALIGN THE NOTCHES WITH THE TABS IN EACH CASE.  OTHERWISE, YOU&#x27;LL NOT BE ABLE TO REALIGN THE COMPONENTS AND THEY WILL NOT FIT TOGETHER PROPERLY.  Next, drop one of the circular blades into each razor cover.  Be sure to place the cutting edges against the inside of the razor cover.  Otherwise, the blades will be upside down when reattached to the razor and not cut anything.  The final step is to reinstall the Orange retainer rings onto each razor.  Again, align the notches on the retainer rings with the tabs on the razor covers.  Rotate the retainer rings clockwise until they snap into place.  Not much force is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me about 15 minutes to disassemble, clean and reassemble my razor blades.  It takes about 20 minutes for the parts to air-dry.  So, roughly, 30 minutes total.  Being as the razor is water-proof and can be used in the shower, waiting for the components to dry isn&#x27;t really necessary.  I just do it.  Again, after a cleaning, my shave is just as good as any safety razor shave I&#x27;ve ever had.o miss the pop-up feature of the original blade assembly.  But, upon figuring out the trick to disassembling, then reassembling the razor head, after cleaning, I&#x27;m not so sure that the design replacement head doesn&#x27;t allow for a better job of cleaning the razor blades.

    <li> This is a poor replacement for my shaver. I sent it back after a few weeks. It&#x27;s difficult to separate for cleaning and the plastic retainers keep coming loose. The worst part is the shave itself! I put the old one back on while I wait for the &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; replacement head and it shaves better!</li>
    <li> Thank you Norelco for giving me a chance to upgrade my 5 year old Arcitec shaver. I have been using this replacement head for a month. The shave is closer than the original and does an excellent job on my neck. It also glides over your skin much easier than the original. I was going to buy a new Panasonic shaver but figured I&#x27;d give the RQ12+ a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did. I will stick with Norelco for now and appreciate the fact that I don&#x27;t need to throw out a working shaver to upgrade to a better shave. I hope Norelco continues this trend.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used the new head yet, but have been using the razor for a few years now it is a great product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original head. It&#x27;s noisier and my opinion is that it doesn&#x27;t shave as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item. It is like shaving with a used axe head, JUNK. Philips Norelco you Stink!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper in quality than the original shaving head it was designed to replace. Shaver head keeps popping open when shaving, spilling &amp;#34;shavings&amp;#34; everywhere. Shaver head is half the price of a new shaver. Wether or not it was cost effective replacing the head will depend on how long it lasts. Only had it 1 month so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same as my original 3D razor. It doesn&#x27;t have all the pivot points. It&#x27;s like a 2D. Plus it pulls the hair in my face like it&#x27;s dull!</li>
    <li> Unacceptable product. Plastic ring that holds one of the blades in place must be tightened each time the razor is used and is very difficult to secure even with the enclosed tool. This began within the first week of use. This  product is too expensive to be malfunctioning as often as it does. I am considering purchasing a different brands of razor and ditching my Norelco.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads for the RQ12 total crap. These&lt;br /&gt;heads suck compare to the original heads. They won&#x27;t swing&lt;br /&gt;open for proper cleaning and the whole head drags like hell on&lt;br /&gt;the face. Totally crap. No stars for this crap.</li>
    <li> This replaces the RQ 12 (Minus the /62) and it is terrible. The regular RQ 12 has been in short supply and as a result everyone has raised the price to stupid levels.  I won&#x27;t pay it.  According to Norelco&#x27;s customer service dept., the RQ 12 (old style) is still being made(and has been on back order for several weeks)  and when more are available, hopefully the price will get back to non-stupid levels.  In addition to this new thing not shaving as well, it is a huge pain in the behind to clean compared to the old RQ 12.  In short, Norelco has &amp;#34;fixed a problem that didn&#x27;t exist) and in the process ruined a very good razor.</li>
    <li> I do not understand the negative reviews. I think this new head is smoother, shave faster, is easier to clean and does not spill shavings all over the place (on you shoulders...). I have one regret: to have read the bad reviews and have waited to buy this new head. I am very please with it and I think it works better than the old one ( even when it was new).</li>
    <li> Just as I expected factory perfect new item</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a replacement for my Arttec Razor.  I learned that Norelco no longer makes the replacement blade for my model.  In my continued search I learned that the RQ12+ is now the replacement bade for my razor.  It works great.  My shaves are much closer than with the old model.  Plus I saved a lot of money not having to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> this razor head shaved reasonably well, but it is poorly made. After two months I am having to buy new again.  Charging $60 is ridiculous and very disappointing because Norelco charges so much but fails to produce a high quality product.  I have been a Norelco user for over a decade.  When I first bought the Sensor Touch razor that I have now (4 years ago) it seemed to work well.  the blades lasted for almost a year and did a good job.  Im not sure what they are doing anymore, but their quality control has gone down the toilet.  No set of blades I have bought in the last two years (about 4 or 5 sets) have lasted more that 3 months.  I have to keep using them because I cant just keep buying $60 blades every two months.    This is not a one or two time problem but a consistent problem over years.  I will not buy another blade.  I will find another solution.  It is a dang shame that the company had gone to crap.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but Norelco has changed the blade and not for the better. First it hurt to shave then a few weeks later it went dual and dosn&#x27;t give you a close shave. Unless they come out with the old style of replacement head, don&#x27;t buy this, just go with a different brand. I used Norelco since I was shaving, about 28 years now and won&#x27;t be going back. Sorry</li>
    <li> I am the owner of a SensoTouch 3D 1250x shaver and needed replacement heads.  All these negative reviews and cries of cheap plastic had me worried, but I reasoned I could always return it if I was unhappy, which seemed more sensible than buying a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listed item has been changed from what previous reviewers received, as the replacement heads, which came in a box clearly marked as RQ12+, are not plastic at all, and are actually identical to the shaving heads for the new 9000 series shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the SensoTouch crowd, how are the new heads different from what we had before?  There&#x27;s slightly more rotation (&amp;#34;eight directions&amp;#34;) than with the RQ12 heads, though I can&#x27;t say it matters as I had no problem reaching tough spots before.  The new heads have slightly more space between them; in theory that means covering surface faster and finishing sooner, but in practice that leaves areas between blades uncut unless you keep making a circular motion on your face, so shaves aren&#x27;t any faster.  It&#x27;s also basically impossible to shave under your nose without using a trimmer, which I had been doing anyway.  While the 9000 series advertises a 30% closer shave, a week of daily use has shown no evidence of that for me; my facial hair is soft and not thick, so your results may vary.  The shave itself is as smooth as before, with none of the pulling and tugging others reported from the lesser version they were getting.  While I loved flipping the individual blade chambers open for cleaning the old heads, the new heads allow the top portion to be removed in one piece quite easily (but it always securely snaps in place for your next shave).  As a dry shaver I actually find the new heads easier to rinse out, though I&#x27;m not a big fan of then leaving the outer portion separate from the shaver so both can air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you own a SensoTouch 3D, I strongly recommend these replacement heads, and urge those who were unhappy with what they gotcirca September 2014 to try again.</li>
    <li> After having my old school head for over 2 years I figured it was time for a new set. To my amazement Norelco has changed the head completely and it is a whole new system. I reluctantly bought the new head and it installed easily. I gave this new head a chance for over two weeks. I have come to the conclusion that my old head (2 years plus old!) shaves my head and face closer and smoother than the new one, and much faster too.&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY disappointed in this 50+ dollar upgrade that&#x27;s useless. Thanks a lot Norelco. Guess I am switching to the Dollar shave club.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving head. Been using them for about 4 months and I feel the shave is better than the original blades. I have tried several shavers: from rotary to foil. In my opinion, the RQ12+ is smooth. A big improvement over the original RQ12 is that it holds the cut hair insides the blade assembly. When using the RQ12, hair would leak out the assembly, making a mess around the sink. The RQ12+ heads have a slight pivoting in each head, which make easier to shave the hard to get areas around the neck and jawline. Both, dry and wet shave are great and leave no burning. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> When I received mine one of the 3 heads was broken.</li>
    <li> Really bad. The old one this piece of junk replaced gives a better shave. Doesn&#x27;t cut, it pulls the hair out.</li>
    <li> sorry to see the old R12 model go .. but this somewhat works ... pulls at times ... after a few years ... heading to Braun 9 series ...</li>
    <li> Broke in 3 months, in addition to all the other problems</li>
    <li> Had an Arcitec, but it broke, more likely was dropped while charging, loved it so I bought the  Sensor 3D, 1250x.  Replaced original head with what was probably a Chinese knockoff.  Worked almost as good as original for about one year, then it broke.  Had a hard time figuring out which one to order RQ12 - 52, 62 or +.  Guessed the plus, surprised to see how radically different from the original.  Called norelco, said I got the right one and explained the design change. Been using for a few days now.  Not as convenient to clean as the original but a much better and faster shave.  Not sure why all the bad reviews.  This is a huge improvement.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> Not as good as the RQ12, I think the old design was easier to clean.  But this is ok. not horrible, but not the old design either.</li>
    <li> This replacement head doesn&#x27;t cut it.  It is noticeably inferior to the original head for the 1250x shaver.  I will be shopping for a better razor.</li>
    <li> After being unavailable for what seems like a year Norelco finally releases a replacement head ... at a ridiculous price. What the hell happened with the $30-$40 that was standard for all these years. Greedy, greedy, greedy. Wondering if I should return my razor to Costco (love those guys can return anything at anytime) and say screw it and go to Braun .. at least their replacements are at a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I love my norelco shaver. It gives a great shave. So if I need to replace these heads once a year or so, it&#x27;s worth it. This replacement set was different then the original. The three heads lift off rather then flip open as the originals did. But the heads work beautifully!</li>
    <li> Recently I purchased RQ12+ instead of RQ12. It didn&#x27;t meet my expectation.  Fit was okay but the Function and Form was terrible. And Quality sucks. I think Norelco is miss leading customer by selling RQ+ in place of RQ12. Norelco better provide original RQ12. .</li>
    <li> I would give negative stars if possible.  Worst replacement ever.  The only thing worse than the quality, is the closeness of the shave.  After 20+ years of using norelco, I need to find another option.  I really liked the old version.  Gave a much better shave.  Save your money and put it towards a different razor.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this replacement head because of the wide split in customer reviews. Finally decided to do it and I&#x27;m glad I did. It feels a bit different on the skin and it even sounds a bit different, but there&#x27;s no denying it produces a great shave. Is the review split because of personal preference or could it be luck of the draw? I don&#x27;t know, but I do know the one I received works very well for me.</li>
    <li> came in fast and saved money.</li>
    <li> I was finally ready for my third replacement head for my trusty 1250 razor and this time around, I couldn&#x27;t buy the exact same head and after reading the reviews of this one, I was very hesitant but didn&#x27;t have much choice. I stopped by local bed, bed and beyond and luckily they had one and it was priced wrong (54.95), so after the price mistake and their trusty 20% coupon, I walked out of the with the head for 45 bucks, quite a deal. I got home and just had to try it, and to my amazement, it did a much better job than the old heads ever did.  My beard grows quite fast and the hair is thick so it usually takes some time to get a close shave but with this head, it took half the time. I&#x27;m sold and very impressed with the new and definitely improved head. I guess some people had different results and I&#x27;m quite picky myself, but this head is great.</li>
    <li> It does not cut as well as the original blades but is easier to clean</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as the original. But it does a good job just not as close a shave.  The original head was very good but I just don&#x27;t understand why they had to create a new head that was not as good as the original. Did anyone in research and development ever use the new head and compare it to the original head before they decided to change it? Change is sometimes good but not always.</li>
    <li> This head works very well and have smooth running.</li>
    <li> Previous version/52 is user friendly, it allows for easy cleaning. The current version/62 falls short on this much needed aspect. In order to clean it, user has to seperate top portion from bottom portion of razor head then use supplied orange tool to remove heads. The possible major design change is Phillips is allowing the user to replace the razor heads instead of whole pod. or to just allow the head cleaner solution  to clean the heads? I prefer to rinse the /52 then use the solution. I will either to end up looking for a /52 replacement head or replace my 1290 razor with another Norelco or Braun. UPDATE: The shave is closer and cleaner with the /62 than with the /52. I will provide another update when I have more uses with the /62.</li>
    <li> This is the new replacement for the Norelco RQ12 head.  I was hesitant about purchasing since the part number was not the same so called Norelco and was assured it would work.  It was a great purchase, not only did it fit it seems to shave closer and has a better retention of whiskers.  The great part is the blades are now replaceable without buying a whole new head.  It was packaged well and received  as promised by Amazon even though it was a preorder.  As usual shopping with Amazon is great.</li>
    <li> I love my Norelco razor. I rave about it to friends and others all the time. Its great! I hadn&#x27;t replaced my shaving head in almost 2 years so I figured I&#x27;d snag this one, knowing how much I love the razor and the shave it provides. Wow. Just wow. I don&#x27;t even know how to describe the drop in quality of this razor! Gone is the smooth shave that I loved and in its place is a rough cheap piece of plastic that requires almost double the time to get things done. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this new razor head and I hope that Norelco does something about it or else I will be forced to go with another razor.</li>
    <li> When I saw that the old RQ12 shave heads were getting short in supply and the price started creeping up, I bought every RQ12 selling for a decent price that I could get my hands on.  When I saw recently that Amazon was carrying these new RQ12+ (RQ12/62) heads for under $50, I decided to order on to test/compare to my RQ12 head that I recently loaded on to my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impressions.  First and most noticeable:  the new RQ12+ units are LOUD!!!  I use my razor to trim my ear hairs, and that RQ12+ is MUCH louder than the older RQ12s.  The new RQ12+ head also feels/looks to be thicker and more bulks.  I don&#x27;t know for sure that the new RQ12+ heads are cheaply made, but the tolerances of the moving pieces for the new RQ12+ heads are certainly larger than the older RQ12 heads.  I suspect because of this the blades in the new RQ12+ head will start pulling my whiskers out with wear on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the new head is definitely different, as others have pointed out.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s any more difficult overall - perhaps a bit more work to do the daily rinsing, and a bit less work to do a deep clean.  One thing that I noticed, however, is that the cost to purchase the foils and cutters (part no. SH90) is currently VIRTUALLY THE SAME PRICE as the whole new RQ12+ (RQ12/62) head that pops on top of your razor ($47.52 for the SH90 versus $47.92 for the RQ12/62 - though neither is currently in stock).  This being Amazon, prices will no doubt jump up and down - however it makes no sense that the foils/cutters aren&#x27;t much cheaper, in the $30 price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to pop the new RQ12+ head back in its box and continue using the older RQ12 heads as long as they last...</li>
    <li> Was not the same head as the original even though it fits.</li>
    <li> 3 stars is spot on for this product.  It&#x27;s good in some aspects and falls short in others.  Replacing the head itself was a snap.  Cleaning is easier now, as the entire top section pops off and you can rinse it out (plus, I use the jet cleaner).  And everyday shaves are just as good as they were with the original head (might work a little bit harder).  Where it falls really flat tho is when I don&#x27;t shave every day.  Previously, I&#x27;d let the weekend go by and not touch my razor (unless I had something going on) and come Sunday night or Monday morning my heavy bread would be no match for my razor.  Not so much now.  I had to bust out the manual backup I keep handy to take care of 2 days growth this past weekend (my first with the new head).  It hardly seemed like it was able to do anything.  So it looks like I&#x27;ll be shaving everyday now (which sucks) and thus results in the 3 star - it&#x27;s ok rating</li>
    <li> Was Perfect will differently buy again perfect upgrade from 2-d phillips norelco</li>
    <li> Easy to replace.  Better than originals.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco user for years.  Sadly, because of this cheap, substandard replacement head, I will never again purchase a Norelco product.  I contacted their corporate customer service to inquire, and had nothing to offer as far as going back to the old replacement head (RQ12).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of shave for this is not even close to the old style razor.  Very unfortunate.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They took the simplest head replacement and turned it into a nightmare. My hands are literally bleeding.</li>
    <li> I called Philips/Norelco today because the charge indicator lights were failing on my year-old 1255x 3D shaver. The rep said he would send me a new body (1250). We set up the exchange.&lt;br /&gt;Then I asked him where I could get the best deal on a new replacement head. He of course sugggested his site, but he was emphatic to search for the new RQ12+ head. Then I read all of the reviews on Amazon and even on the Philips site. 90% of the reviews were negative. So I got on online chat with Philips to cancel my exchange order so they didn&#x27;t waste their money, since I was going to switch brands and get the Braun currently on sale at costco.&lt;br /&gt;I am posting the transcript of our session. The CSR was very nice. And the text contains lots of typos because we were typing fast, plus our responses got out of order since we were both typing at the same time. After learning that I was abandoning their brand, I&#x27;m somewhat surprised that he didn&#x27;t offer to send me a free or heavily discounted RQ12+ head to try.&lt;br /&gt;Chat session follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chat started!&lt;br /&gt;David: Hello Jim. How may I help you?&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Hi David,&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Can you get in touch with Thomas in the midwest who helped me to initiate an exchange today. I want to cancel the exchange.&lt;br /&gt;David: Jim, I am sorry I am not clear on what you are asking. Would you please provide more details?&lt;br /&gt;Jim: The email I got has this info: Order Confirmation # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. My 1255x had the battery charge fail. He is going to send me a 1250 body.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Sorry: battery charge LIGHT&lt;br /&gt;David: Oh, okay.&lt;br /&gt;David: Please allow me a moment to check this for you.&lt;br /&gt;David: Thank you for waiting Jim.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: The reason I want to cancel is to save you money. He told me to buy the RQ12+ replacement head (it&#x27;s been a year), but 90% of the reviews say the new head is horrible and seems like a downgrade. Rather than spend a lot of money on the new head, I&#x27;m just going to switch brands and get the Braun on sale at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;David: I am sorry to hear that Jim.&lt;br /&gt;David: The reviews posted on various social networking platforms may indicate a lesser favorable user friendly image of the product. However, these reviews are completely independent and hence a true picture of the quality cannot be derived from those comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David: Just to make sure, you want to cancel the replacement order?&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Yeah, but at $65, I don&#x27;t want to experiment and lose the money.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Sorry, I was writing. Yes, please cancel the order, since I will be replacing the entire shaver.&lt;br /&gt;David: Jim, we can offer you 15% off on your total purchase along with free shipping on opur Online Store.&lt;br /&gt;David: I really apologize for your recent experience.&lt;br /&gt;David: Jim, I will go ahead and cancel the order for you.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: That&#x27;s still $52 I would be out. I tend to research products very carefully, and the head is disparaged on many sites.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: OK, thanks. sorry, we&#x27;re both typing at the same time, so messages get crossed&lt;br /&gt;David: Jim, I understands your conc ern and I really apologize for the same.&lt;br /&gt;David: understand*&lt;br /&gt;David: Is there anything else I can help you with while you have me here?&lt;br /&gt;Jim: No, thanks very much. But hopefully you can pass on my, and other people&#x27;s comments.&lt;br /&gt;David: Jim, I will definately pass this message to the concern team as we have lose our valued customer. I assure you that we will try to serve you with the best products in near future.&lt;br /&gt;Jim: Thanks. This has been the best electric wet/dry shaver I have ever used, so I am extremely disappointed that Philips has made an inferior replacement which still costs a lot of money. You can sign off now. Many thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;David: I appreciate your patience and understanding.&lt;br /&gt;David: It was nice chatting with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David: Thank you for contacting Philips Consumer Lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David: Bye!&lt;br /&gt;Chat is closed by agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Kind Regards,&lt;br /&gt;PhilipsConsumer Care</li>
    <li> Not quite sure , but seems to do as good a job as the blades it replaces</li>
    <li> cheap made, way short of original ones</li>
    <li> Just to let you all know you can buy the Generic version of the original&#x27; one that we all like so much and works better than the new replacement so you do not have to take the whole head apart too clean.  Work&#x27;s Great.  Check out E-Bay 36.00 dollars for the Generic version of the original one that came with the 3d sensotouch 8000 series.  And as well free shipping.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.  I am just updating to let you know about the Generic version of the real shaver head that came with the 3d sensotouch 8000 series.  It is so much better than the rq+ replacement that you have to take the whole head apart.  I am just updating has been working great and holding a good sharp edge still.  The best part is only cost $36.00 with free shipping on eBay.  I am glad I did my research on this.  Because it flexes like the original one does the best.  So it gives you a closer shave and does not catch and pull hair.  I just wanted to keep you updated on this Generic version.  It is working GREAT!  I like this version just  the original you can take each one and open it and clean it very well without taking the whole head apart.  This is the best way to go.  Here is the link if you would like to give it a shot.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hot-for-PHILIPS-NORELCO-RQ12-1250-1280-Razor-HEADS-replacement-fits-for-RQ10RQ11/321490978186?_trksid&#x3D;p2045573.c100033.m2042&amp;_trkparms&#x3D;aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D28797%26meid%3Dcc713fac0e514e01b647ab7f941b958f%26pid%3D100033%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26mehot%3Dag%26sd%3D321490978186</li>
    <li> Great product, much better than the original head</li>
    <li> This head is much better than the original shaving head that came with my Arcitec, so I really don&#x27;t get many of the poor reviews it&#x27;s received. I like my Arcitec shaver quite a lot, but even from the beginning I thought they had moved away from actual &amp;#34;floating heads&amp;#34;, but it worked pretty well anyway. When I popped on the new RQ12+ heads I immediately thought, &amp;#34;floating heads are back!&amp;#34; These just shave better than the older version, and I can feel the difference. The fact that they come completely apart for cleaning is also a significant improvement over the older heads that just hinged up, but didn&#x27;t come apart.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the one what cutter heads flip up.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to clean.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> OK for replacing your blades of your Norelco 8000 series</li>
    <li> Works well so far, not as silent as the original.</li>
    <li> The original head for the this model razor was great. However, this newer model head doesn&#x27;t even begin to give a shave let alone a close shave.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why there are bad reviews about this product. This new replacement really is an improvement. still giving a close shave without irritation! Now it is also easier to clean! buy it, you will not regret</li>
    <li> OK, but not great.  Kind of expensive in my opinion. Outer head shell has been changed significantly from the one that came with the shaver. The outer heads (not the cover) are now plastic and not stainless steel so the head doesn&#x27;t slide across my beard as smoothly as the original one, especially if its a little humid and the skin is a little moist. Also, cleaning isn&#x27;t as quick and easy as the original head that came with the unit. Lastly, it has a little trouble shaving the skin in the slight depression between my adams apple and the outside of my neck. The old one did a better job there. Otherwise it shaves pretty well. I think a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; or C+ is a fair judgement all things considered. If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I&#x27;d have given it a B.  -One other caveat. I&#x27;ve only had the new one a month. It remains to be seen if it holds up and cuts well for a year like the original all metal one did. Also, I have not tried wet shaving of any sort with it and probably won&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reasoning for the production of this faulty replacement head.  Esthetically it doesn&#x27;t match the rest of the $250 razor I shelled out my money for, but that&#x27;s not the important part.  The range of mobility has been ruined from the original 3D design, and it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as closely.  Perhaps Norelco is on the verge of releasing a new $500.00 razor and wants to annoy everyone with their 1250/1280 razors for a while so that they will jump at the chance to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not me, buddy.  That is the only possible reason I can think of that Philips would have done this -- to make their 3D razors obsolete so that they can sell a NEW batch of overpriced products.  I&#x27;ll just go back to blades, I guess.  I feel like a sucker.</li>
    <li> Horrible product!  Not the same as the original head at all!!</li>
    <li> philips norelco has blown it with this product.  the original RQ12 was great (no longer available).  The RQ12+ is GARBAGE.  Because it is garbage it has forced me to buy a competitor&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco since 1971.  Until now.  I won&#x27;t bore you by repeating what other one star ratings have said.  I&#x27;m all about premium shavers with cleaning EASE like the RQ12 replacement head.  The idea of disassembly with a special tool and dealing with separate blades is just nuts for a premium shaver.  I have the Norelco 3D 1260 and would expect a hell of a lot better , especially considering the costs.  My fix for the problem? The Braun 799cc.  Great shave and the ultimate in cleaning ease.  Goodby Norelco, it is sad that after so many years, you have decided to treat me like an ignorant moron who has no alternatives.</li>
    <li> The short of it, they replaced a quality head for a very expensive electric razor with junk.  Within 2 weeks of purchasing the RQ12+, one of the plastic clips (poorly) designed to hold in the blades no longer does it&#x27;s job.  After an additional month, a second blade clip followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will crazy glue the parts in place and when the blades are done working I will go to Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.  I was a very big Philips/Norelco user for the past decade.  This low quality for the price of the original unit proves that cost savings beats out quality for these companies.</li>
    <li> No where near as good as the original shaver head. Find it pulls hair out instead cutting it. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Yes, works good for me!</li>
    <li> The item fits my needs perfectly.  My shaver works better than ever, and at a reasonable price.  All in line with shopping at AMAZON.</li>
    <li> do not last as long as the original that came on the razor</li>
    <li> Shaves well. Would have rated higher but the head came off while shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product--easy to clean, close shave!!!</li>
    <li> Replacement head is not as solid as the former replacement head. Pulls a little on heavy beard. Blades are sharp and cut well.</li>
    <li> good value to update shaver.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews posted here, I decided to end my 30-year use of Norelco rotary razors.  I&#x27;m very disappointed to read that the new Norelco head is the equivalent of the previous version after a year of use.  I purchased the Panasonic LA-63 ---- after a week of use I believe the foil heads are fully equivalent.</li>
    <li> There have been many negative reviews of these heads, mostly in comparison with the original replacement RQ12 heads.  I find that cleaning these are actually much easier than the previous model once you master the easy task of pulling the assembly apart.  Rinsing under running water is quick and effective, much quicker than having to hinge open each individual blade assembly as was the case previously.  HOWEVER, these heads are noisy indicating to me that the tolerances are not good--parts are rubbing that shouldn&#x27;t.  Quality of the shave seems about the same, but I have had trouble over the past couple years with my neck whiskers and often run a multi-blade conventional razor over that area.  This new head doesn&#x27;t seem either better or worse than the previous one.</li>
    <li> These new heads are not as good as the one they made where you could individually lift each razor head.  They don&#x27;t shave as good and don&#x27;t feel as smooth either.</li>
    <li> They changed the design and it seems to work great so far.</li>
    <li> Extremely bad replacement!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised!</li>
    <li> Invested in the shaver for the wrong company.  Quality went downhill and I feel betrayed.  I&#x27;m due for an upgrade and I&#x27;ll be reevaluating my loyalty with Philips.</li>
    <li> Fits my old razor that came with a smaller head.  this head covers more area and does a better job in less time.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> husband was ready to &#x27;toss&#x27; rasor ... got this and it&#x27;s like a brand new razor ...</li>
    <li> Gives a clean shave and very easy to a quick clean by running under faucet. A detailed clean with solution is also god.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Please bring back the original RQ12 replacement head. The new head is clearly designed for lower cost. The three heads no longer flip up for cleaning. You must remove the entire system from the shaver. This of course loosens the attachment mechanism. The shave is no where near as smooth. I&#x27;d say a shave with a fully charged Philips Norelco 1290X/46 Shaver 8800 using the RQ12+ at 8:00am yields a shave that feels like the original RQ12 about 7 hours after shaving. No kidding. It&#x27;s that bad. I go over and over and over the same areas. I&#x27;ve tried it dry. I&#x27;ve tried it wet. I&#x27;ve tried it hot. Nothing comes close to the original RQ12 blades. I&#x27;m not sure what the + is suppose to stand for; but I could offer some guesses. It just wouldn&#x27;t be polite to list them here. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is I&#x27;m very disappointed with Philips Norelco. After all these years, I&#x27;m back to shopping for a totally different brand.</li>
    <li> My original head purchased with the product two years ago gives a slightly better shave.  The price of the razor replacement heads (esp. the quality of this one) for my SensoTouch 3D almost a use and replace Item.  Good thing I did not throw it out the original head.</li>
    <li> Good replacement, however the quality of closeness and smoothness of the shave is not as good as the original head and blades...</li>
    <li> Works great don&#x27;t know what others are complaining about?</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blades produce the worst saving experience I have had in 20 years of using Norelco shaving products.  Shame on you Norelco for even bringing them to market.  In my book, these blades are an epic failure of engineering, production and marketing.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Norelco customer for over 40 years and have used the RQ12&lt;br /&gt;+ for about 2 weeks. The redesigned replacement blade assembly is clearly cost reduced (for Phillips) and quality reduced for the customer. I had purchased its predecessor the RQ12 and it performed much like the original. Someone on the development team should have actually used the RQ12+ before foisting on customers. At this point Norelco/Phillips needs to prove it actually cares about the customer experience. My suggestion would be to offer a full refund and a credit toward a new shaver. If the response is silence, my promise is that I will be someone else’s customer for the next 40 years.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco pulled a bait and switch. This is totally different from the old head design and this new one stings and burns my face. I get better results using my 2 year old cartridge. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Orange plastic blade holders VERY difficult to insert so that they stay. Blades come loose as I am shaving. Have to add 5-10 minutes or more to my shave in the morning to try and get the blades inserted firmly again, and then wait till the next day to see if that worked.&lt;br /&gt;No problems with original metal assembly. Wash it with hot water after every shade and remove blades and wash with alcohol once a week. That worked great. This is terrible.</li>
    <li> I agree with most of the users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shaving head to save time on the way to work. The way it is designed is sub-par compared to the original Senso3d. I have to run my razor over the same portion of my face over a dozen times before it gets any where close to being acceptable. I had the original SensoTouch3d for over two years and loved it. I&#x27;m not sure what pisses me off more, the fact my old razor doesn&#x27;t work or the fact I paid 60 bucks for this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely disappointing that a quality product turns into absolute garbage. Congrats big business!</li>
    <li> This new design is cheap plastic and rotors popped out in two weeks of use...</li>
    <li> I prefer the previous design. looks and feels cheap, and high priced for a most plastic piece. Only worked ok for 5 months.  today I placed the original head in the shaver, and the shave is much more better with the old model. I will change my shaver soon, and I´m seriously thinking on returning to Braun because of the cheap head on Philips shavers. Is a crap, and is the one integrated with the new models.</li>
    <li> I was hesitating to buy the RG12+ because of the negative reviews on it, after a lot of thinking I decided to buy it for two reasons which are  the the RQ 12&#x27;s price is ridiculously high, and since Philipps stopped manufacturing the RQ12, that means it will be out of the market sooner or later.&lt;br /&gt;I got the RQ12+ like 3 weeks ago, and I use it on a daily basis, I use it to chave my head, and my beard. I like this one better than the RQ12 !! Why???!!!. First the RQ12+ gives closer shave. The way I shave even with RQ12 by doing two rounds of shaving, I did two rounds of shaving with RQ12+ on my haed and the result was closer shave than the RQ12. ( My tow round of shaving  is by shaving in two directions top to bottom and left to right and then on the second round by going on the oppposit directions bottom to top and right to left.). Second the RQ12+ is easy to clean, it comes with a tool that let you dissassmble the blades and clean them if you want to, but clean it with water without dissassembling works just fine, to get easier and better cleaning I recomend using shaving foam instead of shaving gel.</li>
    <li> This works great and it is easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Useless piece of junk replacement head. I shaved with this thing for over half an hour and it would not catch the hair most of the time for one, and when it did it left major stubble behind. I fished my old razor head out of the garbage and completed my shave in 5 minutes after trying the replacement for over half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what is wrong with this thing but I tried it both wet and dry shaving and both gave terrible results. Both times I ended up switching back to my 12+ month old shaving head to finish the job in a fraction of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, DO NOT BUY this piece of junk!</li>
    <li> Excellent product replacement for my old RQ-10. Shaves closer and is easier to empty.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he actually really likes them. (He&#x27;ll be giving a more in depth review later) He says that the only reason he wouldn&#x27;t give it 4 stars is because of all the plastic, but he also says that he doesn&#x27;t get it as to why so many are giving it such terrible reviews since he&#x27;s getting a shave that&#x27;s just as close as he got with the previous (all metal) RQ12 head he was replacing. He is overall very impressed and very satisfied with this item and says he&#x27;ll have no qualms about buying it when he needs to replace his shavers head. So for all the doubters, I&#x27;d tell you to go ahead and try these because if they can satisfy my hubby then they should be just fine for anyone else out there.</li>
    <li> does not seam to be sharp will not last 12 months</li>
    <li> Seems a lot cheaper in quality than the head it replaced.  I think I will retain the original head and just replace its blades;  that seems a much better option.</li>
    <li> I dreaded switching to the RQ12+ as my RQ12 (no plus) was wearing out.  That&#x27;s because of all the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, dear readers, I have a good review.  I am getting a better shave with the Plus.  The metal over the blades is thinner, so the blades are closer to my skin.  I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting used to this.  Daily cleaning is different -- not worse, just different.  I pop the head covering/blades off and rinse them, then I rinse the rest of the head.  No big deal and not terribly changed from the way I cleaned the no-plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;ll give this a 9.  Overall, I&#x27;ll still give the razor a 10, and it&#x27;s now 4 years old.</li>
    <li> so much more superior to the blades that came with my Arcitec shaver</li>
    <li> Very cheap replacement for rq12 which made my sensotouch 3d an excellent razor, have tried 2 of these, they pull hair and don&#x27;t shave very close on neck. I have contacted Norelco and they stated this is a better product and will not change back to originals thagt came with my great razor which now is a paperweight. I switched to Braun which isn&#x27;t as good as my original 3d but better than the rq12+ blades.</li>
    <li> I disagree with all the negative reviews of this shaver head replacement. In comparing it to the original, it&#x27;s better in every way:&lt;br /&gt;1. Closer shaves with less pulling&lt;br /&gt;2. Far easier to clean with the new system, where you remove the entire head, rather than lifting the individual heads.&lt;br /&gt;3. Made in the Netherlands guys! How many electronic parts do you know of that are NOT made in China?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A resounding 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Not as good as my original head</li>
    <li> Thanks Philips!! ...and Amazon, of course!!</li>
    <li> Awesome cost-benefit!!&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean and replace!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely deserves my five stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * *</li>
    <li> Good razor heads. After using the old head for a year you sort of get use to a degraded shave then you pop in the new head and say &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;.  Using this replacement Norelco head for 4 months I have to modify my review. The first month of use this unit worked great but now after 4 months I had to put my old head back in because the replacement unit did NOT shave close at all. I will not use this new type again and do not recommend the item to anyone, It was suppose to be good for a year and the original one was good for a year and will still use it until I find a complete head.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is resulting in lot of cuts. It is not too easy to move around. Its wore compared to original head that comes with the shaver.</li>
    <li> These blades are a terrible replacement for my Senso Touch 3d. Apparently Phillips stopped making the original blades, because I have had a hard time finding them and when I do, they are freakishly expensive.  But this replacement is TERRIBLE.  It pulls hairs, it is not smooth, it doesn&#x27;t have the same position on my face.  I don&#x27;t know what Philips was thinking with this replacement, but I would not purchase a Senso Touch 3d today with this as the only replacement blade.  Absolutely awful.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are hard to find, but they were easily found here.  They work well.  Only need to replace once a year.  The blades do a great job and give the user the closest shave possible, even better than a traditional razor, in  my opinion.  I have used electric razors fro a long time and the performance of these blades are the best I have had in my 25 plus years of using these kinds of products.-</li>
    <li> Does not cut very well and pulls the hairs. Not nearly as good as the old style head.</li>
    <li> JUNK!  Very poor shave, totally unlike the original head.  Poor design, MADE IN HUNGARY...maybe designed there.  I begin to wonder if new brains are trying to run Norelco.  I have used a Norelco every morning since 1960.  I hate to see the technology go backwards.  Here to fore, the newer generations have all been improvements to me.</li>
    <li> Very bad replacement, bought it on July 30th and the blades are very dull and is really unusable.</li>
    <li> Fit razor perfectly shaves cleanly</li>
    <li> Works on the razor just fine.  Does not fit when razor is put into the travel case.</li>
    <li> Really good upgrade to a nice electric razor.</li>
    <li> WoW, this is dramatically improved shaver head from previous model. Clean and fast. Remember to look for the latest shaver head replacement \\&quot; RQ12 plus\\&quot;--&gt;$50 price range</li>
    <li> On the plus side, it does give you a closer shave... If you can stand the pulling and stabbing during the shave and the really annoying cleaning process at the end. Overall a definite downgrade from the previous, which was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have noticed that it pulls hair a lot more, to the point that it sometimes hurt (different shaving gel makes a huge difference with this head whereas the older one did not care).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the blades have tiny gaps between them that the hair get stuck into. This causes two things: 1). every time the blade spins around the hair that is sticking out stabs you; 2). You need a tweezer to clean them out. This takes 10 minutes to do as there are many many blades... The head this replaces used to take 2 minutes to clean!</li>
    <li> My skin hurts when I use this, the shaving is not as smooth as the original one.</li>
    <li> Somewhat worse than the original.  I really liked the original RQ12 head. The replacement is not quite as nice.  Quality of the shave is about the same, definitely not a big improvement Philips claims. But the new head pulls hairs, making the shave less comfortable. The new head pivot range is reduced compared to the old one; this increases shaving time. I also like the feel and the sound of the old head better, feels more substantial and upscale.  I really liked that the original head flips open and stays connected to the base. I can wash the head without getting my hands wet and stand the shaver to dry with the head open. The new one disconnects for cleaning. My hand gets wet when I wash the head, and I need to lay it down to dry separately from the handle.  Looks like Philips switched to a cheaper and inferior design while keeping the price the same. The annoying part is that Philips pulls a bait and switch, as the original head is no longer made, and one has to settle for an inferior replacement. For this reason I will be reluctant to buy Philips products in the future.  UPDATE 2/6/2015  After using RQ12+ for two months, I stand by my earlier assessment. The save quality is similar to RQ12. I am comparing shave quality to that of the original SensoTouch 3D head RQ12. Some people who report better shave quality compare it to the original Arcitec head, which makes sense to me, but I disagree with those who claim that RQ12+ gives a much better shave than RQ12 (when new and sharp).  RQ12+ looses to the original RQ12 in several areas:  * pulls longer hair * less convenient to clean and dry * smaller range of head motion * less pleasant to use: cheaper look, feel, and sound  July 2015 update: reducing my rating to one star because of stability issues. The original head lasted over a year. The new one needs blade replacement after six months.</li>
    <li> I think that this replacement head is giving me a closer, better shave than the original!</li>
    <li> What happened to the original? why  is so expensive now? I did pay $48.36 for a head replacement and now the price is $163????&lt;br /&gt;Why, Why, Whyyyyyyy this is ridiculous.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This replacement head can not be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;The old RQ12 rotors lift up so they could be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;This model does not.&lt;br /&gt;If somebody could explain to me how to clean this please!!!</li>
    <li> these are no way near as good as the real blades.</li>
    <li> Poor design for cleaning. cheap quality of the head. compared to original head for 3D flex shaver, this is a fail.&lt;br /&gt;Poor shave.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy Norelco again after being with them for close to 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;R&amp;D team requires re-boot</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t by this junk.  One star is generous for this complete garbage replacement for the original RQ12.  Horrible shave.  It&#x27;s like dry shaving with a rusty kitchen knife.  My 1280 was the best razor I had ever used, but thanks to the super cheapening of the &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; replacement head, my $99 travel razor is now much better.  What a mistake by Phillips, just greedy and turned a great product into a cheap piece of plastic.  Very disappointed.  Just my 1280 is pretty much an expensive piece of junk now.  The head makes the razor, if anyone over at Phillips is even reading these reviews!</li>
    <li> I reluctantly purchased this, The reviews it received were mostly horrible, I use my Norelco 1250 everyday for not only my face but shaving my head as well, as well as some other much more sensitive areas. I can tell you this is the best, closest, smoothest and least irritating shaving head I&#x27;ve ever had, period. As far as the cleanup it is easy, yes it doesn&#x27;t flip up anymore but frankly I don&#x27;t care. I like this that much. It is not difficult to remove the top for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco got this right, while I thought the original was terrific, this is even better.&lt;br /&gt;As well all of my shaving is dry.</li>
    <li> I used this for two months and the original is far superior. This pulls and isn&#x27;t as comfortable as original. 30% closer shave? YEA RIGHT! This is clearly cheaper for them to manufacture. What a way to show your appreciation to loyal customers Philips!</li>
    <li> Did not know entire head has to be removed for cleaning.</li>
    <li> The big label on the box says RQ12+, but on the bottom by the barcode it is identified as RQ 12/62, still made in the Netherlands.  This is the same Shaving head used on the new top of the line Philips Norelco 9700 series.    The main difference in the new series is a 3 speed setting base with enhanced digital setting displays.  Kudos to Philips for offering the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; head for older models like the SensoTouch 3D and the arcitec. Whether it is better that the old RQ 12/52, only time will tell.  The Philips Norelco upgrade from the SpeedXL&#x27;s to the Arcitec, was a disaster, with shave quality going down, according to most Consumer magazine reviews.  I kept my SpeedXL with the HQ9 three row heads, until I saw the SensoTouch 3D getting good reviews.    Here are my observations on the RQ12+.      I thought the new head was noisy, until I firmly pressed the head onto the base, now the noise is about like the old head.      The shave seems about the same, but like all Norelco&#x27;s it will take about 2 weeks for the blades/cutters to properly seat in the combs.  I&#x27;ll update my opinion after the break-in period.      The top portion with the three cutting heads can be easily removed or unsnapped from any of the three sides.  You DON&#x27;T NEED TO REMOVE the individual blades to clean the head.  Just tap it if dry shaving or rinse it if wet shaving.      Just because you could easily remove the blades from the old 3D, didn&#x27;t mean you should.  Historically Norelco shavers have used plastic retaining rings to hold their cutting heads in place and it looks like they have returned to this concept.  As in days of old, you will use the included orange tool to replace the three individual heads (SH90) rather than the entire head assembly.      I like the new pivot assembly, where the 3 silver rings pivot rather that the old black plastic head sections. It feels &amp; works the same in terms of shaving.  Look at the Philips Norelco 9700 series on Amazon if you want a detailed look at the new head.      Finally a comment about dry shaving, from a guy that has been doing it for a long time, from Remington Rand slot heads to Braun foils to these wonderful rotaries.  Dry shaving is very convenient if done right.  Wash your face with soap &amp; water to remove skin oils &amp; plump the hairs with moisture.  Wait 5 to 10 minutes for your skin to really dry out before shaving.  I use the period to make my morning coffee etc.  I know wet shaving is nice, but if I&#x27;m going to use foam or a gel, I&#x27;d just as soon use a razor blade.        Hope this info is helpful for all of you considering this replacement head.    UPDATE: After 3 weeks use, these blades have broken in nicely.  Shave is even better!</li>
    <li> Replacement heads are not near as good as original RQ12, and is a lot harder to clean</li>
    <li> These are very good blades. I still have problems in certain areas, but over all are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that you no longer have to buy the entire head and can just replace the blades themselves.</li>
    <li> The RQ12+ does not give a close shave.  It leaves short stubble.  Philips Norelco stated that I need to wait one month for the cutters to sharpen to provide a close shave.  I waited and this never happened.  Without a quality shaver blade the Norelco 1200 series shaver is now dead weight.  I purchased the 1160X shaver and the RQ11 blade provides a close clean shave.  I am satisfied with the RQ11, but hope that Philips Norelco does not foul this up with a cheaper replacement head like the RQ12+ has turned out to be.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this blade replacement.</li>
    <li> Much better than the previous rq12. More effective and doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
    <li> relatively easy to install and works well.</li>
    <li> works better than the original</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace heads on 3d senso touch. I didn&#x27;t think shave could get much better but it did. These blades are amazing !  closer, faster &amp; more comfortable.</li>
    <li> These heads replace the ones that came with the series 8000 shaver.  They are plenty sharp but are much harder to clean.  How that will affect performance by the end of their useful life is hard to predict but the design change is not good.  These are the only replacement blades currently made, however, and are cheaper than an entirely new razor.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as bad as some of the reviews here make it sound.  I actually like the way this one comes apart for cleaning better than the original head.  It is also much better at actually catching the shavings instead of making a huge mess like the original.</li>
    <li> Perfect needed it really bad</li>
    <li> No good as original set.</li>
    <li> It was a complete replacement head. It appears that the original design has changed.</li>
    <li> Noisy. Heads float and do not cut.!</li>
    <li> This replacement a poor imitation of original head . This part works but not soo good and you´ll never get a good shaving</li>
    <li> Definitely not as durable as the original.  How ever it&#x27;s 50% cheaper than the original.  My first shave was so close that I got a slight raiser burn. It&#x27;s cheaper and shaves closer than the original head.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head every morning. Works perfect.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical given some reviews.  I too was hoping to purchase the previous version of this replacement head.  But, having used this product for more than 3 months I can say that my fears were unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of the blades is as excellent as what they replaced.  It&#x27;s true that the spindles are made of plastic now, as opposed to metal, as are the blade housings, but the plastic is good quality and strong.  I daily remove the blade cover plate to clean the head and I have not noticed any issues nor has there been any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were pleased with your shaver using the factory heads, you&#x27;ll find the same results with this replacement.  In my case I believe performance has even improved.</li>
    <li> Like the shave, haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet.</li>
    <li> I first reviewed this  item over a year ago when I purchased a replacement head.  I just purchased another set at the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested replacement  date. Again, I was doubtful about paying the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; price for these replacement heads. I read all the  reviews and wondered if something had changed. But I like my Arcitec and decided to try it again. Good decision. In my earlier review (a year ago), I complained about the missing cleaning tool. This  package included  the plastic tool used to disassemble the head for  thorough cleaning.. I have been using the  shaving head for about  a month now and the shave is even better that I recall from a year  ago. Perhaps the manufacturer&#x27;s estimated life of one year is overly optimistic.  Read the  directions carefully and clean as directed. I run  the  shaver head under warm water (with the shaver  running) and then remove the head and rinse both parts of the assembly. About once  a week, I take the  head fully apart  and rinse.   I have tried  using the shaver both before and after showering. If you have time, I think the  shaver works best an hour after showering.</li>
    <li> The new head is pretty good. I like&lt;br /&gt;Pop up heads are better.</li>
    <li> Compared to the original design this replacement is not what I would have expected from Phillips.  They have taken there primier razor and made it much less desirable.  The replacement is cheaply made and does not allow users to clean the device as easily as the original nor does it provide as good a shave.  There appears to be no alternative the original parts cost has now exceed the cost of a new shaver.  At dome point I will give this razor up and try a Braun or similar shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I think Phillips screwed up to Dave a few cents on the replacement heads and I think it will cost them.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with these replacement blades! Some other reviews give this a bad rap and I don&#x27;t understand why. I think they cut as good if not better then the original blades that came with the razor. I was confused at first that Norelco changed the style and could not fine the original blades. I found them at extremely high priced! and again, didn&#x27;t know why. Then I searched eBay and found the same thing, so I decided to buy the blades that are made in China for $26.00.They looked almost like the original blades so I went for it. Wow, what a mistake! They just wouldn&#x27;t cut for crap! had to keep going over and over to get somewhat of a shave! So, I went to Amazon and took a chance on these blades and what a difference!!! Please don&#x27;t hesitate on buying these replacement blades to fit your &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Norelco Senso Touch 3D razor! Trust me they CUT GREAT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have read almost all of the customer reviews, especially the negative ones, for about 2 months,  I was very confused and discouraged.  I first ordered an after market RQ12 for about 35.00.  It was terrible.  So I ordered the RQ12+ for about 54.00.  Have used it about 10 times.  NO PROBLEM.  It  shaves smoothly and without irritation.  I am pleased with it. (purchased one for my son).  It cleans easily by just removing the head.  When these blades need replacing, I&#x27;II order the SH90 blade kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new RQ12+ head is different but shaves as well, if not better, than the old RQ12.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> The description of this item does not full indicate it is a total redesign of the original 12/52 shaver head.  It takes almost 3x longer to shave an area because you have to keep going over the same place to cut all the hair away, it tugs on the hair, and does not clean anywhere near as easy as the original.  This is a total deal breaker for this shaver system for me.  I switched almost three years ago from a Braun foil shaver to the Norelco system and loved it for the closeness and contour hugging shave, but with the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; replacement head I will be looking for an new shaving system that is not Norelco.  This is a clear case of &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; to improve margins on an item that sacrifices end user quality and functionality.</li>
    <li> Not as convenient to clean heads as original</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work half as good as the original shaver head.  Cheap.</li>
    <li> NOT an improvement over the old heads, particular towards the back of the face just in front of the ears. Their products, while touted to better and revolutionary, actually are devolving and becoming less and less functional.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco 1250X ever since I discovered how wonderfully it shaved. I have two, one at home and one in my travel kit. So following Norelco&#x27;s instructions, I purchased a new head recently since mine was a year old. I saw the RQ12 had been replaced with the RQ12+, but thought nothing of it until my first shave with the new head. As so many others have said, this great shaver is now a mediocre shaver with the plus head. There&#x27;s a lot of friction even with shaving cream and I have to shave the same area 2-3 times to get my face as smooth as it was with one pass of the old head. I cannot fathom why Norelco ruined a good thing. Just what problem were they trying to solve by replacing the head? Didn&#x27;t they test this head with customers before obsoleting the old one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dug my old head out of the wastebasket. Even a year old it&#x27;s a lot better then the new RQ12+. I guess I will have to go back to Panasonic shavers.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.  Fit razor perfectly and performs perfectly.</li>
    <li> fitted my older type shaver with good results, a great shave</li>
    <li> Work fine,  I liked the old head replacements as they were easier to clean than these.</li>
    <li> I read so so reviews and a little wary of purchasing. It is different from the original that was with the unit when I purchased it.My original blades were not up to the task anymore and the replacement works well. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate on buying them again.</li>
    <li> This is not a replacement part, this is a joke.  Unlike the original replacement part that Philips no longer offers, this plastic junk cannot provide a complete shave, let alone a decent one.  As the manufacturer suggests, I gave it a full month trial, and now, of course, it&#x27;s too late to return it.  Awful, awful, awful.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the flip up kind that originally came with my shaver, however after getting use to it I found in gave me a closer shave and was easier&lt;br /&gt;to clean</li>
    <li> Closest shave ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, easier to clean blades.</li>
    <li> This replacement to the RQ12 pulls at your whiskers, unlike the original RQ12 flip out set.</li>
    <li> Note this is the new design. It does not work as well as the original design, and is not easy to clean. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> A big step backwards for the 1290, a baby step forward for the Arcitec. I searched for a replacement when the replacement light lit on my Senso Touch 3D 1290. I soon discovered that the replacement, this RQ12+; was one of the lowest rated products from this brand. The original replacement head, the RQ12 was on offer for 169.95 roughly the cost of the full razor. More searching and I found an Amazon vendor offering the RQ12 for 69.99 I ordered, my order of an RQ12 was confirmed. When I opened the box it contained the RQ12+. I contacted Amazon and they contacted the vendor and arranged a refund of the price difference between what I paid and the Amazon price of the RQ12+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the RQ12+ with the 1290 and it was less comfortable and effective than the year old original head. I then mounted it to an Arcitec that I had retired in favor of the 1290. The RQ12+ would not go in straight but rotated about 10 degrees. It outperformed the stock  Arcitec. I shaved with the Arcitec, and followed up with the year old 1290. The year old 1290 removed hair the new RQ12+ had left behind.The problem is that the Arcitec equipped with the new head won&#x27;t fit in the charging pod, so you must remove the head to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the RQ12+ on the 1290 is like putting no name tires on your Porsche. I have been shaving with Norelco since 1974. Bring back the proper head before your customers go elsewhere, alstublieft.</li>
    <li> Just like many of the others here who post poor ratings with this &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; for the original RQ12, my impressions of the RQ12+ is that it&#x27;s a very cheaply made replacement. The original head had swing up features for each of the three blade/comb assemblies, allowing one to easily flip them up, hold it under the faucet to clean them out, then flip them back down into place (at which point I always put it in the automatic cleaner often sold with my unit). The RQ12+ pulls all three heads (blade/comb combined) off in one sub-assembly from the main head assembly, much less convenient. You can&#x27;t use the shaver handle to hold onto to clean everything, you have to hold the three-blade/comb assembly with your fingers under the faucet (and since I use the hottest water my faucet can put out, that&#x27;s uncomfortable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My RQ12+ head assembly broke the fourth day I used it. I replaced it 1/2/15 (my annual &amp;#34;change the shaver head&amp;#34; date), and on 1/5/15 noticed a grinding noise coming from the head. I pulled off the top part (spilling hair stubble everywhere) to see what the problem was, and one of the three head/comb assemblies fell out of place. The little orange plastic retention piece had &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; out of it&#x27;s retention position. I put it back together, started again, and the same thing happened. After the third cycle of stop - reaffix - start again I could tell it was simply a screwy piece of cheap plastic trash, and was permanently defective. Sigh. I put back on the previous RQ12 head that I had replaced and life was good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have noted, the quality of the shave from the RQ12+ is inferior to the RQ12. Even the year-old RQ12 I put back onto my unit after the RQ12+ broke (again, after four days of use), was vastly superior to the RQ12+ at its first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Norelo user for about 40 years now. Very disappointed that, first Norelco doesn&#x27;t have the original RQ12 heads available, except for the ridiculous price of ~$185 (almost what I paid for the complete shaving system), and second that they would even consider suggesting that the RQ12+ is an acceptable product, much less a replacement for the RQ12. It&#x27;s insulting to any customer who bought into one of the higher end shavers that use the RQ12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Norelco, you&#x27;ve always been better than this! Get your act together.</li>
    <li> I have been using the replacement head for over a month now.  I am not a huge fan of the design change, I liked the flip up heads previously for cleaning but the new ones will do.  The first couple shaves with the new head was quite painful actually.  The new design tends to pull the hair much more than I have ever experienced with an electric razor.  I have been using them for the last 15 years.  The longer you let your facial hair get, the worse it pulls.  I will say that if you are using it every single day, it does give a very close shave with little discomfort.  If you go several days without shaving.....be prepared for a slightly painful shave!</li>
    <li> A worthless &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to the old HQ12.  Now just a terrible shave that ruined what was a great razor.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this replacement.</li>
    <li> Not exactly the same as the original 3D-Senso shaver head (not as good/nice), but it fits and works.  A good trick to not have to replace every 6-8 months (or have it worn down so it feels like you need to) is to use the new replacement head for dry shaves and the old one for wet shaves using shaving cream.</li>
    <li> It shaves pretty good (not as good as the original pop-up head) and I&#x27;m getting use to it coming completely off the shaver for cleaning.  I still prefer the pop-up but, they are no longer available.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement for the old RQ-12. I liked the original better as far as the feel when shaving. This one seems to pull a little more, doesn&#x27;t seem to be as gentle with the hairs. Not sure on longevity since it is already causing discomfort when shaving, I will have to see, and if it gets worse, I will update the review. Also irked me that Philips-Norelco stopped making the RQ-12 and didn&#x27;t notify anyone, including their own call-center employees. I called inquiring about ordering an RQ-12 (original) as no physical store carried them anymore (even though the shavers were/are still being sold), and no one online had them for less than $130. I finally called a third time and was told the call center for the store was just informed the previous day that they stopped making the original RQ-12, and a new \\&quot;RQ12+\\&quot; was being manufactured to be available \\&quot;possibly within a month.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not going to ding the review for that issue, but just thought people should know. It seems Philips-Norelco gives no s***s about its customers.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave, hope it continues until december</li>
    <li> I was actually concerned when I first looked at the replacement head.  It didn&#x27;t look like the original and quite honestly, it looked cheap.  I ended up liking the replacement better.  I feel it cuts closer and better than the original.  I did like that the heads opened on the original and didn&#x27;t have to pull the head off to clean it.  That would be my only &amp;#34;negative.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My son had used the Norelco Arcitec razor for years (at least 5) and swore by it. We did an upgrade last year to the Sensotouch 3D and he&#x27;s even happier. It&#x27;s great to be able to rely on a razor to last for years and years of use. This replacement head arrived quickly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product or the service!</li>
    <li> This head shaves just fine for me, and it sure beats the scalpers trying to sell the older head for $200.</li>
    <li> Better than the previous edition.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Innovation by the engineers at Philips continues to amazed me. Great product but a little to expensive.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old shaving head with the new RQ12+ and after using it for a week I could say that the shaving process as well as final results are much better than in my previous head which came with the shaver a year ago. My skin is less irritated and shaving the neck area which has been always the most problematic area for the shaver is much easier and smooth. I&#x27;m very pleased with the new designed shaving head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 2D shaving head and there&#x27;s a loud grinding noise that originates from the shaft that connects to the razor body.</li>
    <li> I was concerned after reading several negative reviews of this replacement head. However, once I replaced my old RQ12 head, the shave was just fine. This was much better than having to get an entirely new razor etc. So, at least as far as I am concerned -- this replacement head works just fine.</li>
    <li> This replacement head fits perfectly. Easy to clean. Quality is poor. As other reviews have said it feels like it pulls as it cuts. Nowhere as good as the original. I bought my razor from a club warehouse and am looking to replace this one now that the replacement t heads are so poor. The new ones appear to have a giant toilet appearing thing that clean the razor (won&#x27;t be getting one of those). Perhaps a different brand. I was perfectly happy with the old better heads.</li>
    <li> Very inferior product. After 3 very good sets of the orginal replacement heads, this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; replacement put a very bitter taste for Norelco in my mind. It pulls hair, no where near the smoothness, and goes dull much faster. I was highly impressed with the original, however now I will be seeking a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement for previous model. This new design is a step down. The cutting blades are further from the edge and make a close shave difficult.</li>
    <li> Far better than the original head.  Cleans very easily, it is less expensive and cuts very close.</li>
    <li> average price; think I saved $2; great shaving heads</li>
    <li> Had to replace original head...  New design works great.  Will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as the original head, but it works.  My $200 Sensotouch 3D now works about like a $100 shaver, but at least there&#x27;s finally a replacement head available, so the shaver isn&#x27;t completely useless.</li>
    <li> As someone else has mentioned, I would give this product negative stars if I could. The Sensotouch 3D (my specific model is the 1290x) was an expensive razor, that I purchased to have a top quality shave. The original RQ12 head did just that. Since I purchased these replacement heads, however, my razor is no more functional than a $30 Remington purchased at Wal-Mart. It misses so many hairs I have to shave with a blade afterwards, completely negating the usage of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT pay $240 for my razor (price a few years ago) to have a completely non-functional product. I did not pay $240 to dispose of my electric instead of replacing the blades. I bought the top of the line rotary to work and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, you can still get the RQ12 heads, but they have been raised in price to $190 (amazon) and up. I can purchase a newer version of my razor for that price. This is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short version of this story: This product is completely useless trash. Philips Norelco: Bring back the original in full production so I can continue to get gouged by you for $120 per year. I am OK with that, at least it gave me the best rotary shave on the market.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors since they had only one head. Each one was better than the last but, after 65 years, they have hit the jackpot.</li>
    <li> If I could give negative feedback I would. Whatever Norelco did to this newer version of the replacement blades, it made a $250 razor useless. Sent them back for refund. Norelco, please get your stuff together so we can use this nice razor.</li>
    <li> I used to LOVE my shaver, and replaced the heads every 6 months so they&#x27;d be sharp and cut close. The last replacement head I bought was one of these new, significantly more expensive heads and it was a piece of sh!t -- the old used one cut closer than the new replacement. UNFORTUNATELY I had already thrown out the old head, or I would have swapped it back. I came on the Amazon site, this evening, to see if maybe I had just gotten the &amp;#34;bad one from the lot&amp;#34;, but I see many others have had a similar experience. I&#x27;m going to send my shaver into retirement and go back to wet-shaving with a Shick disposable razor for a better shave...and a positive experience. I&#x27;ll check back, in 6 months or a year, to see if things have improved. BTW, I would have bought 3 of these shavers (for my 3 teenage nephews), but the heads are just plain SH!T !!!</li>
    <li> This is not worth the money it cost and does not give you a close shave. My old 12 month old razor head gave a better shave then this new one. Do not waste your money on this replacement head. It does not even compare to the original.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING WAS FINE, THERE WAS NO PROBLEN WHAT SO EVER AND THE &#x27;&#x27;RQ12+ REPLACEMENT HEAD FIT GREAT, HOWEVER WITH THIS NEW SHAPE HEAD I AM ENJOYING MY NORELCO RAZOR MUCH BETTER&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;A FEW YEARS BACK I TOLD THE HEADS OF NORELCO THAT NORELCO IN MY BOOK IS FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY RAZOR&lt;br /&gt;ON THE MARKET. I WAS CAREER ARMY FOR 23 + YEARS AND I HAVE CARRIERED A NORELCO RAZOR WITH ME EVERY PLACE I WENT FROM 1950 UNTIL THIS VERY DAY IN 2014, THAT INCLUDED ALL OF MY TIME WITH THE US ARMY THRU ALL OF MY VARIOUS TRAINING, SEVEN TRIPS TO KOREA, TO VIETNAM, AND 2 TRIPS TO OKINAWA FOR HIGH LIGHTS.&lt;br /&gt;REST ASURED MEN  and LADIES YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT A NORELCO.  &#x27;&#x27;GOD BLESS NORELCO AND GOD BLISS AMERICA&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 1250 razor.  The shave is closer and more comfortable than the original head. Daily cleaning is much easier than the original head.  Just lift the complete head off from the pedestal and rinse. I have used it about a month so I checked the blades to see if they needed cleaning. To my surprise they were still clean and did not need cleaning.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Not the Quality of the original head</li>
    <li> Not as quiet, as easy to clean, or as close a shave as the original, but satisfactory compared to other options.</li>
    <li> Terrible replacement for the original.  My first and last Philips razor.  Going back to Braun.  At least then I knew I&#x27;d get the same quality replacement foil and cutters as the original.  I am so let down by what I thought was a quality company.</li>
    <li> A little different from the original, but not in a bad way. It is still fully washable.</li>
    <li> I have used Philips and later Norelco my whole life and this is by far the worst replacement head I have ever purchased.  CONS: - unable to get a clean/deep shave - cheaper construction than the original shaving head - ridiculous price  PRO: - easier to clean than the original shaving head  UPDATE 8/25/015 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; After using this shaving head for months, my first opinion is even worse: - using this shaving head in the shower is a waste of time, after your shower you can start over. - using this shaving head as a &#x27;dry shave&#x27; performs a little bit better  I called Phillips/Norelco and they are aware of the issue, but do not have a solutions/alternative. The only thing they offer is 15% off on a new shaver, I therefore decided to by a counterfeit RQ11 for $20 from China on E B A Y and I am very pleased with the result</li>
    <li> Supposedly an upgrade from their RQ12, this product is a disaster.  Cheap plastic.  Shaves only slightly better than my one year old RQ12 head.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning instructions are laughable (very complicated compared to the flip-open, run-under-the-faucet RQ12).  The Norelco product manager for this is probably already demoted or fired, or at least should be.</li>
    <li> perfect transaction.  no problems</li>
    <li> Wayyyyyyy overpriced!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe so many people are rating this with 1 star? I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of that, well I got the replacement head for my 1290x and let me tell you one thing IT IS AWESOME!!! i&#x27;ll be honest when I opened the package and took it out, it did look and feel a little cheaper than the original head but it&#x27;s actually easer to use and clean, ok so here is my final verdict, I used it yesterday and it really does feel like you get a better and closer shave so that&#x27;s an A+ and to clean it&#x27;s a snap another A+ just pull it off use warm or hot water to clean and that&#x27;s it, I totally recommend this replacement head over the old pop open style head for the 1290x Shaver, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Rejuvenated my old shaver to brand new.</li>
    <li> Changed out heads, much better shave.  works great on my cheaper shaver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these a couple of weeks but my impression is that they look cheap, feel cheap and even sound cheap when running. If you can get past that; they have given very close shaves and I find them easier to clean that the originals.</li>
    <li> The original RQ12 blade was wonderful, while the RQ12+ stings with each whisker it cuts. So, today I ordered a Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> No, you do not need to buy a new razor.  The RQ12+ is not the disaster the one-star reviews imply.  It is far from perfect–see below–and may not be due five starts, which I gave to offset some of the one-star reviews that are over the top.  I have only shaved twice with the RQ12+ on my series 8000 and the quality of the shave is the same.  The place under my nose is still hard to reach to get all my mustache.  The stubble on my neck that is hard to clean shave is still hard to clean shave.  And the parts of my beard that are easy to shave are still easy to shave.  Given that it is supposed to take three or four weeks to break it in, it may turn out to shave better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco shaver is a very inconvenient shaver to use in the first place and the RQ12+ has made that worse.  Instead of opening up the blades, rinsing them, and then leaving them open to dry, the RQ12+ must be removed from the razor to be cleaned.  You are supposed to use hot water, but unlike the original blades, you must get your hands wet to rinse the blades, so–and this is a warning they put in the packaging–you must make sure the water is not too hot.  Once you have rinsed the blades you are told to air dry them, but your choices are to put them back on the razor (shielding one side from air flow) or lay them on a surface (shielding one side from air flow and requiring someplace to put them where they will not get knocked around and damaged).  Once a month you are told to disassemble the blades one at a time (to avoid getting them mixed up which requires re-breaking them in) and clean each one.  To do that they give you a little orange plastic tool.  Assuming you do not lose the tool, you have to use it to disassemble one blade, clean it, let it dry, and re-assemble it.  Then repeat that whole process two more times.  Although there is no mention of it in the instructions (and I use that word loosely), if you have the little cleaning system, you can use it.  I assume it does as good a job as the once-a-month cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting a new razor anyway, I recommend you go with a Braun.  I used Braun for years and tried the Norelco to see if I like to shave wet.  I have found that having wet shave available is not something I need.  The Norelco is much less convenient to travel with.  The Braun fits in a case about the size of a hard-shell glasses case.  The shave quality is close enough, the differences are subjective.  The Norelco is quieter, although the RQ12+ makes it noisier and has a metal on metal sound. My wife says I shave faster with the Norelco, but I haven&#x27;t noticed.</li>
    <li> Squeals like a stuck pig. I waited too long to get my money back. I have used Norelco razors for decades, and this is the last straw. What a waste of 55 dollars. F..k off Norelco. And Philips too!</li>
    <li> This is a direct replacement for the RQ10, which isn&#x27;t readily available, even on eBay.  Works great, close shave.  The ponly drayback is the edges are somewhat sharp and you need to find your own technique to avoid  being jabbed with the edges...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this replacement head is not worth the money. Lost its sharpness in 6-months, very loud, cheaply constructed and shaving with it takes 3x longer.  Too bad as liked this razor.  I have gone back to my original head which is 3-years old and still cuts better/faster  even though it is used.  They should not have tried to fix something that was not broken.  Bad Norelco.</li>
    <li> Quick and exactly what i expected</li>
    <li> Not great.  Not as good as the original.</li>
    <li> Better than my original one, my original one was letting all the hair out, this one doesn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t listen to negative comments, this is good, no problems after almost 2 months.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product that originally came with the Razor.  It is by definition a cheap imitation.  I have called Philips Norelco about this issues and they states they were getting alot of complaints.  It does not perform even close to the original head, it is a less than comfortable shave the heads to not pivot as the original equipment did, it will not cut 2 day old beard, even with daily use it leaves a significant amount of stuble and frankly, takes longer to shave with.  This is a rip off, I have gone back to regular razors, The original equipment was fine, and really did give you a great shave in a short amount of time, but this replacement head is no better than the shavers they made 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> They differed from original head units, however I think they shave closer and better</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave as the RQ 12 head assembly</li>
    <li> Works way better than the previous version! Cuts better, more comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t drop small whisker particles all of the place when I shave! Great upgrade!</li>
    <li> I have been using my 1280x Norelco for over 20 years, but this latest replacement head is extremely rough on my face and provides a very poor cut.  I have to go over and over spots to get even a stubbly shave. My buddy had the same experience with his replacement head.  I have had to go out an buy regular hand razors.  I call customer service, but they suggested I call Amazon for a replacement.  But based on other comments I have read hear, I don&#x27;t think that will help if Amazon replaces this head with the same poorly manufactured one.  What a disappointment.  Based on this experience and other&#x27;s comments, I will have to explore other options other than Norelco.  Loyalty works both ways, but Norelco has lost mine.</li>
    <li> I cannot even give it a second star, even though it was my fault that I had to purchase this as it offered me a more affordable solution to salvaging my razor, which I really liked. However, it is NOWHERE close to the original head. I agree with the majority of the reviews; PN really messed this one up. I use it for &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my head and when I use this I feel that lots of little tweezers are pulling on my scalp. After purchasing this, I will look into other brands when I am in the market for a new razor. I honestly think PN should replace this model with the original style for free to those of us that bought this model; it is a design flaw and it hurts their reputation</li>
    <li> Blades do not appear to be as good of quality as the originals</li>
    <li> I Didnt open the new replacement till one month after it was delivered, when I opened it recently and started using it...&lt;br /&gt;I realized one thing, this is worst shaver head replacement by Philips. My 1-1/2 yr old shaver head(original) works better than this one. I really hate this 48$ I spent on this. I should have opened it little earlier and returned it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should stop selling this, and Philips is just ruining the Norelco reputation(digging the products own grave).Worst replacement.</li>
    <li> This is the third head I have ordered for my razor.  Like all the others, it was dull as a froe in about a week.  If I can get blades I am going to have to go back to my 20 some-odd year old Norelco.  Old, but gives a super smooth shave.</li>
    <li> got this for my father-in-law over my trepidation based on other reviews. however he loves it and says it works great for him.</li>
    <li> The fact that norelco botched the replacement blades for such a great razor is *almost* as ridiculous as the price that sellers like DependableResource is gouging loyal Norelco customers for the original (RQ12) blades that are the true replacement. At the time of this writing, DR is selling these blades for $189, which is more than I paid for my 1250x itself! Save yourself some future money and pick up a Braun Series 7. The top-of-the line model (790) is  only $5 more than this... for the entire razor/cleaning system! Not to mention it has better reviews than any Norelco razor out there. The blades last twice as long (18 mos vs 9), and are half the price of the cheap Norelco 12+ blades, which they&#x27;re trying to pass off as replacements for the much better blades the razor came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Norelco customer for many, many years. But what they&#x27;ve done with this razor is such a fiasco, they have lost me as a customer. They very well could subsidize this disaster and eat the extra cost of these blades, as a courtesy to their loyal customers. Instead, they gave us a cheap replacement that doesn&#x27;t live up to the standards of the original heads, and are rnabling unscrupulous sellers like DependableResource to screw over consumers by selling blades at 4-5x what they&#x27;re worth. Shame on both DR and Norelco!</li>
    <li> The RQ12+/62 replacement head reviewed here is the exact same head that&#x27;s on Norelco&#x27;s new top-of-the-line 9000-series shavers. There are many 1-star reviews of this replacement head from customers that have 8000-series shavers yet the average review score for the 9000-series shavers on Amazon is 4.5 stars.    That doesn&#x27;t add up. The head assembly, combs, and blades are exactly the same on the 9000-series and the RQ12+/62 replacement heads. And as far as a shaving experience, those parts ARE the shaver.    The 8000-series shavers originally used the RQ12 head. This is the head that now goes for ridiculous prices by scalpers - $130 and up - since it apparently it is no longer being produced by Norelco as a replacement part.    So what&#x27;s the difference between the original RQ12 and the new RQ12+ reviewed here?    Each head on the RQ12 is mounted on one of three vertical pivots that make up the base of the head assembly. This allows each head to move independently up and down. The RQ12+/62 has all three heads on a single base with no vertical pivots; as you&#x27;re shaving, if one head moves down the others have to move up like a lever. The RQ12+/62 heads do, however, pivot laterally as they move across your face. The RQ12 heads don&#x27;t.    Each head on the RQ12 is mounted on a hinge. The heads individually pop up for cleaning. On the RQ12+/62 you remove all three heads at once as a single assembly.    To entirely remove the blades for thorough cleaning on the RQ12 you snap open a small retainer, also mounted on a hinge. On the RQ12+/62 to remove the blades you unsnap them with a provided plastic tool.    (Note that the RQ12+/62 actually takes less effort to get really clean than the RQ12 since it&#x27;s much easier to directly access the heads and blades.)    Each RQ12 cutting head has three rows of blades. The outermost row has the Lift and Cut mechanism. The innermost row has round holes on the surface of the comb to cut stubble more efficiently. The RQ12+/62 has two rows of blades. The outermost row has Lift and Cut, V-shaped slots in the comb, and V-shaped blades that Norelco says give a 30% closer shave (the RQ12&#x27;s blades are straight).    I&#x27;m using a new RQ12 head that came with my 8100 (1250X) shaver and a new RQ12+/62 replacement head that I bought to see what the fuss was all about (I was going to have to buy one eventually anyway). What I&#x27;ve found is that the original RQ12 looks more substantial. It&#x27;s more high-end and complex in appearance and then there&#x27;s those fancy hinges on the cutting heads. It also feels somewhat more comfortable on your face than the RQ12+/62.    The replacement RQ12+/62 has a more pedestrian appearance and looks less sophisticated. Perhaps that might help explain why there&#x27;s such a discrepancy between the 9000-series shaver reviews and the reviews for the RQ12+/62. Here people are comparing the new head to something they&#x27;re used to. On the 9000-series page they&#x27;re just using the shaver (again, with the exact same heads) and telling you about the results of shaving with it.    And while it may feel slightly less comfortable than the RQ12 the RQ12+/62 gives you a closer shave. I shave every day and have somewhat thick hairs and the RQ12+/62 feels more like I shaved with a standard razor than if I use the RQ12.    Between the two I&#x27;d rather use the RQ12+ replacement head. Overall, for me anyway, getting a closer shave without having to use a standard razor outweighs everything else. And sorry, but some of these extremely negative comments just don&#x27;t match up with what I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
    <li> It seems that Norelco has stopped making the original RQ12 replacement head and only makes the RQ12+.  They claim it is a drop in replacement consisting of the new style blades and adapter.  The blades only need to be replaced with the &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; and not the entire head assembly.  Here&#x27;s the kicker - while the head does fit, it is no longer of the correct size to fit some of the accessories which came with the shaver.  Further, they instruct the user to remove the entire head assembly when using the charging pod for the Arcitec model.  I bought the shaver originally because it came with the jet clean stand.  Now the head is a slightly different shape and barely fits the stand, let alone being able to immerse in the cleaning solution deeply enough for a good cleaning.  As other reviews state, the overall design has cheap plastic retaining rings to hold the blades in place and needs a special provided tool to disassemble.  I found that fingers work just as well.  The original RQ12 design had metal retaining springs and was much more durable.  On a positive note - overall shave is comparable after the skin adjusts to the new blades and head.  I really wish Norelco would not take a perfectly good design and mess with it.....  Update on 3/16:  the heads got very noisy and the seal came off of the head assembly.  Shaved terrible halfway into the life of the blades.  I am forced to buy a new shaver because it is no longer worth the cost of the cheaply made replacement parts.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is far superior to the original. The shave is wonderful and much faster.</li>
    <li> works just fine, quick shipping too.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other people writing reviews, I have had no problems with this replacement head. I have a Norelco Arcitec razor that originally used the RQ10 head but it seems like they no longer are being sold, so I had to switch to this RQ12 replacement. I have been using it for a month now, and I find that it gives me an even closer shave than the RQ10. It also shaves my neck much faster than the RQ10 as I had to repeatedly go over and over to get a close shave. When I&#x27;m finished every day, I pop the assembly off, brush out the loose hairs, and stick it on my charging/cleaning dock. They only bad thing about this head is that it does not fit into the travel charger.</li>
    <li> These blades work great. Perfect fit for my electric razor.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, this newer &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; design is inferior to the old one. The heads don&#x27;t pivot as freely and are tough to clean if you use any sort of shaving cream or gel. I also find my face gets cut much more often -- yes, my face gets cut up from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really hoping they bring back the old design.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was not sure what I was getting to replace the head of my Phillips Norelco 3D electric shaver. The package arrived and I reviewed the contents of the package. I found the new RQ12+ shaving head complete, a new cover &amp; a blade removal tool. Surprised to receive a new cover with the shaving head since my old one has been replaced twice already. To install the new shaving head was simple. Hold the shaver and pull the old head straight up away from the shaver. Poped right out. Open the new shaving head &amp; simply line up the connector and push it back on the shaver. That&#x27;s the entire process. The RQ12+ is a different shaving head then the original. It opens by removing the entire blade section to clean and snap it back in like the older models. I personaly never liked the new design of pulling up the blades to wash them. The real test was the shave. It was closer &amp; faster, like new again. This Phillips Norelco 3D electric shaver is the best they make, but the blades do wear out. Installing the new RQ12+ was simple &amp; easy, bottom line I was happy with the replacement head using the new RQ12+ Fast clean shave like new.</li>
    <li> I am a long term Phillips customer and this 3-D model is superb when used with an electric shaver pre-shave liquid. I use the CVS brand and it works fine. The replacement heads fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Ordered it hoping it would fit an older model. It did, and it cuts better than the original</li>
    <li> I originally bought my Philips Norelco shaver at Costco, and was getting ready to order a new replacement head. I had saved the replacement head link to my wish list, but when I clicked on the link I went into shock!!!! Originally it was priced at around 50 bucks or so, but to my surprise it was now close to 200 bucks. Then I saw the link to a newer replacement and was relived that it was only $47, that was until I started reading all the dismal reviews for the newer replacement head. After doing a little research I decided to return my shaver to Costco, got to love their return polices, and purchased a Panasonic ES-LF51-A Arc4, which is without a doubt the closest and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Philips, you just lost another happy customer, thanks to your poor decision making process, which lead you to believe that offering an inferior replacement head, which probably saved you a few cents, was somehow a good idea.</li>
    <li> I have one shaver head that keeps coming off and I haven&#x27;t been able to fix it.</li>
    <li> Sept. 2015 UPDATE: I replaced this shaver with a new model from Panasonic.  The Panasonic cost 2/3 as much, yet shaves much better, feels better, even sounds better. &amp;#60;/UPDATE&amp;#62;   Immediately after using this, without having read any reviews, I said to my wife, &amp;#34;If this had been the original head, I would&#x27;ve returned the shaver immediately.  I would never buy a shaver if this head was the only option.&amp;#34;  The original SensoTouch 3D head allowed you to relax and not even think about shaving, while providing a cutting-edge shave.  Now that&#x27;s luxury.  This new head makes shaving a chore again.  The shave was definitely not as close as the original head&#x27;s.  The space between heads is too great, and it caught on my chin and upper lip.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen before (been shaving for 24 years).  Other &#x27;cons&#x27; include the cheap plastic construction (I won&#x27;t be surprised if it breaks), and having to remove the top of the head assembly in order to clean it.  Apparently, the hinged heads of the original design were too expensive to manufacture.  Not a big deal, really, but higher price points demand more differentiating factors.  Every shaver at any price cuts facial hair, so details matter.  Even the sound that this new head makes is annoying, compared to the lower whirring chorus of the old one.  With this new head, the SensoTouch 3D shaver has become more about form than function.  I hope that Norelco will read these reviews and take them into consideration.  I replace my shavers only when the motors are just about dead, but I may make an exception if the head design doesn&#x27;t improve.</li>
    <li> Terrible redesign.  The old version was a great, smooth shave and easy to flip open to clean each time.  This new design doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as close and requires taking it fully apart to clean.  I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for 30 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past but Norelco was the only one that gave a smooth shave.  Well, it no longer does.  You&#x27;d think technology would allow these to get BETTER, but instead they are going in the wrong direction, while &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor blades I see are constantly innovating.  As a result, after those 30 years I&#x27;ve now switched to a regular razor blade.  What a difference THAT makes!</li>
    <li> Falls apart.  However, it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t cut me when shaving, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with this.  Previous model was higher quality.</li>
    <li> As stated.  Best shave ever.</li>
    <li> This is not like the original. Difficult to open and some parts can fall apart when you clean them out.The old blades just popped up.This looks like Norelco made this change.</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed in Norelco for discontinuing (or whatever) the RQ12. This doesn&#x27;t shave like the RQ12 or feel like it on my face. With all the ridges on the metal bezel surrounding the blades, it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to know why it&#x27;s not as smooth running across your face. If Norelco doesn&#x27;t bring back the RQ12 I&#x27;ll never buy another one of their shavers. Considering all the similar negative reviews here as I&#x27;ve written, if Norelco doesn&#x27;t respond in some manner it says a lot about the company&#x27;s lack of consideration for it&#x27;s customers.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Quality is poor and it&#x27;s a PAIN to use. It feels like instead of cutting the hair it pulls it 1 by 1 making shaving really painful. Great dissapointment because the shaving head that came with my sensotouch 3D was painless to use. If I could give it 0 stars I would.</li>
    <li> This replacement head is definitely NOT an improvement over the RQ12.  The RQ12+ is terrible compared to the RQ12.  Using the RQ12 head/blades was a pleasure, providing a wonderfully-close shave.  If I didn&#x27;t shave for several days in a row, the RQ12 barely pulled, with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so for the RQ12+.  It does not provide a close shave, and requires multiple passes to provide an acceptable shave.  If I go a few days without shaving, the RQ12+ is downright painful to use.  I hate this thing.  The only positive thing I can say about it is that it IS easier to clean than the RQ12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I kept my old RQ12 and will go back to it and throw this in the garbage.  Once my old RQ12 stops working decently, then I&#x27;ll purchase a different brand of electric shaver.  Thanks for nothing Phillips.  I suppose I should pursue some sort of satisfaction guarantee to see if I can get my money back for this crappy RQ12+.</li>
    <li> Although the item is what I ordered and it works as expected, there is no need for a customer to have to order the complete assembly.  The picture shown on this page does not show all of the components that came with my order.  It also included a plastic cover for the item shown.  As a customer all I really need is the replacement blades, not the whole assembly that the blades come in.  The cost for these unnecessary components makes the replacement cost as much as buying one of Norelco&#x27;s cheaper shavers that comes with an additional set of replacement blades.  Yes, I know this is the top of the line titanium blades, but even with the foil cover, it could (and should) cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> Nowhere neat as sharp as the original or as adjustable for the 3d sense.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the previous RQ12 version.&lt;br /&gt;Not as expensive as before.</li>
    <li> Good shaver head...a bit pricey, but worth the cost compared with other heads that don&#x27;t shave as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shaver head. There are a number of imitations that are terrible. Buy the Phillips Norelco head if you want it to do a good job and last vs. the cheap imitations that are a total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviews on this product, I loved my SensoTouch 3D razor, and I loved the first replacement head I got for around $50. Then, the new replacement head that was the only available choice without spending the price of the entire razor for the original heads, was basically crap. The shave even when the heads were new, was not particularly good, and it went downhill from there. I also am very unhappy with Philips Norelco for this decision, and have moved on to a very nice Panasonic razor, with reasonably priced replacement heads that are the same as original equipment. Sorry Norelco.</li>
    <li> Norelco needs to offer the previous revision of this shaving head or it will permanently lose many longtime customers. I plan on returning my 2 week old rq12+.....</li>
    <li> Poorly made compared to the one that came with the shaver.  The retaining rings keep getting lose and the blades fall out</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Want the old not &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; head back</li>
    <li> After reading so many negative reviews about the RQ12+ replacement shaver head, and a handful of positive reviews, I didn&#x27;t want to believe that Norelco had ruined my great SensorTouch 3D 1250x shaver,  wiped out the $220 investment I made 3 years ago and forced me into the arms of a competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I always shave in the shower and use shaving foam. My beard is relatively light and grows every which-way, so regardless of the shaver it takes several passes to get a close shave. About 10 years ago or so I tried several different electric shaver models, including one Norelco, and they all failed in the shower due to water leakage. And they didn&#x27;t shave very close. I spent the next decade shelling out big bucks for the various Gillette Fusion upgrades, including the powered models, and ever-more expensive blades. Got a close shave but got nicked a lot, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found the Norelco SensorTouch 3D 1250x. What a great razor! It worked flawlessly in the shower -- water simply can&#x27;t get inside the mechanism. The shave was nearly as close as the Fusion blades. And the cleaning system was excellent. I felt that I&#x27;d finally found the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave every day, so the first head lasted 18 months. I replaced it with another RQ12/52 and the shave continued to be excellent. 18 months later, I couldn&#x27;t buy the RQ12/52 anymore, except at outrageous prices -- some greater than what I paid for the 1250x shaver and cleaning system. I read the RQ12+ reviews with some trepidation, but there were enough positive reviews to give the new head a shot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the RQ12+, I thought it was better than the negative reviews indicated. But the more I shaved with the RQ12+ them more I noticed that the shaver was missing a lot of area on each pass and it was taking more and more passes to get a close shave. Some specifics: The RQ12+ head couldn&#x27;t deal with the heaviest part of my beard, theupper lip and chin. The shave was never close and I couldn&#x27;t get all the way to the nostrils. Didn&#x27;t have either problem with the RQ12/52. Also, I frequently got an ingrown hair near the corner of my upper lip. It was in nearly the same spot every time. Had to pull it out with tweezers. I guess the hair wants to flop over and grow down, and the RQ12+ head couldn&#x27;t lift it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to put up with this for at least a month to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a case of my beard and shaving style needing to adjust to the new heads. In fact, I did better than that -- I used the RQ12+ for three months. But the shave never improved and I finally gave up. It was hard to flush $220 down the drain, but I&#x27;d had enough. I did a bunch of research and bought the Braun Series 7 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWRLJ6O?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Braun 799CC. The shave is actually closer than the Norelco 1250x with the RQ12/52 head. Smooth as a straight razor, but without the nicks. I can go more days without shaving than I could before. What really surprises me is how even the shave is. My beard never grew back so evenly with the Norelco. The Braun 799CC works great in the shower and the cleaning/charging system is better than the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though I&#x27;m disappointed and angry at having my investment wiped out, I&#x27;m glad to have found a better shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad call, Norelco.</li>
    <li> Contrary to some reviews, I find these replacement heads cut quicker and closer than the original ones. Popping the blades off on this for rinsing is simpler than flipping open the 3 heads separately on the original blades, and ends up being easier to clean out. I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Good for 4 months!! The original lasted 2 yrs, the RA12 almost one year but this new RQ12+ only 4 months. And from day I got a flimsy almost toy like feeling. Don&#x27;t like them and wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying them. (This is the husband writing the review)</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco Arcitec and was wary about ordering this replacement head after viewing all the negative comments. However, I find shaving with this head just fine. Blades seem to cut just like the original although this head has a convex shape versus the older head which was concave. The different shape didn&#x27;t seem to matter for closeness of shave.</li>
    <li> Happy with product and delivery time.</li>
    <li> Good quality but cleaning is clumsy.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Yes this head is different to the original one and yes some of the internal mechanism now features plastic parts but no this is not an inferior head. I can&#x27;t really say I can tell the difference between the original head brand-new and this new head brand-new - both resulted in a super close shave out of the box.</li>
    <li> better than the original.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the RQ12 heads on my 1250x. They have as much or more range of motion than the RQ12 had with larger blades. The cleaning process is different - instead of peeling back each blade, you pull the entire blade assembly off of the head. It&#x27;s just as easy (actually saves time) and gives greater access to the blades and the head for more thorough cleaning. These also come with a tool to remove the individual blades if you need to do so.</li>
    <li> New style, easier to clean</li>
    <li> I Bought the most expensive razor Norelco makes and have had nothing but grief.  Like an idiot, I have replaced the head three different times at insanely high prices.  Although the shave was good, not one of the heads lasted longer than 2 months before it &amp;#34;ate&amp;#34; the blades.  So, finally wising up, it sits in the drawer, waiting for Norelco to get their head out and make it something usable. I&#x27;ve used Norelco for 20+ years.  No more.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read concerning the replacement head for my Norelco Senso Touch 3D almost stopped me from purchasing the RQ12+. The RQ12+ head is different than the older one but performs as though the shaver was brand new.  No issues and very satisfied in the first 6 months of use ! ! ! !  RQ12+ is easy to install and easy to clean.  Cleaning the head is a two handed operation where you may use your thumb nail to depress the tab between the any of the round shaving heads and with the other hand use a nail to pry open the head at the outer portion of the nearest round shaving head.  Tap both parts of the shaving head on the side of the sink, then snap it back together and you are all set.  If you determine that a more thorough cleaning is needed you can use the tool included to remove the blades from the head and rinse under running water.  What I also discovered was that you have the option when the blades have dulled to replace just the head and blades.  See SH90/52 for replacement blades for the RQ12+ head.</li>
    <li> Awful shaving head, the parts get loose while you&#x27;re shaving. The original head for the shaver had an easy cleaning process with parts not getting loose. Every time you have to clean the new replacement head the parts come loose  - blades, plastic holder and a pathetic plastic wheel to fix them again - and you waste valuable time assembling them again. Awful</li>
    <li> Cheap workmanship-----.</li>
    <li> Great price, did not have to chase all around tow.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I am a bit worried about cleaning the blades since they don&#x27;t pop open but it is nice getting a clean close shave again.</li>
    <li> Negative reviews might come from surprise: This RQ12+ is not like the discontinued RQ12/52 that it replaces. (This set of 3 heads is pulled off for cleaning, rather than each head flipping up on the RQ12/52.) This isn&#x27;t quite as easy but avoids the mess of water draining out of the shaver. More importantly, the RQ12/52 was not truly 3D. The RQ12+ heads now tilt sidewise in their holders which still tilt radially, as in the old RQ12/52. So there is an additional floating direction. Finally, the individual shaving heads (cutters and combs) can now be replaced (Philips Norelco SH90), rather than replacing the entire RQ12+. That saves a few bucks. More importantly, if a single shaving head is damaged, it can be switched out. ...At first trial, the RQ12+ shave seems as good as the discontinued RQ12/52.</li>
    <li> This item is terrible design...I still using my old RQ12, I won&#x27;t spend any money to purchase this BAD HEAD. Its time to get Braun!!!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these units and when I opened one of the packages I was immediately shocked that Norelco could manufacture such a poor product. Confusing instructions, poor appearence and no easy way to clean the heads. I purchased my Senso Touch 3D about two yers ago for about $100 and it came with two heads. I have been a Norelco shaver for 40-years, but no more. The Norelco management needs to do some house cleaning. I returned both heads to Amazon. Shame on Norelco.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the negative ratings are about! Just as close of a shave and easier to clean as well. People hate different but this redesign works great. This razor gives the closest save of any of my previous Norelcos, and these updated blades shave just as close. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> Norelco needs to rethink this fragile replacement head. I&#x27;ve put the blades and head back together multiple, multiple times when the internals popped apart unbidden. It&#x27;s made what was a reasonably good razor into a so-so competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, the previous head wasn&#x27;t much better, and I see why they replaced and redesigned it.....cut my fingers on the sharp hooks inside and cursed more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll look elsewhere on my next razor entirely (after YEARS of Norelco loyalty). No KUDOs here.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband...The only thing I can say is he couldn&#x27;t change the replacement head...But I just snapped it right on and he has&lt;br /&gt;been using it ever since...</li>
    <li> A lot less expensive the the RQ12 and work really well.  Can&#x27;t understand why the RQ12 i almost as expensive as buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Works better then the old HQ-10 head</li>
    <li> better than I expected, cuts whiskers better than original one that came with razor</li>
    <li> Great buy.....husband loves it</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the original one.</li>
    <li> Horrible,i want my old RQ12 back for 50$. Seems like Philips Norelco doesn&#x27;t care much about their quality. I have 260$ device and now i have to pay 150$ for the good replacement head or use this cheap  &amp;#34;new model&amp;#34; one.1 star,looking to buy something from Braun. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to order the RQ 12 replacement head after all the negative reviews.  But decided to give it a try. Switching out the old head for the new head was very easy. Tried it out, And got a nice Close shave . Found the new head easier to clean compared to the old head. Overall was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was happy that a replacement head was finally made available. I received it today and installed it on my 3D Norelco. It shaves wonderfully. BUT there is a problem. The cutters cannot be lifted for cleaning. My previous heads would grt completely clogged with cut whiskers until I learned to remove the cutter from the enclosure, and clean it with hot water an a brush. I do not see that as possible with this RQ12+. So, if anyone reading this finds out the secret to cleaning, please, please reply to me here. Thanks in advance.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only 3 stars because of the cleaning problem.</li>
    <li> Wow...just wow.  I have been using Norelco razors since I was 15...over 25 years.  The technology has evolved and has been difficult for them to get as close of a shave as a Gillette Fusion blade.  I thought the original R12 head was as close as they could get, but this R12+ redesign is amazing.  I paid $50 for mine, but even at $60 I think it is worth it.  They knocked the ball out of the park with this head.</li>
    <li> Darned shame -- came without the little brush. And -- the Jet Clean unit does a crappy job of cleaning this replacement head.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moNZHB7JK6WV1T]]This is a quick overview of the new RQ 12+. There are a lot of questions regarding this new model, and I hope this video helps.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel this is a much more cost effective and efficient product for the replacement process of the shaver head for the 8000 Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LINK TO THE NEW SHAVING BLADES: http://amzn.to/1vUhCPa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*9/12/2014 UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I brought my 5 stars down to 4 stars. After a week of continued use, I&#x27;d say there is some slight/extra pull or tug from these blades, than from my original OEM blades that came with my 1250X.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been costumer of Norelco for 13 years, and with each new generation the quality of shaving have been dropping, this replacement have the worst quality I&#x27;ve ever seen, my 1 year old head shave better than this, I returned this head and bought a Gillete Fusion, at least I can have a decent shave but with the inconvenience of cutting my face. Let&#x27;s see if Norelco learn from this and came up with a product at the level they use to be</li>
    <li> I have the Norelco 3D Senso Touch, and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement head online or even in the stores. Then this new version of the RQ12 that came in, which provided another option. The other sellers on here made the price go up in the100&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 weeks now since I have used the new RQ12. It works very much the same as the older version of the RQ12 head. It feels somewhat different on how the heads curve, but the design has changed on how far apart the heads are now. It cuts the same as I remember when I first got this electric razor close to 2 years now. And much easier to cut the hair than now. Now that I replaced the head that was already on it from back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me awhile after I shaved to get the 3 individual shaver heads back on the replacement head. Taking them out was easy enough. I found that I needed  the individual heads lined up with the replacement head&#x27;s holes. If it&#x27;s crooked, the plastic orange holders will not work correctly to hold the heads back in. It&#x27;s kind of weird having to line them up each time, and they can shift easily out of alignment. But after the first time, I&#x27;m already used to it.  I could see why almost everyone on here complained about it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The individual heads don&#x27;t collect nearly as much hair as the older head. I just snap off the top of the replacement head, and the hairs collected on the bottom portion are mainly there already. So I probably don&#x27;t have to clean out each individual head as often now. This does take getting used to, still it works in shaving fine for me.</li>
    <li> I used to love my Philips Norelco 3D, but with this replacement head, it&#x27;s awful. Actually hurts when shaving. Doesn&#x27;t shave well. Pulls longer hairs or misses them entirely. Stay away from this head! Unfortunately, the original RQ12 heads don&#x27;t seem to be available anymore unless you want to pay $150+. So looks like I&#x27;ll be in the market for a new shaver...</li>
    <li> This is not the same head that is on the razor even though I ordered the RQ12. Not sure why it&#x27;s different.</li>
    <li> Not qote ready to swap them out with the old ones but they appear to be the correct ones.  My only gripe is how long it took to get them because ot the manufacturing line being down and prices being ridiculously inflated due to a depleted inventory. Have since replaced originals with these and am totally dissatisfied. They are way overpriced and substandard quality.  They are primitive in smootheness, lack in closeness of shave and tend to irritate my skin.  They don&#x27;t even come close to the original heads they replace and I will never rcommend a 3D razor to anyone because of the substandard quality of the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Needed direction how to clean heads.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price</li>
    <li> Takes A LOT longer then previous version did. If you go more then two days, it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really wish they never would have changed design. Now I am going to need to get a new razor completely since I found this to be horrible.</li>
    <li> Yery good service, I received heads promptly.  They work great, better than the orginal&#x27;s ever did.  They are great.</li>
    <li> Might be a good shaver head, but its mislabeled. Despite the packaging clamming its a senso touch 3d, it only has the motions of a 2d head. This isn&#x27;t amazon&#x27;s fault, philips is falsly advertising its own products. To their credit it fits on the 3d handles, but essentially reduces your expensive 3d shaver to a 2d shaver.</li>
    <li> cost was a little high.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically post reviews, but I didn&#x27;t want other people to make the same mistake that I did. I bought this head despite the negative reviews, due to lack of options... I should have just bought a new razor. Next time I&#x27;ll get a Braun. The original head that came with my razor is 1 1/2 years old and still cuts better than this new one. I was unable to even finish a single shave without switching back. This replacement head is a complete embarrassment, especially for the asking price.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard and I&#x27;m on an even tougher budget. So after reading the many negative reviews on Amazon and elsewhere I didn&#x27;t want to buy the RQ12+ for my Arcitec razor if I could at all avoid it. Consequently, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond because their website left off the + sign from the product description (and I had a coupon). Of course the + was on the box when I arrived to pick one up at my local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my first shave and my face is stubble free, which is why I am giving this product five stars. That&#x27;s not to say that the criticism is not valid. The replacement head has some major differences from the original. Frankly, Norelco could have done a better job explaining them in the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a side-by-side photo of the old head (left) and the new head (right). As you will see in the photo, I placed the included orange tool on top of one of the blade covers so you can get a better sense of how to use the tool. This was not obvious, at least not to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the three blades on the left lift up but stay attached to the razor head. The RQ12+ on the other hand (right) requires you to place a fingernail in a groove to detach all three bladdes as a single unit. From this position you can rinse them or you can use the orange tool (shown in the picture) to remove each protective cover and access each blade separately. It was more confusing than anything else, but it didn&#x27;t take long to figure out despite the lack of clear instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In installing the new head for the first time, I held the power button down for a few seconds until my razor reset as the instructions say to do. This was no big deal either and I have no idea why I had to do this.The instructions also say to remove the entire head from my razor in the case of a Norelco Arcitec when charging the unit in the plastic storage case or pod in Norelco lingo. I haven&#x27;t done that yet but it sounds easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will revisit this review as more time goes by. But I would not hesitate to recommend this product thus far.t I would not hesitate to recommend this product thus far.</li>
    <li> Do NOT even think of buying the Norelco Arcitec.  In fact, from what I now know, I would strongly recommend not buying any Norelco products. First of all, it is noteworthy to understand that Norelco has discontinued ALL service operations in the US and Canada. Can you imagine that your shaver&#x27;s battery will need replacement in the next couple of years? Sorry, Norelco has NO OPTIONS for that replacement. I guess that works for them since they hope you will then buy a new shaver.  You will also notice on the Norelco Architec shaver that the cord can NOT be inserted into the shaver, but only into the charger. When the battery can no longer be charged, it can not be powered by the cord either. Next, you will want to consider the RQ12+ Replacement Head. While the original Architec head shaves smoothly, fast and close, the new RQ12+ is poorly manufactured and has the following problems. 1. It has bigger holes and causes the shaver to actually jam on a thick 2 day beard growth. 2. The movable heads now have edges that protrude against the contours of your face and they will catch on your chin and elsewhere. 3. Shaves with this RQ12+ take longer. 4. Shaves with the RQ12+ are not nearly as close. Thankfully, I kept the old original head, and after suffering through the RQ12+ for a 45 days, replaced it with the original head that had 1 year of wear.  Immediately, I noticed that the original head was smoother, closer and faster. There really was NO comparison! It is now clear to me that making cheaper products and offering no service is Norelco&#x27;s new business model.  I have spoken with their customer service reps twice and they simply take notes an apologize. They can offer NO remedies to my concerns, and only indicate the &#x27;company line&#x27; that the new RQ12+ is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;. This is absolute baloney and, obviously, clear indications of just one more corporation that has been taken over by Greed and Deception. You have been warned!</li>
    <li> This is a really bad substitute for the RQ12 blades that work with the Sensotouch 3D razor.  These have doubled my shave time each morning and they still don&#x27;t get as close as the RQ12 blades did with the same razor. I&#x27;m always left without a close shave and missed hairs. I would rather use my 2 year old RQ12 blades than these RQ12+ blades. I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user all of my life, but this poor quality product replacement for such a recent razor will keep me from purchasing another.  Bring back the RQ12 blades, please.</li>
    <li> It cuts nice but, to me it is a lot louder than the head I replaced. It just feels cheap. Something that I found out after I received the head, you have to replace the cutting heads when their wear down. I really liked the old style!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely an aftermarket product. Many differences. Not individual swiveling heads.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shave. no burning</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement head for my Philips Arcitec, which takes the RQ10. I was dismayed at how much the cost of the RQ10 head has increased since I bought the shaver, but after doing some research online I learned that the RQ12 shaving head will fit and is considerably more economical. This was my main reason for buying. So far the replacement seems to be every bit as good as the original. I am a long-time rotary shaver user and was disappointed that Philips would market a shaver that requires such an expensive replacement head so was happy to see this product become available!</li>
    <li> exactly what my husband needed.</li>
    <li> RQ12/52 head is much better than this thing</li>
    <li> The boyfriend says that it does great.</li>
    <li> Poor Quality  .  .  .  The Replacement Head has &amp;#34;come apart&amp;#34; while shaving at least three times in less than a month.  Thankfully I saved the original shaver head assembly as this one will be trashed the next time it fails me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If considering this product  .  .  .  SAVE YOUR MONEY as I am surprised, shocked and extremely disappointed that Amazon would sell this inferior piece of junk.</li>
    <li> It really is no better then the old 2 year one</li>
    <li> Most horrible replacement</li>
    <li> good attachment good price</li>
    <li> works great. cust very close.</li>
    <li> Norelco has decided to reduce the quality of this shaver head, and has lost my future business. I bought my shaver from costco, used the first razor head until it got dull, then used the replacement head that came with my original purchase and noticed an immediate improvement. When that second razor head got dull I ordered this one online, and it cuts as poorly as the 1+ year old razor head I had been using. I do NOT recommend this product and will not be buying another.</li>
    <li> Dullest blades with which I&#x27;ve ever tried to shave.  WTF.  If this is the official product, I&#x27;ll have to change shavers...</li>
    <li> The original shaver head seemed much better.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that it was the same head as the original.  It is not!  It is one solid piece.  The old one could be flipped open and rinsed under the faucet after every use.  This one has to be taken apart to clean it.  Not nearly as happy as with the original head.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Much improved...cleans more easily by far, self sharpening is working.</li>
    <li> A replacement for the original. Not the same and I was disappointed with the not so smooth shave.</li>
    <li> They seem to cut the beard alright, but are more noisy than the original equipment heads.</li>
    <li> Shaves very well but these replacements are very pricey.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a backup for later...</li>
    <li> Poor quality as compared to the original. I expected better for the top of the line razor.</li>
    <li> the price is much better than the the original head that came with the shaver, but it has to be removed from the shaver to be cleaned.</li>
    <li> Lousy product.  Much different than my original head that came with the shaver when I bought it:  Noisy, cheap construction and not easy to clean (individual shaving heads do not &amp;#34;pop up&amp;#34; like the original).  I switched back to my old shaver head (good thing I didn&#x27;t throw it away).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m with most other reviewers:  this thing sucks.  Since Philips has decided to go this route, I&#x27;m shopping for a new razor.  Gaaaa!  Just when I thought I had a keeper!!!  Very unhappy, and will keep this razor in hopes that Philips will go back to the previous replacement (without it costing $200!!).</li>
    <li> I was really worried due to all the negative remarks, but after using the new head, it&#x27;s actually better. The biggest problem with the previous 3-hinges head was emptying the shavings was awkward. It took 2-3 rounds of opening and closing each of the heads to tap out all the shavings, and a few times the clasps came undone, spilling the blades into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design is just two pieces - the blades and the body. Takes two hands, but emptying is now fast. Since it&#x27;s a daily task, it&#x27;s a huge benefit.</li>
    <li> The heads are bigger and are spaced farther away from each other, not allowing for a smooth shave on your chin.  I miss my old blades.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to replace.  Heads work fine.</li>
    <li> As others have already stated hundreds of times, this replacement head is absolutely terrible. It rips at the beard and doesn&#x27;t even get close to the original heads in terms of closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d be better off trying to sharpen an old RQ12 head instead of going with this one.</li>
    <li> Exact Replacement for my razor</li>
    <li> The head works fine but I made the mistake of taking out a blade to clean under it.  It&#x27;s never gone back in and stayed in.  It falls out every single time I use the razor.  I&#x27;m afraid to clean under the other two blades. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> After reading so many negative comments I was almost at the point of ditching the whole system and starting over. However I did buy the new replacement head and these are my comments.  It&#x27;s certainly a lighter accessory than the original, feels lighter and looks / sounds &amp;#34;tinny&amp;#34; by comparison. The empty / clean routine is different, seems awkward at first (and a bit odd to have to re-learn the system when I&#x27;ve had the original flip-open type for 2-3 years). So it looks, feels and sounds different, less heavy duty and cheaper. However.....it actually works quite well and does what it&#x27;s meant to do! I don&#x27;t see any loss of performance just because it&#x27;s a lightweight design etc. It seems to work very well (only 1 week in). It&#x27;s hard to say if it will last the test of time (the old heads were more than good for a year if looked after) so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t throw my Norelco shave system away.</li>
    <li> Works better than original but a little harder to clean</li>
    <li> Babies!  All of you!  That&#x27;s what I was thinking when I read the reviews... too rough... pulling your little hairs... awwww... want a waaaambulance?  Boy was I wrong.  So, I went counter review and ordered.  I mean, how bad could it be.  The answer:  I am sorry.  You were all right.  I simple cannot believe it.  Not only does it suck, but it gets worse every day!  I mean, its up there with sand in your shorts on a hot day with no pool in sight.  Its like the difference between mowing a lawn and weed-wacking it blindfolded.  I can&#x27;t believe they made this thing.  Its now been over a month, and I fear the thing.  Grinding and yanking, missing and rough, it really is junk.  I mean, at the end of the day, why am I looking to replace the entire shaver on Amazon after putting in a new replacement head?  That says it all.  Head the reviews, they aren&#x27;t just whining.</li>
    <li> The changes you made in this shaving head were extremely UN-user friendly. Cleaning the head each time the way you require is a nightmare.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I found this replacement head to actually be better than the original.  Not sure what the fuss is all about, but this head quickly adjusted and my shaves seem to be better than before.  Add to that the fact that future replacement will the blades only, and this seems to a good move by Norelco.  I found the positions of the heads in this item give a better shave and are easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Shaves ok but the squeal it makes is intolerable.  I would not buy this head again.</li>
    <li> Poor compared to the RQ12. Felt the shave was similar to when I got my RQ12 changed out after a year. Poor poor by Norelco not continuing with the RQ 12.</li>
    <li> Not much to add except that the shave is still pretty good but - after 6 months, it is probably time to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I have 2 of the older /52 heads for my 1290x that were ordered by &#x27;accident&#x27; and never returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should keep me going for another couple of years. I&#x27;m a long term user of Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;As others have suggested  -make both heads available.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! Not even close to the original and shaves horribly. Just bought ithe shaver maybe six months prior! Went to order new blades and this piece of crap showed up. The actual replacement is $190 +. I went dark to regular blades. I can&#x27;t replace at $190,might as weekly buy a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> great replacement head, better than the original , fast service could not be more satisfied, thank  ART MERAHN</li>
    <li> Very nice. Worked out great</li>
    <li> my year old head that came with the razor gave me a closer shave than this new??? one.</li>
    <li> I have had some issues with this product getting noisy during operation.  However, I do get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed ... would appreciate more photos so can know for sure this is an replacement part.</li>
    <li> I was very worried reading these other reviews, but could not justify paying the 300% premium on the old, discontinued heads. Glad I got this one - it renewed my old SensoTouch to what feels like a new generation shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You immediately notice that the shave heads are a lot more &amp;#34;agile&amp;#34;, with more angle and easier spring loads, following the contour of your face that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The now metal outer rings make it glide much better and cooler than the previous plastic, and also seem to improve the shave around the edges. I was amazed by how much smoother and closer the shave was with this new head. I couldn&#x27;t cut myself no matter how hard I tried despite my incredibly sensitive skin. (I only use this razor for a wet shave with a cooling shave gel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metal equals resonance, which means this is slightly louder than the old head. It actually helps you because you can HEAR the beard stubble and intuitively know which areas need a second go-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The modular design is a sturdier and more sustainable replacement than the old heads. You will not break them off by dropping your razor, and cleaning is so much quicker and easier. By switching out only the blades or foils when needed, you produce less waste and save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is in the shave, and this instantly convinced me, upgrading my aging SensoTouch 3D to something that properly feels like a new generation of shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased the new RQ 12+ replacement head for my 8000 series shaver and it works really well, better than the original head and cleans much easier. This product is definitely a winner, and as a bonus, Norelco has indicated that they may offer just the rotary blade sets in the future! I think that is a great idea.  This head is much easier to clean and dry than the original attached to the shaver. You don&#x27;t even have to remove the head, just the blade section. Rinsing both the head attached to the shaver and the blade set separately allows both to be cleaned and dried more efficiently. Great job of engineering on this one, Norelco!</li>
    <li> no  very dull do not cut very good</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that with this head it is necessary to remove the entire cutter assembly. The prior RQ12 replacement heads I&#x27;ve bought allowed for each cutter to be opened individually to clean.&lt;br /&gt;What/s the reason?</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Don&#x27;t like the way you remove shave heads.</li>
    <li> Works better than the RQ12 head</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this replacement of the RQ12 for my 1250X 3D.  It doesn&#x27;t glide across my face as smoothly and does not shave as closely.  Plus, the stubble feels sharper than before when it&#x27;s growing back and it does slightly pull at the whiskers while shaving.  I am seriously considering switching away from Norelco after using their products for almost 20 years if this RQ12+ is what they consider their best offering.  Give me my RQ12 head back!!</li>
    <li> Works like the old one - not better; not worse.</li>
    <li> It was fine.  I still prefer the head with the three individual covers.</li>
    <li> Was not the same product as the original</li>
    <li> Not great. As everyone else mentioned, pinches the skin. My cheap razor feels nicer on the skin. It does shave well but feels cheap.  Shame really.</li>
    <li> Would give a no star rating if possible.  What a waste of money.  Does not cut hair properly and leaves alot behind.  Also you experience alot of pulling.  I read the mixed reviews and figured I would give it a shot.  I now wish I would not have.  Norelco needs to understand not to change heads for their shavers if nothing is wrong.  The older heads, RQ12, was great.  Thus new model is horrible.</li>
    <li> With all the negative reviews i&#x27;ve read  here, i was surprised that the replacement head worked so well: very close shave, very quick, and easy glide over all areas of my face.  I purchased this particular replacement head for my aritec shaver, and it fits perfectly.  It even came with a plastic tool to help remove the blades for better cleaning.</li>
    <li> I really got disappointed with the product. I&#x27;m using as a replacement for my Norelco™ Sensotouch 3D, and here what feels off:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is noisier than the original head of SensoTouch&lt;br /&gt;2. it pulls hair, which the original would never do.&lt;br /&gt;3. it doesnt shave smoothly as the original. it does the job, but leaves lots of hair in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave two stars because I deserves credit in how easy it is to replace. But I would neither buy this model again nor recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really wanted an RQ12 and liked the hinged design of that model better for cleaning and drying.</li>
    <li> Terrible Shave.  You don&#x27;t realize how bad it is until you switch back to an original head with 18 months of use and find that it is smoother, closer, less pulling and hurt than this one with 3 months of use.  Only go for the RQ-12 with 3 tracks when the original wears out.  I fully expect to continue using my original well into next year.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Works perfectly.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent replacement cartridge. It seems a lot sturdier than the old rq12, and the curved shape means I don&#x27;t have to press down as hard when shaving my neck. It still has problems lifting hairs that grow flat against the skin, though I suspect using an electric preshave oil would help.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. Do not buy it . The original RQ 12 blades are so superior and most unfortunate these are no longer available. Again do not buy these replacement blades. Its like running a tractor along your face. !</li>
    <li> I think these new heads are fine; they certainly are much better than the old, worn dull heads that I had been using.  For the first couple of days they did seem to irritate my face a bit, but I think my skin was just adjusting to the new, sharper blades. Obviously, there are some people who have had a different experience, but I would recommend trying these before spending lots of money on the original style.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice close shave, but it is very difficult to put back together after cleaning.  Once back together, it falls apart again easily.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement fit.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest.  When I first saw all the bad reviews about this replacement head, I started looking for a different shaver.  I&#x27;m from Ecuador and when I but at Amazon I have to wait about a month to get the products, and then, there is no way I can return the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews at all, this is the best shave I have ever gotten, is even better than the original blades.  It may be a little different, but the construction and the performance is definitely better than the old RQ12.  I feel I have a new shaver and want to shave twice a day because of the nice feeling I get with this replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m crazy or Philips changed this head because of the bad reviews, but I can trully tell you that this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
    <li> A solid improvement over the last head.  Cuts extremely well on broad areas, though not as closely on the lip areas.  Best of all, Norelco has returned to a design that lets you disassemble the cutting heads for cleaning.  Head must be removed from the shaver for charging in the &amp;#34;coffin&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> replaced my 9250&#x27;s RQ12 head with this.&lt;br /&gt;smoother than RQ12, and makes less noise.&lt;br /&gt;for RQ12+ you can replace knives individually not the entire head.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this given all the negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised as it performs better than the original at least for me. Faster shaving times, less passes required, at least as close a shave if not closer, better shaving below the nose, and I do not find it noisier, in fact my wife mentioned that she thinks it&#x27;s quieter than the original. For comparative purposes my original head was 13 months old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side it seems more complicated to clean with more steps and more disassembly required than the old head. A fair trade off for a faster shave in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there have been different iterations of this new head, the earlier ones being poorer quality, hence the poor reviews. This one works well.</li>
    <li> Because of all of the bad reviews I waited to see how the replacement head worked for me over the course of 4 months. First the blades do not shave as well as the original blades. Second they are better than the replacement blades that are listed for my shaver model. I researched and found these blades would also fit my razor model but using them makes the razor no longer fit in the original travel case which is not a deal breaker because of the better shave. Third comparing the original RQ12 blades to this replacement blade the original RQ12 blades were of a much higher build quality that had to cost more to make so it is certain that costs were cut to increase profits on these blades. Fourth I can understand why the people who purchased the high end shaver this replacement head is for are upset with the quality of the replacement head since the shave quality did decrease. Fifth I can live with it because of the quality of the shaver and that these blades do shave better than the original blades and replacements for my shaver model. The shaver model I have is 1060X and the replacement blades listed for it are RQ10 which were terrible compared to the blades that came with the shaver which did not make sense since they were supposed to be the same.</li>
    <li> These are of a different design than the original  I got with the razor.  Needs getting used to and not sure if I really like them.</li>
    <li> Because of the plethora of negative reviews I waited three weeks and over 20 shaves with the new blades before writing this review. In some ways I think the negativity is overblown ,in others ,totally justified. Whats OK: 1) the new system cleans easy and well, just different from the original system.In some ways it is a throwback to the way the older and cheaper XL&#x27;s cleaned. It takes a little longer to remove the blades from the head, and yes you get your hand wet holding them under the hot water , and yes you need to let them dry before you return them to the head. But so what really. They clean well and just as quickly as the originals. 2) Yes they are a little noisier than the original system, but not to the point of being an intrusion to the music on the radio , and it is not an unusual or irritating noise. It sounds like , well, an electric shaver. 3) The shave at first was not as good as the original     head/blades.However after a couple of weeks and paying some attention to what I was doing ,it got to be acceptable and in fact comparable to the shave with the original head/blades. But with a couple of caveats. It takes longer to get the same result and requires more pass overs with the razor. Whats Not So OK : 1) The shave is not nearly as comfortable and smooth . I never noticed a feeling of pulling or tearing whiskers with the original blade system, I do with this one .Just not the same smooth, comfortable shave. 2)Battery life is shortened because the shave takes longer .3) The new system looks bulky ,cumbersome sitting on the head of my senso touch 1250X . Whats Unacceptable : What I find unacceptable and utterly inexplicable is Philips/Norelcos&#x27; complete disregard for its customer base and their obvious dissatisfaction with the new blades and the way they have been foisted on the customers. What was done was essentially a major change to the design and operation of a very popular product. Seems to me that from a purely &amp;#34;customer satisfaction &amp;#34;point of view Norelco at a minimum should have left the option to continue to buy the original head/blade system for those that wanted to do so .They didn&#x27;t and so the only way to get the original-system replacements is to pay astronomical prices to merchants , for what was already an expensive system. If Norelco had continued to make the original system available as an option of choice we would not see the price gouging that is going on .I think Philips/Norelco owed that to its customer base. I will continue to use the shaver,with the new blades.Hopefully the replacement blades will be reasonably priced when I need them because they will not come with a base, it will be just the shaving blades. But I will never feel the same loyalty and comfort I have in the past when purchasing a Philips or Norelco product, given the way they have treated their customers in this fiasco. And I will give much more attention to whatever competitive product is out there.  Update 4/29/2015 ,after thinking more about my dissatisfaction with the new blades I asked myself why I was putting up with mediocrity in the shaving experience and the shaving result . Answer, because I have always used Norelco shavers . Not much of a reason to suffer mediocrity every  morning 365 days a year is it ? I went on line ,did a lot of research on alternative electric shavers, wound up focusing on Braun , Series 5 &amp; Series 7 . Got one of each to try and wound up keeping the Series 7 ,which I plan to review on the proper web page for that product. The point however is that I am now again satisfied with my shaving experience ,and the daily shaving result , Perhaps that is what we should all do, move on to another product,and perhaps Philips/Norelco will get the message going forward.</li>
    <li> Think I liked the original better but this one works just fine</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with these replacement heads, one of the blades does not stay fastened.</li>
    <li> It is not what I thought I was ordering</li>
    <li> Works great, don&#x27;t know if it will hold sharpness yet.</li>
    <li> Not the original. This unit is much noisier than the original cutter supplied with the razor. However, seems as though it cuts almost as well (not quite, but almost). Certainly, given the price, seems worthy of 4 stars. My original cutter/foil lasted me 8-9 months. Have had this one about 6 weeks. I feel as though I had to retrain my beard to this cutter. If the original was an A-, this one is a solid B.</li>
    <li> while the razor head gives a excellent shave, every time I take the head off to clean it, one of the blade circles falls out of the unit. When I get home I am going to ask for a exchange</li>
    <li> Fewer missed hairs and a closer cut than the RQ10 this replaces. When the shavers become dull, they can be replaced independent of the head, unlike the RQ10, which was an entire replacement head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for over 40 years.  This is the last Norelco product I will buy.  While Norelco recommends replacing heads every year I usually replace them at six to nine months.  These new design heads are not much better than the almost nine month old heads I am replacing.  The quality of the heads is a far cry of what they used to be.  Looks like another company is sacrificing quality for profitability.  When these replacement heads ware out I will be looking for a new electric razor.  Braun and Panasonic come to mind.</li>
    <li> This is a cheaply made unit that does NOT give the same shave as the original unit.  Furthermore, one of the 3 rotors popped out after 1 week and the plastic ring that holds it in is impossible to seal.  The video on the Amazon site shows a plastic device to push it back, but this does not come with the replacement.  For  the price of a new original shaver head from Norelco, I can buy a lot of razors</li>
    <li> I have a 1290 (Series 8000) and love the shave with the included old head (RQ12). Close shave, sometimes a bit too close with skin irritation, but the cleaning was a breeze - I&#x27;d pop up each head like the petals of a flower, tap out the hair, then rinse under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I dropped it whilst these heads were open, and bent the cages out of shape. Couldn&#x27;t find any RQ12 replacements until the new ones came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Better shave for me!&lt;br /&gt;Less skin irritation, closer in my opinion. Not so sure about the complaints regarding noise - they both have a whirring noise that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Annoying to clean. I have to lift all-three heads off to tap out the hair. And not so easy to rinse out. But then once I&#x27;ve rinsed out - I can&#x27;t leave it popped open like the old head.</li>
    <li> New design from Norelco for the 3D shavers.  Great shave.</li>
    <li> I was looking at buying a  Norelco RQ12 Replacement Head SensoTouch 3D, but after seeing the heart stopping price for the original head and the comments on the cheaper plastic replacements I will not be making any purchase.  I have always wanted an excuse to try another brand and now it looks like Norelco has given me the ok to leave them.</li>
    <li> This is a very disappointing replacement. I would not buy this head again. If the old head RQ12/52 is no longer&lt;br /&gt;available , I will have to change shavers. Plus I have never seen what they are getting for the old head.&lt;br /&gt;Anywhere from over $100.00 to $200.00. They use to be around $35.00 each. Norelco really made a big&lt;br /&gt;mistake on trying to change a good thing.</li>
    <li> It was not clear if this was a replacement head for my 3D Sensor razor, or not. The head fits ok but it is not the same head that came with the original razor. The original head had a means of cleaning them by opening the cutting heads, this one does not, nor does it come with instructions on how to clean the cutting heads. I will need to do some research to get that answer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think cleaning this head is hard. I think the fact that the blades are securely in place is good-they cannot fall out and go down the sink.  My dog chewed up the original RQ12 shave head so I did not have much time to assess it. They were not that much easier to clean than these RQ12+.  I would say these heads do not give a closer shave than the old style norelco shavers and you can buy one of those shavers for the cost of these heads.</li>
    <li> This is a total piece of junk.  It is hard to work with, does not give a good shave as the original RQ 12 that was part of the original very expensive razor that gave great shaves with a head replacement every six months. Then that head was under $50 until some time this year when they came out with this piece of junk.  Now the original head is now $160 +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No choice but to scrap a great and expensive razor body, and look for something else.  I have used Norelco products for decades without ever a complaint.  No more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can not believe they would come out with a poorly designed piece of trash to replace the original RQ-12 head.</li>
    <li> I was confused at first because these heads did not look like the previous heads.  I thought I had ordered the wrong product.  Yet, these are the new style heads that turn out to be better than the old ones and allow consumers to purchase the blades individually rather than having to purchase the whole head.  Explanation of this change would be helpful.</li>
    <li> This new head is terrible compared to the old one. It pulls (painfully!) whereas the old one never did. It also doesn&#x27;t flex outward the same way resulting in missed spots. They market the SensoTouch 3D razors as having a head that moves in three directions (hence the 3D), but this one doesn&#x27;t. Only two. So how is this a 3D? Bring the old RQ12 back!</li>
    <li> Apparently Norelco states this is a replacement for the 3D SensoTouch. I want to emphasize &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; and not 2D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I say this is because the 3D SensoTouch allows the three heads to move freely from each other. It&#x27;s kind of hard to explain, but the 2D model allows the heads to tilt inwards and had a solid outer shell/housing that did not allow them to separate from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought the 3D SensoTouch model, this was the feature I liked most. It lets the heads split and move/tilt outwards and inwards. With this new replacement head model, you are actually getting the downgraded edition. So you basically downgraded your 3D model for the 2D model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the above shady tactic, the shaver head is just not good, plain and simple, which is really unfortunate. I get a worse shave and more tugs with this replacement. This was an expensive mistake and now I may to leave Norelco altogether since I don&#x27;t have a replacement head that&#x27;s not garbage to buy.</li>
    <li> I have to change my review: initially I didn&#x27;t like the new replacement head. I have to admit it is far easier to clean and the shave is just as good. It&#x27;s plastic instaedvof metal, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Philips Consumer Lifestyle (U.S. vendor for Norelco shavers) should continue to make BOTH the original RQ12/52 and their newer head RQ12+ (or RQ12/62) available for users of SensoTouch 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many careful users of the superbly made SensoTouch 3D top-of-the-line 1290x find that the original RQ12/52 head GLIDES MORE SMOOTHLY (especially over sensitive neck areas) and has LESS PULLING or TUGGING than the new replacement head. I have carefully evaluated both heads on the 1290x, and that is also my conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that the original RQ12/52 had THREE tracks in each of the three circular heads (including the tiny holes in the center track for stubble). The new RQ12+ has only TWO tracks in each of the three circular heads, including the new V-channel outer track. There is no inner track of tiny holes for stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHILIPS (Philips Consumer Lifestyle)--Are you listening?--Make BOTH of these heads available for your SensoTouch 3D customers. And let the customer decide which head is preferred. Don&#x27;t FORCE them to use the RQ12+!</li>
    <li> This replacement head turned my $250 razor into a $29.99 one... Problem is that there&#x27;s no other choice. I feel deceived.</li>
    <li> What a bunch of bull.  Spent $250 on the Sensotouch 8000 series and I get this crappy replacement head as the only option to keep it going.  The original head shaved the best of any I had ever had, and flipped up for easy cleaning.  It was durable.  It felt and looked like a great product.  I will be returning this product and I hope they lose money for this terrible idea.</li>
    <li> One head to snap off an clean is much better than the old three heads that had to be cleaned one at a time.</li>
    <li> Its awesome! Much better to clean and shaves better too. Hurts a bit with a 5+ days beard.</li>
    <li> Hello, Hello! Does anyone remember the comb and cutter blade replacement for all the previous Norelco models? If you can remove and clean the blades on the 8000 series, why not make parts to replace them? You all know the answer to that,</li>
    <li> I cannot believe norelco could put their name on a product this poorly made</li>
    <li> Compared to the previous version of the original Q12s, these new razors are a lot worse than expected. The new design does not provide a close and pleasant experience, and shaving takes a lot more time than with the original design. Overall, poor experience but I don&#x27;t think there is an alternative if you want to keep the shaving machine.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement head with a lot of doubt given all of the negative reviews.  Because the 1290x shaver that I have is by far the best shaver I have ever owned, I had to give it a try.  This head is different than the one that it replaces in several important ways.  First, I think that this shaves even closer than the previous model (however I am replacing an old head with a new one and the gradual degradation of the old head may account for the difference.)  Second, the blade section flexes more than the old head, the head section no longer flexes.  This change does not bother me at all since it has not affected the comfort of my shave and as mentioned above the shave is closer.  The third major change is that the three heads no longer swivel up for cleaning, but instead come off as one unit.  It is possible that this may aid in cleaning, but I have not noticed a difference.  My preference was for the blades swiveling up which allowed me to store the shave as one unit while drying, now it has to be stored with the shaver unit as always and blade section separate.  I considered removing a half star for this, but it is not possible.  Another important factor to consider and other reviewers were quite helpful in pointing out  is that there can be a tendency to pull or tug a little -- by applying slightly less pressure, the pulling or tugging stops.  If you are an Arcitec owner, this is a huge upgrade.  I use my old Arcitec as a travel shave and had previously changed the head on that to the old RQ12.  It was not advertised but it upgraded that model to effectively be a Senso-Touch 3d.  Now Norelco advertises that the new RQ12+ is compatible with the Arcitec.  Finally I have also learned from the package insert and confirmed with Norelco that SH 90 replacement blades can be used in this head unit saving between $5 and $10 for the next replacement.  I find it interesting that the new 9000 series using the same cutting system has received excellent reviews whilethis product has received so many poor reviews.  UPDATE 11/28/15 -- Rating lowered from 5 stars to 1 star.  After 10 1/2 months, the head stopped working properly and shrieks without turning two of the three spindles.  It sounds like a gear broke inside.  I called Philips and escalated to a supervisor.  This call was a waste of time.  Philips will do nothing about their problems other than offer a 15% discount (still more expensive than the undiscounted Amazon price).  They are aware of the negative reviews (even lower on their site), but insist that this is a superior product and are not willing to make good.  After being a Philips Norelco user for more than 40 years, it may be time to change.  When a company is unwilling to stand behind their product, why should anyone purchase that product?</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.This replacement head is a real cheap version of the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt that I will continue use of Norelco razors in the future.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as well as the original. Also, it seems to be less well made.</li>
    <li> What a fine example of &amp;#34;don&#x27;t try to fix what ain&#x27;t broken!&amp;#34;. Philips, I&#x27;m so disappointed in you! The RQ12 head was a beauty, an absolute masterpiece of a shaver head. The new head (RQ12+) is just the opposite. It&#x27;s a very rough shave and pulls of hair to the point that I can&#x27;t use this head when I haven&#x27;t shaven for about 2-3 days. With the RQ12, it was a breeze no matter how long my hair had gotten. Didn&#x27;t expect such a substandard product from Philips on their flagship rotary shaver. And, guess what? The original RQ12s are now selling on Amazon and eBay for over $160 for just the head! There&#x27;s like this black market for the RQ12s. Philips, do that right thing, recall this crappy product, and just bring the old heads back. That&#x27;s it! Or, you&#x27;ll have one less loyal customer.</li>
    <li> Tried these as a replacement for my Senso Touch 3D.  My one year old used genuine original 3D blades were better than this new version replacement. New ones were quite uncomfortable and could not deliver nearly as good a shave result as the prior version.  I will not &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to the 9000 series since they also use these &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version blades.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointing.  I plan to buy a different brand of electric razor!!!!!  Loved the old head which is way too expensive for what you get!!</li>
    <li> I used the old version for two years and I was afraid to buy this new one after reading the horrible reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I find them very comparable, no change in blade quality, shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism to clean the blades has changed but this replacement head i just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand why the other customers are so unhappy.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  The heads wore out after 6 months, not 12 like the package and Norelco state, and after 6 months, the shave hurt.  To make matters worse, the plastic cover broke and I&#x27;m having difficulty finding a replacement because the stated replacement only fits the RQ12, not the RQ12+.  I like the new design, but it&#x27;s frustrating they didn&#x27;t last.  These are expensive to be replaces every 6m.    I don&#x27;t get it.  There&#x27;s so much hatred towards this replacement head with people saying it&#x27;s noisy, harder to clean, doesn&#x27;t cut as well, blah blah blah.  Is this an upgrade from the original RQ12?  Not really.  It is a more than suitable replacement?  Definitely.  Look, my old RQ12 head was duller than a butter knife.  I popped this one on, and it was like a brand new razor.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s any harsher pulling than the old head.  It&#x27;s a LITTLE noisier, but come on, you&#x27;re shaving for a couple minutes as most per day, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to give you hearing damage.  I find that this head traps my hair better than the old RQ12, which just dumped hair out everywhere and made a mess on the counter and sink.  With the new design, more hair is collected in the head and less on my bathroom counter.  I think it&#x27;s a wash as to which is easier to clean, the old flip up heads were more convenient, but this design isn&#x27;t bad.  Bottom line, I wouldn&#x27;t believe the one and 2 star reviews, this is a solid performer and I think it&#x27;s great Norelco is back to replaceable shaving heads and combs rather than having to replace the whole head assembly.  Of course, if you want to spend 3x and buy an original RQ12, go right ahead.</li>
    <li> This RQ12+ shaver head replacement works very well.  After reading all the very negative reviews, I didn&#x27;t know whether to get this replacement head or invest in a new shaver.  I decided to take a chance on the RQ12+.  Yes, it has more plastic parts than the original shaver head, and feels flimsier, and doesn&#x27;t flip up for cleaning like the original.  But it shaves just fine, much better than my original that had gotten dull from use.  And it&#x27;s not difficult to clean - cleaning is different from the original, but maybe better results.  I am very satisfied with the RQ12+.  (For a lot more details about this, see the review by Viper Tech dated Jan13, 2015.  I agree with Viper Tech.)</li>
    <li> The replacement head works fine. The only issue I have is one of the three orange rings that holds the blades in place is defective and keeps coming off. I have tried switching it around to different positions but it continues to dislodge. I have tried to find a replacement for it, even from Philips, but no one sells just that part. I have to buy a whole new replacement head again. Wish there was an option...</li>
    <li> Good product, fast Delivery, Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This head was hard to confirm that it was for my razor model, but I took a chance and it fit easily and delivers a smooth and quiet shave. My previous razor head broke completely, so the razor was not usable. It is now, and I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to update this as in cleaning the razor, I took the rotating cutting head out of one of the head cylinders; putting it back together has proven impossible, despite following instructions and using the tool that was sent.  I delayed replacing it, as I was convinced that I could reassemble. I have to give up, spend more time reinserting parts than it takes to shave. I still like it, just don&#x27;t follow instructions to take it apart to clean.</li>
    <li> heads are not what I have been receiving, they are big and rough plastic, I guess they are making them more inexpensive I believe Phillips Norelco have stopped caring about quality and their customers. this is not the fault of amazon</li>
    <li> This replacement is better than the original. I like that subsequent replacements require only replacement of the cutter blades, and not a complete head.</li>
    <li> My original head was way better.....where can i get one like it?</li>
    <li> Sorry Norelco.  You really blew it on this one.  This suppose to be the replacement for my RQ12 blade to use for my Norelco SensoTouch 3D.  I use my razor wet for shaving my head.  It use to take me about 5-8 mins to do my head and face.  Now, with this blade, it takes 5 times longer because I have to keep going over and over the same spot for it to cut it all the way to the skin.  I&#x27;ve call Norelco to complain, and they say, of well, &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34;.  We&#x27;ll let customer service know.  Sadly, I have a $100+ razor that now doesn&#x27;t work properly.  Sure, you can find the old RQ12 replacements if you want to spend $150.  Come on Norelco, bring back the RQ12 blade replacement or I&#x27;ll have no choice but to start looking at a different brand.  Update: 3/26/15 Using this blade for almost 2 months now, I&#x27;m becoming more and more frustrated with it.  My SensoTouch 3D is no longer considered a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; razor because this RQ12+ doesn&#x27;t work wet.  Now, all I can do is shave dry and take over 4 times longer to shave than I use to.  I&#x27;m waiting patiently for Norelco to come back out with the old RQ12 blade.  If not, I will have no choice but to find another brand.  Any recommendations?  Update: 4/16/15 Don&#x27;t waste your time waiting for Philips Norelco to bring back the original RQ12 replacement blade.   Go purchase a Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System for Men.  I did, and it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  I used it for the 1st time last night over my head (I&#x27;m bald) and face, and it&#x27;s the closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.  It was just as close as a regular blade.  It cost a bit, but it is totally worth it.  I will never go back to a Philips Norelco razor because of what they did with the RQ12 replacement blade.</li>
    <li> This head may be quieter than the one that came with my razor, but the shave quality is not as good as the 1 yr old head. Really.</li>
    <li> I cannot imagine who would have designed this replacement head. I don&#x27;t know how I am ever gonna clean it after using it.</li>
    <li> Not really liking the redesigned head.  For me, it actually now does not work as well as the original RQ12.  I&#x27;ve switched back to blades for now.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver head I ever had the blades wirk great</li>
    <li> First, I do agree with a lot of people on here...It&#x27;s sub-optimal construction for a major company like this (feels and looks &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; and yet costs about the same as the old head), significantly more painful if you don&#x27;t shave every day, takes more passes to get all the hair than previous model, less convenient to clean, etc.) And yes, I&#x27;m disappointed in Norelco for making this change.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s not ALL bad. This new one definitely holds the cut hairs a lot better. (Old model, I had to stand over the sink to not make a mess. New one, I can wander around while shaving.) And I&#x27;m hoping the fact that you only change the blades and not the entire head will translate to lower cost of ownership.&lt;br /&gt;So it has some redeeming qualities. But, overall, compared to the older head, I would certainly say I&#x27;m disappointed in Norelco.</li>
    <li> Downgrade to the previous model. The plastic looks and feels cheap. Shaving results are not as good but it gets the job done. Not gonna buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this blade.  When I first received it, it shaved really well. However, the quality decreased incredibly fast.  I started hearing grinding noises while shaving and needed to spend a considerable amount more time shaving, just to get all the hairs.  The ease of cleaning issue really didn&#x27;t bother me too much. However, the original RQ12 was a nicer process.  I am very happy with Amazon though.  Since it shaved well at first, I didn&#x27;t hang onto the packaging.  They still took it back and gave a full refund!  I am going to try out a Braun Series 7 which is a shame, since I really liked my 1280x.  There is also no guarantee I will like the Braun anyway.  I am using my worn out RQ12 blade while i am waiting for the Braun to arrive.  I must say, my worn out RQ12 shaves better than the 3 week old RQ12+.  The whole thing is frustrating and I have written Norelco a couple times about it.  They have stated, they are not going to be addressing the issue.  It really doesn&#x27;t seem fair for me to have to invest in a new razor when I have one that works just fine.  I just need a new blade of equal quality to the original.  This blade was a bad call made by Norelco.ling with on the original design.</li>
    <li> I would have prefered blade replacements instead of the head replacement.  The original head seemed to be much more stout and gave a better shave. I have been a Norelco user for 20 years and this replacement head is the first disappointment I have had.</li>
    <li> It worked just fine! and it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper than the other product. I would buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lucky I purchased a spare 12 months ago,</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. One of the plastic pieces (the Orange circle) has broken and I have to reset it manually each time I shave. The head is of much lower quality than the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement head for the Model 1250X 3D, do not like it at all, it does not save like the old Head, not happy with it., will try to find some one to sharp my old blades. Glenn</li>
    <li> When I bought my SensoTouch 3D razor (with the factory RQ12 head), I thought it was the best razor I ever had. After 18 months, I figured it was time to replace the head. Despite the negative reviews for this replacement, I figured I would try it. After all, there is no other choice for less than the cost of a new razor. In short, all the negative reviews are right. This thing takes, no exaggeration, three times as long to shave, does a much worse job even after that, and irritates my skin far more. I gave it a month, hoping it would get better. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am incredibly disappointed in Philips for selling this garbage and am telling everyone I know to stay away from their razors now. I am now looking to replace my razor after less than two years - my prior Braun, even though it did not shave as well as my Philips (prior to this worthless replacement head), lasted 10 years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get lower than one. Terrible product. Only bought it because it was supposed to be the newer, improved version. Bad shave. Pulls. Doesn&#x27;t open like the old heads. I cleaned it using the system I got with my original razor. Always liked Philips Norelco, but this was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> This item broke after 1 use!!!! it has changed from the original razor configuration, and is HORRIBLE</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t making the original replacement blades so they force you to buy the head. It&#x27;s not as good as the original but it&#x27;ll have to do.</li>
