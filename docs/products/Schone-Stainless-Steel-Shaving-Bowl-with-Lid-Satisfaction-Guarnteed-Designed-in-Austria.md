<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This has been a great addition to the shave den. The Stainless Steel looks great and it cleans up easily.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped a Mitchells wool fat soap puck in it and it fit perfectly. I use this bowl to load up my brush and do the lathering in another&lt;br /&gt;bowl. I then rinse out the soapy foam left behind, drain well, and dry off the outside. It looks like a matched set sitting next to my SS razor/brush stand. I get loads of compliments from our guests. I think Stainless Steel is the way to go, don&#x27;t mess with chrome plating or even worse, (IMO), wood or plastic. You&#x27;re so close, don&#x27;t get cheap on yourself now, you will regret it later.</li>
    <li> Works great, nice look!</li>
    <li> This Shaving Bowl is very nicely designed, looks like silver. Could be used as a decorative container for many&lt;br /&gt;other things. Has a nice etching on the side too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and being all stainless,will not rust which is I,portent when storing moistened soap cakes after using. The lid fits tight.I own two.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  You can get the same quality crap at Walmart for cheaper.  I sent this back because you can just tell that it will rust after a couple weeks use.</li>
    <li> Happy with the seller and shipping/packaging. The product on the other hand is ok at best (so far). The cup produces a decent foam when working with shave cream. It is light, thin walled metal.  Because of that, it does not retain heat well and floats in a sink of hot water so you can&#x27;t keep your cream hot. Might be better suited to a puck of soap only. I just started DE shaving and plan to eventually try some soaps as well especially because of the ease of travelling with them through airport checkpoints as opposed to creams. When that time comes, if I remember I will update my review. If you are a cream user, I would not buy this product and would stick with a ceramic mug.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful shaving bowl, my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Nicely crafted. Fits perfectly with the rest of my shave set</li>
    <li> This bowl is nicely made of polished stainless steel and comes with a matching lid that fits perfectly .&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this shaving bowl to anyone looking for a quality made wet shaving bowl .</li>
    <li> I thought it was double lined. It does fine whipping up the cream, but it does not keep it warm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of weeks now. I really like it. I haven&#x27;t had any issues and it is a high quality item. The shape and curved middle make it easy to hold while using the shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Good size and shape.  Well formed.  Metal gauge a little thin would be great if it was thicker.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shaving bowl, just keep in mind that because it&#x27;s stainless steel it will conduct heat. I like to fill the bowl with hot water while I&#x27;m soaking the brush (soaking the brush in a mug), then dump it out so some water remains to build the lather, but using especially hot water to do this results in the bowl being hot to handle. Really not a big deal though, and I&#x27;m not sure my habit makes much sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the bowl looks very nice and cleans up very easily.</li>
    <li> Nicely polished bowl with a small depression in the bottom to hold a puck of shave soap. It sits well in the palm of the hand. The lid fits inside securely enough to flip upside down. I&#x27;m basically pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;m fairly new to this type of shaving and still getting the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s too small to actually use as a lathering bowl.  But it&#x27;s shiny and looks good on the shelf.  I use it to keep small stuff in, so it&#x27;s still useful, so I still like it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shaving bowl, but really I prefer Tank Riot</li>
    <li> Great for whipping up cream or the old soap puck. Feels manly, but looks so much better than a ceramic mug. The cover will keep your pucks nice for reuse. It&#x27;s remarkably light and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Very attractive bowl with a nice etching on the bottom. I&#x27;d say the one drawback is that the metal is a little thin and &amp;#34;tinny&amp;#34;, but overall it&#x27;s a nice piece and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Well made, though I don&#x27;t use it for travel so the lid isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> Cheap thin metal. Not worth the price. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did buying this thing.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> very plain but stylish. Exactly what I was looking for. have not had any corrosion or dulling of the finish.</li>
    <li> Slightly larger than you&#x27;d think</li>
    <li> I liked this bowl because it had a lid and seemed to be the right size. I rinse off the soap of excess foam after my shave, put the lid on and it is ready to go next time. Bowl is shiny and goes well in our bathroom so no problem leaving it up in the sink. No complaints from the Missus so far!</li>
    <li> Well built. The lid keeps thing out and the soap in. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Matches my shaving set fits all regular sized pucks as well as being a great receptacle for larger soaps that you need to grate or cut into smaller pieces.&lt;br /&gt;As long as it lasts should be worth the price.</li>
    <li> Quality stainless steel product, very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Great quality product and has the perfect size. Looks great on the countertop too</li>
    <li> Well made, soap pucks fit loosely inside but lather up good.</li>
    <li> It really holds the heat. I run my brush under hot water and hold the bowl tight in my hand.  There&#x27;s nothing better than hot soap on your face!  I&#x27;ve used other kinds of bowls (wood, ceramic) and they just don&#x27;t hold the heat like advertised.  Boo on cold soap on your face.</li>
    <li> Very nice finish, but not as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Looks great on the counter top and works as described. What more do you want from a product?</li>
    <li> Reasonably nice shaving bowl.  Chrome is shiny and unscratched on arrival, and the lid fits tightly and well.  The shape keeps your shaving foam from getting out of the bowl (mostly), and is large enough that you can use pretty much any shaving soap in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue keeping it from five stars is that the metal is not quite as thick as I&#x27;d like, so it lacks a little heft and will slide around while you&#x27;re whipping up a good lather.  If you hold it (as I do) this problem goes away.  It&#x27;s not so thin it deforms in my hand during use, but I&#x27;ve no doubt it would pick up nasty dents though if it were dropped.</li>
    <li> clean look, deep enough to work up a good lather. steel is thin enough so it doesn&#x27;t leech off heat</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving soap holder. Thank you</li>
    <li> Due, in part, to the overall positives reviews on Amazon, I bought this item.  On the positive side, it is very shiny, which is nice, and rinses well too.  Moreover, it seems to function well as a lather bowl.  However, there are two issues with this bowl that are very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the metal is EXTREMELY thin.  By thin, I mean extremely thin.  Indeed, their simple logo stamp at the bottom of the piece makes an indention on the inside of the bowl.  Moreover, I suspect the box in which this bowl was delivered was heavier than the actual bowl itself.  Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the knob that holds the top cover is not centered.  From the top something seemed off and then looked inside the lid and noticed that the screw was not centered.  This shows extremely poor craftsmanship.  If I have the time I will try and take a picture of this and post it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.  Yes.</li>
    <li> Does the job well,lid is secure.</li>
    <li> I Love my Schone stainless shaving mug !</li>
    <li> I was expected something more heavy-duty for twenty dollars. It is pretty light and tinny. It had a small dent in it when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Very nicely made.  Vendor ships real fast, too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bowl. The chrome is shiny and flawless and it makes lathering up my shave soap much mroe enjoyable than when I was using a regular bowl out of my kitchen. Looks great with the rest of my shaving gear. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this bowl.  Thin yet sturdy and wont dent from being dropped on the counter or floor.  Heat transfers quickly so you can place it in a sink of hot water to warm up your soap.  Having a lid for my soap it also a great plus.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I&#x27;ve used this for months to store my Taylor&#x27;s for use. Far more convenient than the plastic tub.  Only takes 2 minutes to transfer from the original tub, far more convenient afterwards.</li>
    <li> Quality product, I would have added some sort of cleating on the bottom to mold onto and keep the soap in place during brushing.</li>
    <li> Bought 5 of these for gifts and they kick butt.  Much better than the wooden ones you see on Amazon.  Fit and finish is excellent with plenty of room for soap.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Everything I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as it looks.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> It is what it is and is a nice product and performs the job.</li>
    <li> The good:  The shape is good and it lathers well.  The finish is smooth and the lit fits correctly. The price is reasonable and the shipment was quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  The stainless is very thin, light gauge.  That makes this feel cheep, like a tin cup, when you are holding it.  It feels like it will dent the first time that I drop it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaving bowl. Durable finish and it is large enough to take a 3-inch diameter puck of soap. The only difference between it and the competing Apollo is the Apollo name on the side of the bowl. They are obviously made by the same manufacturer. (I have both.) If the Apollo name is worth $5 to you, go for it. I prefer this nameless version. (It does have Schöne on the bottom.)</li>
    <li> Works great, looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> Awesome container! Shiny, and looks great.  Good size, I can really whip up a lather in no time.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t believe I spent 20$ on this....&lt;br /&gt;With a 7$ price tag I would give this 5 stars and recommend it. However, at the current price point this is not even close to worth it. I spent 20$ on my cast iron pan that&#x27;s lasted me years and now I&#x27;ve spent 20$ on a tiny tin can. When you hold it, you know it&#x27;s cheaply made. Sorry guys, this is definitely not the one you want.</li>
    <li> High quality. Looks great in the bathroom and holds my melted puck of soap perfectly. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful.... Holds soap perfectly and the signature on the bottom was an added touch that my husband loved! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Beautiful shaving bowl. Fits large cakes of shaving soap easily.</li>
    <li> Great bowl.  It is very clean and contemporary looking, and the ideal size (it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space).  Nice product and great price.</li>
    <li> A great container for shave soap that is also very good looking on your sink or shelf.</li>
    <li> Nice bowel for mixing shaving cream!!</li>
    <li> Nice well made shaving bowl with lid.  Right size and looks good on the sink.</li>
    <li> Flawless chrome finish.  Size is just right (not too big, not too small).  Not flimsy.</li>
    <li> Very nice product I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Good looking and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> Schon in German means beautiful and by any translation of the word, this stainless steel shaving bowl is a true beauty! Highly polished stainless with a lid that fits perfectly, this piece makes a perfect shave accessory to any one who still appreciates the fine art of shaving with a brush. Originally designed in Austria, the wider Bombay style base adds distinction and eye appealing aesthetic in contrast to the usual bland shave bowls on the market. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, this piece has been copied by other providers, manufactured in India and is available throughout the web under a myriad of brands. Look for the engraved Schon logo on the bottom to ensure you are purchasing the original Austrian design (the &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; at the end is left off for aesthetics and correct German spelling, while the company has added it for easier American pronunciation and corporate recognition). At the current sale price, the Schone Stainless Steel Shaving Bowl with Lid is truly a stainless steal!</li>
    <li> Splendid bowl, I love it.</li>
    <li> Best bowl I have ever had. It takes the large soap heat up with hot water and does not flood the soap.</li>
    <li> Nice little bowl and it fits my merkur safety razor and badger brush for storage. It has not shown any signs of rusting so far so I am pleasedan with this so far.</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s a perfect size and it looks good in the bathroom next to the stand that holds my badger shaving brush &amp; razor</li>
    <li> Very nicely designed- finish looks very durable, seems like it will last quite awhile.  Its bigger than the cake soap I use, but really doesn&#x27;t affect anything.  Well pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Other reviews were spot on. Excellent finish, good looking on the sink countertop, good weight and feel to it. As noted the top is slightly smaller than the bottom, but standard 3&amp;#34; shaving soaps fit.</li>
    <li> Great looking bowl and appears to be well made.  The puck of shaving soap fits in perfectly.  I mix the lather right in the bowl and it works better than anticipated.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my shaving soap out of sight.  After putting the puck in, I have to be very careful not to throw the foam everywhere.  I wish this was a little deeper.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking... love the polished stainless.  I expected the bowl to contain a little more heft which is why I took away a star, but it&#x27;s functionally and aesthetically fine just the way it is.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery good product!!</li>
    <li> Just go tthis in but it is exactly identical to the &amp;#34;Apollo&amp;#34; branded one I have had that cost $6 more.  These are decent little stainless shaving bowls.  Do yourself a favor if your also looking at the &amp;#34;Apollo&amp;#34; branded bowl and buy the Schone brand......exact same and save money!</li>
    <li> Would be nice if the bowl had a little more weight to it so the lid pulled out without picking the bowl up at the same time, but overall, a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is very well-built. It&#x27;s solid construction will last you a lifetime</li>
    <li> This is a very nice wet shave bowl.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s stout in quality, so my clumsy wife can&#x27;t break it knocking it off the sink, and the lid prevents her from spilling any of her stuff in my soap.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s strong enough for me to drop a new soap puck in, and set the bowl over a cook top on low heat and melt the soap to the bottom of the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;My brush lathers up well in it, and it was less than 20 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;It can still get dents and dings, but that should add to the character.&lt;br /&gt;And you can engrave this with words to live by, or a monogram, etc.</li>
    <li> I  received just what I was looking for and works as described. And with prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful looking shaving bowl, but it feels like I&#x27;m holding a piece of aluminum foil in my hand because it&#x27;s so light. When you pull the lid off, the bowl lifts up with it.  Definitely needs to be heavier to avoid this minor problem.  I can&#x27;t believe something stainless steel is this flimsy.  It is attractive and does the job though and not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a a very handsome bowl with cover, and I&#x27;m enjoying it both visually and in daily use.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s good enough for its purpose.</li>
    <li> The metal is very thin, but overall looks great. Fits a puck of shaving soap (in my case L&#x27;occitane Cade soap) perfectly. The base of the bowl is wider than the opening/top. So had to squeeze the soap in but fit into the base. Highly recommend this bowl. It claims to be 100% stainless steel. We shall see if it can last without corroding or rusting</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband Christmas present. He loves it very much!</li>
    <li> If your&#x27;re using soap for shaving then a bowl comes in handy, but it is not 100% necessary. This one is quite pretty: but it&#x27;s thinner than it looks (nothing nowadays is made the way they used to be); and I would be very careful in cleaning it as the steel might retain scratches</li>
    <li> Another example of a nice, but kind of ho-hum product at a very low price that Amazon reviewers go crazy over.  It&#x27;s a nice steel shaving bowl.  Not much more to say that that.  I use it every day and enjoy it.  The one downside I&#x27;ll point out is that since it&#x27;s thin steel it will not keep your shaving cream warm if you set it on a cold sink.  I float mine in hot water while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
    <li> Love this bowl, will be great for shaving soap lather.</li>
    <li> Love this bowl. Very neat and clean presence. Matches my Jagger and chrome stand beautifully. So far, after a few months, no sign of rust. Cleans easily. The soap sits at a good height to whip up some good cream. Good deal and fast shipping. Highly recommended.</li>
