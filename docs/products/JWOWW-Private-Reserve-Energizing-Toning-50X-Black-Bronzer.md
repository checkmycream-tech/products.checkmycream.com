      <li>Im one of those people that enjoys nice packaging..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gave me a nice even color.</li>
      <li>It smells good before and after the tan, and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like most lotions.</li>

      <li>love love love!</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and smells good too!</li>
      <li>I ordered this because of it being jwoww, but this is not as good as the original one in my opinion.</li>

      <li>Smells great, works great, and after one month of using it I can see some definite skin toning.</li>
      <li>It has a great scent and works really well to darken skin when tanning!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great love my tan!! Had a good tan after a week! The price is great less than half the price in a salon:)</li>
    <li> To be honest, I like the JWOW One and Done lotion better then this. It works well in the bed and all but i just like One and Done better. Not bad but isn&#x27;t amazing either.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant but I really like this! You&#x27;d be crazy to pay full price in the store!!! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Great smell, and amazing results! J-WOWW did a great job with her tanning line! I have been a tanner for 10+ years, and this is bar far the best tanning lotion I have used!! Kudos to J-Woww!!</li>
    <li> I had the Jwow black before i got this one.  This one left me more greasy and smelled different. Caused me to break out personally.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this tanning lotion was going to work the way I wanted it to. It&#x27;s a great lotion for tanning outside mainly, it helps you get a great bronze outside of the bed but not as great inside the bed. Its five stars if you tan outside but probably a three if your tanning inside. If you trying to buy a lotion for a indoor bed I would recomend Jwows other tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I recently went to miami and used this product for the first time. It is amazing! A must have. I usually have to go tanning more than once to get dark but this lotion got me dark on one use. I highly recommend this for all those who go through the lobster stage before the dark tan.</li>
    <li> I have to say, My skin color would put casper to shame BUT with this i was able to tan and retain my color!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking it would be like the original JWOWW, which i happened to like. This product turned my dark brown tan into a light yellow color and also clogged my pores tremendously. I broke out all over my chest, back, and shoulders whenever using this lotion. I have not even finished half of the bottle and i&#x27;ve already ordered Obsidian :) my advise is stick to what you know works for you... trying new things definitley has it&#x27;s pros and cons. #KimboProblems</li>
    <li> I just received the bottle in the mail.... going to try it out tomorrow.. This seems kind of iffy though the bottle does not look the same as it does on here not even the lable. it&#x27;s weird to me especially sense seller claims their product is real.. we will see if this works or not. I have used this lotion before and it&#x27;s a great product (coming from a salon) but we will see if this ever feels and looks the same. Or if these sellers are scammers.</li>
    <li> Jwoww is the best tanning lotion makes you dark in one session well worth it fast shipping great company get it if your thinking about it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Not a big fan of JWOW but I love her lotion. I needed a tan for my vacation so I wouldn&#x27;t burn and I was using a different lotion when I found this one. After I made the switch I noticed a huge difference in my color. I can&#x27;t remember the name of the other lotion but I bought it at the tanning salon for more than double what I paid on here.</li>
    <li> the JWOWW energizing toning 50x black bronzer but who cares there both very similar. I absolutely LOVE this lotion It gets me so so so dark right after using it. I love the scent and has absolutely NO after tan odor! so you can put this on and then go somewhere after tanning! LOVE THAT. It is very moisturizing so I dont feel the need to apply an after tan lotion after tanning like I usually do. It gets my legs sooo dark I use it on my entire body and it gets my legs the darkest I HIGHLY recommend this lotion and I bought it from A-Z tanning lotions and its the legit real deal lotion. VERY happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, and after one month of using it I can see some definite skin toning. Anyone who says it streaks is either using too much, not rubbing it in well, or is an amateur tanner.</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice even color twice as dark as with other products. Very moisturizing and smells good too! Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I got really dark after just one use.  It works bestf for me when I put it on the night before our an hour before I tan. Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ll never go back to Designer Skin products!</li>
    <li> I used my friends lotion once and saw a big difference in my color.  I went from golden to gingerbread!!  I was using the black noir and wanted to shake it up a bit.  You will not be disapointed!!!! I am ordering mine now.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! It works great indoors but even better outdoors. Quick results and smells great. I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> This is the best Tanning Lotion I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Started with 30 min every second day.&lt;br /&gt;Now just on the weekends. Great healthy glow.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great!i was super tan only after tanning a couple sessions and my tan didnt fade quickly either. This lotion smells great too, doesn&#x60;t make the after tan smell bad at all. I would definitely buy this stuff again!! The price on amazon is unbeatable too, for tanning lotion this good the salon charges at least double the price on here.</li>
    <li> I must say I have loved all of the J-Woww tanning products. This one is awesome as well. Gives great, natural color and has a nice smell.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, texture and color! The only tanning lotion I have used that gives me the color I have wanted quickly and evenly.</li>
    <li> So great!  In the winter I use tanning beds about twice a week and after one session with &amp;#34;Jwoww private reserve&amp;#34; my skin is the perfect shade of golden.  It smells really good (not too heavy or too perfumey, just refreshing) and its a great moisturizer.  My skin actually does look firmer and smoother after using this product.  Bought another one as a gift for my sister. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it!</li>
    <li> Product works and smells just like the very pricey one I bought at the salon. Definately the real stuff. Love it! Shipping was fast and ordering was easy. Great product!</li>
    <li> This lotion gives you a very good color, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and hydrated. Does not leave streaks.</li>
    <li> Shipping was insanely fast.. i like the shiny packaging.. Im one of those people that enjoys nice packaging.. It smells really good..kind of, cinnamon-y. It reminds me of Rumchada. I cant tell if  this lotion works well or not being as it is SO STICKY i cant stand to even use it. Im wondering if I just didnt get a bad bottle since it doesnt seem to be a common issue?</li>
    <li> I tan ALOT, and have used a variety of different lotions. This one doesn&#x27;t make me &#x27;black bronze&#x27; as I was hoping, but it does accelerate color some. Best thing about this tanning lotion is the amazing scent, even after tanning, whereas others leave that &#x27;tanning bed smell&#x27; afterwards!</li>
    <li> This is a 90.00 dollar bottle of lotion in a tanning salon, im excited i founf it on amazon! works well, smells good, and i have a great tan! needs to be followed with a good moistizer</li>
    <li> Color great, smells terrific! Price is right and who has a better tan than  Jwoww from the Jersey shore! I recommend this product to all tanners!</li>
    <li> This lotion is WONDERFUL!!!!! I was skeptical of buying online because there are so many fakes out there, but this company is so trustworthy! I have tried every brand on the market, and JWOWW&#x27;s colaborations with Australian Gold never let me down! I&#x27;m dark in just two uses, and I feel like my skin has tightened, and I feel so relaxed after I use this lotion. It smells good before and after the tan, and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like most lotions. I LOVE THIS!!! :-D</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month now. The smell is nice and I find I get darker when I use it compared to other lotions I have.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! It has a great scent and works really well to darken skin when tanning! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ADORE this tanning lotion!! I used it only for 1 month prior to my wedding and it gave me this amazing healthy natural glow and I was TAN!!! I didn&#x27;t look orange or fake tan like I get from some other lower-end tanning lotions. I am a firm believer in JWOWW&#x27;s tanning lotions because I think this girl knows what she&#x27;s doing! SMART!!! Pleasant unexpected surprise-the caffeine in this lotion seemed to make the appearance of cellulite almost disappear! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my decision to invest in this lotion. Look no further, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used (and that&#x27;s saying a lot, I have used at LEAST 12 different kinds of lotions over the past 10 years(</li>
    <li> A completely different bottle from the picture . Hoping its the same stuff .i guess we will see when I start using it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I tanned really nice with this and did not burn like with other lotions. It&#x27;s gave me a nice even color. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion for the first time over a year ago and instantly loved it. Now this is the only tanning lotion I use. I would definitely recommend this product. I use it because it gives you the natural tan look and does not streak while applying.</li>
    <li> If this price doesn&#x27;t get your attention, the softness it gives your skin will. This is by far one of my favorites. At the salon I go to it retails for $90, with my VIP membership discount it is $72--i couldn&#x27;t resist Amazon&#x27;s $33. Very happy to get one of the better lotions for the price of some of the base level lotions :)</li>
    <li> I liked the smell, and it has made me noticeably darker in about 2 sessions, compared to the Designer Skin 20X lotion I had been using previously which wasn&#x27;t really making me darker at all. It was also affordable. And the company I purchased it through appeared to be legit and I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I not only use it for indoor tanning, I also use it for outdoor use as well! Or if I am in a hurry and want my legs nice and brown, I put some of this lotion on before I head out the door. The lotion however does feel a little thick, but doesn&#x27;t bother me. Great smell too! I will purchase this again when I need it! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Used consecutively for weeks and have noticed little tan. The only good thing is the smell. I would definitely not buy this product again. Snooki black bottle works much better.</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was pretty bad. It seems to make me lighter than when I started. The smell is ok but it gave me no color whatsoever. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> smells just like the salon lotion, now to test it out! arrived all right in the packaging exactly what I ordered the private reserve 50 x bronzer. Its the best smell everrrr.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Works great could tell a major difference after one use!!! No tingle, lots of bronzers and smells good. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> the first time I used this product i only applied on my legs and it worked!  My legs finally looked the same as the rest of me!  I know use it all over.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I am dark after just a few uses!  Smells great! I loved the original Jwoww but this one is even better!</li>
    <li> Loved this lotion! I&#x27;ve used it all up now and have already purchase more!</li>
    <li> I really like this item a lot I got this earlier then I said I would get it. It does not turn my skin orange when I use it. I have a very olive skin tone and I think that might be why but I&#x27;ve heard for very pale skin that it does not turn your skin orange. It gives you a very good smell after tanning and it makes your skin have a sparkling affect and it helps to keep it on if you are going to be outside the sun uv rays enhances the products ability a lot more that I found out by being at the beach after I went tanning for a little bit and did not wash it off it works real nice.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this lotion. It feels good, it spreads nicely, it smells really good. There&#x27;s no down side to this lotion for me. I get awesome color and I&#x27;m moisturized without being greasy feeling. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from tanning place that i go to. It makes my skin feel nice and smooth. I wish it made my color deeper. But this product smells good and makes skin smooth and not dried out.</li>
    <li> I am a red head new to tanning. I want to get dark, but have had a hard time finding a good lotion for my sensitive skin. Jwoww&#x27;s lotion smells great, goes on so smooth, and has really gotten me a few shades darker just after two uses! love love love! How can you not with such a great price, and fast shipping?!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of it being jwoww, but this is not as good as the original one in my opinion. smells good, goes on good, but does not give me the tan like the original one.</li>
    <li> I loveeee loveeee loveeee this lotion !! Amazing I was dark in just 3 sessions !! I never write reviews ever but for this lotion I will lol its all I will ever use !! (:</li>
    <li> i rated this five stars because as soon as i used it i could see a difference and i am really white and i seen color the first time by the third time man i was hooked love love it..i will buy this again thanks amzon for sending it so fast xo</li>
    <li> Even with the discounted price, this is not as good as the Paint it Black lotion, which is cheaper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Millenium-Tanning-Bronzer-Lotion-13-5-Ounce/dp/B0058E3XJI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1395591621&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;paint+it+black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it is okay. It smells pretty good for tanning lotion as well.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of JWOWW and it is as described. It smells good and feels good and I don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, and this is definitely a lotion I like to have in my rotation. It&#x27;s a nice natural bronzer. It&#x27;s not overly thick, or difficult to rub in. Not to big on the coconut scent, but the results outweigh the dislike of the smell. Very minimal ato. I&#x27;m noticeably darker after each session.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. I was really hoping for more color, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy more JWoww in the future! Still love this line of lotions!</li>
    <li> Gives a great tan very quickly! I have used this in just the basic bed about 5 times in the last two weeks and I have a noticable difference in my skin tone. Very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter tanning lotion. You can alternate this tanning lotion with the other JWOW black bronzer...! Together they&#x27;re a great pair of tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion worked ok for me and my daughter. One of JWOWW&#x27;S other lotions work best on me..... This also has a great scent to it</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over a year and even tho the price has dropped tremendously (I bought my first bottle for $98), the quality is 10-10. I naturally have a lot of freckles over my body and it takes about two months to get a good/decent tan in a bed or outside but with this, it really cuts your time. I actually use this lotion as a moisturizer also since it makes you irresistible to the touch, (I am an exotic entertainer and clients LOVE the feel of this lotion. It has a tropical/coconuty kinda smell to it, kinda like the smells that remind you of summer as soon as you smell it but not too strong that a little perfume won&#x27;t fix if you dont like the smell. I will keep buying this lotion until they stop having it and I&#x27;m also stocking up with the price being as cheap as it is.</li>
    <li> I have bought this several times.  It smells great and gives me the darkest shade of all products I have used.  The seller was super fast with shipping also!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my friend had me try it on a trip to the beach and it was incredible! My skin is very fair and I have a really hard time tanning so I&#x27;ve tried tons of products, this worked very well! We laid out for about 45 min, I didn&#x27;t burn and the color was beautiful. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great lotion ! Thanks, Amazon for a great product at an affordable price. Also recommend jwoww&#x27;s other products for indoor/outdoor tanning. You will love your tan and it smells good.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best tanning products I have ever used.it goes on soft, and keep your skin so smooth and gives you a remarkable tan.. No Tingle Factor,which I like.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It works great, it’s not greasy, it applies well and does not leave streaks. It also smells super good a little strong though but I don&#x27;t mind smelling like a tropical coconut paradise when I get done tanning.</li>
    <li> I have FINALLY found my favorite lotion, after trying out so many from designer skin.. Australian Gold products and MR International products are by far my favorite for getting the results I want. With this lotion there is no after tan odor which is SO great, because I really get tired of smelling the same tanning lotion on my skin 6 hours later. When I come out of the bed, I feel silky soft and have a mild coconut sent on my skin but it fades fast. The color results I get are awesome, after two sessions I was very brown and not orange. Great product - I have also tried Snooki&#x27;s line but I prefer the tropical scents that JWOWW has instead of the candy smell that Snooks has.</li>
    <li> This product was not what it said it was.  I have a bottle from a tanning salon and it doesn&#x27;t even spell the same.</li>
    <li> It has a very nice smell and I like that you can use it indoor or outdoor.  The bronzes works well too.</li>
    <li> The lotion has a very nice smell and makes your skin feel amazing. I am very happy with it and have my friends hooked too :).</li>
    <li> Well I started going tanning about a month ago and I got a bronzer at my tanning salon ( which was alot of money )and I loved it but like most people I cant afford to keep spending 70.00 or more on tanning lotion. So I decided to take a chance and buy some at amazon. A couple of my girlfriends use the Jwoww products and loved them. So I picked this one and I love it!!! I have dry skin also and using this lotion keeps my skin nice and smooth. If your looking for a more natural tan this is the lotion you want to use. Im very dark but it doesnt look fake at all. It leaves NO streeks on your skin and doesnt make your hands orange. I also put it on my face and it doesnt make me break out ( my face is senstive to alot of lotions ). Im telling you, you will not be dissappointed! Try it and you will love it! The smell its bad either. its a very light beachy coconut lime type of smell. Enjoy!!!! It really is great!!!</li>
    <li> Tanned really well, no burn smell afterwards. Very good for guys, doesn&#x27;t make you smell perfumy after a tan. Excellent tan.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives you great dark tan,the smell is great no bad after smell.This lotion at my salon is so high.Ilove the price on this lotion and I will order it again.Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> It has turned me so brown! I love the way it smells too. Great product and will be trying her new lotion next time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the big hype about how great this product is by other customers.&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time deciding to do tanning and I refuse to use a booth. So I bought the newest Jwoww tanning lotion after reading such great reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited when it came that I used it right away.&lt;br /&gt;1. It does smell really amazing I give it that.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is a lot in it, but I feel I will be done with it quite soon, bc it did NOT take to my skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;3. Only some of my body is darker and the rest is still the same color I was am or only a slight darker but not by much.&lt;br /&gt;4. It did make me a bit itchy, but not as bad as some can be from what I read, but i did still feel itchy.&lt;br /&gt;5. I am hoping maybe her other ones will work for me bc I really would like to have a tan glow to myself. I am not sure how much you are supposed to use  this supply I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter, but I used it twice and still see no difference.&lt;br /&gt;I love Jwoww and her other products I bought are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed using the matching lotion when I started to get itchy it did ease it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I am just hoping one of her tanning products will work with my skin type and actually work on a first timer.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure I am the only who feels this way about this one especially bc it was my first time doing this, but I refuse to use the booths.</li>
