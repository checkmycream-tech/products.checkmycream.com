<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Outstanding product. Very potent... I admit, I suffer from cold sores. I have tried everything to curb this issue including Abreva, Novitra and the list goes on and on—until I found this product. Mix it with some olive oil, put it on your lip and you should not have a problem. I put it on daily and haven&#x27;t had a cold sore in so long I can&#x27;t remember. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to control how much comes out, so I use it on the bottom of my feet at night.  I do not feel the warm feeling other reviewers described.  In fact, I do not notice any advantage to using this product.</li>
    <li> I am experienting with oils,</li>
    <li> Very fresh. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Oil of Oregano (OoO) for 1 week and so far my allergies have subsided. It is VERY spicy on its own so I cut it with a tsp of Olive Oil (OO). Based on other reviews I put 1 drop of OoO to about 1/2-1 tsp of OO underneath my tongue and try to hold it there for as long as I can. I really hope this works because I am trying to avoid taking antihistamines based on the recent side effects of causing dementia, especially for those 65 yrs and older. Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used OoO, I cannot compare it to other brands. I will try to update in a month&#x27;s time and let you know if this OoO has helped me with my allergies or not. Stay tune... but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> This oil is very strong but effective!  I&#x27;ve used this for earaches (do not put inside ear canal, rub over outside), pimples, burns, and is showing promise for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Have tried other oregano oils, but this one seems to have the best taste in my opinion.  Still definitely oregano, but without the strong(er) burn and odd aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;I use when I have a sore throat, mix a few drops with something like water/OJ/apple juice (literally 5/6 drops of this to about a tablespoon of liquid), try to slowly swallow to let coat the back of mouth/throat...and it&#x27;s like a long-lasting halls cough drop!  I love it.  I swear, it may be a placebo, but definitely haven&#x27;t got terrible sore throat like I use to prior to this method.</li>
    <li> Must be diluted, extremely pure- it burns, but I&#x27;ll feel the burn for the benefits of Oregano oil. I recommend and will purchase more.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations.  I would recommend it to my family and friends. I will buy this again. Thank you,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to find these oils with such good quality and at such reasonable prices. Thank you so much for being a fast shipper too.</li>
    <li> I frequently buy DoTerra and Young Living. This product has much friendlier price point and the quality was obviously there. I can taste the quality. I will be purchasing many more oils from this company! Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, and is strong and potent. I mixed a few drops with extra virgin organic coconut oil to use in place of antibiotic ointment and applied to a scrape - excellent results - no inflammation at all, quick healing.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I found this oil to be better than any I have bought before. It is; I have no doubt; 100% pure. I&#x27;d buy again...but let us think I&#x27;ll not need it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Eric Paris</li>
    <li> I received my product in a prompt manner and it by far is the best and superior product that I have come across.  It really works. I try it on  sore back and also sore and work within a day on both</li>
    <li> This is the purest strongest oregano oil I have come across and is excellent value. I dilute in olive oil - I don&#x27;t know exactly what the proportions are - I start out with about 15ml of olive oil and then added about 10-20 drops of the oregano oil. I test by placing a couple of drops under my tongue. If I can really feel the heat after a minute or so and if I feel the burn when I swallow that requires a quick swig of water then I know the proportion is about right for me. This is my go-to cure for colds/flu. As soon as I start feeling under the water I start taking this. I&#x27;m usually good by the next day! It&#x27;s also great for toe fungus - diluted in the same way as previously mentioned. DO NOT EVER USE THIS UNDILUTED - IT WILL DO DAMAGE!!!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with other ingredients on my dry cracked heels. I am extremely happy with the results that I have gotten in a very short amount of time. I work in my green house and garden on a regular basis almost always in flip flops, not a great thing for my feet. I am grateful to have found a product that helps reverse the effects this has on my feet. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Works for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Very potent. Be careful where and how you use it. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews for this product before I bought it because I was prepared for the burn.  I knew to only add one or two drops per tall glass of liquid.  It seems like such a tiny amount--how can it possibly have much benefit?  Believe me, it does.  Not only does it pack quite a punch in the hot and spicy department, it also wipes out any illness or infection you may be experiencing.  Well, don&#x27;t quote me on that--I don&#x27;t have experience with anything serious like cancer or HIV, but I do know it helps greatly with the common cold and any basic viral or bacterial infection.  I started feeling a cold coming on last week, I put two drops of this oil in a glass of OJ and within 30 minutes I was feeling significantly (like 90%) better!  I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity (and hopefully I won&#x27;t) to test it on a really bad cold or ear infection, but if I do I&#x27;ll probably come here and update my review.  If you decide you&#x27;d like to put some in your ear(s) due to an infection then heavily dilute it first in a carrier oil like coconut, avocado or jojoba.  My recommendation is at least 10:1 (carrier oil:oregano oil) just to be on the safe side.  Like I said, you really don&#x27;t need very much of this for it to have a strong effect so don&#x27;t be afraid to dilute the heck out of it.</li>
    <li> surprised how it worked with olive oil on RA</li>
    <li> Perfect essential oil! Oregano is a very strong oil with anti fungal qualities. This came on time, and in full strength. They say they don&#x27;t dilute and they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! I have used this on inflamed gums and found it to be a superb healer. When my mother had a break out of shingles, she put oregano oil on the blisters and it helped the healing. Pure strength origanum essential oil.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil.  Quick shipping.  I&#x27;ve used this product before and am very pleased with the customer service from Plant Therapy</li>
    <li> Happy to see tis arrive so that I can continue using this and frankincense together!</li>
    <li> Good quality essential oil. It will be a good addition to my natural health regime. Bottle does not have a dropper and so it is harder to get the right dose/amount of the oil out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> the product was great, however it took quite a long time to receive it. My shipping date kept being pushed out. I am satisfied with the product though.</li>
    <li> Use a dab under tongue to keep flu away. Very strong</li>
    <li> Worked great for my toe nail fungus, it gone now</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Repeat customer 👍</li>
    <li> Great product. Received as promised. ++++</li>
    <li> I tried tons of over-the-counter stuff to get rid of my plantar warts and nothing worked (I had them for over a year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it with a q-tip once a day for two weeks without a carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warts are gone - skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Potent stuff. I always mix it with coconut oil 2 take.</li>
    <li> just what oregano oil should be</li>
    <li> this works great!!  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> excellent product, Used one drop in water to gargle and my sore throat went away immediately.  I will be using and repurchasing this miracle oil</li>
    <li> A few drops in boiling water during my cold helped me breathe better, finished up the cough and head cold in days not weeks like before.  just inhale over bowl for 10mins 2x per day- watch out its strong tho...give it a try.  I will keep this in medicine cab always!</li>
    <li> Yahoo this stuff is strong! I got over a chest cold in 4 days taking this stuff (usually it&#x27;s a several week thing for me). Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I use oregano oil a lot. I use this to make home made antibiotics and also use this for pain. this is very powerful and should always be diluted. I have use this when I feel a cold coming on, I also use this when I have a tooth ache. My mom used this to get rid of a wart that she had on her foot it seems to have many uses.</li>
    <li> satisfied with product</li>
    <li> I like the medicinal benefits of Oregano&lt;br /&gt;Essential oil.  I would purchase from this&lt;br /&gt;business again.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done any of the wonder cures for me- didn&#x27;t help with the sore throat or the mystery red spot on my tongue or hurting gums or cold sores or anything else really. Might, though, I didn&#x27;t use it a lot. It&#x27;s strong so make sure to use only a drop and disperse it in liquid before taking. I wouldn&#x27;t use this internally for my kids and am hesitant to swallow myself. Rinsing is okay.</li>
    <li> Purchased the oregano essential oil. Love how amazing it smells. Shortly after my purchase,  the company contacted me, making sure I was 100% satisfied with my purchase, I was! Just knowing how</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. No added oils or alcohol. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help me with my persistent psoriasis/eczema/atopic dermatitis. I mixed one drop of this into about a teaspoon of olive oil, and rubbed a bit of it onto affected areas. (That was enough to last the whole day...I just set aside a little bowl containing the mixture next to the kitchen sink.) It started feeling better within the same day...and there seems to be less itching.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review in a few days and let you know the progress!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She has been using it to get rid of the warts on her feet. She doesn&#x27;t like that it makes everything smell like Oregano, but it has been working great for her.</li>
    <li> This oil is extremely powerful. I have been taking it internally and applying it on my spine as well. I use it to fight cold sores. I am not sure if the virus is dead, but I have not had cold sores in about 2 months. I will continue to use it for some time and maybe it will completely eradicate the virus from my body.</li>
    <li> Applied this sparingly to a skin irritation on my finger and it caused a burning sensation for almost 2 days.  Also, even after washing my hands with soap a number of times, the smell was still overpowering.  It did heal the irritation though...</li>
    <li> I wondered how come so much money, but this oil goes POP&lt;br /&gt;with extra strength.  Well worth  the money !</li>
    <li> I wanted oregano oil that was for internal use, but the bottle says external use only. I don&#x27;t know why they wouldn&#x27;t state that in the website description, but I feel that the nondisclosure is unfairly misleading. You don&#x27;t figure it out until you paid and you have the bottle sitting in your hand.</li>
    <li> Hard to find at this purity and price really the best product line I have came across will defently be reordering thank you</li>
    <li> Great product!  Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The oil is strong and seems very good. I diluted it with olive oil at 50%.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, my mother&#x27;s podiatrist suggested using this for toenail fungus.  Says it works better than anything else on the market!  So we tried it and, yes, it works!  Product was delivered quickly, and was inexpensive compared to many on the market.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> My mother has been buying the essential oils that cost an arm and a leg for a tiny little bottle so I decided to check amazon first to find the oils cheaper. I wondered if they would work the same and this one sure does. For less then half the price it is removing my moles and skin tags. Works great, but don&#x27;t use to much because it burns.</li>
    <li> I was truly blessed when I discovered oregano oil. One drop and I was hooked, I use it in my hot tea, mix it with olive oil or just by itself for aches and pains. I will always keep a bottle in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> Arrive in good condition.</li>
    <li> Bought for husbands nasty 10 year old toenail fungus. He hasn&#x27;t even used it consistently &amp; it&#x27;s working. He does apply carrier oil around the skin of his toenails prior to apply oregano oil to nails. The fungus is dying off &amp; new growth is clear. He&#x27;s also got a small Amber glass dropper filled with grape seed oil &amp; about 20 drops of oregano oil in it. He takes 2 drops orally of that mixture each day. So it could be his body healing from the inside out with using it that way. Not sure but it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> WOW, I did not even comprehend the intensity of oregano oil.  Although a tad difficult to adapt to its stringent taste and taste, it is known to be a beneficial for your body, hence to say that &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; must be understood that love in this case is in reference to its pure medicinal properties.</li>
    <li> This stuff severely burned me,</li>
    <li> I purchased the oregano oil for nail fungus as recommended by Dr. Oz.  Time will tell, but I used it for the first time last night and very quickly learned to dilute it with an oil such as olive oil.  The feeling I got from the first use gave a very strong indication of it&#x27;s strength. I HGHLY recommend researching its correct use before diving in!&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the seller came through as promised.  A positive purchase all the way around!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
    <li> I have purchased OIl of Oregano from other online retailers before, but this company&#x27;s product is the best quality I&#x27;ve had.  I am very pleased with their oil and highly recommend them to essential oil purists!</li>
    <li> This is what I used for Shingles on my daughter-in-law. She was in pain and that was the only thing I had on hand.. It burns and then they were gone.. I recommend it and  L-Lysine 1000 .L-Lysine is good for fever blisters and if you have had chickenpox .It can help prevent Shingles sso I&#x27;ve been told.Read direction carefully on anything .</li>
    <li> Excellent product..thank you. I will be ordering this again for sure:) Using this economical and great product will save me money by making my own Oregano oil.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE ON SKIN. IT BURNS AND DAMAGES SKIN.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I would recommend this seller. Seems to be a quality product, and I hope it eliminates my nail fungus.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just received this product 4-days ago and have used it every night since in a diffuser.  I noticed a change in my health after the 1st night.  I have been fighting cancer for the past 16 years so I have some health problems that I am trying to resolve naturally.  The first morning after using the oregano, the phlegm buildup in my throat was almost gone.  The inflammation in my body lessened causing my usual body aches to almost disappear.  The most important reason I started using oregano, however, is because of one of it&#x27;s important benefits.  Oregano helps improve conditions of &amp;#34;iron deficiency anemia&amp;#34;.  Because of an erratic hemoglobin level, I have it checked twice a week.  So, after using the oregano for 3 nights, I had my hemoglobin level checked and for the first time in several months, my hemoglobin level actually went up without a blood transfusion.  Now, some of my nurses are looking into Essential Oils.  I am convinced in the value of EO&#x27;s.  I recommend having oregano on hand.</li>
    <li> doing what I wanted it to do</li>
    <li> Works great at clearing out the airways! The scent isn&#x27;t extremely appealing, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. It does remind me of spaghetti though.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s consistency is much thicker than other oils that I am used to. But I think it&#x27;s suppose to be that way, plus, it makes it easier to not accidentally add too much. A little goes a LONG ways! Like, one drop in the diffuser is all it takes! Dillute it well if you&#x27;re going to use it topically.</li>
    <li> Used this directly on skin to remove a wart. Worked wonderfully without the usual pain of wart removal.</li>
    <li> I got the product quicker that I thought I would. Very high quality product. Thank you. I only wish I had ordered more.</li>
    <li> I researched the benefits of oil of oregano and decided to buy this based on good reviews.  I take 3 drops daily in water.  I have been taking it for 2 months.  I have not been sick this winter.  I understand that it is anti fungal, anti viral and anti bacterial.  I plan on taking it daily until winter is finished.  After that, perhaps 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Works great! I used it with coconut oil to get rid of poison oak and it cleared up in a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it to cure a fungal infection on my toe, I found the commercial OTC treatments to be ineffectual.</li>
    <li> After reading some items on this oil I decided to give it a try and am very happy with it.  I don&#x27;t remember everything about  it but after getting a bug bite I put some of this oil on the bite and the itch went away.  My husband has a rash on his ankle and he started using this on the rash.  The rash has dried up and gone away!  We will order this again.</li>
    <li> I use this product for itch. It has an odor to start out, but get better. A small amount will last a long time. Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product should be used.  I got a bit on my skin and it irritates my skin.  I had to rinse with cold water for a long time to get it off.</li>
    <li> Powerful stuff here!  Came in a timely fashion.  Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Oregano Oil, so I am still up in the air about it&#x27;s efficacy for the purposes I have in mind.&lt;br /&gt;However, it certainly smells as tho it&#x27;s first rate and It arrived within the date range it was promised.</li>
    <li> by far the strongest, best oil I have received.  It has been quite effective and will definately purchase again.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> delivered so late.&lt;br /&gt;Lack of product warning description. I purchased this for my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;burned my lips by using recommended instruction.</li>
    <li> Very strong and hot! Be careful. But if you know what&#x27;s up then you&#x27;re good. I have a face wart. It&#x27;s going away now slowly but surely with this oil. So happy I have it.</li>
    <li> Not sure how pure this stuff really is and I am almost though the bottle and the jury is out on how well it works on toe fungus.</li>
    <li> This really helps with receding gums, best when added with pure organic honey for better results. The honey allows the Oregano to bind to the gums for effectiveness.</li>
    <li> The oil came packaged very well and is certainly strong. I&#x27;m using it for a specific skin issue and it&#x27;s working very well for that use. It makes one smell a bit like a salad, but far better than most medicinal smells.</li>
    <li> I do not have this brand but I do have a brand with the same ingredients. I have placed this on my toes and have seen results in 2 days. My toes already look healthier but it really smells. I have also placed 4 drops under my tongue but am not sure how it has helped my health. I will update when it has completely cleared.</li>
    <li> Just got rid of a facial mole will using t his product for about 1 1/2 weeks.  Daughter is resolving a finger wart with it.  I think another week or two and it will gone.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Oregano Oil, just what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much more I  can say about it! Just good stuff! Yup!</li>
    <li> I have avoided the traditional head cold symptoms so far this winter. I did try diluting this oil with olive oil and drinking it, but the flavor was much to strong for me. I prefer to put several drops into a gelatin capsule then take it with a glass of water or milk. I can only taste it a little bit if I burp soon afterwards, but it isn&#x27;t as strong as having it run across all of your tastebuds. I did try using this to battle strep throat. I think it helped some, but it wasn&#x27;t quite enough to kick it completely. I did end up taking an antibiotic. It has done well against the traditional cold as far as I can tell. This has been my first experience with essential oils and I think oregano was a good one to start with as it can help with a myriad of symptoms, including topical applications for skin rashes and such.</li>
    <li> Great when mixed with coconut oil and rubbed on the spine when you have a cold</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I will be purchasing this again when needed.  This is the real deal, I did order 2 more that I gave one to a friend and kept the other at work for emergencies.  When I feel a cold sore comming on I mix it with a little olive oil so it is not so strong and put it on my cold sore as soon as I feel one comming on. Works Great.</li>
    <li> The company I bought the oil of oregano from was very good. They delivered the product in a timely and professional manner so all that was good. However, I found oil of oregano to be the most highly disgusting and obnoxious stuff that has ever passed my lips. I tried mixing it with several different drinks. I thought for sure it would be a natural with V8 vegetable jiuce but not so. I finally just mixed it in about 1/4 cup of warm water, tossed that back, gagged, wretched and felt the tremendous burn. The health benefit may be great from oil of oregano, but I simply could not handle the taste and burn. I made it two weeks taking only 4 drops a day in warm water but that was it. Maybe the capsules would be a better choice, at least for me.</li>
    <li> This is very smelly and strong stuff.  Do NOT use undiluted.  And be warned.  You will end up smelling like a pizza parlor.</li>
    <li> The Oregano Essential oil worked really well with my husband&#x27;s bee sting.  I followed the instruction for dilution and application from one of the few websites I&#x27;ve found online .</li>
    <li> My sister recommended oregano oil to me after it had cured her of her seasonal allergies. But I didn&#x27;t realize that it was not this pure undiluted one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tried taking one teeny tiny drop of this in one cup of water and it burnt up my mouth and lip. I was left with burnt scabs all over my lips for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I put it away and avoided it like the plague. Henceforth I will use it only externally.</li>
    <li> This is some potent stuff!  It is not diluted so it is important to add to a good carrier oil.  It only takes a little.  The directions say use 1% dilution. A little certainly does go a long way.  It has helped a painful area on my hip.  Also have been using it on a skin tag which now appears to be shrinking.</li>
    <li> This Oregano oil, is really good. Is very strong so if you are gonna use it use it carefully because it can burn.</li>
    <li> Hot oil....Wow&lt;br /&gt;This is very interesting. Using it for mole removal with a carrier...still hot. Be careful GOOD STUFF!</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of prescribed oral and cream medications for my nail fungus, they didn&#x27;t seem to work long term.  For oral med, I have to worry about my liver, so I can&#x27;t take it long term.  The Oregano does the best job for my nails so far.  I used it undiluted, but be careful of not touching the skin because it is very strong.  So far it is killing the roots - stopped the growing of the fungus.  I have to wait to see the new growth of the nails, but I think it will be coming.</li>
    <li> Oil seemed good but the bottle is very hard to del with, be much better with regular eyedropper.</li>
    <li> this stuff will make you slap your mama , worked good, but can not give it a 5 because its not free</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t do it all what I thought it was going to do and the smell is something that you&#x27;ve never smell before. About this item to put on a cut On my toe and it burned for two days and it was just terrible</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t sacrifice potency for price. Nice product. I got this for its all purpose general usage. If I could only have one oil, this would be it.</li>
    <li> I like this but boy is it hot when you put too much on in certain places. Definitely need a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I am sure the product works just fine as we haven&#x27;t even opened the bag it was mailed in. The reason being is I made a mistake and ordered this essential oil thinking it could be taken by mouth which I didn&#x27;t know it couldn&#x27;t be. But that is all good. I admit I don&#x27;t know much about essential oils. But my problem is when I when to return it, I find out I can&#x27;t return it so now I am stuck with an essential oil that will never get used. Totally ridiculous, I will never buy any kind of medicinal use product through Amazon or this company again.</li>
    <li> This is a very strong smelling oil. Be careful with it but with the right application it is an &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; in the bathroom cupboard.  I wanted to remove a small wart on  my face,  I dabbed a dot with a  Q tip on the wart everynight and in a week the wart was gone.  My dog has itchy ears, and the vet wants to sell me these drops for $20 for a teeny tiny bottle.  I am done with that,  now I&#x27;m adding some of this natural oil to a bit of coconut oil and putting that in her ears....her ears are much better, hardly no more itching.</li>
    <li> This is indeed 100% oregano oil. Look into the uses before applying for whatever you&#x27;re using it for. It works wonders, when used correctly. (It burns)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Keep in mind that pure oregano oil is very strong and can burn your skin without the proper carrier oil, (it also doesn&#x27;t have the greatest scent in the world) but I love that I can dilute it myself to the desired strength depending on what I want to use it for. After trying 3 other brands, I finally found what I was looking for with the results I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product, which I have employed as an inhalant to treat an upper respiratory infection. Frankly, I didn&#x27;t expect the oil to do very much. I was wrong. It quickly eliminated the infection. The product has met and exceeded all expectations.</li>
    <li> It came on time and it works like a charm. No complaints from me at all. I am very happy with everything</li>
    <li> This product was what I expected and I received it when I was told I was.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product. I had a bump right by my ear which I tried this on. I just put a drop on once a day. Burned a little. It&#x27;s a little over a week and the bump is practically gone! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I tried two drops in my 24 ounce water bottle. Yuck!! Then tried it in a small glass of apple juice. Wasn&#x27;t quite as bad. Will take a while to adjust to the taste. Now I&#x27;m just waiting on the miracle improvement to my health!!</li>
    <li> I had a very large ganglion cyst on my left wrist.  After applying Red Thyme for about a month I replaced my morning two drops with Oregano, continuing with the Thyme in the evening.  After a month and a half, the cyst is hardly noticible and seldom do I feel what had been constant pain.  I had tried many different home remedies with no success.  This really worked and eliminated the need for expensive surgery which could have caused irreparable nerve damage.</li>
    <li> I bought this to have on hand for a sore throat.  It was a smaller bottle than I&#x27;m used to getting, but the product is fine, and just as described.  It&#x27;s ok for a smaller bottle, because it only takes a drop on a toothpick to knock out a sore throat!</li>
    <li> This alternative therapy works great. As soon as we begin to feel congested and I&#x27;ll we steam with oil of oregano and it makes us better soooo quickly! I think this product has become a staple on our house!</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy is my favorite brand of Essential Oils.  You actually get what they say you are getting.</li>
    <li> I got this to see if it would help reduce age spots.  Tried it on one on my face and one on my hand.  The one on my face is now gone.  The one on my hand is still there, but has reduced in size.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil. Very strong.</li>
    <li> This is something which, in a pinch, can help ease the suffering of colds and flu. My mother swears by this!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised, I am very pleased with it</li>
    <li> This Oil of Oregano is amazing at preventing colds, stopping them in their tracks, and lessening the severity. Also helps with the flu. I also had a &amp;#34;dry socket&amp;#34; once from a pulled lower tooth, which caused SEVERE pain. I put a couple of drops directly on it, and after a while, my severe pain stopped COMPLETELY for a WHOLE DAY - not just a few hours, but all day!!! It got me through it when prescription and over-the-counter painkillers did nothing. I even cook Italian food with it! We love it, and will never be caught without it. Even keep a small bottle in my purse, in case I feel a cold coming on. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! This is now a staple in my house for my natural family. P.S. It burns, so KEEP A GLASS OF WATER NEAR BY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product at a discount so I could write an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This oil would be fine if it came in a useable bottle. When I removed the cap a clear plastic thing stayed in the bottle and every time I use it I have to pry the plastic thing out with my thumb nail thus getting it on my fingers which is a waste and is also very messy. It doesn&#x27;t have a dropper, just a little pointed end on the clear plastic thing that I have to pry out. I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone could design a worse bottle for this oil. It&#x27;s almost like they designed it this way so you would waste half of it and have to buy it more often. Do yourself a favor and buy another kind that comes in a bottle with an eye dropper.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with Coconut oil and use it as germ killer and moisturizer, works great. Never will buy those hand soaps again, no need after using this. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and seems to be very concentrated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is a problem with the batch or if the formula has changed to include a lot of carrier oil, but this has no burn, which for me at least is an essential part of the healing mode. I have a  problem with serious, severe headaches which appears to originate at the base of my skull. I have bone involvement but don&#x27;t know for sure whether the cause may also be related to nerves damaged by Lyme. In any case, there has not been any legal pain reliever powerful enough to relieve the pain that can put me in bed with hot water bottles and ice packs for4-5 days at a time.  Then I tried full strength oregano oil on my neck. It burned, but the discomfort of the burn was not an issue compared to the pain in my neck, ears, and head which had been coming on stronger and stronger for several days previously. I was shocked and surprised when the headache receded. Within several hours I was able to resume my normal activities. I felt so grateful to find a &amp;#34;cure.&amp;#34; Now I have become very disappointed by Plant Therapy Oregano. It says it is pure but is it full strength? I doubt it. Full strength oregano oil is the only pain reliever that I can depend on for my problem but now this bottle has disappointed me I don&#x27;t know where I will secure something that is actually 100% pure and full strength as well.</li>
    <li> This is pure and very effective. I have used it numerous times with great outcome. Repeat customer, thanks.</li>
    <li> I am new to EO&#x27;s, but what I can tell you is that most do not come with instructions. Tells you a little about how it is derived, and what it can do, but not how to use it. This will burn certain parts of your skin that is more sensitive if you do not dilute in another oil, like almond oil.</li>
    <li> Started using this on a mole that I have on my face about a week and a half ago, mole is shrinking already 2/3 smaller no pain a little stinging. It will burn your skin so protect other skin with petroleum jelly. Very happy that I did not have to pay $$ for surgery and have a scar on my face. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> First saw oil of oregano recommmended on the Dr. Oz Show on TV.  I have used it at the early signs of a cold or sore throat since then and find it to be effective and helpful.  I recently bought some for my daughter, who rolled her eyes when I told her about it.  But, last week when she felt a cold coming on, I reminded her to use it.  She reluctantly tried it, complained about its bad taste, but ultimately agreed that it does seem to work.  A few drops under the tongue is all it takes.  There is a slight burning sensation when you first apply it, but after a few moments that goes away, and it does its work!  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> It worked as I hoped  Tastes terrible and smells strong but effective I will go back to this store again</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me ,  never  even known this oil was around.  very powerful stuff, seen it on oz show and was looking for a skin condition fixer and was blown away how strong this was. mixed 2 drops  to about 1/2 ounce olive oil for a great mixture for just about everything from putting on bread  to  getting rid of fungus on skin and townails. you may not like the strong odor this has , but I cook with lots of spices and the is the one I will be using for a long time. be carful if will burn your tongue  mouth and skin. my home smells like a pizza shop, bring on the oil buy a bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> very high quality product.</li>
    <li> I was told to use this stuff on moles. I put this on and it just burned the skin around the mole. It was like someone was shoving a hot poker into my skin. There were no instructions on it but really....I can&#x27;t understand how anyone can stand this stuff.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Must dilute and shake well before drinking.</li>
    <li> All the oils I received from here are top quality oils, I use them daily in my hypnotherapy practice. I will certainly order from them again when I need other oils.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a cure all. If your sick forget the vics and use some of this it takes care of anything. We had a mold problem in our house and with some good cleaning and a couple drops of this it took care of most of the spores in the house. I would recomend this to anyone with any kind of ailments.</li>
    <li> I definitely love this oil!!! My husband had this horrible knee pain coming back and forth. He couldn&#x27;t walk around the mall for an hour or even drive for more than an hour. We went to visit a friend in Oregon and HIKING was one of thing they wanted to do. I decided to try my oregano oil on his knee. The night before hiking and an hour before hiking, I rubbed the OO with a carrier oil all around his knee and OMG!! He was able to handle 4hours hiking with no pain at all !!!! And he felt no pain for two weeks!! Now each time he has pain of any kind, which is not often any more, he just uses my OO. I totally recommend this product :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I recommended this product to a friend who suffers from shoulder pain. She never heard that OO was a medicine, she just knew it was a herb for cooking... Well, she tried it with excellent results and she can&#x27;t stop talking about it :) I personally ordered my second one :)</li>
    <li> Works well, my office people take this when they have sore throat.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of these oils. I&#x27;ve purchased several from Plant Therapy &amp; have always been satisfied. I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Wow. This stuff means business. I mixed a couple of drops with olive oil and applied it to my feet that are plagued by chronic athlete&#x27;s foot. Antifungal cream gets very, very expensive at $15.00 per tiny tube, so I figured I would give this a try. Let me tell you...my feet have never looked better...this is no placebo effect! I am now a believer!</li>
    <li> MY DOGS HATE THIS SO IT MUST BE GOOD AFTER ALL WHAT DO DOGS KNOW ANYWAYS? HUH? RIGHT? HAY! RIGHT?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a toenail fungus on almost all of my toe nails for as long as I can remember. I saw my doctor for it about a year ago and she said there is not much I can do, and she wouldn&#x27;t prescribe antibiotics because she said they&#x27;re not healthy for someone so young (Age 22). I did some research and found a product called Nonyx on Amazon and tried that for about a month, and there was absolutely no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 1 year and I somehow ran into this product on Amazon by chance. I read the reviews and saw that it helped people clear their toenails, so I was willing to give it another shot. At the price, I really didn&#x27;t have much to lose anyway. First, I put the oil directly on my toenails undiluted, and it didn&#x27;t burn at all. Later in the day, I decided to put some of the oregano oil into my old Nonyx bottle, and then shook it up and put it on my nails again. The next morning I buffed the nails with a nail filler and it looked 90% better. The only parts that were still dark were on the corners I couldn&#x27;t reach with the filer. However, I continued alternating with the oil and nonyx+oil for the rest of the first week, and now my nails are 99% clear. I just have a small dark area on both pinky toes that are also hard to file because they are so small. I will update my review in a month with the progress on that area. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and the product is priced very well.</li>
    <li> thank you for asking - yes, so far so good with product.  I was told to dilute with olive oil and use as a healing agent.  worked immediately on some spots.  very impressed.  Thank you again for asking!</li>
    <li> I use the beach showers after surfing and swimming which means I get to share in the community fungus pool.  Since I mixed this powerful oregano oil with baby oil and started applying it to my feet daily, viola, no more athlete&#x27;s foot.  Very pleased and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I started with my doTerra brand and ended up giving that to my brother for his warts. I have been using this brand of oil on my own wart (on my arm) and it is nearly gone! This evil thing has been around for years and nothing has worked because each time it never fully went away and came back immediately. Now that Im learning more about the awesome uses of oils and oregano in particular Ill for sure buy this brand since it seems to be pretty good quality for a much more affordable price than some of the others. Just don&#x27;t try a drop in your mouth without diluting it first this stuff is HOT...learn from my mistakes :)</li>
    <li> Love using Oregano oil, it has so many uses in the home.  I gave this one to my sister so she has her own bottle!  :)</li>
    <li> Absolute GOD send!  Not for the squeamish though - if you can tolerate its powerful heat - it works magic.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing !! Thank you</li>
    <li> The product was OK, but the amount it contains is deceptively small.</li>
    <li> Bought this to dab on my eczema on my forehead!  Makes you smell like pizza but this stuff really works.  Be sure to DILUTE this oil with some type of carrier oil because this oregano oil is concentrated and can burn a bit when applied directly to skin.  I also found out that it works nicely to repel mosquitos!  Great stuff -- everyone should have a little bottle of oregano oil; it can be used for many different things.</li>
    <li> Wonderful remedy for my sons planters wart. I applied directly to skin, twice a day and it was gone in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Yes, you need to know how to use it, but why buy something that claims to be 80% pure but is actually that solution as one part to 3 of olive oil?  This is 100%, end of.  It knocks out colds and sore throats.  Yes, it is very warm going down.  It&#x27;s supposed t be.</li>
    <li> Works for the purpose I needed, I added to my first aid kit for minor scrapes with my little one.  If you love the smell of Italian food, you will smell like a pizza parlor.</li>
    <li> Bought to use to clean my teeth.  One drop is all you need-- very strong!!! Teeth feel just like after dentist cleaning when used with toothpaste.  Will last a very long time</li>
    <li> This oil is very strong, I add it to my tea and it helps right away with my asthma. This stuff is very overpowering so you may have to think of its benefits to use it this way for encouragement,lol. I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product, one of the highest potency available. One little drop of this is all you need, very fragrant and works well for health purposes. Mix with Coconut/Olive Oil for internal use.</li>
    <li> This Il was recommended by Dr OZ for a natural hand santitizer  Just put a few drops in with coconut oil and rub into hands when needed. It smells nice and not at all too heavy scented.</li>
    <li> it is very strong great drink with juice love it best productd must have an try  it so people get it recomedede</li>
    <li> This is the best Oregano Essential Oil I&#x27;ve used.  Super concentrated so that only a couple drops per use are needed.</li>
    <li> It does have a very strong Oregano smell a little bit to much.</li>
    <li> I put two drops of this oil in a glass of water and drank it down.  A few minutes later I felt a lump in my throat and then I threw it up....ALL of it.  I&#x27;ve taken Oregano oil in water before (not this brand) and I had no problems.  Won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Careful not to use it full strength though, it burns like the dickens!</li>
    <li> Very strong, so be careful.  I have limited experience with these products but this seemed to be exactly as advertised and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to make things simpler and basic in my life so I thought I&#x27;d try making my own hand sanitizer.  You mix coconut oil with some drops of oregano oil and you have a simple hand sanitizer.  It&#x27;s so much nicer for my hands - the other stuff really dries it out and the news lately about the ingredients it contains are not so good. So a simple mix of the oils works out best for me without drying out my hands.  The same mixture also works great as a scalp rub - rub it in at night, sleep, and shampoo in the morning.  I don&#x27;t need conditioner usually except for this brutal winter has been hard on hair/scalp.  Nice combo of the smells - coconut with oregano - not to mention how little it costs.  I have a jar of this mix in each room.</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing an episode of Dr. Oz.  Used a few times as a sanitizer and vaporizer.  Seemed to work well and if very strong.  Good price for the size as well.</li>
    <li> I use the oil for bug spray and mixed with coconut oil for skin care, very aromatic. It works very well for these uses.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I am new to essential oils. I wanted an oregano oil for planters warts.  I did a lot of research before purchasing one.  I heard great things about Doterra, but frankly they are really expensive.  I saw this one and it had really great reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  All of the reviews I have read says that oregano oil is hot and cannot be applied topically without it burning the skin.  I wanted to test that on my foot and put it directly on the wart.  There was no burning or pain whatsoever.  I figured it was the foot so maybe the skin is rougher there so it can handle better. I have been applying for 2 weeks with no results.  Today, after being a bit skeptical I decided to try it on a more sensitive body part without a carrier oil...absolutely nothing. No burning, no red marks, no pain or any sensation whatsoever.  From every single review I have read about oregano oil you cannot use it without a carrier oil because it will burn you. My conclusion, this plant therapy oregano oil is not 100% and must be diluted or something.  I got this because it was cheap so I guess I get what I paid for.  I would not buy a plant therapy product again since I now don&#x27;t trust their products or honesty.  Unless I have super human skin there is no way that this product is 100% as it states.  Do yourself a favor and spend more for the good stuff. I&#x27;m not sure if there is even a point to me completing this bottle or if I should just toss it and get DoTerra.  One good thing came from this purchase...I learned that if I want good quality oils, I need to stick to Doterra. All the Doterra oils I do have are great.  I am still not sure why this plant therapy oregano got so many good reviews.  I wonder if people were reviewing \\&quot;oregano oil\\&quot; and not plant therapy oil...or maybe I just got a really bad batch?</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after reading that it would cure skin rashes.  I should have done more research.  When I rec&#x27;d this, I put a drop on my finger and rubbed it into the rash on my face (next to my right nostril).  It felt hot at first, but tolerable, but after a few minutes, I was on fire, and so I attempted to wash it off with soap and water.  That seemed to spread it around.  I was left with a very tender burn on the right side of my face from the nose outward.  It healed after a few days, but it was a big lesson for me to be more careful.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because of the potency. It is extremely strong. You definitely must dilute it if taking it internally or it will burn your lips, mouth, and throat for a while. I would put a couple of drops in a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. The only thing I really do not like is the dropper system. I think a regular eye dropper would have been so much better. I think it is a little difficult to get exactly how much you want from it. This is why I did not give it 5 stars. But other than that, it is great. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and doesnt take much to use even when drinking it or mixing it with someting, so use cautiously, very small drops.</li>
    <li> A friend told me that applying this product to moles, made them disappear.  Unfortunately, it burns the skin around it.  Be careful.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is great ! I got bit by some kind of spider ( the bite looked like it might of been brown recluse who bit me, cant say for sure though ) . I diluted this oregano essential oil with some coconut oil and started to rub it on the bite as many times a day as I could remember to ( about 4 to 6 times a day ). Amazingly the bite didn&#x27;t get out of control and healed up after a week or two. If you research brown recluse spider bites , they can get ugly, so I was very worried.</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great product will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Used it on a spot that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of... Worked great!!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Item came on time and was exactly as listed</li>
    <li> The real deal. This stuff is potent. Be sure to cut it with coconut oil. I put 4 drops per tablespoon. It shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Really nice antiseptic qualities when combined with tea tree and clove - beware that the combo is a bit strong and can cause a burning sensation on skin, but mix with a little carrier oil or other neutral and its quite effective.  Very pleased with my purchases from this seller!</li>
    <li> As with all Plant Therapy oils, this one is just as pure and beneficial as the others we use. It&#x27;s strong and must be used with a carrier oil, however, and people need to take note of that fact!</li>
    <li> I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS ONE AND THE OIL OF OREGANO I PURCHASE FROM THE WHOLE FOODS STORE.  I REALLY LOVE TAKING THIS BECAUSE I WORK AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND KIDS OR ALWAYS GETTING SICK AND OF COURSE THEY LIKE TO HUG ON US SO WHEN I FEEL LIKE I&#x27;M GETTING SICK I TAKE 5 DROPS A DAY FOR ABOUT 3-5 DAYS.  BUT WITH IN THE FIRST DAY I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE!!!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I took this, I tried putting a couple drops into a glass of water. Bad idea. It burned my lips, my tongue, my mouth, and my throat. Also the oregano taste and odor is rather potent and overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not how you should take it.  You should dilute it in another oil. So now what I do is, I use a shot glass, pour an ounce of olive oil into the glass, then add 10+ drops of this. Then I quickly throw it back. Sometimes I chase with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking this because I think I have Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). My stomach puffs up painfully after eating and I get crippling migraines. I read on the internet that Oregano Oil has anti-bacterial properties, and it seems to work so far with this product. My bloating subsides a little (not completely), and my brain fog clears up noticeably.</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia and this stuff WORKS ON THE PAIN (always dilute with olive or coconut oil) !!! Immediate relief!!! Cant live without it. I refuse to ask for pain pills.</li>
    <li> I use this like mad during cold and flu season! Everyone in my family gets this on the bottoms of their feet(mixed with carrier oil) before bed. I use it twice a day during cold/flu season(because a Mommy can NOT get sick).</li>
    <li> So glad I found this...great price and did the job I needed</li>
    <li> A great product.  The diluted versions of oil of oregano do not work for me,  this one is pure.&lt;br /&gt;Use it carefully.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use because I had seen recommendations for it on several self help sites. I was suffering from a severe sinus infection and had tried many other avenues to find relief. I had not been to MD yet although I had an upcoming appointment. This arrived in the mail two days before so I thought I would see if it would bring relief. I used it orally at least  6 times before going to the MD but found no relief. The taste was so unbearable but I tried to chase it with OJ but still gagged. I will try to continue , but maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Good product, good value, fast shipping, arrived in good condition.  Useful oil for skin irritations. Strong enough to dilute prior to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really really pure. Accidentally let some of it touch my cheek and gums, and for a few weeks afterwards I was in a lot of pain due to the oil just burning the affected areas.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s also a good sign because it&#x27;s very pure, and stores don&#x27;t usually carry anything like this. Clears up sinuses and lungs like nothing else. Best way to ingest is to put a few drops into an empty capsule shell and down it with water while eating food. Best product on the market right now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using YL Oregano Essential Oil for many years now...I&#x27;ve never used any other brand of essential oils. However, I was intrigued by all the positive reviews here on Amazon, so I decided to try PT Oregano essential oil. PT brand is just a fraction of the cost of YL brand, so I thought it was worth a shot. I am so glad I tried it! Honestly, I cannot tell ANY difference between YL and PT brands and I did a side by side test. Smell is the same, taste is identical, burn is the same. After ordering this, I&#x27;ve ordered other oils in PT brand and am impressed! I may convert totally to PT...and that&#x27;s a HUGE deal because I was a YL fanatic. Try this.. you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews... but this is a scam. there are claims that it cures cancer, diabetes, herpes, etc.. I bought into it without doing the proper research. There are no peer reviewed articles that back any of these claims.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way a lot burns a long time!!</li>
    <li> Love all Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
    <li> It works just like my research said it would. I would buy it again and again and again and again.</li>
    <li> omg, this taste is, and it s burns as well so first time users beware ...but i will deal with it if it work for me....have to find a way not to taste it as its going down.  first time was definterly a shock.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  A small drop is all you need.  I am just learning about the amazing benefits of oregano essential oils and others.  I plan to add some to coconut oil to make a natural non drying hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> I had gotten other oil of oregano in the past and it was diluted. This was more of a regular strength product. I use it on my toenails. It would be nice if it came with an eyedropper though.</li>
    <li> I have not used this oil but I saw a reviewer mention she puts it in her cat&#x27;s food. Please DO NOT FEED THIS OIL TO CATS, oregano oil is highly toxic to them. Cat&#x27;s lack the liver enzyme used to detoxify themselves of phenols (aromatic compounds found in most plants)and it build up in their system and eventually causes liver failure. Also, most essential oils are harmful to cats. Please inform yourself before giving any to your feline friends.</li>
    <li> We had to mix it with some olive oil because it was so strong. But I don&#x27;t mind it, it will last longer. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost a week. I don&#x27;t know if its working yet.</li>
    <li> Have use to help with the flu on my husband and 2 kids. I really think it helped to shorten their symptoms. What a relief</li>
    <li> This product has worked well on certain type skin rashes. Bottle lasts for a year due to only needing a small amount each time.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a treatment for corns in the paws of dog&#x27;s feet.... not only does it stink to high heaven (and I love fresh oregano!) it must be diluted so it won&#x27;t damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is stale smelling and not at all pleasant, and the anti-fungal/anti-viral properties are yet unproven, so it went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Good product .  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time &amp; in perfect condition. I knew oregano oil was a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; oil &amp; not to be used directly on the skin without a carrier oil such as coconut, olive, or vegetable. Though I mixed the oregano oil with a carrier oil, I used the concoction to remove several small moles on my face &amp; one large one on my leg. The one on my leg was not affected as negatively as the ones on my face. I have small patches of surface skin burns on my face &amp; would recommend this product be used on a person&#x27;s face. This outcome was NO fault of the sellers &amp; I would purchase from the seller again. I will simply not use this product on my face &amp; will be more careful when putting any product on such sensitive skin. Good product, great scent! I may use the remainder of the oil in my oil burner as it has an earthy scent, which I like.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!! Purchased for my sister who has a rash and google suggested this product.  Rubbed on the skin surface the smell was offensive to everyone around.  When used as 2 drops in a cup of juice it repeated to the point of making her nassau. The cost was too much and it was used only twice.</li>
    <li> I love the product, however, like others have mentioned, the spout sucks. It makes it difficult to only get one drop out at a time. Too many drops and you&#x27;ll be burnin!</li>
    <li> This product has many uses.i&#x27;d wish i bought it sooner!!!!product ws sent days thn predicted arrival date.Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing.  I like collecting as many natural medical treatments as I can... this is a wonderful addition to my &amp;#34;Apothecary&amp;#34; Bag.  As with anything... you must use it properly and not expect a miracle within a few minutes.  Natural treatments mostly boost your body&#x27;s own ability to heal itself.  Oregano Oil by Plant Therapy Essential Oils is the real thing.  Buy Some.</li>
    <li> damn i used it on my neck and it burned the hell out of my skin it peeled off and now they retuned to normal thank god they didn&#x27;t turn into black :) watch out friends don&#x27;t use it without dilution !!!</li>
    <li> Helps  inflamation of tummy.  However takes several drops making it difficult to tolerate.  I continue to use as noticeable difference in symptoms of IBS.  It does take some getting use to the taste.  Not to mention portion for price.  Will not purchase again from seller as there are other brands available for less.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended I try oregano oil for a skin condition.  I thought this would be perfect BUT YOU NEED TO DILUTE THIS QUITE A BIT!  I tried one part in 10 mixed with massage oil and it still burned my skin!!!  It ended up being one part in 100 that seemed to work best.  My skin condition is clearing up but, if you don&#x27;t know any better like me, this can give you a painful rash!!</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and seems to do the job well.</li>
    <li> This brand (Plant Therapy) is POTENT!  Please remember to use a carrier oil. If not, you insides are sure to burn!  I put the oil in a gel cap and take with food for immune system support.  It seems to burn if taken on an empty stomach. I referred my grandfather to this product for the anti-inflammatory benefits to assist him with Arthritis in his knees who had been struggling with pain for months.  He called me on day 3 and thanked me for referring this essential oil!  He can now go back to work without the pain!  I am very pleased with this oil and the brand.</li>
    <li> Oregano essential oil is great for man things. This is a high quality very potent oil and you definitely want to keep it away from children and pets.. Oregano oil can burn you so make sure you always dilute it properly with a carrier oil. I recommend with any essential oil that you research the uses and safety instructions online or in a book. That being said this oil is very high quality and is working well in my home made mouth wash. I also use a few drops in coconut oil when i oil pull. I look forward to exploring the further uses of this oil and ordering more oils from this company. This was my first time ordering from plant therapy and I am very pleased with the quality of the oil.</li>
    <li> I am new at getting into the essential oils.  I would love to be able to purchase some young living oils but they are crazily expensive so i opted for this brand.  I chose Plant therapy b.c i read some reviews on them saying that they were a good comparison to young living oils.  In comparison to other oils that i have the dropper releases the oils out very fast.  Just something to note.</li>
    <li> Received the product in a timely fashion.  I&#x27;m not sure of the effects of the oil yet as I just started using it.  It was recommended for treatment of fungal toenails.  If it works, I will let you know.</li>
    <li> I use it to battle fungus and yeast which bugs me occasionally.</li>
    <li> A word of caution!!  This bottle comes with no directions or specifications on it....  Do not apply or ingest this undiluted!!! (dilute with olive oil)  This is a very strong and powerful oil and it will burn you!!!!  Just want everyone to know!!!  Other than that it is great stuff</li>
    <li> Love have oregano oil in my cabinet and this brand was good!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality Oregano Oil.</li>
    <li> Hi, every thing was pretty good, product was in good shape and came in a timely matter, wondered why it couldn&#x27;t ship all together at the same time from the same company. Also didn&#x27;t realize til I opened the bottle, but I got clary sage instead of the oregano :( I have been ordering a few and didn&#x27;t see the mistake until to late.  Thanks, Kristy</li>
    <li> Another surprise. Very strong smell, which is good. Great for digestive problems, Viral Infections, PAIN, but can cause pain too if your not careful. I saw someone on here somewhere that said they put a drop under their tongue.... PLEASE DO NOT do that. Never use this oil with out a carrier or heavily diluted. This is a fantastic E.O., but use with caution.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Must dilute with olive oil, otherwise it will burn your skin. Great  product otherwise. Will buy again soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a supplement for my son and myself. After exhaustive research and education I bought this product by Plant Therapy Essential Oils. The product itself it incredibly potent!! I had no doubts about it&#x27;s authenticity or claim of being 100% pure, believe me it is!! I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I stress that it must be suitably dissolved being ingestion. One drop with 3 drops of coconut oil and then added to a half cup of water or juice still made my mouth burn. We&#x27;re still trying to find the perfect mix for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint from this product is that the bottle itself says that it should not be ingested. I understand not being able to give out &#x27;medical&#x27; advice but I was extremely unhappy that no direction was suggested at all. I called the company to inquire about the product further and the woman I spoke with was very short and unhelpful. This product is pure but given the lack of information from the company regarding dosage and use and simple product education/information, I won&#x27;t be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy has some of the best grade oils. This Oregano oil is very strong smelling and very potent. It needs to be applied neatly (with a carrier oil) no matter what!</li>
    <li> OMG this oil is no joke. When I first received I added a few drops to a glass of water and thought I could drink it.  It was so strong that  it burned my mouth and lips.  After that experience, had to use it in gel caps in order to swallow it without burning my mouth.  Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  This oil is supposed to be a HOT oil. I finished the bottle in Jo time. My husband and I both used it almost everyday.  I need to order more from plant therapy.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on the recommendation of a friend who follows a strict macrobiotic diet and has essentially eschewed conventional antibiotic treatments in favor of using Oregano Oil.  I have to say--I have never reviewed a product online before, and I buy nearly everything online so I get asked to review my purchases A LOT.  This product is absolutely amazing.  I have used it on myself, my husband and my children and each time it has cured their symptoms within a day or two.  For myself, I had a recurring infection that didn&#x27;t seem to react well to antibiotics, which I had taken at least 5 times in the past year.  The last time the infection recurred, I used Oregano Oil for about 5 days, 3 times a day.  I DO NOT recommend you use that much of it, because it actually burned the tip of my tongue on both sides and I believe it also caused pharyngolaryngeal reflux, which I currently have.  Basically, a part of my throat has become inflamed, causing my voice to be constantly hoarse.  I used it so much because of the severity and recurrence of the infection, which has not returned since I used it over a month ago.  For my husband, he had a severe cold and I coaxed him into using it against his wishes--he was significantly better within 24 hours and he used it again a couple of days later and then was completely cured the next day.  My 8 year old son gets a recurring cough throughout the school year, and at the first sign of it I gave him a drop of this oil in juice (the only way he can stand it), and he was instantly better the next day.  It really only takes ONE DROP, under the tongue, to cure whatever ails you.  Take that one drop each day until symptoms are gone, but don&#x27;t take more than that!  You will experience an intense burning sensation (so intense that the first time I took it, I nearly vomited) once you swallow it, and it lasts for about a minute.  Have a glass of something ready to drink as soon as you swallow it, because trust me, you are going to need it.  So far, I only have positive things to say but want to warn against taking too much of it.  If I can get rid of this throat problem, I will continue using it whenever I experience symptoms for any kind of ailment and I highly recommend it.  One other warning--don&#x27;t ever try to spit it out.  I accidentally put 2 drops in my mouth and tried to spit some out--it burned and chapped my lips for days and actually removed the skin on my face right under my bottom lip where it touched me, which was painful.  This stuff is so potent that it could be used as a deadly weapon, but if you use just a drop and only once a day at most, it will work wonders.t.

    <li> I got this oil to remove a mole on my husbands face that he&#x27;s had 30+ years. It worked great. Careful it&#x27;s a very strong oil. I did use it neet ( without anything added), but that&#x27;s because he&#x27;s a big strong man. I don&#x27;t suggest that on more sensitive skin. It is a great quality oil and arrived quite quickly!</li>
    <li> A great antibiotic!  I add a few drops to olive oil for oil pulling. This stuff is powerful so dilute before using.</li>
    <li> Good oil and less than young  living and deferral.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a skin rash I got after a trip to southern Missouri.  Not sure what kind of bug bites I had, but they were driving me crazy.  I diluted it with coconut oil and used it on my bites twice a day.  After about 2 weeks, I can honestly say, I think they&#x27;re nearly gone.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this, at least once a day till I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m in the clear, but I do believe the anti-bacterial, viral, and parasitic properties of this oil helped.  In fact, I bought a second bottle for back-up.  Now this is very strong, so make sure to dilute it with oil.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell - very, very strong.  Would not put this on and go into public.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face everyday ( I have acne and dark spots ) I see the difference on my face, I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and I am going to continue to use it. I will review it again in about 6 weeks. I dilute it with olive oil (just a drop) the smell is very strong. The results are absolutely great so far! It&#x27;s also great for cold sores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my toes just a few times and have noticed the fungus receding already. I&#x27;ve used it on cuts, etc and this is just a miracle. Love it!</li>
    <li> Luv it, good quality, 100% recommended it</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff that makes cheap cleaner. All you need is 3 drops and some water, then you get a very decent cleaner.</li>
    <li> I found this stuff to be amazing to use on the gums when you have soreness or pain. taste is awful but it clears up pain &amp; gum issues. The application of this bottle was inferior to the one I purchased &amp; used up from another company. fortunately the stopper from the other bottle fit this one so all is well with application. But a Q-tip will do also! I went with this product strictly on price I have not used it so I am assuming it will preform like the other brand. great to use with a teething child.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this seller&#x27;s product, yet after thorough research I did make a purchase. The reviews from others in addition to the quality of ingredients used were a huge factor that assisted me.  Thanks goes to all the people who took the time to post their reviews.  I was first amazed by how quick the products arrived because in the notification it said it would arrive approximately 4 days later from the order date.  It was a huge surprise when it actually arrived in a day and a half.  This was more than fantastic as I needed them very quickly.  All the bottles were packaged very neatly in individually wrapped bubble wrap; there was no breakage or leakage.  I am extremely happy and would definitely order again.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to oils, but I love these products.  The prices are great and this makes learning so much easier.</li>
    <li> I had read and heard about the Oil of Oregano on Dr. Oz and he stated to get the desired effect you needed at least 40%  This is 100%.  One night when pollen was really high in my area I was stuffed up, snoring, dry throat, and I had been coughing up whitish snot for days got up at 3am put 2 drops in a glass of juice and swigged it down. it burned my upper lip, roof of my mouth, and throat but I instantly could take a deep breath, no cough no stuffiness instantly. I had some drainage but not till about 15 min later went back to bed and woke up symptom free.  I gave the same dosage to a friend who was having issues with Asthma and the very next day she could breathe freely she will never ingest again but rubs it on her feet and chest mixed with olive oil daily.  I think she secretly want to strangle me for her burnt upper lip, but she can&#x27;t deny she&#x27;s breathing much better.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best oils around for medicinal use. whenever feeling a virus or illness coming on this is what i start with.</li>
    <li> It is very deluted and not like the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Seriously people....this stuff is HOT!  I have tried many brands of Oregano Oil and put a few drops under my tongue....no problem.  Made the mistake of doing it with this stuff.  My tongue, lips and mouth were on fire for about 3 hours.  When they say to dilute it - do it!  Great price considering the amount you get when you dilute it.  If you want an oil you can use straight out of the bottle, this isn&#x27;t it!  However, if you want to get a great price and are willing to mix it up...this is great.</li>
    <li> I love essential oils because I would rather use something that is all natural then to use anything chemically enhanced like antibiotics if I can help it. Plus you can use all of them in so many different ways for so many different things. That being said I loved this product!!! You do want to dilute it for most things but that just means it&#x27;ll last forever! I would definitely stick with this brand anytime I need to re up my essential oils and the shipping was quick and the price was great for what you get!!</li>
    <li> I listened to the radio host Joyce Riley on gcnlive.com in the mornings.  One of her guest mentioned how using a swab and oil of oregano would help lessen the ringing in a persons ears as this was caused by an out of balance of parasites.  It burned like crazy for the first several minutes but when it calmed down the oil worked like a charm!  The ringing has lessen quiet a bit and I&#x27;m glad to have purchased this natural product to treat this issue without drugs.  Great product I will buy again.</li>
    <li> How can you use the word \\&quot;choleretic\\&quot; for exemple on the label, as one of the qualities, and then \\&quot;for external use\\&quot;..???? i added 3 drops on a cup of tea and burned my mouth with it, my fault i didn&#x60;t see the contradiction.</li>
    <li> Good product,  fast delivery</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy has the best oils - thank you for such a healing product.</li>
    <li> Very strong tasting - must be diluted. So far, so good for me. However, I do wish the oil wouldn&#x27;t come out of the bottle so fast--too many drops at one time.</li>
    <li> Great quality oil at a fair price.  Will be buying with this company again. Plant Therapy Essential Oils are all very good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! High quality. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Sooooo hot due to purity but highly effective.  Cures common warts on my kids and helps fight infections.  Goid stuff!</li>
    <li> I use a drop or two diluted in olive oil when fighting a cold. I have an impression that it helps.</li>
    <li> We believe in the natural way ~&lt;br /&gt;So, we use oil of oregano and have, for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t know though was the strength of this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to learn how to dilute it, without losing the power of the healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t figure out it was undiluted until my lips went numb...for quite a while!!!</li>
    <li> I researched this product because I was having issues with PND and so many people had good results so I decided to try it. Ive only been taking it for about a week, and see a slight difference. I am able to sleep mist night without my sinuses dripping. Let me say this... It is STRONG so all u really need is a drop maybe two so be careful with this stuff. If things improve then I will do an update on the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a good quality oil. Already killed if a fungal infection in my husband and an ear infection  in 2 days. A little goes a long way so be careful because it has heating qualities and may burn. ALWAYS dilute it with a carrier</li>
    <li> I use 4 drops iin my bottle of water and the strength is just right. Not burning but strong, just the way I like it. Other people in my family got sick and I managed to stay healthy. I really like this oil. I also use it in my diffuser at night.</li>
    <li> This is the second or third time that we have purchased this product.  Overall, it seems to be a good value.</li>
    <li> So far so good, need to use it with olive oil. Just tried it on pimples that didn&#x27;t want to go away and it definitely shrunk them.</li>
    <li> This oregano essential oil is exactly what I was looking for to add to my natural healing oils collections. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Great oil.  Working perfectly for my daughter&#x27;s wart!</li>
    <li> A very good product essential for the first aid kit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, I dilute 5 drops every morning &amp; drink it. It has helped me tremendously with acid reflux. I very rarely take meds. It&#x27;s very bitter, it&#x27;s a good idea to have something to drink right after to wash it down.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> The product was delivered quickly and as advertised. It seems to be a quality product. However, it is very strong, only use a tiny bit at a time</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realized that it was undiluted and I burned my taste buds, it&#x27;s definitively pure :) fortunately I got them back about 10 days later... :). So make sure to mix it with olive oil before using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is what it says it is - if you&#x27;re looking for the strongest, most potent oil of oregano get this one. My husband takes it daily and he has used different strengths, but you definitely get the most bang for your buck with this one.</li>
    <li> Ne sure to dilute the oil. It is so strong that is will burn your skin if you don&#x27;t dilute it. I used it to fight toe fungus. It&#x27;s been about 2 months now and I am starting to see some good results. I realize its a slow process but I am very happy with this oregano oil so far.</li>
    <li> bought this to put with coconut oil for healing up dogs mouth bad infection it is doing great almost healed at this point will continue both because it works so great and he loves it</li>
    <li> Purchased this oil to kill a plantar wart. The wart is bubbling and I think I&#x27;m making better progress than the year and a half I&#x27;ve been seeing the dermatologist!</li>
    <li> not sure how much to use, but experimenting, ty:)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time  A miraculous product  Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no medical doctor and I am not making any medical claims. However, when I was fighting the onset of a cold I started taking oregano oil and the cold fizzled out in two days. Others got sick and stayed sick for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Great product , love it</li>
    <li> I wont give this one star because I haven&#x27;t used it (although it is in my cabinet) I looked at the bottle and I guess I didn&#x27;t notice where It said external use real tiny, So one day while staying at my parents house I decided to give it a try I put a few drops in about a 1/2 cup of water in a bottle....and began downing it...well as soon as I did that my lips began burning and my mouth and throat was on fire :/ I flipped out and made my sister call poison control and the company.. The lady on the phone was kind of shocked that I drunk it, and told me I should be ok and I was a little while later. After that my sister got a really good laugh on my stupidity. Worst blonde moment of that week! I will keep this in my cabinet though as it can be used to several different things.. And I&#x27;ve learned to double check everything lol</li>
    <li> Wow.  STRONG!  I put 3-4 drops in a big glass of water...I like oregano...and mixed well.  Took a drink and my lips and mouth started burning.  Poured out and got a fresh glass of water, which helped a lot.  My lips were numb for about 10 minutes.  I mixed about 10ml olive oil with 2 drops to try next time!  Very happy to have such a great, inexpensive, high quality essential oil in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR TOE NAIL FUNGUS.  THE NAIL IS NOT BRITTLE AND BREAKING OFF LIKE IT DID BEFORE.  IT ALMOST LOOK NORMAL . I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I SEE IT IS WORKING. A COUPLE OF DROPS MIX WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL TO DILUTE IT.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Make sure to dilute it with some coconut oil!</li>
    <li> I will most dëf order this product again.....this was the first time I tried this product before.  You can tell by the taste  and  and  smell it will get the job one.  The price is rêasônable...overall great product..received the product lightening speed.</li>
    <li> the product is fine. Haven&#x27;t use them yet, but I do like the size of the tablets.  I am tired of having to swallowed&lt;br /&gt;humongous sized tablets.  I was already taking oregano oil supplements.  I just ordered some more before I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem ordering from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Very strong. Mix it with a carrier oil or feel the burn. As with all essential oils you shouldn&#x27;t use full strength on the skin.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered oregano oil because I heard that it was good for removing skin tags and moles. I can say it definitely works! Shipment was very fast too!</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is god-sent for allergy sufferers. I use it 1 drop of Oil of Oregano to 1/2 to 1 tsp of Olive Oil to cut the spiciness of the Oil of Oregano every morning (placed underneath my tongue for as long as I withstand it) and my allergy attacks have significantly reduced. I have used this now for 1 month combined with a daily nasal wash using saline salt neti pot and it has made a huge difference. I highly recommend this Oil of Oregano for allergy sufferers. The main reason I have stopped taking antihistamines was due to a recent article from JAMA (Journal of American Medical Associations) indicating all kinds of side affects attributed to long term consumptions of antihistamines, one of which is Alzheimer disease especially for the elderly.</li>
    <li> Bought this for medicinal purpose to combat pain. I use a few drops mixed in with tea made from organic tumeric powder. It is very strong and can burn your mouth, a few drops not shakes is enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always surprised by how good plant therapy&#x27;s oils are. This did exactly what I needed it to. Be warned: this is a hot oil so dilute it more than you would with other oils.</li>
    <li> Great product. I mix it with a carrier oil, and rub it on my sore muscles.</li>
    <li> very good product I love it.</li>
    <li> If you get this on your skin, it will burn you.  If you are careful not to, it will help you.</li>
    <li> Quick and just as listed</li>
    <li> A fine product. Learn how to dilute it with another oil so that it doesn&#x27;t burn when taking it.</li>
    <li> The real deal right here for a great price! Fast shipping. 100% happy.  Will definitely order again from here. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very strong.  Delude.  It burns</li>
    <li> Pretty good ! I do not experience the burning sensation that many have experienced. However, I mix it with coconut oil. I notice a change in my body, which led me to believe that something is working.</li>
    <li> I use it for my face (sparingly diluted with a good cream) as it has antibacterial properties. I also use a drop on my toothbrush and toothpaste. I have been brushing with this regularly now and the tarter build up I had has disapeared, my teath are also whiter and I know my breath smells great.</li>
    <li> Oregano oil can be used for so many things, I enjoy trying different essential oils and have been pleased with Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> This is very strong and shiping is super fast, but it would be nice to see a NON-GMO label so guess will be using it as a topical application.</li>
    <li> DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE UNDILUTED. DIlute with some other oil, like coconut/olive or smoothie. I made the mistake and it hurts. other then that this is a very good brand and oregano oil itself is a wonder given only by God through nature. (and unlike regular pharma has little/no side effects)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only drawback of this product is the bottle dispenser. it is really bad.</li>
    <li> This 10 ml vessel is a power house of oregano, reminding me of Oreganol P73 strength, but less cost.  Expect this volume will last me a long time...and feeling confident, ordering other herbs from Plant Therapy...</li>
    <li> Heard about this and used it  on my knee to alleviate the gnawing pain of osteoarthritis, it helped. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I  got these warts under my feet and they would not go away. Went to my podiatrist but their treatment did not help. I tend to use a lot if natural products and while searching came across many great reviews for oregano  oil, so I tried it and it seems to be helping.  Be careful though it burns if put in the wrong place</li>
    <li> this stuff will burn your skin if you do not dilute it well.  Worked great with sunflower oil for my daughters ear infection as well as for my oil swishing.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my son&#x27;s flu symptoms.  It must be diluted first! Great company, great product! Its pure and inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Good product with lots of usages.</li>
    <li> Very strong. Needs dilution</li>
    <li> Nice oil good product</li>
    <li> Very helpful oil, I used it for allergies, and sinus, and it really worked.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to use it direct to your mouth, it will burn you!!!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll like it to come with a guide to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Love the price, and the fast shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;Really recomend it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as recommended by my acupuncturist to treat a Candida infection.  It is great!  It only takes a few drops.  Be prepared that it is VERY hot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the oregano essential oil. It was everything I could have hoped for, including being reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Cannot go wrong with Plant Therapy Essential Oils!</li>
    <li> Great and good quality essential oil.  Received on-time and very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> awesome, using it as massage oil with coconut oitl and it feels and smells amazing :)</li>
    <li> no problems.&lt;br /&gt;works fine.&lt;br /&gt;really works on a cold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a wart on the back of my foot for 5+ years, that has grown to almost the size of a dime, and also created little clusters of warts near it. I&#x27;ve tried to freeze off, vinegar, banana peel, and &#x27;fast acting wart cream&#x27; with none of it working as fast as this has. I ordered this a week or so ago, and have only put it on roughly at night while I sleep and sometimes throughout the day. A lot of the reviews said this oil would burn me, so I diluted it. I didn&#x27;t see anything, so I tried it full strength on my huge wart and it didn&#x27;t burn, it didn&#x27;t hurt, or anything, I was glad, but, was it doing what I wanted it to? YES! I waited a few days before I checked, I left it uncovered for a full day, and when I got home, I took my foot file and filed my wart down as far as I could without it hurting, and it was almost half the thickness it was to begin with! I&#x27;ve now gotten it to roughly skin level. It is not fully gone yet, but I haven&#x27;t been as consistent with it lately due to my too eager filing made it really sensitive, and I didn&#x27;t want it to burn me.  For a split second, a few minutes ago, thought, &#x27;wonder what it tastes like?&#x27; and just touched the dropper to my tongue. OMG, don&#x27;t do this, people. learn from my mistakes! it is hot, that&#x27;s true, and it will numb your tongue for a while, and you&#x27;ll taste oregano for a while, but nothing life altering. More so a horrible taste in your mouth. Granted, it wasn&#x27;t an actual drop or anything. I will update when my wart is gone.  UPDATE 02/13/15:  I have backed off a little from using the Oregano Oil, more so because I have been too busy in the mornings and too tired/forgetful at night to remember to put it on. BUT, i have noticed the largest wart I have has begun to shrink on the sides, whereas before the height was greatly reduced, now I notice the sides are starting to be able to peel up and flake off (sorry if TMI.) also, I had a small wart, a little smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, and i had been putting theOregano oil on there at the same time as I had for the larger wart. It had pretty much stayed the same, but it felt harder. I have a mild case of dermatillomania, which means i will pick at any skin imperfections. i noticed if i picked at the sides, it would kind of easily separate from the healthy skin around it. without much pain or effort, i was able to lift it out of the healthy skin, maybe have a tiny bit left, which once it heals, i will apply more Oregano oil. more updates to come.  UPDATE 02/26/15:  As before, I haven&#x27;t been consistent with the oregano oil on my warts, but when i have, i definitely get results. it appears now the large wart I have, is going away. earlier tonight, it appeared to have parts of the old wart (TMI...) flaking off and peeling up. i would try to pick it off, but it is still too painful. while the areas where it is peeling off, it is still kind of that hard feeling where the wart is, but where i&#x27;ve already had it peel off, feels like regular skin again underneath, leaving me to believe it&#x27;s essentially pulling all of the wart out of your skin, and when you file the dead skin, you&#x27;re just filing away part of the wart. here&#x27;s what i did:  Last night, i tried putting the oregano oil on all of my warts on my foot (they&#x27;re all on the heel of my foot) with a cotton ball torn into pieces only big enough for the wart, with a good amount of the oil (undiluted, still) on it, then duct taped it to my foot. i had tried this method for weeks daily with the apple cider vinegar (acv for short) years, ago, but it became extremely painful to the point of me limping everywhere i went. although it was working: it turned the largest wart black, it was extremely painful, but i digress. i tried this method again because while the oregano oil is great to begin with, if you deprive the warts of oxygen while using the oregano oil, it will help to better absorb all of that oil that will kill the wart virus, in my mind anyway. this morning, i took off the duct tape, and did some things around the house for a few hours, while it was uncovered. later on, i took my foot file and filed down what i could. i could file for a long time, and it still didn&#x27;t hurt. just one night of the duct tape method, and maybe a night or two with the band-aid method helped to reduce the small warts on my foot to skin level. simply amazing.  one warning: if you&#x27;re going to put the oil on your warts and cover them with a bandaid, and especially duct tape, at night, and when you wake up and take it off to take a shower, it will hurt. the water will get in there and make it swell, which hurts a lot. this may be because i constantly file down the wart so there is no dead skin on it, and the oil is really getting down into the wart to kill it, i&#x27;m not sure. but i do know that while it does hurt at night, depending on if i&#x27;m putting (even the slightest) bit of pressure on it, it hurts a lot worst when you&#x27;re taking a shower and the dead skin kinda swells up. just a warning.  i read in some other reviews about it helping to prevent sickness. i believe this is true too. last week i had that dry feeling in my throat like something was trying to come on, and several people i work with, as well as my boyfriend were sick, and i didn&#x27;t none of it. i took my DILUTED mix of this, which is half olive oil and half oregano oil, and got about 1/3 of the dropper full, had some water on standby as a chaser, and dropped it on the back of my tongue, didn&#x27;t breathe for a minute until i chugged some water real quick. definitely helped the taste, and plus i ate something right after, which helped to not have an after taste. but, i didn&#x27;t get sick! i&#x27;m not sure if i was coming down with something, but it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry!  the small wart i talking about in a previous update seems to be completely gone. there was a scab for a while, that has since gone, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as if there is a wart there anymore. success! more updates to come!  UPDATE: 09/25/2015  Almost 7 months to the day, and they have not come back or anything. Seeing as how they were in a tender/sensitive area, I&#x27;d have to be careful how I place my feet when I&#x27;m sitting at the computer, which I do a lot of. I sometimes catch myself being careful to not hurt my foot/heel and remember they&#x27;re not there anymore and carry on. I posted a review much similar to this on earthclinic.com, which is a great website to find natural remedies to your ails.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the flat warts I had on my arm. It worked but since it kind of burns if you just put it on by itself I mixed it with some vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> Very potent oil.  Definitely recommend to others for therapeutic use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this product and with the Plant Therapy company. They care very much about me as a customer.</li>
    <li> With tick season just beginning, I bought this Oil of Oregano to put around tick bites to help reduce the chance of infection from bacteria they carry.  This one smells very potent.</li>
    <li> The oil is amazing-- pure and intense.  I&#x27;ve used it for sore throats, athlete&#x27;s foot, sweat rash, and gum health.  The bottle is annoying, though:  instead of a squeezable dropper, it has the &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; type opening (think the top of a sesame oil or vinegar bottle).  This is hard to control and often results in putting three or four drops in instead of one, or getting the oil on the outside of the bottle.  With sesame oil, four drops or one is no big deal.  But with THIS STUFF, you have to be so careful.  Putting a drop into some almond oil makes a warming, tingling cure for a shoulder rash.  Putting four drops into the almond oil makes a fiery concoction that keeps you awake with the burning and itching of your now much-more-irritated skin.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  It works anyway; the burning goes away and it&#x27;ll cure what ails ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh-- careful with putting this on under clothes.  I was putting it full strength on the bottoms of my feet and between my toes for mild athlete&#x27;s foot.  I usually wear sandals.  One day I wore socks and shoes and the oil stayed in the socks and irritated my feet for hours.  I felt burning halfway through my work day and found an inch-long blister that looked like a chemical burn under the spot where the oil had stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;Put it in another bottle, if you can.&lt;br /&gt;Only use it full strength on the bottoms of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Dilute with another oil (not water) for any other skin (chest, back, stomach, face)</li>
    <li> Very useful to combat stubborn respiratory diseases , but be warned , truth be told ,the taste is really strong!</li>
    <li> So, I started searching for a natural remedy to cure a stubborn asymptomatic enterococcus UTI that didnt respond to: Antibiotics Uva ursi Buchu D-mannose Cranberry Echinacea Goldenseal Raw garlic Homeopathy  I found oregano and decided to try it first putting it on my sole for a few weeks then internally considering I already had a bottle of this product at home. Have been taking 1 drop diluted in 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil multiple times/day and guess what? This is day 2 and not only I dont think is working I also got a full sinus infection in the meatime and feeling miserable and this oregano is not doing its magic with me at all. I am very disappointed. If you have any tips feel free to contact me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after reading it was beneficial for toe nail fungus. I&lt;br /&gt;did not have thickened or discolored nails but my toe  nail has been separated from the nail&lt;br /&gt;bed for 10 years. I have used this for a week 2 to 3 times a day and my nail is growing, the area that is growing&lt;br /&gt;is connected to the nail bed and it looks healthy. I mixed the oregano oil with olive oil. It works and I am extremely happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using plant therapy products for a while now &amp; I must say I was shocked by the price &amp; the quality....I&#x27;ve completely quit ordering from my other supplier lowhich was very expensive &amp; the shipping was very expensive also...&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is fast too....&lt;br /&gt;NEEDLESS TOO STAY I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED W/ THE PRODUCTS!&lt;br /&gt;FYI: the oregano is very strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> the bottle was broken oregano was all over the bottom of the box</li>
    <li> I I like it as far as smell. I have yet to try it</li>
    <li> this is a quality product; worth the price.  i have several oils from this manuf. they give you what&#x27;s promised.</li>
    <li> Havent used this product yet , but Ive heard that it great in taking care of infection when you get a cold.</li>
    <li> Used this product in a mixture for my dogs and it worked for his dry skin and his hair stopped falling out within 3days .</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil in a capsule - one drop three times daily - will cure the worst bronchitis and asthuma within a&lt;br /&gt;week.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake of getting it on your tongue, I&#x27;m not sure I will have taste buds again.</li>
    <li> Very strong!!! You have to be extremely careful when using this!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - very potent!!!</li>
    <li> Item received quickly! This is powerful stuff. I diluted a couple drops of it in olive oil before using and it was still burned so I diluted it further.</li>
    <li> worked great, received very quickly</li>
    <li> LOVE Plant Therapy Essential Oil.  VERY potent! Please use a carrier oil with Oregano. One of my friends told me I could place a few drops under my tongue and I did try it... Totally burnt my ass up. Other than listening to my idiotic friends this has been a great product and will be ordering more Essential oils from Plant Therapy very soon! Next on my order list is Frankincense.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Potent. The real thing. Hot!</li>
    <li> My 1st  order I stated &amp;#34;The Oregano oil came packaged quite well and is good quality&amp;#34;  It is exactly what I ordered and I am a satisfied customer who will buy from Plant Therapy Essential Oils again.&amp;#34;  Well I have now ordered again.  I am quite happy with this company and the products I have purchased from them.  We have used the Oregano in several different homeopathic recipes with great success.</li>
    <li> Very potent. Great for the natural pharmacy</li>
    <li> Yes, this product compares with the best made essentials oils and price is great.  But, since we use it for medical&lt;br /&gt;purposes we didn&#x27;t realize it, until we received it, that it&#x27;s for \\&quot;external\\&quot; use only.  I believe this should have been&lt;br /&gt;highlighted in the description.  The brand of oregano oil we were using before was for internal/external use but was rather pricy and since we use it a lot we thought we would try this brand.  Looked great on the posting written about the product but really feel this important factor that should not have been omitted!</li>
    <li> I mixed 1 drop with olive oil (make sure you know your olive oils otherwise it can harm you-not rancid etc) and then applied to skin with DMSO gel (dmso.org) to help cure a candida fungal infection.</li>
    <li> Bought this to compare to the oregano oil from Greece.  This is very good quality but not as strong as the oil from Greece.  This is just right.  The oil from Greece was industrial strength and would burn skin if not diluted.  I like this oil.</li>
    <li> Best decision I have ever made when it comes to cleaning out my digestive system. If you order this, please do your research. It helps with many ailments but too much at one time will have you laid out for a couple of days or more. Do the research.</li>
    <li> Great quality product at a much cheaper price than I am used to paying. My only complaint is that there is not a dropper in the cap, so getting it out can prove difficult and somewhat messy.</li>
    <li> My oregano was sent so quickly! I was excited and hesitant to open it because I have I have never used this company before. Much to my surprise the oil was a therapeutic grade as they claimed. With a new earache I put the oil right to work. By the end of the day my infection was gone. I even use this to drop in my spaghetti sauce. Thanks for a great product!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time, on price and as described.</li>
    <li> I currently have three different brands of Oregano oil.&lt;br /&gt;So far I like this brand the best of the three O.O. I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping from seller was fast, and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> YIKES!  The warning reviews are for real. I have tried many ways to dilute for oral consumptions.  In marinara sauce. yuck. In soda pop: my lips are still burning. Under the tounge: ouch! Not sure how this product is to be used or consumed. I can&#x27;t figure it out and am returning for refund. Unless you are NOT using it orally buy something else.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after seeing the uses on Dr. Oz.  Can use topically or put a drop on your toothbrush to kill parasites.  Product arrived promptly and is great quality.</li>
    <li> Your mouth will fell fresh and clean for hours. However, a warning.&lt;br /&gt;Use just one drop of oil when brushing. I brush as I normally would,&lt;br /&gt;albeit briefly. I THEN put a drop of oil on the brush. This is followed&lt;br /&gt;by another layer of toothpaste and a resumption of brushing.This procedure&lt;br /&gt;works best for me. Once again, TRUST ME. HEED THIS ADVICE.&lt;br /&gt;ALL YOU NEED IS ONE DROP. ( Also, I use the oil just once a day)</li>
    <li> Something that should have been stated in the product description. I am new to using herbs for health reasons and I took this internally (suffering with the burning of it!) before I read on a health site to make sure I had &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34; Oil of Oregano. Who knew there was anything else??? I sure didn&#x27;t. The print on the bottle is SO tiny, I had to ask my son to read it for me and although he is only 14 and has perfect vision, even HE had a hard time reading the fine print!  I hope I didn&#x27;t do any internal damage to myself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tired of the misleading descriptions on these products at Amazon.  EVERY distributor should show the entire label and include any and all warnings in the description!</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have a source and a reasonably priced one for this oil. It is therapeutic grade, which means you may want to dilute it with something like olive or coconut oil. This oil helps me tremendously with candida albicans which lives in my stomach due to a splenectomy (no spleen means immune issues). I love this stuff and don&#x27;t want to live without it. It is more digestible if you take it with olive oil. It also makes it gentler on the skin. This isn&#x27;t the lame sniffy stuff that is normally in essential oils sections. It is \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot; grade which is clearly stated in the description and is what makes it work medicinally.  I am very grateful for it.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy sells a quality product. I have ordered many different essential oils with no variance in quality and strength.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when I had my wisdom teeth removed. Luckily, I never had to use it for that. I have however, used it as a natural skin healing cream. Mixed with coconut oil, and rubbed into the affected area. Has helped it to heal up in 2 days time. And no chemicals!!!</li>
    <li> Very good and very potent. Has many benefits and uses. But, it must be diluted according for what you will use it for. This is a grade stuff. I will be buy more Therapy Oil.</li>
    <li> Loved it my face is better wish I could get more at that price</li>
    <li> I use this product for massage.  Mixing it with a carrier oil with a bit of water in a spray bottle can create a very stimulating, and rewarding massage.  Will buy from this seller in the future.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am building my oil supplies and using them faithfully.  I am so pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the quality and service from the Plant Therapy line.  I have given&lt;br /&gt;as gifts to people I know have never used oils and they have told me how&lt;br /&gt;much they enjoyed the benefits. I see no reason to buy from anyone else.</li>
    <li> very good quality oil using diffuser</li>
    <li> TERRIFIC OIL AND SIZE IS VALUE PRICED!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know the mechanism of action but this definitely improved my ability to breathe through my nose. I&#x27;ve given it to other people with severe allergies and they experience almost instant relief. Of all the bulls*** supplements I&#x27;ve sunk money into, I&#x27;m honestly kind of blown away how this works.  P.S. My carrier oil is coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This oil I&#x27; m using whan I have running nose&lt;br /&gt;due to my allergy / dust, cats, dogs, mold/.&lt;br /&gt;I boil 1 gallon of water and putting few drops of&lt;br /&gt;this oil. Then I cover my head with a towel and&lt;br /&gt;I inhalate it. That helps me a lot and stops any&lt;br /&gt;allergy. Be careful and don&#x27;t keep your face too&lt;br /&gt;close to the boiling water because you may be&lt;br /&gt;burned.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for inhalation, it works !</li>
    <li> Very potent essential oil .. To be brief, it has met my expectations !!</li>
    <li> Just be warned that it is very powerful.  I have used it when I have a pan on the stove with other essential oils to get the diffused wonders.  Just remember that you can cut the drops.  You will smell oregano over everything else.</li>
    <li> It is so hot it has to be the real deal. I don&#x27;t have to mix it much, because I like hot stuff, but I advise everyone to dilute it.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it four stars for now because I haven&#x27;t used it long and haven&#x27;t compared it to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I can see where people would give it 5 stars and may add a star later on. The dropper could be better, but maybe they make it that way because of the heat or reaction. I transferred it to another real dropper bottle but keeping watch that it doesn&#x27;t melt the thinner dropper plastic. It came so fast I thought it was in the second order I ordered and I had to go back and look again.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty small in a big box so easy to over look.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for nail fungus. I&#x27;ve had this for years and tried everything, both prescription and non- prescription, and this is the only product that worked. It is VERY strong, so try not to get it on your hands or it might burn. It took about two months, but now it&#x27;s almost cleared up. Great product.</li>
    <li> Carvacrol concentration is high and really is the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Plant Therapy Essential Oils!</li>
    <li> Does the job just as good as name brand oregano essential oil.</li>
    <li> It helped my dogs paw. We had done all we could do for my dogs infected paw. 15 rounds of antibiotics and pain meds over a year. Then exploratory sugery. After surgery, they put her on a dose antibiotics. It again started to heal,&lt;br /&gt;just to reopen. I got her more antibiotics and got a recommendation of Oregano oil. I figured i had to try it. Next step was to amputate her paw. Used it topically along with conventional treatment and it did trick. We have been infection free for two years.&lt;br /&gt;it did the trick. I was a little concerned about putting it on an open wound but she didn&#x27;t seemed to be bothered.</li>
    <li> Although I am a parent of 2 kids, I will not claim to be an expert on much, except for this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids are germ factories - or at least logistics experts. They can transport germs better than Fedex, UPS, and DHL combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from getting one solid cold per year, to 4 or more. No way - I had to find a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I happened across some infomercial stuff about oils &amp; while I discounted much of it, my follow-up research about oregano oil did have some interesting studies supporting it... or at least less obvious trolling from the medical community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I picked up a bottle - this was reasonably cheap, compared to the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect timing on the arrival, because my kids were right in the middle of some nasty colds - hacking, rivers of snot, feeling miserable, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I started getting to the evening, I started feeling those swollen glands &amp; lethargy. Oh no...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I responded with 4 drops of this in a short glass of water, and then doing a 2nd short glass to get the oil which stuck to the sides of the glass. Exhale.... wow, that stuff was potent. Yikes. Be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day I woke up feeling fine. The kids colds passed &amp; I never caught it. They ended up getting another just weeks later - passed me by as well. I haven&#x27;t gotten confident enough in it to give it to my kids because the taste is so powerful, but I&#x27;m hatching a plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even tried it on anything else, and I don&#x27;t take it regularly by any means. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Found alot off great stuff about oregano oil. Very very helpful to the human body!!!!</li>
    <li> Works, this have to be diluted with other oils like coconut.  Potent and stings to the skin if not diluted.</li>
    <li> I make my own oil of regano much better and more economic. It kills all fungus and bacteria and viruses.</li>
    <li> Great items at great prices With fast shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is OK, if you use it properly.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma!  Was disappointed that this product says not to ingest.  I was told that oregano oil works well as an &amp;#34;antibiotic&amp;#34;, and the person that told me this puts a drop under their tongue.  They use another brand of oil that is ingestible.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome, clear up alot of cold s and flu congestion.</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> Great Product, good price.</li>
    <li> Best oregano oil I&#x27;ve ever used (and I use oregano oil all the time)!!! We add it to the cats&#x27; food (this is an animal rescue shelter) and mix it with coconut oil to put in their ears and on \\&quot;hot spots.\\&quot; Kills parasites, fungus, etc. I had an abscessed tooth, dropped oregano oil on it and POOF the abscess was gone in about 20 minutes. Have added a few drops of this oil to my remaining oregano oil from other companies. Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: As other reviewers have noted, this particular oregano oil is incredibly potent. We use approximately 5 drops per every 2oz of coconut oil for \\&quot;medicinal purposes.\\&quot; One or two drops in a 10qt pot of marinara sauce is pretty awesome, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who complains of stomach ulcer, she uses it on her feet, she loves and had asked to get more for her. Will order soon.</li>
    <li> Extremely strong stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews before purchase so that I knew that this needs to be mixed with another oil before use.  I mixed a couple drops with a couple tablespoons of coconut oil.  I used it in place of an antibiotic cream that I had used or many years, but now no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used as described above, it cleared up skin infection within 48 hours!</li>
    <li> I ordered oregano&lt;br /&gt;I received peppermint&lt;br /&gt;And this bottle says wellness scent&lt;br /&gt;Ad says plant therapy&lt;br /&gt;Like Huh?</li>
