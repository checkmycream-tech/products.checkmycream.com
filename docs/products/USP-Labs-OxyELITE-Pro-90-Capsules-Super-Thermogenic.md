      <li>amazing... reccomendation!</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the results!</li>
      <li>and I was in good shape even before I started taking the pills.</li>
      <li>good appetite suppressant and energy booster.</li>
      <li>Ok, let me just be real honest here, I probably ate 2500 calories that day (McDonalds for dinner and had a donut -</li>
      <li>Works great, much more energy, already shedding plenty of water weight.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and doesn&#x27;t make you feel \\&quot;cracked</li>
      <li>but then when I saw How amazing she looked I confided in her about my depression over my weight gain.</li>
      <li>take one pill and after 30 minutes you&#x27;ll feel nice and refreshed.</li>
      <li>It was extremely effective in reducing my appetite.</li>
      <li>effective and not overbored.</li>
      <li>When I started exercising, the effects were even more effective.  </li>
      <li>They are very effective for reducing appetite, but they mostly accomplish this task by causing a mild nausea (I get turned off to food very easily when on them).</li>
      <li>The best part is that I only take 1 pill a day.  </li>
      <li>I have lost 5 pounds in one week because I have been able to control my portions and to make healthier choices.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE to eat.  </li>
      <li>1/20 - Have lost some more weight.  </li>
      <li>I know that if I exercised an hour each day, that the results would be even better.</li>
      <li>Now i am able to power through to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>love this product</li>
      <li>also feel like I have more energy.</li>
      <li>I work out 4-5 days a week and eat somewhat healthy.</li>
      <li>I ended up writing to the makers of this product, thanking them for such a wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>SURE YOU DRINK WATER!&lt;br</li>
      <li>so i love it :)</li>
      <li>Overall this is the best compromise I have found between appetite suppression and not getting \\&quot;the jitters\\</li>
      <li>I have a healthy diet</li>
      <li>I like this product because it has helped me with transitioning to better eating habits and helps me when I plateau - which will happen, but you have to keep pushing through.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;).</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s all mostly fat...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m like OK</li>
      <li>Im not wasting more money.</li>
      <li>Because I saw the results first hand, they both look amazing!  </li>
      <li>and it gives you energy for the most part of my day.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say this is a five star product. :)</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!!!!  </li>
      <li>After getting a free sample from GNC and feeling immediate effects  of Focus, appetite suppressed &amp; energy, I looked more into \\&quot;customer reviews\\&quot; (as that is what is most important to me.)</li>
      <li>So 3 lbs lost in 4 days and two of those days I did not work out and two of those days I ate more than I originally intended.</li>
      <li>It gives you such a GREAT boost without being jittery; I am more focused at work and during my work outs</li>
      <li>but I find that it doesn&#x27;t work as strongly after you take it for a while, which is one of the reasons for cycling off of them</li>
      <li>All I can say is this is an amazing diet pill and one of the first pills that work.</li>
      <li>I feel healthy and full of life.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine).  </li>
      <li>Great deal for $35.00 especially since GNC charges $79.00  </li>
      <li>came a free trial bottle of oxyelite.</li>
      <li>I had great results with this product losing a total of about 20 lbs in two months.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money if you are looking for more energy and some help dropping some weight.</li>
      <li>You are also supposed to drink 91 oz of fluid a day (which is good, it&#x27;s making me drink more water).  </li>
      <li>A very nice lady was like what can I do for you, I basically brushed her off</li>
      <li>If I could take it regularly I am sure it would be even more effective long term, but I just can&#x27;t stomach the way it makes me feel.</li>
      <li>but maybe it depends on the person because i felt fine, just full of energy.</li>
      <li>It is very strong though, I stopped taking two pills in the morning because it was too much for me.</li>
      <li>Just imagine if I had worked out and eaten healthy all 4 days, I probably would be down even more!!  </li>
      <li>and I love it so much!</li>
      <li>I have personally lost 25 pounds and many of my friends have lost more!</li>
      <li>She said you shop right!</li>
      <li>but I did not gain either - SWEET.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>although this product does get your body to minimize your food intake and makes you thirsty, the only benefit i found with this product is that it is a good cure for hangovers.</li>
      <li>so I could give an complete and honest one</li>
      <li>I told her the GYM was out as I have two young Children to to look after when Hubby was at work and that i had a Full time Job of my own.</li>
      <li>These are pretty strong when you start</li>
      <li>made my breath stink, and made me super hyper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from southbeach, slim quick, weightwatchers, ect....</li>
      <li>but it subsided quickly.  </li>
      <li>but it quickly subsided.</li>
      <li>And the product is EXACTLY as it promised!</li>
      <li>The weight loss isn&#x27;t super significant, but the fat loss around my waist is very noticable.</li>
      <li>These gave me a good energy boost and helped me push harder during workouts.</li>
      <li>Everyone is right.  </li>
      <li>2 right when I get up and 1</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a combination of jogging, eating right and taking OxyElite.     </li>
      <li>If taken right, this product works wonders.</li>
      <li>this will not work miracles by itself, but it will help you to eat less and have better workouts so that you will be able to lose weight.</li>
      <li>I would recommend getting in a habit of exercising daily, eating healthy and the right amount of calories before you start taking this..</li>
      <li>It was shipped very fast.........</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s less severe than the Super Slim I used to take (before they stopped making the effective kind) because that stuff gave me a dry mouth,</li>
      <li>First with Jack3d and now with OxyElite Pro.  </li>
      <li>and if you are going to take it TAKE IT CONSISTENTLY.  </li>
      <li>I only take 1 pill in the morning Monday through Friday to give my body a break, plus I don&#x27;t want to depend on the pill to be able to stay this size.</li>
      <li>They also said that you should only take these if you plan to lose more than 25 POUNDS.  </li>
      <li>The next day I ate alot more than I had wanted too</li>
      <li>The first couple of days while taking OEP</li>
      <li>I thought there wasn&#x27;t anything better on the market than Hydroxycut but after taking this for two months I can still feel it work just the same as it did the first week I took it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am thrilled with the results! And the product is EXACTLY as it promised! I will be ordering more, and it came in just a couple of days!!!</li>
    <li> Two of my friends just finished using this.  My boyfriend is about to start so when he is finished I will write another review for you.  The tips they gave were to drink a lot of water with it and if you are going to take it TAKE IT CONSISTENTLY.  It is funny how people can spend time writing reviews about products when they can&#x27;t even use that product correctly.  I am writing this using their advice, and yes I know that i&#x27;m writing a review on a product I have never used. WHY? Because I saw the results first hand, they both look amazing!  Take it at the same time everyday, EXERCISE with it (it really isn&#x27;t that hard to go running or walking everyday, it is very peaceful actually.)  I would recommend getting in a habit of exercising daily, eating healthy and the right amount of calories before you start taking this..and then when you are really serious about wanting to lose the weight (when i say that i mean prepared to work hard to lose it and to get on a schedule because CONSISTENCY is the key!) then you should start taking these.  They also said that you should only take these if you plan to lose more than 25 POUNDS.  I hope this helped...and GOOD LUCK!</li>
    <li> This product has definitely helped me lose weight so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s not working for others. I started out walking (and then switched to jogging) every other day and eating right a little over 2 months ago. I lost 9 lbs by myself but couldn&#x27;t get to 10. It was driving me crazy, so my boyfriend suggested OxyElite because he received a free sample at GNC and he told me it really helped him lose a couple extra pounds. Since I was desperate to get things moving again, I went to GNC and purchased it. Since then I have lost an additional 13 lbs. Now let me say this, it wasn&#x27;t just doing one thing alone that got me to this point. It&#x27;s been a combination of jogging, eating right and taking OxyElite.     I&#x27;m sure I could have lost the extra weight by myself, but definitely not as quickly. It gives me great energy and has definitely made me feel less hungry. Sometimes I have to remind myself to eat, and I have NEVER been like that before. I was spurred to write this review because I saw some people say that the reviews on here are fake. lol I&#x27;m not faking it, I know there&#x27;s no way I can make someone believe my story no matter what I tell them, but I thought that was a bit ridiculous. I&#x27;m a real person with real results. I&#x27;ve told all my friends about this product, but have also let them know, that this is not a miracle pill. You can&#x27;t take it and lay on the couch all week and expect to lose weight. You HAVE to change your eating habits and you HAVE to exercise, pill or no pill - that is the only way to lose weight!    I like this product because it has helped me with transitioning to better eating habits and helps me when I plateau - which will happen, but you have to keep pushing through. My goal is to lose 40 lbs by July (I&#x27;ve already lost 22lbs total) and I believe I can do it with the help of OxyElite.</li>
    <li> If taken right, this product works wonders. But if not taken everyday as directed, its a waste of money. I recommend for anyone that take there workout serious. This will definitely assist and you will see the results almost instantly if you incorporate it in a challenging workout routine.</li>
    <li> I thought there wasn&#x27;t anything better on the market than Hydroxycut but after taking this for two months I can still feel it work just the same as it did the first week I took it. They aren&#x27;t horse pills that are hard to swallow and they pack a punch in each pill. I plan on sticking to this product as long as I can to keep my weight in check.</li>
    <li> I was broken-hearted when Solo Slim was taken off the market. I read reviews of OxyElite Pro on bodybuilding.com and on Amazon and decided to try it. One pill in the morning is all you need and I know that my appetite is curbed. I only exercised one day in the week I have taken it and I have lost 4 pounds. I know that if I exercised an hour each day, that the results would be even better. I pray that this product stays on the market. I will be ordering more ASAP!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about losing crazy amounts of fat, but it a very good appetite suppressant. It is very strong though, I stopped taking two pills in the morning because it was too much for me. I only take 1 pill per day vs. the 3 recommended. I do that because I want to have control over what i eat also and not gain the pounds that I lost after I stop taking the pill.</li>
    <li> My husband and I stumbled upon this little gem at a GNC in our town and I love it so much! It helped me drop 20 pounds for a cruise we went on in August and since I have lost another 10! I love it so much I didn&#x27;t want to cycle off of it, but I think it&#x27;s very necessary...   It gives you such a GREAT boost without being jittery; I am more focused at work and during my work outs and I think it helps me execute everything a lot harder!   Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to supress their appetite and lose some weight... I definitely plan on hoping back on to loose another 20! Love this!</li>
    <li> I had great results with this product losing a total of about 20 lbs in two months. This really suppressed my appetite for the first month or so but I find that it doesn&#x27;t work as strongly after you take it for a while, which is one of the reasons for cycling off of them I&#x27;m sure. These are pretty strong when you start, I myself had never tried a weight loss supplement before these so I started slow with one a day for a couple of days, then I upped it to two. I did not add the third pill until I was about three weeks into taking them because I did not feel like I needed it till then. These gave me a good energy boost and helped me push harder during workouts. They do give you a little bit of a hotflash feeling every now and then but nothing too bad. The first day or two I felt a little jittery but that went away. Overall I would say that this is the product that will give you an edge with your diet and exercise routine. I had been working out and dieting for a while and hadn&#x27;t really been losing what I felt I should have been until I added this to my routine. I decided when I first took them to wait until the end of the eight weeks to leave my review so I could give an complete and honest one and I have to say this is a five star product. :)</li>
    <li> Works great, much more energy, already shedding plenty of water weight. No jitters at all. Definitely worth the money if you are looking for more energy and some help dropping some weight. Is it a cure all? Definitely not, you DO still need to workout, as with any supplement, but does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> 1st let me give you a little history, I&#x27;m a 30yr old married mother of 2. I&#x27;m packed on a whopping 77lbs during my 9 years of marriage. I&#x27;ve tried everything from southbeach, slim quick, weightwatchers, ect....I had spent so much money over the years trying to get my sexy back. My husband was in GNC on day and I was just browsing too. A very nice lady was like what can I do for you, I basically brushed her off but then when I saw How amazing she looked I confided in her about my depression over my weight gain. She took me away from the fad diet wall to the Vitamin wall.She told me she was once in my shoes and sujested I take the Women&#x27;s active Vitamin Pack and hit the GYM. I told her the GYM was out as I have two young Children to to look after when Hubby was at work and that i had a Full time Job of my own. She said you shop right! I&#x27;m like of Course she said well Go and buy yourself some workout DVD&#x27;s. I said well what about the Hunger! she then took me back to the JUNK! wall. I&#x27;m like here we go more money down the drain. She told me to buy Oxyelite pro. I&#x27;m like NO! Im not wasting more money. She said she know it works and just to prove it she will buy it for me as long as I buy the Vitamin Pack. I&#x27;m like OK what&#x27;s there to loose. No today is day 3 and all I can say is WOW! I stated taking this product and following a reduced calorie diet and I dropped 5lbs in 3days. I did a Half hour of YOGA, 30min of a Walking workout DVD and I cant believe it! No Hunger! No Jitters! Nothing! This along with the Women&#x27;s Vitamin pack has really helped me with energy, and I&#x27;m never Hungry. I&#x27;m talking a packet of Reduce sugar oatmeal w/a few berries and bottled water for breakfast, Salad with some protien for lunch, yogurt for snack, Some sort of Fish and steamed Veggies for Dinner and that&#x27;s it. I have one of the scales that tell you if it&#x27;s water, fat muscle ect... and it&#x27;s all mostly fat...All I can say is Women out there that want to get your SEXY back, try this product along with the Womens Vitamin Pack, SEE YA IN 60lbs....</li>
    <li> effective and not overbored. good appetite suppressant and energy booster. The only con i have is i feel like it&#x27;s making it a little harder to keep and build muscle. Gonna switch to something else after this bottle.</li>
    <li> This product helps curb my appetite, without \\&quot;the jitters\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s not perfect either. This being said, it does not curb my appetite as much as other products I have used in the past, but with a nice trade off. I don&#x27;t feel the nausea, have the dry mouth, or \\&quot;jitters\\&quot; that other weight loss/thermogenic type of pills usually have. Overall this is the best compromise I have found between appetite suppression and not getting \\&quot;the jitters\\&quot; as i have found.</li>
    <li> I had taken these pills for a month while i had gone to a jym everday for a hour and, they worked for me and no i am not making this up!! My friend had told me about them.  I take 2 in the am 15-20 min before breakfats and i go to the gym.  then like 3 hours later i take the 3rd one and eat lunch.  but you have to eat or of course your gonna feel all nasty! and yes you cant just eat diet pills and not work out! bc it wont work and it is a waste,  so i love it :)</li>
    <li> Like many here, disappointed, minimal energy boost and never got used to the weird head rush, which isn&#x27;t the same as energy.  Followed instructions, gave up after 2/3 of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how much OxyElite Pro changed my life.  I am very sensitive to any sort of stimulant and I have an anxiety disorder.  This makes me weary of ever trying diet pills.  Then, I tried OxyElite Pro!  I had no side effects, except I felt like I had energy (not a buzz), and the weight dropped without even exercising.  When I started exercising, the effects were even more effective.  I ended up writing to the makers of this product, thanking them for such a wonderful product!  I have personally lost 25 pounds and many of my friends have lost more!</li>
    <li> After getting a free sample from GNC and feeling immediate effects  of Focus, appetite suppressed &amp; energy, I looked more into \\&quot;customer reviews\\&quot; (as that is what is most important to me.) I then decided I would give it a try!I bought a 160 tab bottle from GNC for $80. Some back ground on me.. I&#x27;m 32 / 5&#x27;6 / start weight 186lbs / size 14. I work out 4-5 days a week and eat somewhat healthy. I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter weight loss pill in walmart! Nothing works for me. 1 week after taking OxyEP I&#x27;m down to 181 lbs and back in size 12!   I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I don&#x27;t have any of the negative side affects others reported. But of course all of our bodies are different. all in all, I&#x27;m happy with OxyElitePro and when I&#x27;m done with the bottle I&#x27;ll repost on my final results.   &#x3D;) Best of luck!</li>
    <li> All I can say is this is an amazing diet pill and one of the first pills that work. I have gone from 234 lbs down to 196 over the past 6-8 months where I still did 2 months on with 1 month off throughout that time.    Now dont be fooled though, I do hit the gym 3-4 days a week doing weight training and 30-40 minutes of spinning along with I play tennis for 2 hours once a week. As with any diet pill, I am a firm believer there is no magic pill out there where you can just take and do no physical exercise and expect to loss weight so I am not sure how effective this would be if didnt do any exercise.    The pill not only suppressed my diet but also gives me energy throughout the day. In suppressing my diet, take for example instead of eating 3 pieces of chicken parm with pasta, I now just eat just one or maybe half of it and feel full and will want to eat it later. Now this isnt the case in every instance but I see a difference in my eating habits.    I take 3 pills a day, 2 right when I get up and 1 about 6-8 hours later. I wouldnt recommend you start with that and should only start with 1 as I did in the beginning to see how your body reacts as I have several friends who took it and it make one friend sick and another real jittery and he didnt like it but I have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Everyone is right.  It gives you a very weird feeling.  I can&#x27;t comment on if it works or not because I have to pshych myself up to want to take it.  It makes me hot, tired, and slightly nauseous.  I would say that the closest I can come to describing it is saying it feels like I have the flu.  I sort of feel worn out and just want to go home and curl up in a ball.  It does suppress your appetite, but I am not sure what else because I can&#x27;t take it consistently enough to know.</li>
    <li> USP does it again!  First with Jack3d and now with OxyElite Pro.  I have been looking for a product to suppress my appetite for a long time and I have found it with OEP!  I LOVE to eat.  I eat just to be eating.  I have lost 5 pounds in one week because I have been able to control my portions and to make healthier choices.  It reduces my cravings and I can go for hours without eating or thinking about food.  The best part is that I only take 1 pill a day.  The first couple of days while taking OEP, I felt a little jittery because I have a low tolerance for stimulants.  After that, no side effects at all and it gives you energy for the most part of my day.  I don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is an awesome product.  If you have a problem with food and eating, get this product now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 with a baby and I was in good shape even before I started taking the pills. I have a healthy diet and I exercise. I just needed extra help to lose the last stubborn pounds. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7 and weighed 136 lbs at the time. I&#x27;ve been using this product (with periodic breaks, continuing my diet and exercise) for 3 months and went down to 124 lbs.     This is no miracle pill (They don&#x27;t exist). But this pill definitely cuts hunger and give me tons of energy. I only take 1 pill in the morning Monday through Friday to give my body a break, plus I don&#x27;t want to depend on the pill to be able to stay this size. I find that if I take the normal dosage I become extremely jittery and nauseous but symptoms very per person. I definitely recommend this product for people that just need that extra help losing weight.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to lose weight for a while now and have not found anything that really worked for me.  Alli was the closest thing, but I did not like the effects it had if you ate just a little too much fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been taking this product for 4 days and I have lost a little over 4 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I had any bad side effects was yesterday when I forgot my water bottle at home.  I took my morning pill as usual and felt fine, but after I took the afternoon one I felt terrible.  I was cold, shakey, nauseus and a little dizzy.  The only thing I did different was not drink water.  So I bought a bottle of water from the vending machine and felt better about 45 mins later.  So if you take this MAKE SURE YOU DRINK WATER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been taking this product I have been able to eat a lot less because I am not hungry all the time.  I still get hungry at meal times, but I don&#x27;t feel like I am starving and I feel content after a small meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like I have more energy. I have been having great workouts.  Normally I get tired fast and never finish.  Now i am able to power through to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this later after I have taken it for a little longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/20 - Have lost some more weight.  The weight loss isn&#x27;t super significant, but the fat loss around my waist is very noticable. My jeans that were tight a couple weeks ago are now loose enough that I can take them off without unbuttoning them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short this will not work miracles by itself, but it will help you to eat less and have better workouts so that you will be able to lose weight.</li>
    <li> These pills do the job. I take one in the morning and one in the afternoon, or I take two in the morning and none the rest of the day. They definitely cause thermogenesis and make you sweat when you aren&#x27;t doing anything. They also make you feel flushed in the face occasionally. They are very effective for reducing appetite, but they mostly accomplish this task by causing a mild nausea (I get turned off to food very easily when on them). Another side effect is that they make you feel generally odd and uncomfortable, which can kill motivation. I would highly recommend taking a day or two off of them each week or taking a week off every month. Nevertheless, I lost 10 pounds on the first bottle (with no added exercise) and another 10 pounds over the next two bottles (with very little effort put into dieting and no added exercise). My only caution is that they will make you feel inexplicably weird, and they don&#x27;t give you any extra energy.</li>
    <li> These pills have worked well for me. They curb my appetite but do not give me the jitters.  I can feel the thermogenic heat in my body.  The pills complement my workout well to help me not eat too much.</li>
    <li> i just have to say that i lost 3 pounds in 3 days.... amazing... reccomendation! drink a LOT of water</li>
    <li> i tried this product out for a month. i didn&#x27;t lose any crazy amounts of weight like some of the other reviewers reported.     after the inital dose during the first week i was taking one before cardio day. it gave me trouble with breathing while doing cardio. it also made my joints hurt, especially in my knees. although this product does get your body to minimize your food intake and makes you thirsty, the only benefit i found with this product is that it is a good cure for hangovers. take one pill and after 30 minutes you&#x27;ll feel nice and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I only take these 1 or 2 days a week, because it&#x27;s a guarantee that I&#x27;m going to feel like garbage until it wears off. I am presently sweating through my work clothes (I work in an office that&#x27;s pretty cold)... It&#x27;s great to feel like it&#x27;s working, but the side effects are less than desirable: nausea, cold sweats. It&#x27;s less severe than the Super Slim I used to take (before they stopped making the effective kind) because that stuff gave me a dry mouth, made my breath stink, and made me super hyper. But at least it worked. I&#x27;ve lost about 5-7 lbs on this OxyElite Pro. If I could take it regularly I am sure it would be even more effective long term, but I just can&#x27;t stomach the way it makes me feel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews but I had to share my experience thusfar with this product.  I have a 5 month old baby at home (and two older children, ages 6 and 4). I never lost all the baby weight after the first two which has bothered me for years.  I am 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and was 168.2 lbs when I started this product 4 days ago (I was 125 lbs pre-children).  My hubby had done some research on appetite suppressants as I have had difficulty controlling my eating since having children.  I do work out (3-5 times a week usually) but wasn&#x27;t losing weight because I simply was eating too much (sometimes just because I was bored or emotional). I just couldn&#x27;t control myself and I&#x27;d get so frustrated and upset.  So he buys this pill and I agree I&#x27;ll try it, why not right??      For the 1st 3 days you take 1 pill in the morning (15-30 min prior to breakfast).  I did notice a tiny bit of nauseau on day two after taking it but it subsided quickly.  You are also supposed to drink 91 oz of fluid a day (which is good, it&#x27;s making me drink more water).  I must admit I was shocked by how much it suppressed my appetite. Instead of eating all day, or thinking of food all the time, I didn&#x27;t!!!  It allowed me to make healthier choices because I wasn&#x27;t craving junk.  Anyway, the first day I lost 2 lbs and was giddy with excitement. I actually called my hubby into the bathroom to watch me get on the scale, that is how stoked I was.  The next day I ate alot more than I had wanted too (my goal is 1400 calories a day). Ok, let me just be real honest here, I probably ate 2500 calories that day (McDonalds for dinner and had a donut - I know I know). And yet I did NOT gain any weight back. I was really expecting to have gained back what I had lost and was fearful I had sabotaged myself.  I did not lose but I did not gain either - SWEET. Day 3 I also ate a bit more than I wanted (not sure the calories) but again I did not gain. I still suggest that you try to make healthier choices and work out to maximize your weight loss though.  I lost another lb yesterday (ate around 1400 calories but didn&#x27;t work out).  So 3 lbs lost in 4 days and two of those days I did not work out and two of those days I ate more than I originally intended. I am stoked!!  Just imagine if I had worked out and eaten healthy all 4 days, I probably would be down even more!!  I would definitely recommend this product to those who need help with suppressing their appetite so they can lose weight.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how this continues.    Side effects: a little nauseau day two after taking the pill but it quickly subsided. A little thirsty but not parched. No jitters at all.  It does say to NOT take any caffeine with this product (I&#x27;m not a coffee/soda drinker anyway so it&#x27;s fine).  Good luck everyone!</li>
    <li> Today i went to GNC to try and find something to help me lose fat and gain muscle. Sring break is coming so i must look my best &#x3D;). I asked the guy at the counter what he would recommend and he showed me something called womens ultra active vitapak. I bought this and along with it came a free trial bottle of oxyelite. As soon as i got to work at 12:00 i took one pill. At 12:30 i ate a meal replacment bar called meso-tech complete. At about 1:00 i felt it kick in. I had alot of energy and i felt really alive. I didnt have any hunger cravings until about 5:30pm. The oxyelite and the meal replacement bar went really well together, i have no complaints. Some people say they get jitters but maybe it depends on the person because i felt fine, just full of energy. I would certainly recommend all the products. The oxyelite, womens unltra mega active vitapak and the meal replacement bar. I didnt take the womens vitapak until after i ate dinner at around 5:45. I feel healthy and full of life. hopefully in about 2 weeks i can come back and give a postive 2 week review</li>
    <li> This is my second round of OxyElite Pro. I did this last year around this time and with a healthy meal plan and about 30 minutes of cardio 5 days per week I ended up losing 30lbs in 3 months. I definitely contribute a lot of that to OxyElite Pro. While I did put some weight back on while off this product, it was a lot less than I thought. This year, I wanna lose even more weight!! This product is amazing and doesn&#x27;t make you feel \\&quot;cracked out\\&quot; like some of the other diet pills I have tried in the past. I now have 3 of my friends using this product who are all seeing great results as well.</li>
    <li> This product did not help at all.  I follwed the instructions, used half the bottle, taking every day, and nothing except it made me dizzy.  Now my money is wasted, they wont take a return.</li>
    <li> Great service from sender got the product in a timely matter and awesome product has helped me lose 15 pounds already.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!!!  It makes you sweat a lot so drink plenty of water throughout the day. It was extremely effective in reducing my appetite. I&#x27;m not always hungry anymore. Great deal for $35.00 especially since GNC charges $79.00  It was shipped very fast.........love this product.......will definitely order it again &amp; again</li>
