      <li>This works great!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
      <li>This is the best deodorant I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Works great though!</li>
      <li>Amazingly, both of them don&#x27;t click!!</li>
      <li>The customer service line was helpful and if you aren&#x27;t happy with the product I recommend bringing this up to them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Normally this is a great product at the clinical strength...</li>
      <li>This works great and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
      <li>the CS Rep was very nice but did not have an answer for me.</li>
      <li>and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I ordered the powder protection thinking it would be equally good.  </li>
      <li>Amazing protection</li>
      <li>What an amazing product.</li>
      <li>It smells nice too, if you get the scented one.</li>
      <li>Nice travel size though.</li>
      <li>This deodorant has been the most effective I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
      <li>I love the \\&quot;Powder\\&quot; smell &amp; it</li>
      <li>Love the Powder Protection scent which is feminine but not too overpowering.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stayed away from most deodorants because of that baby powder smell that they seem to put in every woman&#x27;s deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and if I remember the price was comparable.</li>
      <li>This product is very effective, glides on easily, can be used right after shaving without irritation, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, and prevents wetness and odor.</li>
      <li>My friend&#x27;s pre-teen, hormonal daughter also uses it and finds it prevents the strong odor she would have after playing sports.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased the light &amp; fresh version and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference to apply it at night as the directions instruct.</li>
      <li>Who would have ever thought a deodorant more than twice the price of what I&#x27;ve bought for over 20 years would make its way consistently into my medicine cabinet?  </li>
      <li>What if, right?!</li>
      <li>works great especially going thru menopause with the hot flashes..</li>
      <li>After the first correct application it worked amazingly well, I wasn&#x27;t sweating and had pretty much no odor under my arms even at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda expensive in drug stores, but, I found a SUPER GREAT deal on Amazon.com &amp; even saved more money by using their Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
      <li>This has a strong smell, its not a bad smell, just kind of too strong, also, I&#x27;m not sure how well it works at keeping sweat away.</li>
      <li>I would order this deodorant again if I were to get more use out of it, but looks like it won&#x27;t even last me a full week!</li>
      <li>Really keeps me dry and unsmelly even in very warm temperatures.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s expiration date and let the customer decide if it&#x27;s worth the lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even been effective in the middle of summer.</li>
      <li>and you smell fresh.</li>
      <li>The price is worth it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much of it each time.</li>
      <li>Love the deodorant, but even with Subscribe and Save, I found cheaper at my local store.  </li>
      <li>and I still smell exactly as I do as the moment I started my day.</li>
      <li>Like most deodorants, leaves yellow stains on whites/lights after prolonged usage.  </li>
      <li>It even got me through all those hot flashes.</li>
      <li>Great product, I am fresh all day, even Afrer a hard sweaty workout!</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry, keeps me fresh, keeps me confident.  </li>
      <li>I have always prefered Secret brand but the clinical strength is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>It took me more than 5 minutes to get a 2mm long deodorant.</li>
      <li>I actually like it better than a full solid.  </li>
      <li>Very</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I live in a hot climate where it is often over 100 degrees.  </li>
      <li>I still smelled funky and was still sweating 5 hours later so that night right before bed</li>
      <li>These things don&#x27;t expire quickly so that means it was sitting on a shelf for a long time before it was sold...</li>
      <li>I ignored that step the first time I used it and applied it after I took a shower like I would normally apply my regular deodorant.</li>
      <li>Even 12 hours later and being out in hot weather I didn&#x27;t smell under my arms and didn&#x27;t sweat.</li>
      <li>I did think it was going to be a solid deodorant, but it comes out of little holes at the top.  </li>
      <li>I find that it masks order less than my original version.  </li>
      <li>I would still sweat and smell under my arms a few hours after application and that was only in my nice air conditioned office not even out in the mid summer heat!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs that extra protection....</li>
      <li>These work fine but are a little bit smaller than what you might buy at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>My other deoderants worked but this one, even after a day at the beach, really works.</li>
      <li>It is more expensive than ordinary deodorant, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>This deodorant isn&#x27;t your traditional stick, it&#x27;s dispensed after a few clicks as a cream that goes on rather wet but dries quickly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even tried these clear deodorants that leave wet marks on clothing as well.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve even tried these clear deodorants that leave wet marks on clothing as well.  </li>
<li> I wiped my underarms clean with baby wipes and then applied the Secret Clinical.</li>
<li> There are no other active ingredients and the inactive ingredients do not effect the product according to their Customer Service.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time too.</li>
<li> Sounds strange, but any girl who has learned from the locker room knows sweat seems to be sources from these areas as well as under the arms.     </li>
<li> I have been using this for years, as nothing else keeps me as dry.</li>
<li> It also keeps you dry.</li>
<li> This Secret formula really works!</li>
<li> one difference however between clinical deodorants vs. traditional deodorants is that you apply it at night because your body temperature is lower and you sweat less.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference from the Secret Platinum</li>
<li> so I looked at the ingredients and the active ingredient in both</li>
<li> The idea of this deodorant is great, however, when it arrived it&#x27;s a travel sized deodorant that has to be twisted from the base over halfway in order to even get any of the deodorant out.</li>
<li> I found that odd since I take a shower in the morning.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never really needed deodorant in the past</li>
<li> Secret Clinical is the only deodorant I ever use!</li>
<li> Every deodorant/antiperspirant combination I&#x27;ve used in the past did not work as advertised on me.</li>
<li> but lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of work on my yard.  </li>
<li> I was tired of deodorants that are messy getting all over my clothes.  </li>
<li> I usually read labels in the store but was in a rush and grabbed the Secret Clinical Stength.</li>
<li> Unbelievable!!</li>
<li> I decided to try Secret Clinical Strength.</li>
<li> For the price I feel like writing Secret to complain.</li>
<li> I found that none of my shirts and undershirts were stained by the Secret Clinical deodorant which means I can wear whites without any issue.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I bought a 2- pack</li>
<li> I have tried EVERY brand that has ever been made &amp; none of them have ever come close to working like Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength!</li>
<li> I will be wary of ordering this again as it passed it&#x27;s expiration date while I was using it.  </li>
<li> Secret did!  </li>
<li> As a tip, I also use this under my cleavage and butt cheeks in advance of upcoming heavy sweating occassions where I&#x27;m fearful of being &#x27;seen&#x27; or don&#x27;t want to ruin outfits (ie work, going out).  </li>
<li> How frustrating!!</li>
<li> I had to get sweaty in my palms in my bad wrist.</li>

    <li> This product is very effective, glides on easily, can be used right after shaving without irritation, doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, and prevents wetness and odor. It smells nice too, if you get the scented one. My friend&#x27;s pre-teen, hormonal daughter also uses it and finds it prevents the strong odor she would have after playing sports. It is more expensive than ordinary deodorant, but well worth it. It lasts a long time too. I don&#x27;t need to use very much of it each time.</li>
    <li> This Secret formula really works! My other deoderants worked but this one, even after a day at the beach, really works. I don&#x27;t have any B.O. and I still smell exactly as I do as the moment I started my day. Secret Clinical is the only deodorant I ever use!</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERY brand that has ever been made &amp; none of them have ever come close to working like Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength! I love the \\&quot;Powder\\&quot; smell &amp; it last all day! It&#x27;s kinda expensive in drug stores, but, I found a SUPER GREAT deal on Amazon.com &amp; even saved more money by using their Subscribe &amp; Save! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs that extra protection....it&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
    <li> I live in a hot climate where it is often over 100 degrees.  I was tired of deodorants that are messy getting all over my clothes.  I&#x27;ve even tried these clear deodorants that leave wet marks on clothing as well.  This is the best deodorant I have ever tried.  It lasts and it doesn&#x27;t get all over everything and you smell fresh. It also keeps you dry. What else could you want in a deodorant?</li>
    <li> I usually read labels in the store but was in a rush and grabbed the Secret Clinical Stength. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference from the Secret Platinum so I looked at the ingredients and the active ingredient in both is Aluminium Zirconium Trichlorohydex GLY. The Clinical Stenghth contains 20% and the Platinum has 19%. There are no other active ingredients and the inactive ingredients do not effect the product according to their Customer Service. I called P &amp; G and asked how 1% would make a difference and the CS Rep was very nice but did not have an answer for me. Probably because 1% doesn&#x27;t make a difference except to my pocket book. The clinical strength was around $11 and the Platinum around $4. The customer service line was helpful and if you aren&#x27;t happy with the product I recommend bringing this up to them. I think it is unethical to add 1% to a product and charge 2.5 times the regular price.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found. It lives up to it&#x27;s name. Really keeps me dry and unsmelly even in very warm temperatures. The price is worth it and I found it cheaper on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by this deodorant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really needed deodorant in the past but lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of work on my yard.  I&#x27;ve stayed away from most deodorants because of that baby powder smell that they seem to put in every woman&#x27;s deodorant.  This works great and doesn&#x27;t smell.  Just one click is enough for but underarms for me.</li>
    <li> Mine were two packs from Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program. Amazingly, both of them don&#x27;t click!! I had to get sweaty in my palms in my bad wrist. It took me more than 5 minutes to get a 2mm long deodorant. Unbelievable!! How frustrating!! Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the light &amp; fresh version and really liked it.  I ordered the powder protection thinking it would be equally good.  Not so.  I find that it masks order less than my original version.  Unfortunately, I bought a 2- pack so I&#x27;m stuck with this inferior product.</li>
    <li> Great product, I am fresh all day, even Afrer a hard sweaty workout! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my favoarite deodorant.  I have always prefered Secret brand but the clinical strength is by far the best.  It even got me through all those hot flashes.</li>
    <li> Who would have ever thought a deodorant more than twice the price of what I&#x27;ve bought for over 20 years would make its way consistently into my medicine cabinet?  Secret did!  Amazing protection I&#x27;ve torture tested through P90X, Sarasota summers, adventures in India, and boardroom presentations.  Keeps me dry, keeps me fresh, keeps me confident.  Love the Powder Protection scent which is feminine but not too overpowering.    As a tip, I also use this under my cleavage and butt cheeks in advance of upcoming heavy sweating occassions where I&#x27;m fearful of being &#x27;seen&#x27; or don&#x27;t want to ruin outfits (ie work, going out).  Sounds strange, but any girl who has learned from the locker room knows sweat seems to be sources from these areas as well as under the arms.     Downside?  Like most deodorants, leaves yellow stains on whites/lights after prolonged usage.  Bleach takes out the smell, but not the yellowing.</li>
    <li> works great especially going thru menopause with the hot flashes..I would recommend it to anyone who has to use extra protection</li>
    <li> The idea of this deodorant is great, however, when it arrived it&#x27;s a travel sized deodorant that has to be twisted from the base over halfway in order to even get any of the deodorant out. While I did not smell after using it, my underarms do feel wet which is an old sensation. I would order this deodorant again if I were to get more use out of it, but looks like it won&#x27;t even last me a full week! For the price I feel like writing Secret to complain.</li>
    <li> Love this product and if I remember the price was comparable.</li>
    <li> I will be wary of ordering this again as it passed it&#x27;s expiration date while I was using it.  These things don&#x27;t expire quickly so that means it was sitting on a shelf for a long time before it was sold...hence the lower price.  I would recommend advising customers if you&#x27;re selling something that is close to it&#x27;s expiration date and let the customer decide if it&#x27;s worth the lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally this is a great product at the clinical strength...my only objection is selling it to me at expiration.  It looses potency the longer it sits on a shelf.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I have been using this for over 1 month and it does its job!  Very Well!  I did think it was going to be a solid deodorant, but it comes out of little holes at the top.  You turn 1 or 2 clicks &amp; deodorant comes out.  I actually like it better than a full solid.  Not greasy at all.  I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> only product that works !! if this doesnt work you probably have hydrolisis and if you do still this is the best option</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, as nothing else keeps me as dry. It makes a huge difference to apply it at night as the directions instruct. I cannot get myself to skip it in the morning though. What if, right?!</li>
    <li> This deodorant has been the most effective I&#x27;ve used to date. Every deodorant/antiperspirant combination I&#x27;ve used in the past did not work as advertised on me. I would still sweat and smell under my arms a few hours after application and that was only in my nice air conditioned office not even out in the mid summer heat!

I found that none of my shirts and undershirts were stained by the Secret Clinical deodorant which means I can wear whites without any issue. I also didn&#x27;t experience any irritation of any sort although that may differ from person to person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one difference however between clinical deodorants vs. traditional deodorants is that you apply it at night because your body temperature is lower and you sweat less. I found that odd since I take a shower in the morning. I ignored that step the first time I used it and applied it after I took a shower like I would normally apply my regular deodorant. I still smelled funky and was still sweating 5 hours later so that night right before bed I wiped my underarms clean with baby wipes and then applied the Secret Clinical. I got up and took my shower in the A.M and didn&#x27;t reapply the deodorant. Even 12 hours later and being out in hot weather I didn&#x27;t smell under my arms and didn&#x27;t sweat. I was sweating everywhere else but not under my arms. What an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Love the deodorant, but even with Subscribe and Save, I found cheaper at my local store.  Works great though!</li>
    <li> my daughter wont wear anything else. this stuff works. put on at night to have maximum results as package says.</li>
    <li> This has a strong smell, its not a bad smell, just kind of too strong, also, I&#x27;m not sure how well it works at keeping sweat away.</li>
    <li> What can you say about these products? These work fine but are a little bit smaller than what you might buy at the grocery store. Nice travel size though.</li>
