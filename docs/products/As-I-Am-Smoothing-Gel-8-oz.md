### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It smells awesome.</li>
      <li>I used the Creme of Nature Perfect Edges, and yes with the warmer climates, it has to be reapplied at the end of the day if you work or work out after 8 hours.  </li>
      <li>smells delicious.  </li>

      <li>It is not what I thought it was, but it does have good consistency, non flaky, and more</li>
      <li>but this stuff is nice, however I have 4c hair</li>
      <li>Why did I steer away from my own advice?  </li>
      <li>Nice gel.</li>
      <li>I actually love this brand , I &#x27;ve been using som many cheap gel, but this is the best out there, no flaking and crushy hair, you can easily comb it out without breaking your hair.</li>
      <li>It is especially great for the edges on natural hair.</li>
      <li>The best Gel ever for my natural hair, and it contains no alcohol</li>
      <li>I did it smells great and smooths pretty well.</li>
      <li>This gel is the best gel that I have used since becoming natural three years ago.  </li>
      <li>I love virtually everything about this gel.</li>
      <li>The smoothing gel is just ok for me.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice and light.</li>
      <li>after using this smoothing gel for some time, I noticed some breakage/thinning at the part where I used it most.  </li>
      <li>I love the consistency of this gel</li>
      <li>Just make sure to moisturize after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>So for me this gel was just ok because it wasn&#x27;t as versatile as I like for my hair products.</li>
      <li>Love to use tis because there is no residue</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait for warmer and more humid weather</li>
      <li>It was more of a semi-smoothing gel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>AIA smoothing gel is better than the AIA curling jelly IMHO.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>Great for Wash and Go not so much for smoothing.  </li>
      <li>well I&#x27;m  glad</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I ordered more than one, just</li>
      <li>Its not flaky,gummy or sticky like most gels.  </li>
      <li>and i love that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just mix it with what i have left of the Perfect edges.  </li>
      <li>OK, all done.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>It does hold hair, not too strong but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I just air dry my hair after brushing it and it dries perfectly!</li>
      <li>I find that if I use this with two strand twists rolled on flexirods it will take 24 hrs to dry and another day to reach the perfect curl set.</li>
      <li>The consistency is light and very smooth.</li>
      <li>This was okay on my fine hair</li>
      <li>The best gel for smoothing edges is hands down Ecostyler...</li>
      <li>The Perfect Edges with argon oil slicks the hair down immediately upon application.  </li>
      <li>It worked great in my aunts hair, but her hair is blown out, same thing with my mother.  </li>
      <li>Offer a fragrance free option.  </li>
      <li>I bought it as a curl definer, not even wanting it to smooth my edges.  </li>
      <li>But so far, I can&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions to apply on clean damp hair.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing  and has all natural ingredients which is what I&#x27;m looking for in my hair products.</li>
      <li>Since my big chop, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various products, searching for the best curl definer.  </li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You dont need to use alot and the hold is mild;</li>
      <li>But, if you want something to help fight frizz, and make your twists or coils smooth and hold their style this may be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite thing for wash and go because it is a hold but very soft to touch.  </li>
      <li>Blackhairlong.com or some natural website, that As I am was the best for laying down the edges.</li>
      <li>Perfect edges is far less work.    </li>
      <li>Perfect for my dry, coarse, wavy hair, I apply it to damp hair.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s light it really holds my twist n curl style.  </li>
      <li>this might help your edges look more tidy, but I emphasize this is not like a firm Eco styling gel.  </li>
      <li>Love it leaves my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I am surprised and pleased.  </li>
      <li>This product makes my natural hair soft and it smells good.</li>
      <li>Really good stuff, much milder than the heavy chemical type gels, smells good, only need a little for a great hold, lasts all day.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s smooth and is not hard like some gels.</li>
      <li>its runny so application is easy and its not heavy.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle hair gel.</li>
      <li>Its very gentle and nourishing to your hair.</li>
      <li>I only gave it two stars because I love the smell</li>
      <li>This is my second time purchasing this gel, I love</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Still working on using this product.  Not holding down the fine hairs at all</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product besides having great ingredients it smells fantastic! It is not too heavy and it does not weigh my hair down.  It also makes my hair shiny.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great gel. Smells divine and smoothes my edges really well with no flaking or tackiness.</li>
    <li> I am a new user and I have the Double Butter Cream and the Leave in Conditioner so I also bought this because it states that it &amp;#34;Provides Moisturizing Hold &amp; Shine.&amp;#34;  It does not!  There is no shine and at the end of the day my hair is frizzed.  My hair is not kinky and is about 10 inches long.  I was disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Again, the As I Am line is yet another attempt to capitalize on the natural hair movement and doing as Curly Nikki said on the Steve Harvey radio show this morning, &amp;#34;disrespecting your finances&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you&#x27;re buying sulfate and paraben free products OR better yet, making your own gels you can&#x27;t go wrong, no need to spend exorbitant amounts of money on hair care products.  Why did I steer away from my own advice?  Well, being a recovering product junkie, every now and then I see something that opens my nose and I get curious, soooo, I fell for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work as a HOLDING gel, NO.  I have a multi-level head of hair from 3c at the crown to 4a in the front and 4b around the sides....yeah its a mess!  So it did not hold down my 4a and 4b curls around the front of my face.  I had to follow it up with my Eco-style gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it give your hair shine, yes. So that&#x27;s the best thing I can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I&#x27;m at it, I feel a little rant coming on.  Why do they always make black hair care products smell like some sickeningly sweet candy or fruity bubble gum?  It&#x27;s like some cheap incense from a 1970&#x27;s pimp mobile, its awful. (That&#x27;s how this stuff smells)  Offer a fragrance free option.  OK, all done.</li>
    <li> I love virtually everything about this gel.The label was spot on when it said it provides moisturizing hold &amp; shine (although after a month of use,my jars labeling is non recognizable.The writing rubs off after a while,which gives it the false impression of a cheap quality gel product)I use this when I want to rock a wash n go(a style that requires some kind of a curl/coil defining item such a gel or mousse.)Upon applying and smoothing my hair feels light and curl/coiled defined with very minimal crunch.No stickiness detected and the shine from the aloe vera was great on my hair.It has a hold of about 6/7 and could be compared to a lighter version of eco styler crystal clear gel.I give it 5 stars because it fulfilled the basic necessities of a hair gel.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after seeing someone on YouTube use it .  I sectioned my hair and applied small amounts from root to ends, sometimes adding extra on the ends.  I wear my natural hair in braids and this product smoothes, tames and makes my hair shine.  When I unbraid my hair I have beautiful waves.  I wish I could get a larger jar and will recommend this product to friends and family.  I have type 3B/C hair.</li>
    <li> It smells very good and is somewhat moisturizing. But....It does not smooth the edges at all and the product is visible even if you use a little, but it is difficult to use a small amount when even a large amount can&#x27;t lay the hair down. I would not recommend this at all. The best gel for smoothing edges is hands down Ecostyler...This product unfortunately did not work well for smoothing edges or slicking hair back. You could use it for curling, but the hold is too soft to make it stay. I only gave it two stars because I love the smell, I did not like the product for would it is supposed to be used for.</li>
    <li> My fav for smoothing my edges. Great scent.</li>
    <li> This is a good product as it is, but it is not what I was looking for. It is not what I thought it was, but it does have good consistency, non flaky, and more, it just did not do the job I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> I actually love this brand , I &#x27;ve been using som many cheap gel, but this is the best out there, no flaking and crushy hair, you can easily comb it out without breaking your hair. Very gentle hair gel. That&#x27;s why I ordered more than one, just so I don&#x27;t run out of it.</li>
    <li> Love it great product</li>
    <li> The best Gel ever for my natural hair, and it contains no alcohol, I recommend this product without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what As I Am is selling other than a cool name.  I didn&#x27;t get good results from this product.  I would have taken it back if I had purchase it from Sally&#x27;s.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a gel for my edges that&#x27;s smooth and is not hard like some gels. Although I have to reapply it daily, I like using this specifically around my edges better than any other. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the parfume ingredient. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s natural or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed (African American and Latina) I love the consistency of this gel and I feel it&#x27;s not damaging to my tresses but be mindful on how much you apply because if you use too much the scratch it afterwards it looks flaky and white</li>
    <li> As I mentioned in my review of the cowash, I didn&#x27;t realize at the time that this is a product made for natural African American hair. I was just looking for a product without crazy chemicals in it. I&#x27;m Caucasian but have thicker than normal hair. My hair is also wavy and highly prone to frizzing. I love that this product has fantastic hold without feeling stiff. When I get out of the shower, after using the As I Am cowash, I towel dry my hair and apply this gel. No need to blow dry or add other products. I just air dry my hair after brushing it and it dries perfectly! It looks like I spent a long time styling it but I haven&#x27;t! I highly recommend this and will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> This gel is light,  leaves hair soft not crusty to the feel. Wish it came ina larger size. Great product for hair.</li>
    <li> This did not work on my natural hair as I expected.  It worked great in my aunts hair, but her hair is blown out, same thing with my mother.  I have tight curls which require moisture so my curls can stay curly instead of turning into a fro.  I will have to try it again after I wash my hair.  11/8/15, I tried a small amount in my hair before washing it and my hair curled up.   I am surprised and pleased.  After washing my hair and doing a section at a time with my fingers,  my hair came out curly,  soft and shiny.   I loo forward to seeing how I make it through the day.  :)</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly/coily black hair (mixture of 3c and 4a) and I am a true product junky so I have tried quite a few things to get my hair sleek, shiny, and moisturized without being greasy.  I have 3 different brands of olive oil gels and none of them lay my edges down *ALL DAY* like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You dont need to use alot and the hold is mild; meaning that your hair will not feel hard. Oh, the product smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For only an 8oz jar this product is pricey, but it is worth it in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/4b hair and I was using the Curl&#x27;s paste ( cant remember the exact name) to smooth down my edges. I also tried Eco styler and it didn&#x27;t work for me. I really like this.  I only use a little bit to smooth down my edges and it does what I need it to.  I have a TWA and my edges are still in place the next morning.  Definitely one that I will continue to use in a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Not very good from this product line. I was let down because it makes hair stiff and makes hair very greasy. I am Irish and my hair is very thin. Not for everyone.</li>
    <li> okay, i tried the As i Am smoothing gel..    ladies with 4b/c hair, don&#x27;t bother, just don&#x27;t.    I used the Creme of Nature Perfect Edges, and yes with the warmer climates, it has to be reapplied at the end of the day if you work or work out after 8 hours.  okay, but it works.    I thought with the reviews on Amazon.com, plus Blackhairlong.com or some natural website, that As I am was the best for laying down the edges. Well if you&#x27;re 4a - Maybe.. but this s*** is worthless.Angry    The Perfect Edges with argon oil slicks the hair down immediately upon application.  IMMEDIATELY.. and it stays down.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot either, nor do you have to \\&quot;add water\\&quot; and utilize a silk scarf to lay your edges down.  Perfect edges is far less work.    As I am?  aaargh.. first of all, you have to wet your edges first. and then.. you have to slather on this crap.  It comes in an 8 oz jar at 1/2 the price of Perfect edges, but you have to use 3- 4x as much PLUS use a scarf to lay your hair down, and HOPE that it holds.    i used the As I am gel before going to the gym? looked okay before i left, but i barely sweated for 2 hours.. TWO HOURS, and my edges started curling up burnt paper.    I actually believe that  SOME of the people on amazon might be capes working for As I am - OR they are ignorant about their hair type and think everyone is a 3c.. all NATURAL HAIR  is NOT 3a/c or less..    Now i&#x27;m stuck with 2 jars of this crap because it was on sale.  I&#x27;ll just mix it with what i have left of the Perfect edges.  after this, i&#x27;m not buying anymore.. lying as*s reviewers...    those who are honest reviewers, but know about \\&quot;hair type\\&quot; please disregard my rant.</li>
    <li> oh my gosh! this product does nothing it said it does, it DOES NOT HOLD, this products is not a gel it is a water based product and i regret it. what a waste of my money steups!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say anything bad about this product. It was just not right for my texture of hair, to ever want to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help keep my natural hair in tact for an up do at all. This gel didn&#x27;t sooth anything on my head. It did arrive on time and the packaging was nice and neat.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and this is great to hold the curls and yet not be too heavy where it weights it down.  The smell is wonderful and I am very please with the results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold, it just doesn&#x27;t...sorry</li>
    <li> My hair can be very frizzy at times.  This smoothing gel has eliminated the frizz so far.  Can&#x27;t wait for warmer and more humid weather so I can truly test it out.  But so far, I can&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural now for a year. It&#x27;s been a challenge finding a gel that doesn&#x27;t flake or leave my hair dry. The scent is nice and light. I&#x27;ve used it for two strand twist,bantu knots,or wash n go. The hold is good,a little goes along way.I would rec&#x27;mnd this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product flakes and has additives that are not good for natural hair! Waste of money, so I switched to Eco-Styler!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on it reviews.  I must say that it work great.  It is especially great for the edges on natural hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard which is great as I normally get hard hair using gel but this stuff is nice, however I have 4c hair and it doesn&#x27;t smooth my edges for long so I will try something else. This would probably work great for 3c hair but not for thick hair it doesn&#x27;t have enough hold.</li>
    <li> It was more of a semi-smoothing gel. This was okay on my fine hair but it didn&#x27;t work well on my niece&#x27;s hair at all.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product and so did my hair! I did not see any flaking until 3rd-4th day and by then I&#x27;d wash out the product build-up or do a co-wash, so I didn&#x27;t have a problem. It&#x27;s heavy enough to hold down my curls and define them yet light enough to keep my curls from feeling weighed down by the product itself. Also held my edges down really well. I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> Product does not do what sold to do, already submitted FEEDBACK</li>
    <li> Smells amazing  and has all natural ingredients which is what I&#x27;m looking for in my hair products.The Coconut Co wash is amazing as well thinking about getting the line products of AS I AM. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it a little goes a long way. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get away from a bunch chemicals in their hair care products checkout AS I AM product line.</li>
    <li> Great leave in gel for wash and go&#x27;s .</li>
    <li> I like this product for two strand twists. It keeps my hair soft and leaves no residue and plays well with my homemade hair moisturizer, which I put on my hair before using the gel. As a smoothing gel/edge tamer for curls and coils, it is not great at all. My hair just fights against it gets curlier.</li>
    <li> it was here on time and i love the product!</li>
    <li> Love it leaves my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love to use tis because there is no residue and it is unnoticeable when it dries. It looks natural and keeps my hair smooth all day. I wear my hair natural and it is very crinkly. This smoothes it out without the gunk and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard like the other products. I would recommend this product to any one especially for use on kids hair.</li>
    <li> I like this as a curl defining jelly for my wash and goes.  I originally bought it for sleeking down my hair.  It failed to do that.  I have thick 3b/3C/4A hair (yes all 3) and it only made my hair extra curly.  Even though it did not do what I expected it to do, I was still able to use it.  It does the same thing that the As I Am Curling Jelly does on my hair.  So I cheat and buy this instead. It&#x27;s way cheaper. The joys of discovery!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my dry, coarse, wavy hair, I apply it to damp hair. I&#x27;m of Greek descent, and so is my type of hair!</li>
    <li> Too watery for me didn&#x27;t like it...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon,but thought I would comment on the product anyway. I wanted something that would lay my edges down and I must say this does the job. Its not flaky,gummy or sticky like most gels.  Also smells nice. I think I will try the conditioner and cowash as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I love &amp;#34;AS I AM&amp;#34; products, leaves my natural hair soft and manageable, try them for yourself.</li>
    <li> Did not like it for my hair . It leaves so much build up in my hair</li>
    <li> This gel is the best gel that I have used since becoming natural three years ago.  No buildup and lays my hair down right!</li>
    <li> I love this and I will be making another order really soon thank you sorry for taking so log to respond.</li>
    <li> Did not hold hair. I had to return product (beware cost to return was the same cost of product). I have very thick textured hair and this product was very greasy on my hair and did not hold.</li>
    <li> Great for Wash and Go not so much for smoothing.  With wash and go I do in four sections first applying the as I am leave in conditioner and then smoothing the gel over that whole section.  This is my favorite thing for wash and go because it is a hold but very soft to touch.  If you want to use the method where you go through each section then you will need to dilute this gel with water.</li>
    <li> This works just like any other gel, no special characteristics there.  It does lay the hair when doing a ponytail or updo.  But it needs to be washed out before you can go back to wearing your hair down.  I like it though for updos and ponytails.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my husband&#x27;s (Type 3B) hair, and he loves it. Infused with the pleasant smell of coconut, it works perfectly as a smoothing agent for his grade of hair. While I like the smell and texture (not excessively oily), for his hair, I don&#x27;t feel it worked as well on my 4B-C hair, which required a bit more firm smoothing agent. Because it works so well for hubby, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Helps when straitening my hair . Leaves your hair feeing natural, no greasy or heavy film.</li>
    <li> ive recently had all my japanese straightened hair chopped off and gone back to my natural short curls...in a very short style.  this gel is great!  no frizz...its runny so application is easy and its not heavy.  smells delicious.  hair is in great condition and curls are CURLS not frizz...am going to try it with rollers and see how it work for bigger curls.....definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman and I&#x27;ve only been natural for 6 months.  I wear my 3c/4a hair in a TWA.  I really like the Smoothing Gel.  I bought it as a curl definer, not even wanting it to smooth my edges.  I really like the result.  Since my big chop, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various products, searching for the best curl definer.  And I must say, As I Am&#x27;s Smoothing Gel works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this journey, and it is definitely a journey, I&#x27;ve read countless reviews and tried a multitude of products.  And what I&#x27;ve found is that what works or doesn&#x27;t work on one person can totally different for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed another reviewers advice, and didn&#x27;t use too much.  This is a heavier gel.  The result was a great curl on my wash and go style, it has a nice smell, did not leave my hair flaky or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder what the actual curl definer is like.  As it is more expensive than the smoothing gel, I don&#x27;t think I need to try it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a girl at my job had been using it and said I should give it a go. well I&#x27;m  glad I did it smells great and smooths pretty well. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.</li>
    <li> Holds hair without it being sticky, thick  or greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this gel, I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;It has a really pleasant smell and i love that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that it is one of those gels that should be used when your hair is wet and that you should tie your hair down a minimum of 10 minutes for best results</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks back and to say  \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; would be an understatement. I&#x27;ve an African American woman and I went natural in August of 2010. I&#x27;ve been using Ojon products with moderate success. And using Kinky Curly Gel. I found the Kinky Curly gel dried my hair and made my scalp itchy. I decided to give this product a try. I LOVE it. It provides a strong hold, yet doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weigh my hair down. It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp irritated or itchy. And a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve also used it as a curl enhancer. Sometimes I&#x27;ll put a bit on my hair after shampooing and it makes my curls look great. So it has multiple uses. If you&#x27;re considering this product, I think you should give it a try. Its very gentle and nourishing to your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this products, but I still get fly aways about 30 minutes after applying to my hair, but it doubles as a curl defining gel, so it&#x27;s still useable.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff, much milder than the heavy chemical type gels, smells good, only need a little for a great hold, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This product might as well be oil, it has no holding power whatsoever. The price of the product is absolutely ridiculous. I am returning this product.</li>
    <li> This product makes my natural hair soft and it smells good. I am changing to all As I Am products.</li>
    <li> I use As I Am Coconut Cowash and Leave-in as part of my regular natural hair routine.  The smoothing gel is just ok for me.  I have 3a (with some b around the edges) and after using this smoothing gel for some time, I noticed some breakage/thinning at the part where I used it most.  It could have been stress caused by my technique, however, so without proof I can&#x27;t blame the gel.  The most critical thing I can say is that while I can use this on my hair when wearing curly, I have tried to use it on my edges on the last day of my blow out (when I notice my curls fighting to come back) and it does NOT work for pressed hair, most likely because the very first ingredient is WATER!  So for me this gel was just ok because it wasn&#x27;t as versatile as I like for my hair products.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, it made my hair really dry even when I used a very small amount  My hair was was not smooth or shiny and the product produced a flakiness in my hair when it finally dried. This definitely did not work for my hair. I would not purchase this product again and I would not recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I read a positive review of this product on a natural hair blog. I decided to purchase it so that I could try out some new hair styles on my 5 inch \\&quot;frohawk.\\&quot; I followed the instructions to apply on clean damp hair. I did this and then twisted my hair to create spiral curls. The plus factors: T) the gel worked well at holding the curls. I like the fragrance of the gel. After sweating profusely the curls still held. The minus: it made my hair look dry and it flaked some. I&#x27;ll use less gel next time and see if this will make a difference.  Overall, this product is ok.</li>
    <li> It does hold hair, not too strong but it&#x27;s ok. It also doesn&#x27;t build up on my scalp. It smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice gel. Conditions the hair</li>
    <li> This is my go to styling product. I use it along with the co-wash or clarifying shampoo, deep conditioner, leave in conditioner, the twist defining cream, then the gel. I like As I Am products as they play well together.  This item is a must try. Not everyone will like it, because we all have personal preferences when it comes to styling, but you won&#x27;t know unless you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AIA smoothing gel is better than the AIA curling jelly IMHO. The consistency is light and very smooth. Even though it&#x27;s light it really holds my twist n curl style.  Just make sure to allow your hair to dry and set. I find that if I use this with two strand twists rolled on flexirods it will take 24 hrs to dry and another day to reach the perfect curl set. I like to start the style with tighter curls as they will stretch when I re-twist at night.  I have very long thick, kinky curly hair (3C-4A,B) if that helps gauge with my drying recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note I&#x27;ve never had issues with flaking or white dots with this gel even if I reapply to reset the style a few days later.  You will need a clarifier though if you restyle multiple times and have an extended wash period. I don&#x27;t find the As I Am clarifier to be overly drying. It cleans the products without stripping. Just make sure to moisturize after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, IMHO this is not a holding gel equivalent to something like a firm level Eco styling gel. This gel is meant to be used as a styler and compliments other styling products and leave ins without adding build up. Which is the opposite of a heavy gel. If you&#x27;re looking for something to lay thick, or kinky, or coily edges this is probably not for you. If you have wavy hair with an elongated curl pattern like 2C-3A this might help your edges look more tidy, but I emphasize this is not like a firm Eco styling gel.  But, if you want something to help fight frizz, and make your twists or coils smooth and hold their style this may be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
