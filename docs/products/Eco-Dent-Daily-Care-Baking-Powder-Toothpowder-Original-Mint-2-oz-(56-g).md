      <li>I mainly love the taste of Eco-Dent and the fact that it has Baking Powder in it, which foams in your mouth to let you know it is neutralizing your mouth acid to help prevent tooth cavities caused by the acid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product.  The perfect switch from regular toothpaste.  It has a pleasant taste and your mouth feels fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> The products came as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite, hard to beat, tooth powders. I like the flavor, as it is mintier than its competitors, and it leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean. There have been concerns raised by some of my friends that this product increases the risks of cavities. I tend to disagree, but to be certain I&#x27;m not being too rough on my teeth I often will coat my teeth with coconut oil, as a preventative measure, and also to nourish the old chew-choppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a gripe, it would be that the prices are ridiculous. There is nothing about this product that cost what is charged.</li>
    <li> ... but you will get used to the background baking-soda taste the others here complain of. The mint flavor comes to the foreground. I have used this powder for many years. It&#x27;s mild, not abrasive, and it cleans your teeth like nobody&#x27;s business. Perhaps because, in a pinch, I have been known to brush my teeth using baking soda alone, I never noticed the trace of soda taste, only the mint. I don&#x27;t know why all our toothpastes must be saccharined and sweetened to taste like candy, anyway. I love this stuff. I would say \\&quot;This is a dentifrice for grownups,\\&quot; except my kids grew up using it, too, and liked it fine.</li>
    <li> OMG!  I was excited to try this product but now it sits in my medicine cabnet only to have been used once. The taste is so bad I can&#x27;t try it again.  It has an very salty foul taste.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple stand alone product to clean my teeth. This so far has really been great! The powder bottle dispenses only a little at a time, but a little is all you really need so this actually helps limit waste. The favor is a minty herbal taste with earthy undertones. You&#x27;ll know you have rinsed all of it away when the taste turns from earthy to clean and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like simple, natural products that get the job done, you will enjoy this. There are no frills like colors or sweeteners, but it still gets the job done safely and effectively.</li>
    <li> Eco-Dent tooth powder make my teeth feel clean and fresh.  It lasts a long time.  I shake the powder over my wet toothbrush and over a little bowl.  This way I can put back the unused powder in the bottle and don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
    <li> Trying the eco-Dent Toothpowder has been a change from applying the regular toothpaste. The powder works great on my teeth leaving a smooth feeling. I&#x27;ll see if using the powder helps me with plaque buildup at next dentist visit.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; gentle, fresh and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I found this to have a refreshing flavor.  Not salty, but it definitely has that \\&quot;baking soda\\&quot; flavor.  It might take a little getting used to, but my mouth feels great after using it.  I got this after trying the Eco Dent floss.  Go Go natural products.  A great product from an independent company (Tom&#x27;s is owned by Colgate-Palmolive)  EcoDent is the bomb!  Oh, and read this: [...]</li>
    <li> I tried this product just to see if the old standby still worked (baking soda) It still works and this has a milder taste point to it. I like it, but the price point is a little high.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasted me forever!.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpowder--it&#x27;s easy to use and does a very good job of cleaning my teeth.  Very nice taste, and not sickeningly sweet.  The bottle was a little smaller than I was expecting, but it doesn&#x27;t take much and this bottle should last a long time.  No lingering aftertaste.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years, and we are very satisfied with it. It was difficult to find a tooth powder in our local market, but this was exactly what we were looking for. It leaves our teeth and mouth feeling much cleaner than when we used toothpaste. A little on a wet brush (we use electric) does it, so the product lasts quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpowder. It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Made with baking soda but with a nice minty taste. Very very fine grit and is concentrated. Feels like it gets my teeth clean and  the mint taste doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth. Nice balance of cleaning and fresh taste.</li>
    <li> The whole family loves this stuff.  We&#x27;ve tried about three of the various Eco Dent formulations over the last four months and have really grown to love it.  Teeth feel very clean and the mouth much fresher than even our expensive toothpastes that we used to use.  Thinking of cost, this stuff lasts forever, the container never seems empty.  However, getting the powder from the container to toothbrush is kind of tricky, either too much or too little until you get some practice.</li>
    <li> Saw this stuff at whole foods and wanted to try it.. so glad I did. I now like it even more than tooth paste. And it&#x27;s more compact and you can take it on the plane. Taste gets some getting used to but now I actually prefer it.</li>
    <li> arrived on schedule .... am pleased with the product .. all is well ...</li>
    <li> I recently started using this tooth powder with the intent of only using it while travelling (since it&#x27;s a powder, not subject to the TSA 3-1-1 liquids rule). However, my mouth has none of the aftertaste that I often get from regular toothpastes.  My mouth feels much cleaner than with traditional toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I first tried Eco-Dent with no expectations at all. I had never seen it before that day at a local co-op. I hadn&#x27;t read any reviews but I knew I&#x27;d run out of toothpaste so I bought it on sale. Here are the reasons why Eco-Dent has become my favorite Dental Care product.    -Less Mess: A lot of natural toothpastes come in a foil tube. Living in a multiple person household, the aluminum usually exhausts and cracks open just a tiny bit- but that tiny crack makes a mess everywhere. Eco-Dent completely bypasses the possibility of the sticky toothpaste mess; And while sometimes the powder might sometimes not make it onto the brush, those delicate grains of baking soda rinse away much more easily than any toothpaste ever will.    -Clean Teeth: This toothpaste cleans my teeth to a smooth natural shine. Sometimes I&#x27;ve used toothpastes that leave my teeth feeling a bit over-scrubbed and Eco-Dent manages to make my teeth feel truly clean, without feeling stripped and vulnerable.    -The Taste: The complaints about the taste of this tooth powder are very extreme. It&#x27;s baking soda based, so we know what baking soda tastes like- not a big deal. It&#x27;s minty and mild- no flavors are overpowering and it certainly doesn&#x27;t taste like you&#x27;re going to die as one reviewer mentioned. If you are only comfortable using sweetened toothpastes then this tooth powder is not for you. It&#x27;s naturally effervescent so you can feel tiny bubbles forming as you brush. Brush and rinse as usual for a minty fresh finish.    Something interesting to look out for- Whenever I use this toothpowder, anything I eat or drink tastes sweeter for the first 30 minutes after. (Including black coffee)</li>
    <li> Tastes great,&lt;br /&gt;real cleaning power,&lt;br /&gt;I only wish so much didn&#x27;t fall of my tooth brush as I daintily sprinkle the powder on.</li>
    <li> Very good toothpowder, all natural ingredients, good tasting, effective. Only criticism is the cost, pretty high priced for the amount you get. But good stuff. Have never liked gummy, soapy toothpaste and used toothpowder for years until Colgate and Peosodent went off the market, then Arm and Hammer. This is good, use a little baking soda with it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this every single day as baking soda is pretty abrasive on the enamel.. Use it maybe once a week, twice at most..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELPFUL HINT: After brushing with this, use apple cider vinegar as a mouthwash for a good minute or so. Be sure the baking powder is still on your teeth and not rinsed off... It will deep clean your gums because of the chemical reaction between baking soda and vinegar. Over time you&#x27;ll get pink gums again. You have to use the best type of apple cider vigegar. Use the unpasteurized all natural ones. The ones you have to shake very because of the sediments at the bottom. You&#x27;ll thank me later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the &#x27; Now Foods Xyliwhite, Baking Soda Toothpaste, Platinum Mint, 6.4-Ounces &#x27; for every other day. It contains xylitol which is very beneficial for dental health.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service ..</li>
    <li> In the first use I noticed a real difference the overall clean. It feels like a dental cleaning everytime and I can&#x27;t stop running my tongue across my teeth. Moreover, the clean lasts all day unlike most toothpaste. I&#x27;m a month in, and I&#x27;m noticing my tooth sensitivity decreasing dramatically and they are starting to re-mineralized because of my change to the WAPF diet. Thoroughly impressed.</li>
    <li> This tootpowder leaves a fresh clean feeling to my teeth. The downside to this toothpowder is that it is not strong at fighting bad breath. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it works pretty good in that area but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to use a mouth rinse alongside this. Overall this is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eco-Dent Care Baking Powder Toothpowder for many years.  When I was a child, I am now in my 70s, I loved the tooth powder available then over the taste and feel of tooth paste.  I mainly love the taste of Eco-Dent and the fact that it has Baking Powder in it, which foams in your mouth to let you know it is neutralizing your mouth acid to help prevent tooth cavities caused by the acid. Also, you only need a little of it each time you brush your teeth since it is so powerful. I mainly love the cinnamon flavor. Thus, even though it seems expensive coming in such a small container, it is a powerful tooth cleaner and each container full of Eco-Dent will last you for months.</li>
    <li> love it. and very economical.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of tooth powder.  I have been using it for a few years.  Cleans great, an a little bottle lasts a long time!  Great for travel - no worries about liquids and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in your luggage.  For the record, I use it at home too. My teeth feel much more clean after using this than most tooth pastes.</li>
    <li> this is the best tooth substance for your teeth, for my teeth for sure. I follow with xyliwhite rinse to follow up and desensitize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the granules were finer, or put into a gel. glycerin coats the teeth so the ecodent toothpaste is no good. An ecodent gel would be perfect</li>
    <li> I brush my teeth everyday and used regular toothpaste for years. My hygienist always had a complaint about my teeth or gums. I switched to this tooth powder and within 3 months my hygienist said &amp;#34;good, good.&amp;#34; My next visit she said my teeth are easy to clean. I take it that there is less plaque.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind baking soda taste or salt but this is sharp and sour. It has a bite and is nothing like the old time Pepsodent or Colgate powders. We all hate wasting it but all 3 bottles are going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothpowder after drastically changing my entire lifestyle. I&#x27;ve eliminated all chemicals from my life (toothpastes, food additives, cleaning products, etc.) &amp; eat a low-fat raw vegan diet. Eco-Dent was the final piece of the puzzle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes great, but doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth with &amp;#34;minty freshness&amp;#34; like the commercial toothpastes do. No fluoride either. Just use a tiny bit with some water &amp; brush. It&#x27;s got enough mint for you to notice, but if you&#x27;re not eating garbage foods then your breath isn&#x27;t going to need insane amounts of mint. The smell of your breath starts in your stomach, not your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was able to remineralize 2 cracked teeth while using Eco-Dent. I think it was the diet change, but the Eco-Dent definitely didn&#x27;t hurt anything. Highly recommended &amp; it lasts quite a long time. Will whiten your teeth a bit as well.</li>
    <li> I love the product and can&#x27;t go back to anything else.  It&#x27;s fresh and yummy.  I even use it to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth because it&#x27;s so clean.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for traveling.  It goes a long way.  My husband and I have used one 2oz container on three two week overseas trips and still have some left.  It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest taste, which is why I am giving it a 4, but if you want to carry on everything and can&#x27;t stop to find toothpaste, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love the effervescence effect of this toothpaste.  I have both the blue and the white containers.  There is also a cinnamon that I&#x27;m not that fond of in the morning, but a nice taste for bedtime!  I will not go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is very good for brushing one&#x27;s teeth. It is completely water soluble, whitens teeth without excessive abrasion, and has a fresh taste. We have used it exclusively for several years. One bottle lasts a very long time. It is good for packing in one&#x27;s toiletries case when traveling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years now. I used to get what is called &amp;#34;geographic tongue&amp;#34; all the time, but my dentist never could figure out why. Apparently, it had to do with the toothpaste. As soon as I started using this tooth powder instead of paste, the geographic tongue disappeared, never to reappear. (and yes, I&#x27;d tried many different pastes, including natural ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning, it can take a few weeks to get used to using powder as opposed to paste. It&#x27;s worth the it to get there.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Goodbye toothpaste!  The Eco-Dent hit my mouth with a Ka-pow! Fresh mint explosion without that weird toothpaste aftertaste. Cleans my teeth better too.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this. I love it. Great, no-spill for travel. It is also healthy and makes my teeth clean and white.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I put it in another small container though so I can wet my toothbrush and dunk it in and it doesn&#x27;t get all over the place.</li>
    <li> This little bottle of tooth powder is awesome!  Taste is not that bad - I mean, it&#x27;s toothpaste - not like I&#x27;m having it for supper.  Basically tastes like a mixture of baking powder and peroxide.  The best comment I can give is that I had my first dental checkup last week after using this powder for several months.  It was the easiest and fastest checkup I&#x27;ve had in years.  Hygienist even commented that I was taking very good care of my teeth (and she doesn&#x27;t usually say that)!</li>
    <li> Used it for a week and experienced great whitening results, and I love it. Will order again in the near future</li>
    <li> I needed an alternative to normal toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain glycerin products (I have headache issues) and this product fits the bill perfectly. Look up glycerin and teeth and it doesn&#x27;t read very well and that alone is reason enough to try this product. My teeth feel very clean, the flavor is easy to get used to, and it foams up very well. Use it with a good mouth rinse beforehand and you are good to go. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I needed a toothpaste that I could carry on the plane without counting as a liquid. The answer is tooth powder! Works great, just a little powder on a moistened brush and it works great, and best of all, it can be on an airplane carry-on! Just keep in mind that unlike most toothpastes, this one does not contain fluoride (which may be good or bad depending on one&#x27;s view of the substance).</li>
    <li> A little pricey for baking soda and flavor.  It turns salty tasting as you brush.  It becomes somewhat difficult to spray out of the bottle and you must ream it out from time to time.  But it does avoid TSA difficulties when traveling.  (I know, funny world, huh?)</li>
    <li> Did not like it.  Bad taste.  Saw no changes in my teeth color.  My teeth are not yellow or dingy, but I wanted a little lightening.  Saw no changes.  Did not like the taste.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Only took a little bit on the toothbrush and it left my teeth feeling clean and had a nice fresh taste.  As an added bonus, no need to pack in the liquids pouch when flying.  I&#x27;ll pack it in a separate clear bag so the TSA agents can read the label.</li>
    <li> I purchsed this because it is powder and does not have to go in the TSA quart bag at the airport.  I is a little expensive compared to toothpaste, but it does last a long time.  It is minty, bubbly and seems to leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Natural. But I have a tendency to have really bad breath. And I don&#x27;t think this toothpaste helps with that what so ever.</li>
    <li> Maybe I could love it, but I used Vince for many years and even though it has been discontinued it&#x27;s still my top pick.  However, as a substitute, Eco-Dent seems to fill the bill, easily available, mild minty taste, handy dispenser -- and be ready for full effervescence.  Leaves teeth clean and smooth, and probably does the gums a bit of good.</li>
    <li> Leave mouth refreshed and clean</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s vegan, animal-friendly, and you can take it on planes! I still pull it out and put it in a plastic bag so they can scan it at the airport, but it&#x27;s a powder so it doesn&#x27;t apply to the 1 ounce rule. Very very useful for traveling. It also lasts an incredibly long time, as you don&#x27;t need very much of the powder to brush your teeth. It tastes great and my mouth feels thoroughly clean afterwards. Never going back to a traditional toothpaste again!</li>
    <li> I like this tooth powder. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and this one isn&#x27;t as salty tasting as some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. This one has a more minty taste which a lot of people may prefer.After using tooth powders for several years now I can no longer use regular tooth paste.</li>
    <li> I like the taste, but I&#x27;m the kind of person that likes plain unsweetened cranberries so my taste might be a little different than others. However, regardless of taste my teeth look good!</li>
    <li> My granddaughters asked me if I had whitened my teeth, after I started using this tooth powder. I have healthier teeth and gums as well.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 months now and really can&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
    <li> One month that I have been using it everyday, I like it a lot because I feel my teeth are very clean. Very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great tooth powder..I was looking for something without the dreaded carrageenan and this is it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for travel and have used it for a few days with great results. My teeth actually feel cleaner using this toothpaste somehow. It definitely doesn&#x27;t have a sweet taste like many of the tube toothpastes, but this was exactly what I was looking for and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Much better than regular toothpaste.  My dentist recommends using baking soda with some hydrogen peroxide on the tooth brush.  This foams up really nice, better than baking soda.  Even my 8 year old daughter (the same one who has a plain cheeseburger and McDonalds) likes it.  There may be other great similar products, but compared to toothpaste this is a big improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use while hiking as I am a long distance hiker and it provides a lighter weight option then most others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this product works, but it does so with a very bad (to me) flavor. I have yet to find a way to get it to not taste bad while using it. Could use some tips if anybody has any.</li>
    <li> Once one gets used to the idea of powdered tooth cleaner it is easy to&lt;br /&gt;Ike this product. I especially like that I don&#x27;t have to remove it from my carry-on for airport security.</li>
    <li> After reading about the negative effects of brushing with a paste containing glycerin I decided to try a tooth powder.  Saw Eco-Dent at Whole Foods and decided to give it a try.  WOW.  Teeth feel so much cleaner and breath stays fresh - even in the morning.  Won&#x27;t go back to tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the recommended way of using this stuff is, but it just goes all over when I try to put it on my toothbrush, and does not leave my teeth feeling clean very long. But it does the job and the mint flavor is powerful and smells good</li>
    <li> Good tooth powder awesome results after using it my wife just raves about the change in the way it cleans also it has pleasant taste a little goes a long way great product I will be using it as long as its available.</li>
    <li> Great product, my breath smell and taste alot better..</li>
    <li> When I was much younger, tooth powders were common the market, eventually to be replaced by toothpaste.  I am up in years and I am finding the many of the popular toothpastes contain chemicals that irritate my mouth.  So I decided to try a toothpowder based on what I remember of its efficacy from long ago.  There are not many tooth powders on the market and they are hard to come by.  I found Eco-Dent on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I am very glad I did.  It has a minty baking soda taste which may take some getting used to, but it definitely cleans my teeth and leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.  It does its job and does it economically.  Based on my experience, this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> The flavor takes a little bit to get used to but it leaves you&#x27;re mouth very clean. Not really good of you like to brush your tongue though.</li>
    <li> IT IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  NO ALUMINUM, HEALTHY.  VERY REFRESHING.  I ALWAYS USE THIS TOOTHPOWDER.&lt;br /&gt;AND IT IS ECONOMICAL  THE 2 OUNCE SIZE LASTS A LONG  TIME.</li>
    <li> This is an awsome product.  I wish my dentist would have recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;When I run out of my samples, I WILL be ordering or purchasing this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Shame on me for not reading more closely, but this bottle is about 3 in. tall.  Two ounces is not much.  Way too expensive for that much minty baking powder.  I would return it if I could.</li>
    <li> Love it..my whole mouth feels fresh and clean!!! My teeth feel like I just left the dentist office and they had just been polished!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal, which is probably why your dentist doesn&#x27;t sell it. They are trained to sell the fake stuff. This is as natural as it gets- you could swallow whatever is left in your mouth after you brush. This small bottle has enough toothpaste to last months because you need just a bit, unlike the inch-long strip of toothpaste your dentist tells you to use when you use the fake stuff. It cleans your teeth til they feel like they must have felt the day you were born- smooth, fresh, unsullied, no leftover gook like paste leaves you with. That&#x27;s because it is effervescent. It bubbles slightly and instead of being abrasive, it just scrubs softly and firmly, the way you&#x27;d scrub a baby&#x27;s skin. It&#x27;s like homeopathy: gentle, but super powerful. This powder does not kill your taste buds and burn out your mouth like those nasty mint-flavored toothpastes. This has REAL mint. What a rarity! Worth every buck and more. You know how &#x27;once you go black, you never go back&#x27;? Well, let&#x27;s revise that. Once you go Eco-Dent, you never go back.&lt;br /&gt;I think what I just wrote would make a super customer endorsement for Eco-Dent if they ever advertise. But unlike most endorsements, this one is pure. Straight from the heart. Straight from my freshened mouth.</li>
    <li> I have used Eco-Dent Daily Care Toothpowder for years.  Tooth powder cleans your teeth better than paste, in my opinion.  This is mild and has a soft mint flavor.  Thank you for stocking products that are hard to find locally!</li>
    <li> I brought this along with me on a two month backpacking trip through Latin America. This saved room and weight in my backpack. It was easy to use and my teeth felt clean afterwards (whether they actually were clean or not I don&#x27;t know!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that my gums sometimes developed a bit of sensitivity after using this, but it was only temporary.</li>
    <li> Having used another toothpowder previously, I was not prepared for the sour flavor (creme of tartar, probably) and the wretched after taste this product left in my mouth. Awful stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item not realizing how tiny the container would be.  I love the taste of this tooth powder which is anise and actually look forward to brushing my teeth.  Maybe the item will last in spite of the small size.  This is a great product, I was just disappointed in the tiny size of the container.  I should have paid more attention before ordering.  I have no complaints about the powder itself, I love the wonderful taste.  Also, it is not certified by the American ADA, but by the Chinese nation (CCIC), which doesn&#x27;t mean a lot to me, however, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  You really only need a very small amount to do the job.  I brush with this first and then with baking soda.  BYW, baking soda has been listed with the least abrasion factor of all tooth cleaning products by the ADA (American Dental Associatin).</li>
    <li> Nice clean teeth feeling after using this powder. Last pretty long, cleans effectively. Does not ab braise my mouth lining like other toothpastes which happens probably due to whitening agent. Easy to take on the trips, light weight and compact. Like that there are not harmful chemicals in it. Definitely will continue buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> Has a slight tinge of baking soda taste when brushing teeth. But leaves teeth feeling cleaner than typical toothpaste and brighter too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eco-Dent Daily Care Baking Powder Toothpowder for years and love it.  This was the first time ordering on-line--good to know it is so easily available.</li>
    <li> Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate, Calcium Carbonate, Magnesium Carbonate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste is not good, and Phosphate is not something I want on my mucus membrane inside my mouth.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave this to me over 1.5 years ago, and I finally finished it. My dentist was impressed with the improvement in my teeth, since I eat blueberries and drink tea all the time and had been having staining. No more staining!  Also, no cavities. I think my gum health has improved. Used 1x per day every day - only need a little sprinkle! Amazon price seemed good do I ordered, and it was delivered quickly.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but I read that regular toothpastes coat your teeth so that calcium cannot get in and strengthen them. No such problem with this. I wouldn&#x27;t switch back, because this makes my mouth feel better.</li>
    <li> The only stuff I&#x27;ll use -- much better than toothpaste, less bulk, and travels better.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s healthy for your mouth and cleans so well. You only need a little. Will keep buying this.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old loves this!  It is a great alternative to regular toothpaste.  We alternate regular paste with this.</li>
    <li> tried 1 bottle per dentist wfo found this rooth powder for me becaise u could no longer find the brand I used &amp; tooth paste upset my stomach.</li>
    <li> Best tooth cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used! I used &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; toothpaste for years and wondered if going without it would cause more sensitivity? Not at all. Been using it for 2 weeks and my teeth feel clean and my gums healthy and NO sensitivity! Just ordered another two!</li>
    <li> I love this tooth powder. My teeth feel cleaner and I feel like the powder really gets into the grooves where tooth paste can&#x27;t go. My mouth feels fresher longer and bad breath seems to be less frequent. Toothpaste sort of made my mouth taste sour after awhile and I don&#x27;t have that with eco dent. I also use the whitening powder and while I can&#x27;t tell if it is actually whitening my teeth (avid coffee drinker here) I like both products a lot.</li>
    <li> The container is tiny. You can barely see the powder go onto your brush with the puffer bottle. I accidently inhaled some because it was dry. When I was little we had a can of old school powder and it was a much bigger can and tasted good, like pepsodent.&lt;br /&gt;Will not use or re-order this powder. The taste is bitter too.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpowder! After I used this, I am not going back to regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your teeth and mouth feel so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Great product as a supplement to brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. A bottle lasts a very long time, and is TSA friendly when travelling.</li>
    <li> Great product, I will continue to use and recommend it. Only annoyance is that the information on the label on the back is covered with a LARGE hard to remove bar code sticker that has to be removed bit by bit if you want to read the label with ingredients, cautions and user instructions .Not sure if this is done by Amazon or the manufacturer</li>
    <li> I like this tooth powder a lot- it is very easy to use in the squeeze tube it comes in and makes my teeth cleaner, my breath is noticeably better and gums look healthier.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to a newbie to tooth powder who has healthy or white-enough teeth.  The other eco-dent powder is better for stained teeth because it has the whitener aspect.</li>
    <li> I have always used baking soda from time to time for a really clean feeling. I got this powder in hopes that it would add some pizazz, and it really does! It&#x27;s a bit saltier than I expected but that soon goes away and the effervescent mint takes over. Very refreshing, not too abrasive. Only issue is dispensing it onto the toothbrush without making a cloud of powder but I&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
</ol>
