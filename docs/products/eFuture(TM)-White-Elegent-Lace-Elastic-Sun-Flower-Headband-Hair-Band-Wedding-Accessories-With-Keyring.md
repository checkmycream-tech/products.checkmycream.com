      <li>And smelled of strong chemicals even after washing it.</li>
      <li>Super cute headband for me to wear.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really fit at all.</li>
      <li>Definitely fit for a child.</li>
      <li>Replaced the cheap elastic with a piece of ribbon.</li>
      <li>Fit very nicely to the head, would purchase another in a different style.</li>

<ol>
    <li> its broader than i taught and not what i expected...wasted my money</li>
    <li> Snapped the millisecond I put it on. Replaced the cheap elastic with a piece of ribbon. The lace part is nice and strong. Not traditional lace. Much thicker. So after replacing it with ribbon and just tying it on every time makes the purchase worth while</li>
    <li> i like the product, but it wasn&#x27;t WHITE...it was a pearl color...not bad but not what i was expecting.  Also, it had a few loose strings here and there...nothing that i couldn&#x27;t fix.  It&#x27;s an ok product...useable</li>
    <li> Super small. Definitely fit for a child. Took forever to get to my house. And smelled of strong chemicals even after washing it. Don&#x27;t buy unless you have a super small head and don&#x27;t mind it ripping after first use. Save your dollar.</li>
    <li> Super cute headband for me to wear. It was a little stiff, but it&#x27;s still super cute. There is metal at the end where the rubberbands are, just an FYI</li>
    <li> Great Band for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Super cute, stays in place and it&#x27;s Comfy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to own more colors.</li>
    <li> Poorly made BUT what do you expect for the price. I would recommend this for pre teens or anyone with a smaller head!</li>
    <li> Both of my teenaged daughters felt that these were too tight to be worn comfortably. I squeezed one on my head, but it is indeed a touch small.</li>
    <li> The lace is too big and the elastic broke the first time I wore it.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be white, and it wasn&#x27;t.  It was ivory with gold running through it.  I bought it to be used with an item that was white, and I ended up having to buy something else because this was the wrong color.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Loved this hairpiece looks great too</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture. Has a slight sparkle to it. Very cute.</li>
    <li> This headband is way too big. It didn&#x27;t really fit at all. I know it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money to purchase it but still. I guess you get what you pay for :/</li>
    <li> kinda stiff but still cute</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all lace and the lace is tight. There&#x27;s an elastic string underneath and it pulls your hair out! I never wear it.</li>
    <li> Took forever for me to recive it.. The head band is falling apart were it&#x27;s supposed to be connected..</li>
    <li> this is an okay purchase that I probably wont make again.</li>
    <li> Quality was great and very cute on. Fit very nicely to the head, would purchase another in a different style.</li>
    <li> Worst headband ever. Went to try it on for the first time and the elastic band snapped and broke. I had to throw it out. Definitely not worth the price, or the wait since it came from China.</li>
    <li> This is pretty and a little sparkly. The lace is a bit stiff and was too wide to look good on me, probably about 4 inches. I gave it to my sister to see if she liked it and she ended up folding it in half to wear. It went to the middle of the top of my head.

    <li> the one I got was not white at all... its more of a gold/tan.</li>
