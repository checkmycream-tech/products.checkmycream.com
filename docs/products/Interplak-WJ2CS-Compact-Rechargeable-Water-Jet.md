      <li>and they both were good at removing the food.</li>
      <li>Both the Interplak and the Water Pik do a good job of removing junk between teeth.</li>
      <li>As one customer mentioned, you are better off gargling!      </li>
      <li>I use luke warm water not to irritate the gums.</li>
      <li>I also would have liked the option of a finer tip.  </li>
      <li>handy</li>
      <li>I purchased this with great excitement, I had just gotten my braces and planned to keep them clean.  </li>
      <li>It is quieter and more durable than the WaterPik brand irrigators we bought before we discovered Intrerplak and just as effective.</li>
      <li>Im sure it will end up in file 13.</li>
      <li>Got rid of it and now my life got better with Interplak water jet.</li>
      <li>This worked well for cleaning my most rear teeth, when my wisdom teeth were out and creating problems in brushing.</li>
      <li>So I then ordered the Interplak Dental Water Jet, model WJ6RW &amp; really love it.  </li>
      <li>Bottom Line - Interplak is better all the way around.</li>
      <li>and it worked again for about four more times.  </li>
      <li>It was cheap, effective and portable.</li>
      <li>I usedd to be a nightmare for me , I would get infection once a month or more often.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>now it is loosing a preasure on about 4th day, which I consider great for a year old 20$ oral jet.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an economical effective addition to dental care.</li>
      <li>Best 20$ I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
      <li>Charges easily and holds it unlike others I have had.</li>
      <li>Since the Interplak&#x27;s cup comes off it is as easy to fill as a dixie cup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had a strong pain reliever</li>
      <li>The water pressure is strong.</li>
      <li>and it works fine with a converter.</li>
      <li>No power, cheap in appearance, can NOT do the job.  </li>
      <li>This product works great to get all of the food out of the deep pockets.  </li>
      <li>The real benefit of these are for gum stimulation and I believe they are both effective there, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not very powerful &amp; didn&#x27;t do a very good job.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to purchase a travel size oral irrigator.  </li>
      <li>I have teeth implants and have to keep them immaculately clean, and this product does the trick.</li>
      <li>If you have limited counter space it is great for that and for traveling also.</li>
      <li>Our switch was still working great when the wire came loose.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more powerful &amp; really gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>To strong preasure at first than it was weakning very fast and the batteries where wunning out very fast.</li>
      <li>Worked great about 10 times then quit dead.  </li>
      <li>The thing just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>Although loud, Waterpik products are better.</li>
      <li>I have some areas where food ALWAYS gets caught between them and using this would shoot those leftovers right out.  </li>
      <li>This product gets the job done at the right price.    </li>
      <li>The Interplak has a cup with a very large opening</li>
      <li>It is admittedly not quite as powerful as our counter top model but it is powerful enough.</li>
      <li>The big opening makes it easy to clean and fill.</li>
      <li>First I got a panasonic , don&#x27;t recall what model but it needed 2 batteries.</li>
      <li>I am sure the Interplak is easier to pack for trips than the Water Pik, but I only travel a couple weeks a year</li>
      <li>first off the pressure was not even close too</li>
      <li>The first one lasted about 2 years until the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
      <li>I always brush my teeth first then use the jet.</li>
      <li>The Interplak promises to be better at charging because the connection is a standard barrel connector.</li>
      <li>I must say that I have to agree with all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>The unit was still working good, but I decided I wanted to take it apart and use the motor to make a small squirt gun.</li>
      <li>Working in sections of your mouth (upper, lower, innner and outer gums/teeth), turn off at the easy push button and rinse out your mouth.  </li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t work every time and you have to play certain tricks to get the air out of the system.</li>
      <li>This Water Jet is much quieter than the high-end rechargeable Water Pik (Ultra WP-450).</li>
      <li>And belive me I am very keen about my teeth</li>
      <li>I had to devise a special way of propping the Water pik up while stretching the cord to try to ensure it was actually going to charge.</li>
      <li>It effectively removes small particles that are not removed by flossing.</li>
      <li>The manufacturer does not supply spare batteries and, hence, I have to throw the whole item away and buy a new one.</li>
      <li>We now live in Kenya serving as missionaries.</li>
      <li>This item was purchased for my daughter in order to assist her with cleaning her newly aquired braces and spreader.</li>
      <li>- You&#x27;ll learn to live with whatever setting you get.</li>
      <li>not everybody could aford it , and it was still prety new there.</li>
      <li>I bought it for traveling, but I really doesnt have enough pressure to do much of anything.</li>
      <li>When my previous Water Jet died after many years of use, I decided to replace it with the same product.  </li>
      <li>Cumbersome and the jet action stopped working after two months after reharging   </li>
      <li>gave it a third chance by charging it one whole day.  </li>
      <li>my old one fore 35 bucks.</li>
      <li>I own this product for at least a year, this same one.</li>
      <li>I strongly advice against this product  A total waste of money</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second one (well, at less than $20 they don&#x27;t last forever, you know), and I just ordered one for my grandson to help clean his braces.</li>
      <li>The Water Pik, on the other hand, was pretty easy to store because it stands up taking no more space than a drinking cup - but it doesn&#x27;t have an opportunity to dry -</li>
      <li>The pressure was fine until it slowed to a weak stream of water about 6 months after.  </li>
      <li>I used it one time and the water ran down my arm, I couldn&#x27;t get any real pressure and the second time I tried to use it</li>
      <li>It packs down small for travel but opens up to be easy to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amazon did give me most of my money back but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth in all senses of the phrase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Compact Water Jet for a couple of weeks now.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s small,affordable, and only holds enough liquid for one use at a time.  However, the on/off switch is awkward, and it&#x27;s impossible to hold in a position that will keep the suction tube in the liquid and not be terribly messy.  I also would have liked the option of a finer tip.  All in all, if you can afford to buy the larger version with a stationary tank and a wand, do so, but if you need portability and the lower price, this one will work.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and does what it says. came well packed and in perfect condition. Returned to UK with it and it works fine with a converter.</li>
    <li> Cumbersome and the jet action stopped working after two months after reharging   I strongly advice against this product  A total waste of money</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for my daughter in order to assist her with cleaning her newly aquired braces and spreader. It broke within 2 weeks. I am highly disappointed and would not recommend this prodeuct.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use a counter-top Interplak Oral Irrigator when we are home. It is quieter and more durable than the WaterPik brand irrigators we bought before we discovered Intrerplak and just as effective. We wouldn&#x27;t go back to WaterPik even if our home model broke.     We bought one of these portable models over 2 years ago and used it for some brief trips before I retired. It works just like any irrigator. It is admittedly not quite as powerful as our counter top model but it is powerful enough. One resevoir of water lasts about one minute.  We now live in Kenya serving as missionaries. We have used the irrigator three times daily [me once and my wife twice] for about fifteen months in ten African countries. Then a wire connection came loose inside. I took it apart and resoldered the wire but was unable to get the irrigator back together exactly right - so we ordered up a new one. I saw some reviews complaining about durability of the switch. Our switch was still working great when the wire came loose. I also saw some complaints about battery durability. Ours would still operate for over a week, three uses per day, on a single charge.    If you use an irrigator at home, you should probably buy one of these for travel. Just put it in a zip-lock bag, toss it in your suitcase and off you go.</li>
    <li> Did its job while it worked for 5 months.  I bought mine in a pharmacy. The reservoir is a bit small without refilling so you have to rush a little to get to all the crevices.  The pressure was fine until it slowed to a weak stream of water about 6 months after.  I thought it was plugged and tried letting it sit overnight with white vinegar twice but to no avail. Turning it off then on seems to coax it to work for a few seconds but it&#x27;s still headed for the wastebasket.</li>
    <li> I must say that I have to agree with all the positive reviews. I have been using it for over an year now.     This product gets the job done at the right price.    The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the charger is rated only for 110V as opposed to be 240V-110V so when you travel you need to bring an extra adapter to convert from 240V to 110V.    Otherwise awesome product.</li>
    <li> I consider this item as a disposable one. I have bought 6 over the past 3 years.  The battery becomes dead in about 6 months of recharging. The manufacturer does not supply spare batteries and, hence, I have to throw the whole item away and buy a new one. Also, it doesn&#x27;t work every time and you have to play certain tricks to get the air out of the system. The only advantage of this product is that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
    <li> When my previous Water Jet died after many years of use, I decided to replace it with the same product.  It does take some practice to learn how to use it so you&#x27;re not splashing everything around you; essentially you bend over a sink so any water and debris will run out of your partially closed mouth into the sink. It effectively removes small particles that are not removed by flossing. It&#x27;s an economical effective addition to dental care.</li>
    <li> Boy, I don&#x27;t about those other bad reviews, but I&#x27;ve had good luck with this product. I&#x27;m on my second one (well, at less than $20 they don&#x27;t last forever, you know), and I just ordered one for my grandson to help clean his braces. I have teeth implants and have to keep them immaculately clean, and this product does the trick. I also use it when I travel. It keeps a charge for at least a week, so it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
    <li> The Interplak WJ2CS Compact Rechargeable Water Jet works well for a short time 3-4 weeks. Then they do not work well. I have had two of them so I have some experience with them. Don&#x27;t they make things well anymore?    Ronald P Peroff MD</li>
    <li> Charged mine for 24 hours.  I read the instructions, and yes, it works.  Keep your mouth closed, elbow outward so water doesn&#x27;t run down your arm. (instructions say so).  Working in sections of your mouth (upper, lower, innner and outer gums/teeth), turn off at the easy push button and rinse out your mouth.  Sorry to see the previous review had a bad machine and am dissapointed that Interplak did not send her a replacement to try again.  I bought mine at Target and there was only one left.  Am going back or order thru Amazon after X-mas for each family member. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> I bought this water jet several months ago. I used it 2 to 3 times a week and am the only one in my family using it. Nevertheless, it did NOT last me a year. I wrote a review about it saying I would tell a friend to buy it. But now I regret writing that review. This is a poorly made product and I would never recommend it to anyone. Do not buy this piece of junk. Save your money!</li>
    <li> This Water Jet is much quieter than the high-end rechargeable Water Pik (Ultra WP-450). I was always a bit self-conscious when using it while my wife was sleeping. The Interplak unit is so quiet that there is no worry. The Water Pik, which I had for about a year and a half, was really hard to charge. The connection between the charger and the Water Pik was non-standard and didn&#x27;t make a reliable connection - and there was no LED indicator to tell me when it was charging. So when I would plug it in I would never know if it was charging or not. The next day when I tried to use it, I would then discover if it had charged or not. I had to devise a special way of propping the Water pik up while stretching the cord to try to ensure it was actually going to charge. There were times it took several attempts over night to get it charged. The Interplak promises to be better at charging because the connection is a standard barrel connector. The Water Pik also had issues with drying out the water reservoir because there is only one small hole. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t have a tendency to get mildewy but if it did, I would have had a very difficult tie cleaning it. The Interplak has a cup with a very large opening and you can leave it and the rest of the unit on the shelf separated all day long to dry out. The big opening makes it easy to clean and fill. The Water Pik was difficult to fill because it has such a small hole for filling. If your bathroom sink bowl is small the length of the unit will not allow you fill it all the way. Since the Interplak&#x27;s cup comes off it is as easy to fill as a dixie cup. One issue with the Interplk is that the on-off button is hard to feel. As you turn the unit in your hand you lose track of where the on-off button is and once the water runs out in the reservoir, you have to look around for the switch. (This is a bit of a drag if you still have water in the reservoir and you want to turn it off - if you pull it out of your mouth while it is pumping,you&#x27;ll get water all over your bathroom.) Storing the unit for drying is a problem with the Interplak unit because it will be in 2 pieces on your counter - I&#x27;m still not happy about that but I prefer that to having a unit that is almost impossible to clean. The Water Pik, on the other hand, was pretty easy to store because it stands up taking no more space than a drinking cup - but it doesn&#x27;t have an opportunity to dry - whether you take it apart or not. Both the Interplak and the Water Pik do a good job of removing junk between teeth. I have a gap that tends to hold food and they both were good at removing the food. The real benefit of these are for gum stimulation and I believe they are both effective there, too. I have visited the dentist 3 times since getting an irrigator and I believe my gum health is improving. The Interplak has only one speed and it seems to be a stronger jet than I am used to with the Water Pik - I always used the low setting on the Water Pik - basically I don&#x27;t see any benefit of having 2 speeds - You&#x27;ll learn to live with whatever setting you get. I am sure the Interplak is easier to pack for trips than the Water Pik, but I only travel a couple weeks a year and I just leave it at home.    I had a surprise about a week after starting to use the Interplak - it stopped pumping water even though everything appeared to be functioning. I was afraid I would have to return the unit. After trying just about everything, I decided I&#x27;d suck on the nozzle and se if I could get water through it with or without the pump. It turns out that once I got water sucked into the pump it started to work. Now I realize that the pump needs to be primed with water in order to work. If the water drains from the pump, it won&#x27;t work. Now every tie I use it, I suck water into the unit through the nozzle as a turn it on.    Bottom Line - Interplak is better all the way around.</li>
    <li> I was excited to purchase a travel size oral irrigator.  Traditionally, I use the ones that have a tank to fill and they tend to be a bit bulky in size.      The maximum use I got out of the travel size Interplak was a couple of weeks!  I purchased it with the intention of removing tonsil stones, but the water pressure was too low.  As one customer mentioned, you are better off gargling!      I found this product very uncomfortable to handle especially if you have arthritis or weakness in your hand.  The cord gets in the way.  It was heavy and irrigating was a lot messier than using my previous irrigator.  Constantly filling the tank with water was a dreadful experience and the small metal stick automatically springs up once you close the cap. This product should be discontinued!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It packs down small for travel but opens up to be easy to use.  Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with great excitement, I had just gotten my braces and planned to keep them clean.  I thought I could use it at school since I have a sink.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  I used it one time and the water ran down my arm, I couldn&#x27;t get any real pressure and the second time I tried to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I gave it a third chance by charging it one whole day.  No dice.  The thing just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  I called the company and had a horrid experience there also.  The number wasn&#x27;t 24 hours.  I left a message and no one would call me back.  I sent an email and no one answered it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amazon did give me most of my money back but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth in all senses of the phrase.</li>
    <li> first off the pressure was not even close too my old one fore 35 bucks. also it stopped working less than a month into buying it</li>
    <li> Worked great about 10 times then quit dead.  Found problem in charging connector, tab switch would hang up in the \\&quot;charge\\&quot; position.  Got this loosened and it worked again for about four more times.  Finally the pressure dropped so low as to be useless and the battery would not hold a charge.  Solved problem by tossing it in the trash!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write about products, but I do rely on what people say about products and when I&#x27;ve seen allbad reviews for inerplak water jet I just could not belive it. I own this product for at least a year, this same one. It works great. In the begining it used to hold charge a bit longer. I could go for about a week on single charge now it is loosing a preasure on about 4th day, which I consider great for a year old 20$ oral jet.  Best 20$ I&#x27;ve ever spent! And belive me I am very keen about my teeth, I had my braces at 20yo - well I am from Poland and 12 years ago not everybody could aford it , and it was still prety new there. I am 32 now and I did not had my 8th teeth surgicaly removed, and they seatting rather deap in my gums. I usedd to be a nightmare for me , I would get infection once a month or more often. I&#x27;ve always had a strong pain reliever handy and I was possitive I will have to go for extraction. Then I decided to try oral jets,i wanted a portable one. First I got a panasonic , don&#x27;t recall what model but it needed 2 batteries. Nightmare.To strong preasure at first than it was weakning very fast and the batteries where wunning out very fast. Never again. Than I had a portable waterpik - and the answer is NO! It was supposed to have a different preasures and different attachments , whatever. It sucked. Got rid of it and now my life got better with Interplak water jet. I did not have an infection since I am using it. I always brush my teeth first then use the jet. I use luke warm water not to irritate the gums. Every time I jet I can&#x27;t belive my eyes what comes out my teeth after I brushed. Than I feel sory for people who did not discover irrigation. I am not planning to have another infection nor cavity anytime soon. If I go away and forget my charger I just simply go to store and spend another 20$ and get another interplak.  I guess oral hygine is a very personal experience andsometimes you have to try couple jets before you get your fav one. Mine is Interplak!</li>
    <li> I was not very happy with this product. It&#x27;s not very powerful &amp; didn&#x27;t do a very good job.  So I then ordered the Interplak Dental Water Jet, model WJ6RW &amp; really love it.  I had one like this for a number of year until it stopped working (after dropping it a few times!).  It&#x27;s much more powerful &amp; really gets the job done.  I&#x27;m very happy with the newer one.</li>
    <li> After 2 months of using this product daily, it stopped working.  In process of returning unit but must spend money on return postage.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  The water jet is not much better than gargling and it broke after only a few months. Although loud, Waterpik products are better.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have sent it back.  I bought it for traveling, but I really doesnt have enough pressure to do much of anything. Im sure it will end up in file 13.</li>
    <li> Had this for a year with no problems.  Charges easily and holds it unlike others I have had. I like it!</li>
    <li> This is the second Interplak water jet I&#x27;ve had.  The first one lasted about 2 years until the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  Otherwise it works very well, and it&#x27;s nice that the unit is portable, with no water tube or power cord connecting to a base unit.</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for this flosser. My last one lasted for years. The water pressure is strong. I holds a sufficient amt of water&lt;br /&gt;and is compact. I like that the water well is a removable cup and therefore can be washed.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money.  No power, cheap in appearance, can NOT do the job.  Stick with the waterpik brand.  I used this once, and put it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have really bad gums.  This product works great to get all of the food out of the deep pockets.  It will do what it is designed to do which is to make my gums healther and teeth stronger.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This lasted for quite sometime. I bought mine from Target, a little skeptical compared to the plug in bigger units and waterpik brands, but this really did the trick for the past year. I put mouthwash in it, took it into the shower. Charges occured overnight or through the day, usually setting it to charge when I noticed the \\&quot;jet\\&quot; feeling was kind of weak. This worked well for cleaning my most rear teeth, when my wisdom teeth were out and creating problems in brushing. I have some areas where food ALWAYS gets caught between them and using this would shoot those leftovers right out.  The unit was still working good, but I decided I wanted to take it apart and use the motor to make a small squirt gun. Now I&#x27;m searching to see if I can find this model again in stores. It was cheap, effective and portable. Great find and experimenting.</li>
    <li> it finally  died on me.</li>
    <li> NFG! Stopped working after only 1 year of use.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this junk again. They want 2o words so hope this counts.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and I would not want to be without it.  If you have limited counter space it is great for that and for traveling also.</li>
