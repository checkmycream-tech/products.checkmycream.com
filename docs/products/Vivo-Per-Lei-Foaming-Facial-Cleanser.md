      <li>Love these vivo products.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels clean after, and I do follow it with the toner (which works well!), but it almost feels more like another cream than a cleaner.</li>
      <li>LOVE HOW LIGHT</li>
      <li>Yes it is a very good cleansing agent that removes dirt and make-up but leaves the skin smooth, not dry.</li>

      <li>Also dries out my face a little too much.</li>

    <li> This product had an old rancid smell. It works ok but the fragrance is one of my favorite things.  Should have returned it but didn&#x27;t know til past the return date.</li>
    <li> I really like most of their products but this one was just ok.  The pump didn&#x27;t work that well and it really didn&#x27;t foam much.</li>
    <li> Product irritated my face .  Unaware item made in Japan.  Seems a low quality facial item. Sorry I bought.</li>
    <li> Works great, just like it claims, l really like it and will continue to use it</li>
    <li> Great cleanser as part of their line. Non drying.</li>
    <li> Product indicates it is foaming but it does not foam very well at all. The pump dispenser is too short so it is next to impossible to get the product in the center of your hand and the small pump action does not allow enough product to be dispensed. You have to pump 4 or 5 times to get enough to wash your face. Also, unlike other products in this line, it leaves my skin feeling dry. It does, however, remove make up effectively.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is the best I have used thus far.  The cost was phenomenal and the speed with which I received the package was astounding! I give it 5 stars both for the product and the shipper.</li>
    <li> i love this product! i bought it at the mall for 149$ for 3 pieces. night,day,and face peel... untill i looked for it on amazon. great prices.and now i know i can continue to use the product!</li>
    <li> Love these vivo products.  This cleanser smells clean and really does effecively cleanse my face and yet it is gentle and non-drying.  I would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser and needs very little to cleanse your skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE HOW LIGHT THE FORMULATION IS AS IT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY SKIN.  SMELLS GOOD TOO.  I USE THEIR TONER ALSO AND OTHER FACIAL PRODUCTS...LOVE THEM ALL.</li>
    <li> Love how soft this product makes my skin feel! soft and silky. Has a nice soft fragrance. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! Creamy, with mild foaming and non-drying.</li>
    <li> Yes it is a very good cleansing agent that removes dirt and make-up but leaves the skin smooth, not dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter who has problems with acne.  She has tried several other products like Proactive and clean and clear and they have not worked. After trying some of the other anti aging products at the Mall which worked wonderfully I decided to give this a try.  Amazing results after the very first use!  The face wash does not foam as it claims but it does a great job cleansing.  While her acne is not completely cleared up there is a significant difference!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry or oily.  The dead sea minerals are said to have a healing affect and that contributes to the anti aging affects....I also use the eye syrum and cream along with the day and evening moisturizing cream. Love the products! I highly recommend them.  A little goes a long way and it does what it says it will!  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle and makes my skin brighter, without drying it out.  However, I don&#x27;t know why this stuff goes for so much money? The price on amazon is great, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s worth.  The brand itself seems like a scam.</li>
    <li> Very nice facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> one of the best facial cleansers I have found, though the new design of the pump is awkward and only allows a very small amount to be dispensed at a time</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser - very gentle and does not dry my skin. I will continue to use it and see how I like it down the road.</li>
    <li> Maybe the one I got has a defective pump but I&#x27;m not getting any foam. Also dries out my face a little too much.</li>
    <li> The best cleanser I have used.  It does not cause breakouts but leaves the skin soft and smooth.  It lasts a long time because only a small amount is needed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with this. I&#x27;ve purchased it before and loved it. This time, it didn&#x27;t even seem like the same product. It doesn&#x27;t foam at all and it has an off fragrance. In the past, it had a very subtle fragrance and a nice foam to it. I nearly sent it back, but didn&#x27;t want to deal with the extra time involved doing that. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again- at least not from the same company that fulfilled the order.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; as nice as I expected. My skin feels clean after, and I do follow it with the toner (which works well!), but it almost feels more like another cream than a cleaner. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just my impression as it IS cleaning my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser on and off for over a year now and it is by far my favorite. I have sensitive acne prone skin and I&#x27;m in my late 30s. This stuff isn&#x27;t too strong and leaves my skin soft. Non irritating.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Makes skin smooth and soft.</li>
