<ol>
      <li>Just a wonderful product that I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
      <li>Mac has the best brow wax stick</li>
      <li>THIS is the best!  </li>
      <li>This is a *wonderful* product &amp;</li>
      <li>It is wonderful for lines around the mouth to keep lipstick from bleeding.  </li>
      <li>Good price too!</li>
      <li>been using this for 4 years...not easy to find, so when I do I buy 6!!!</li>
      <li>Great product that I hope never gets discontinued.</li>
      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>Great for when you go to bed.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Its not for me but great service</li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>A very nice product for the price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this more as a lip balm and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>It also has a pleasant scent of vanilla and coconut, which I like.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I plan on getting more!</li>
      <li>Actually better than the product I was using before!</li>
      <li>It works amazingly well and minimizes the lines around the lips.</li>
      <li>I found the product years ago, loved it then and love it now.  </li>
      <li>It arrived in great shape and right on time.</li>
      <li>but then dries and feels very light.</li>
      <li>I think it works better than Chapstick.</li>
      <li>I searched many years for an anti-feathering lipstick sealer.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing else out there for the price and there are many products that are significantly more costly - in dolled up packaging - that do not perform.</li>
      <li>but it sure does work well as a lip moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am SO grateful to find more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t feel the love with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far cheaper than most like type products and works great.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light on your lips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years; since I can&#x27;t get it locally any more, I&#x27;m very glad I can find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Especially since it&#x27;s very easy to knock the top off the stick.  </li>
      <li>Great product, especially for the reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used this often, but so far I&#x27;d say it is okay.</li>
      <li>I have tried others that cost 3 times the price, and they don&#x27;t work half as good.</li>
      <li>I ordered this one to make sure it was the same product</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed it working, so much so that I rarely ever use it underneath lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Glad to see the same product still on the market.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>When lipstick is applied over it, the lipstick color seems a bit more sheer than it normally is.  </li>
      <li>This provides a smooth, soft feel that holds your color in place and keeps it vivid all day.</li>
      <li>Lipstick WILL stay on much longer, and will not so easily migrate into the tiny lines around your lips, if you coat your lips first with this very pleasant, lightly fragranced lip base.</li>
      <li>this worked very well for feathering.</li>
      <li>I really love this formulation it goes on rather glossy &amp; wet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing as well.</li>
      <li>Does not work and is very greasy.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work my Mac matte lipsticks still make my lips chapped</li>
      <li>I have used many other products under my lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>It is more moisturizing than I am used to, but it works great when used with a cream foundation over the lip base and a lip pencil to define...</li>
      <li>Keeps lips very soft!</li>
      <li>The container is sturdy enough to last for the life of its contents - although - if anything is going to punk out, it will be the clear outer &amp;#34;top.&amp;#34; I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It was ok i am  not a huge fan of the product</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you let it dry before applying lipstick or your lipstick will look a bit sheer.</li>
      <li>Very soft.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best lipstick base I have ever bought.</li>
      <li>Have been experimenting with cheaper brow wax sticks, so far nothing touches Mac.</li>
      <li>Does make my lips feel soft though</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years, as it is marketed under at least three brands.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent 4 times as much money on the more popular brands and they either made my lips feel dried out, or really sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>This lip base is perfect for keeping your lipstick in place!  </li>
      <li>It is also an excellent lipstick primer, or base.</li>
      <li>My skin gets dryer as I get (shhh) older, and I live in a dry climate to boot.  </li>
      <li>By sheer accident I ran out of this product before I received  new ones and out of desperation tried chapstick type product as primer for lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Not only does this product reduce feathering of lipstick around the lips, but it is a soft balm that keeps your lips soft and supple.  </li>
      <li>Works ok, not great as far as anti-feathering</li>
      <li>Irene Gari Anti-feathering Lip Base is a very good product.</li>

<li> Not only does this product reduce feathering of lipstick around the lips, but it is a soft balm that keeps your lips soft and supple.  </li>
<li> Works ok, not great as far as anti-feathering</li>
<li> Irene Gari Anti-feathering Lip Base is a very good product.</li>
<li> However, this brand is nearly three times the price of the other one I have .  </li>
<li> It works as an undercoat for lipstick and basically keeps the lips from feathering, but not completely.</li>
<li> I had originally used 2 Faced Borderline anti-feathering product &amp; found it dry &amp; waxy and it is REALLY expensive.</li>
<li> I have dry vertical lines on my lips, which cause any lipstick to appear to &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I was looking for something that moisten my very dry lips</li>
<li> I&#x27;m also trying some other new lip products, so it&#x27;s kinda hard to say.</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> Does not have the staying power that I expected and would not re order.</li>
<li> only used it a few times.</li>
<li> I used it in conjunction with other creams but this is the one I carry in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.</li>
<li> As an almost 60 year old who loves dark lipstick I really needed an anti-feathering product, just lipliner did not prevent the ugly vertical lines where the lipstick color would creep out around my mouth.</li>
<li> I love this lip base.  </li>
<li> Buy a half dozen at a time - you&#x27;ll run through them.</li>
<li> It does however, change the look of your lipstick slightly.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mary Kay equivalent but for less than half the price, this product is a WINNER!</li>
<li> Well with a little research I found it in the Amazon Marketplace -- she received all six tubes I purchased and can&#x27;t stop thanking me.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me though as I don&#x27;t always like a heavy lip look anyway.  </li>
<li> It moistens my lips and doesn&#x27;t leave them dried out like Chapstick.</li>
<li> Irene Gari Anti-feathering lip product is a waste of money.  </li>
<li> I have spent months looking for an anti feathering lip base that works, and this one really does the trick.  </li>
<li> This performs well, but it is pricey for the small amount you get.  </li>
<li> No better than chapstick.</li>
<li> It works like no other anti-feathering lip base I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
<li> no more bleeding lipstick!!</li>
<li> Poorly made.</li>
<li> I am sorry I purchased this product.</li>
<li> The lip base broke after a few uses.</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with this product, but it is overpriced and unnecessary, plus you have to wait for delivery!!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I broke the product off at the base.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Saw no difference in how the lipstick stayed on.</li>
    <li> I gave the item 2 stars because I purchased as primer but it doesn&#x27;t work well as a primer. Lipstick didn&#x27;t last any longer than when I don&#x27;t use a primer but it sure does work well as a lip moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this lip base.  It works great and it&#x27;s light on your lips.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I had never used this brand before but it does what it says it will do. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have spent months looking for an anti feathering lip base that works, and this one really does the trick.  It is more moisturizing than I am used to, but it works great when used with a cream foundation over the lip base and a lip pencil to define... no more bleeding lipstick!!</li>
    <li> Irene Gari Anti-feathering lip product is a waste of money.  Does not work and is very greasy.  It&#x27;s like putting on Chap-Stik or a similar product.  I am sorry I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years; since I can&#x27;t get it locally any more, I&#x27;m very glad I can find it on Amazon.  My skin gets dryer as I get (shhh) older, and I live in a dry climate to boot.  This lip base is not just another \\&quot;chapstick\\&quot;; it is creamier and smoother, and lets my lipstick stay where it belongs instead of bleeding.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Had been looking forever for something to prevent lipstick&#x27;s bleeding and finally found it! It works amazingly well and minimizes the lines around the lips.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well and keeps lipstick from fading.</li>
    <li> Makes lipstick look smoother and fuller 😄</li>
    <li> Lipstick WILL stay on much longer, and will not so easily migrate into the tiny lines around your lips, if you coat your lips first with this very pleasant, lightly fragranced lip base. There is nothing else out there for the price and there are many products that are significantly more costly - in dolled up packaging - that do not perform. Buy a half dozen at a time - you&#x27;ll run through them. Also works as a lip balm. Great for when you go to bed. The container is sturdy enough to last for the life of its contents - although - if anything is going to punk out, it will be the clear outer &amp;#34;top.&amp;#34; I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This lip base is perfect for keeping your lipstick in place!  It also has a pleasant scent of vanilla and coconut, which I like.  It does however, change the look of your lipstick slightly.  When lipstick is applied over it, the lipstick color seems a bit more sheer than it normally is.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me though as I don&#x27;t always like a heavy lip look anyway.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing as well.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was in my 40s. Now I&#x27;m in my 60s and it still does the trick.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this product to be anti-feathering for the over forty crowd at all.  However I do like it as a lipstick sealer.  I use a brow wax stick to line the lips to prevent feathering.  That works.  Mac has the best brow wax stick but it is pricy.  Have been experimenting with cheaper brow wax sticks, so far nothing touches Mac.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this more as a lip balm and it&#x27;s perfect. Keeps lips very soft!</li>
    <li> It was ok i am  not a huge fan of the product only used it a few times. Its not for me but great service</li>
    <li> This performs well, but it is pricey for the small amount you get.  Especially since it&#x27;s very easy to knock the top off the stick.  I wish this item contained a hardener so it would withstand the pressure of putting it on my lips.</li>
    <li> It works as an undercoat for lipstick and basically keeps the lips from feathering, but not completely. It&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product reduce feathering of lipstick around the lips, but it is a soft balm that keeps your lips soft and supple.  I wear it beneath lipstick or alone as it&#x27;s colorless.  Just a wonderful product that I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it working, so much so that I rarely ever use it underneath lipstick.  Does make my lips feel soft though</li>
    <li> this worked very well for feathering. would buy again</li>
    <li> 12-13-13  I have used many other products under my lipstick.  THIS is the best!  I use it to keep my lips moist to avoid chapping too. I am SO grateful to find more.  No one else has it anymore.  It arrived in great shape and right on time.</li>
    <li> Does not have the staying power that I expected and would not re order.</li>
    <li> been using this for 4 years...not easy to find, so when I do I buy 6!!! I have tried others that cost 3 times the price, and they don&#x27;t work half as good. Also, it doesn&#x27;t change the color of your lipstick! yeh...keep carrying it, please.</li>
    <li> Does the job and keeps my lipstick from seeping into the lines around my mouth.</li>
    <li> As an almost 60 year old who loves dark lipstick I really needed an anti-feathering product, just lipliner did not prevent the ugly vertical lines where the lipstick color would creep out around my mouth. Irene Gari Anti-feathering Lip Base is a very good product. I had originally used 2 Faced Borderline anti-feathering product &amp; found it dry &amp; waxy and it is REALLY expensive. I tried this because it was inexpensive &amp; came in a lipstick formulation so there was no need for sharpening (therefor wasting) a pencil. I really love this formulation it goes on rather glossy &amp; wet but then dries and feels very light. It works with just lipstick OR with a lipliner &amp; lipstick.I never have to worry about feathering with Irene Gari. Just make sure that you let it dry before applying lipstick or your lipstick will look a bit sheer. If I am in a hurry I just blot before applying my lipstick. This is a *wonderful* product &amp; I plan on getting more!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this often, but so far I&#x27;d say it is okay. I&#x27;m also trying some other new lip products, so it&#x27;s kinda hard to say.</li>
    <li> By sheer accident I ran out of this product before I received  new ones and out of desperation tried chapstick type product as primer for lipstick.  And guess what?  It does the same thing that this stuff does for only a dollar!  Guess I should have made the connection between wax products before, but I did not.  Nothing wrong with this product, but it is overpriced and unnecessary, plus you have to wait for delivery!!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. My lipstick didn&#x27;t last any longer than it would have without this product and it didn&#x27;t prevent feathering either.</li>
    <li> A very nice product for the price.  Keeps my lipstick from feathering.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lipstick base I have ever bought. I&#x27;ve spent 4 times as much money on the more popular brands and they either made my lips feel dried out, or really sticky and uncomfortable. This provides a smooth, soft feel that holds your color in place and keeps it vivid all day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work my Mac matte lipsticks still make my lips chapped</li>
    <li> I searched many years for an anti-feathering lipstick sealer.  I was elated to find this product on Amazon&#x27;s website at such an affordable price.  I have dry vertical lines on my lips, which cause any lipstick to appear to &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34;.  It is also an excellent lipstick primer, or base.</li>
    <li> Terrible. No better than chapstick. The lip base broke after a few uses. Poorly made.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Actually better than the product I was using before!</li>
    <li> does not stop bleeding and feathering at all.</li>
    <li> It really works! Good price too!</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve been using the Mary Kay equivalent but for less than half the price, this product is a WINNER!</li>
    <li> Great I uae it all the time!!  I only wish Sally&#x27;s still sold it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I have to tell you, it not only keeps your lipstick from bleeding, but it also wards off wrinkles around the lips. Great product that I hope never gets discontinued. A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in your cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Helps somewhat, but not as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Works wonders and it&#x27;s only a lipstick sized product.  I used it in conjunction with other creams but this is the one I carry in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Don&#x27;t feel the love with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this! I was looking for something that moisten my very dry lips so I thought I would try this lipstick. I love it! I think it works better than Chapstick. It moistens my lips and doesn&#x27;t leave them dried out like Chapstick. I&#x27;ve ordered twice before and when I use this up I will be back a third time!</li>
    <li> Works ok, not great as far as anti-feathering</li>
    <li> It seems to work.  Never used a product of this sort.  Unfortunately, I broke the product off at the base.  Very soft.  Unlike a tube of lipstick.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again unless I can&#x27;t find similar product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years, as it is marketed under at least three brands.  It is wonderful for lines around the mouth to keep lipstick from bleeding.  However, this brand is nearly three times the price of the other one I have .  I ordered this one to make sure it was the same product and it is.</li>
    <li> I found the product years ago, loved it then and love it now.  It works like no other anti-feathering lip base I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s far cheaper than most like type products and works great.  Glad to see the same product still on the market.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my aunt -- she&#x27;s been using the product for years then couldn&#x27;t find it. Well with a little research I found it in the Amazon Marketplace -- she received all six tubes I purchased and can&#x27;t stop thanking me.</li>
