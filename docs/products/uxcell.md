### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a great way to stimulate your face and massage it using this even if you aren&#x27;t trying to remove blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not noticed a decrease in blackheads, so that was kind of sucky.</li>
      <li>If you already have perfect skin and just want to keep it that way, perhaps this is the facial scrub brush for you.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this :)</li>
      <li>its okay to use this product</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re a man.&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside, I am really pleased with this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better quality than the l&#x27;oreal brush built in to their face wash.</li>
      <li>love product :)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay for my skin type</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>it comes with too, great for really getting in there and removing blackheads.</li>
      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>good to have!!!i love this product, because it is kind of clean my blackhead very well.</li>
      <li>super handy</li>
      <li>This feels great on my skin and clean it thoroughly but gently.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this feels and how clean my face is after using this.</li>
      <li>it makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>Still trying to figure out why I bought this item in the first place!!</li>
      <li>I found one that had 2 light blue ones both the same size, also very cheap but are perfect also from overseas and on amazon.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use and clean</li>
      <li>clean this</li>
      <li>makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Love this little brush it does a really good job</li>
      <li>Buy the generic version of the Buff-Puff, and buy them buy the carton --- it&#x27;s worth the investment if you want good looking skin.</li>
      <li>Or for a quick disinfectant, soak in rubbing alcohol and rinse thoroughly afterwards and let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have pretty oily skin, and use this in the shower with a mild cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I really like the fresh, clean feeling I get after using this product.</li>
      <li>it can clean face daily, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This a a very gentle product for exfoliating.</li>
      <li>If you have less than perfect skin and really want to do some cleaning, I think you will find this brush too gentle and too soft to be of much</li>
      <li>However, my face does feel much cleaner after I use this instead of just my hands, so it kinda makes it worth the money.</li>
      <li>They arrived nicely packaged and when expected.</li>
      <li>Arrives in cute Asian packaging.</li>
      <li>As a side note, I thought I lost the first on</li>
      <li>I recommend them, but be aware they may arrive permanently out of shape, though still usable.</li>
      <li>I just boil hot water and throw this in the pot for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>it did nothing you&#x27;re better off with egg whites and toilet tissue.</li>
      <li>This is a nice little face scrubber that feels good on my face, not too rough but not too soft.</li>
      <li>but i have super sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>These were a little scratchy, but I liked the size and the fact that it had a handle.</li>
      <li>i even use it to wash my makeup brushes versus the  other sigma glove craze and does a magnificent job for waaaay less!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than those sonic sin cleansing machines.</li>
      <li>I really like the mini brush</li>
      <li>Gentle yet robust.</li>
      <li>I really wanted something with longer softer fingers, to Massage my face while I cleanse..</li>
      <li>I feel this amps up my face wash products without spending as much on a clarisonic.</li>
      <li>highly recommend getting this!</li>
      <li>I use it every other day/shower, for a week or so, my skin really does look better.</li>
      <li>It has lasted this long and is still going strong.</li>
      <li>I only use the large one mostly because it&#x27;s easier to hold compared to the tiny one.</li>
      <li>My face gets super red</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t have problems with blackheads, more so than white heads especially my nose and around my mouth area.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not too particular about my skin, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I notice The pores on and around my nose are starting to become a bit more visible, and I occasionally am getting a blackhead here and there, that sometimes, swell a bit.  </li>
      <li>cleansing one&#x27;s face daily as harsh as people now do does not seem healthy or natural this is a great alternative to 3x a week for me and no more.</li>
      <li>(just use a little dial soap) and they make washing my face much more productive.</li>
      <li>I love these little guys.</li>
      <li>Other than that minor annoyance, these are exactly what I expected and the big one does a great job of cleaning my makeup sponge.</li>
      <li>I bought these scrubs to use the big one to help me deep clean my makeup sponge.</li>
      <li>I use the tiny brush for my face and the large one for my body.</li>
      <li>So far, yes, my blackheads have signifcantly reduced.</li>
      <li>like anything silicone, it is flexible and soft.</li>
      <li>Affordable keeps my skin soft</li>
      <li>I have always struggled with acne and this cleansing pad is gentle while exfoliating at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I used the pink one for a couple of weeks before finding my original blue one.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this for a simple clean that doesn&#x27;t buildup bacteria like sponges and other material.</li>
      <li>I had (blue), and bought the pink one because the blue one wasn&#x27;t available.  </li>
      <li>then what i was expecting like big enough to hold and gentle.</li>
      <li>It really seems to open up my pores afterwards, and lets my pores relax, and the oil tends to come out over the next day.  </li>
      <li>i assumed  it came with two large scrublets not one large and one very small one.</li>
      <li>I generally like to exfoliate my face with this but with water only.</li>
      <li>My acne has gotten better over the past few months using this product.</li>

    <li> my skin is luminous, less black heads and what i love is it is not as rough as a clarisonic nor as crazy expensive. cleansing one&#x27;s face daily as harsh as people now do does not seem healthy or natural this is a great alternative to 3x a week for me and no more. only downfall is based on pictures and advertisement i assumed  it came with two large scrublets not one large and one very small one. still im very happy. i even use it to wash my makeup brushes versus the  other sigma glove craze and does a magnificent job for waaaay less!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels and how clean my face is after using this.</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure out why I bought this item in the first place!! Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong or something but its just not working for me!!</li>
    <li> its okay to use this product but it was different then what i was expecting like big enough to hold and gentle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as describe</li>
    <li> it makes my skin feel so smooth. the small one is useless tho.</li>
    <li> This a a very gentle product for exfoliating. I really like the fresh, clean feeling I get after using this product. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This thing helped me brush dead skin (usually around my neck area) and helps prevent acne when I use my facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with acne and this cleansing pad is gentle while exfoliating at the same time.  My acne has gotten better over the past few months using this product.</li>
    <li> makes your skin nice and soft. after i&#x27;m done, i just press&lt;br /&gt;it against the mirror to hold it. super handy</li>
    <li> Love this little brush it does a really good job</li>
    <li> I really wanted something with longer softer fingers, to Massage my face while I cleanse.. These were a little scratchy, but I liked the size and the fact that it had a handle. Back to the Drawing board.</li>
    <li> If you already have perfect skin and just want to keep it that way, perhaps this is the facial scrub brush for you.  If you have less than perfect skin and really want to do some cleaning, I think you will find this brush too gentle and too soft to be of much value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a Buff-Puff type scrubber on my face for years.  I bought this because I thought it might last longer than than the Buff-Puff type scrubber does. I was disappointed.  It would take a lot of scrubbing and a lot of time to see any results with this scrubber (especially in comparison with the Buff-Puff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? Buy the generic version of the Buff-Puff, and buy them buy the carton --- it&#x27;s worth the investment if you want good looking skin.</li>
    <li> Amazed with customer servicea! love product :)</li>
    <li> Arrives in cute Asian packaging. Better quality than the l&#x27;oreal brush built in to their face wash. I really like the mini brush it comes with too, great for really getting in there and removing blackheads.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little face scrubber that feels good on my face, not too rough but not too soft. I use it once a day in the morning and I use the clarisonic mia at night. I use both proactiv system (at night) and carenatural tea tree system (in the morning). So far, yes, my blackheads have signifcantly reduced. I recommend this for a simple clean that doesn&#x27;t buildup bacteria like sponges and other material. I took one star off b/c it doesn&#x27;t stay suctioned to my bathroom mirror and always falls off.</li>
    <li> Terrible, too hard, flimsy, thin and does not work like the others. Threw out. I found one that had 2 light blue ones both the same size, also very cheap but are perfect also from overseas and on amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy so I&#x27;m not too particular about my skin, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I notice The pores on and around my nose are starting to become a bit more visible, and I occasionally am getting a blackhead here and there, that sometimes, swell a bit.  I have pretty oily skin, and use this in the shower with a mild cleanser.  It really seems to open up my pores afterwards, and lets my pores relax, and the oil tends to come out over the next day.  As a side note, I thought I lost the first on I had (blue), and bought the pink one because the blue one wasn&#x27;t available.  I used the pink one for a couple of weeks before finding my original blue one.  I noticed that using the blue one allows me to retain my manliness better.&lt;br /&gt; Just FYI if you&#x27;re a man.&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside, I am really pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;If I use it every other day/shower, for a week or so, my skin really does look better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleansing pad for 2-3 years now. I heard about it from a Chinese lady on youtube. It got rid of my stubborn cystic acne that takes months to go away. It&#x27;s much cheaper than those sonic sin cleansing machines. I usually use it 3 times a week (can be used daily but i have super sensitive skin). I replace it every couple of months. Everybody should try it!</li>
    <li> Affordable keeps my skin soft</li>
    <li> Takes  awhile to received. I use these daily. Love them.</li>
    <li> it can clean face daily, and easy to use. good to have!!!i love this product, because it is kind of clean my blackhead very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 1\2 years. It has lasted this long and is still going strong. I only use the large one mostly because it&#x27;s easier to hold compared to the tiny one. Using the tiny one is like pinching your pointer and thumb together and trying to scrub with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like anything silicone, it is flexible and soft. I generally like to exfoliate my face with this but with water only. I do not use this every day. And I don&#x27;t have problems with blackheads, more so than white heads especially my nose and around my mouth area. I can use this little beauty to scrub those areas without being to abrasive on my skin. And let me tell you, I scrub with a purpose! My face gets super red but it&#x27;s okay for my skin type and I know it doesn&#x27;t damage my skin. I have oily prone skin. If you really think about it, why would you want to scrub something very harsh on your face?? You can definitely see the dirt and grime from your face in the pad. It&#x27;s also a great way to stimulate your face and massage it using this even if you aren&#x27;t trying to remove blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean this I just boil hot water and throw this in the pot for 5 minutes. Or for a quick disinfectant, soak in rubbing alcohol and rinse thoroughly afterwards and let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend getting this!</li>
    <li> I have used this for several weeks now. I have not noticed a decrease in blackheads, so that was kind of sucky. However, my face does feel much cleaner after I use this instead of just my hands, so it kinda makes it worth the money.</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference in my skin once i threw this into my skincare routine, i have oily acne prone skin btw! i love this product. I would recommend this :)</li>
    <li> it did nothing you&#x27;re better off with egg whites and toilet tissue. I feel like it might clog the pores deeper since you try so hard to scrub to get something out but it does not work</li>
    <li> This feels great on my skin and clean it thoroughly but gently.  The downside is that the handle is so flexible and thin that is feels fragile and is hard to hold onto.</li>
    <li> Takes of the dead cells and massages the face.</li>
    <li> I love these little guys. Super easy to use and clean (just use a little dial soap) and they make washing my face much more productive. I wouldn&#x27;t say my blackheads are gone but I exfoliate much less often and they have minimized. I feel this amps up my face wash products without spending as much on a clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Gentle yet robust. I use the tiny brush for my face and the large one for my body.</li>
    <li> I bought these scrubs to use the big one to help me deep clean my makeup sponge. They arrived nicely packaged and when expected. My only complaint is that the bigger pad arrived bent inside the package, and it will not unbend despite my attempts. This means I have to hold it un-bent when I use it. Other than that minor annoyance, these are exactly what I expected and the big one does a great job of cleaning my makeup sponge. I recommend them, but be aware they may arrive permanently out of shape, though still usable.</li>
