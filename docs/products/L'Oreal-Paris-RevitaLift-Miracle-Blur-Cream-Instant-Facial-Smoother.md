      <li>It&#x27;s good...</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s really good about this product.</li>
      <li>The consistency does not feel good.</li>
      <li>and I was told I looked really good.</li>
      <li>I can wear it with a tinted moisturizer or foundation over it and it will mattify it, and I can also wear it alone and it looks really good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not happy with results. I could not see a difference and it was hard in the tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it first became available and can attest to how completely it truly does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; wrinkles and lines on my face producing a more youthful, almost dewy look. Applying foundation over the product leaves my skin looking much younger and smoother. Great for dry, mature skin!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would work better than it did, but I have a few deep wrinkles so I guess I will have to get Botoxed.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I&#x27;m 50+ and the very first day I used this I was given compliments. That is the only thing I changed.</li>
    <li> Very greasy and thick.  Did not seem to cover anything.</li>
    <li> I had heard about &#x27;blur&#x27;cream but was obviously sceptical. When I tries it first time my friends noticed the difference straight away. It does seem to work. It has a cushiony effect which does &#x27;blur&#x27; the skin and refines fine lines. I would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It really does lift the fine lines and close pores, its like magic! It feels smooth on the face...Really really great if you have dry skin it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Seems dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Came half full in the tube and very hard to squeeze out.  Packaging seemed in tact.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing in my skin/makeup routine. Really blurs imperfections.</li>
    <li> What miracle?  There is nothing miracle about this product.  It&#x27;s an overpriced sunscreen with the consistence of spackle.  Goes on thick and pills when you try to apply any other facial products.  Do yourself a favor, save your money and purchase a better sunscreen.</li>
    <li> The product is great, but the problem is with the packaging.  After a very short time (after about 10 days of use) it was impossible to squeeze anymore product out of the tude.  I decided to cut the tube open and discovered approximately 3+ weeks more product still in the tube.  I continued to use the product, but as it was exposed to the air it was drying out a little each day.  This is very, very poor design, and not at all consumer friendly.</li>
    <li> First, this item is pricy and not sure it&#x27;s anti-aging? However, I tested it and It does make me look younger a little.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it&#x27;s not pyschology effect. I&#x27;m sure my skin look smoother on mirror, I received several compliment from friends &amp; coworkers lately&lt;br /&gt;and probably it has to do with it. I will provide more updates in coming months.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about Miracle Blur and decided to try it for myself. I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and saw/felt a difference in my skin almost right away after using a very small amount. My foundation lasts a lot longer with less touch ups and my skin feels soft and smooth. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great stuff, I am 68 and it has worked wonderfully on my lines, not so on wrinkles but they have been there a few years. My skin look fresher and even hubby has noticed the difference. Wonderful I am really pleased with the cream, feel nice as well. I use it before putting on make up and makes my skin feel sort and smooth, would recommend it to anyone. Great</li>
    <li> Primer before makeup. Very good but prefer Olay Regenerist primer</li>
    <li> I like this product, but i don&#x27;t know why it makes my skin oily -__-</li>
    <li> Just work for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> This works great to hide fine lines and makes the pores just about disappear.  It is also a good sun block.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good... just wish I actually saw results.</li>
    <li> I use this under foundation and it&#x27;s great.  I will continue using it again and again.  The only criticism I have is the tube it comes in.  It&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
    <li> female friend loved it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really see that it makes much difference for me.  Not my favorite Loreal product and a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> Meh. Sorry that&#x27;s my response. I have a few permanent blemishes from some acne scarring and have been looking for products which will lesson their appearance and texture. This product basically just covers over everything and provides the base layer for makeup. Any decent primer will do the same thing. I also didn&#x27;t like the feel. It isn&#x27;t a heavy or greasy product, but the texture ends up feeling very odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again because it didn&#x27;t really accomplish my expectations.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin and need a mattifying primer with good sunscreen SPF, this product is perfect.  I have tried the oil-free version as well which has no SPF, but ultimately prefer this one which has a small amount of oil that does not create shine.  I had been using monistat anti-chafing gel or the lanacane anti-chafe gel before, but the anti-chafe gels had some issues, most notibly that they would pill on touch and thereafter make it look like I had dead skin residue on my face, neck, or clothes.  That is because those gels contain talc, which this product does not contain.  The anti-chafing gels obviously do not offer sun protection, since they are not designed for exposed skin, and so I had to apply sunscreen first, and carry two items instead of just one.  Miracleblur with SPF has thus saved me a lot of time and frustration, doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly white pallor like many other expensive primers with titanium dioxide SPF, keeps me looking alive and not like skin-shedding zombie, and thankfully is available through subscribe and save through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product, i was surprised at how well this product works after trying a different brand and being so disappointed, I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It will minimize the appearance of fine line and pores for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  It came out like dried silicone and couldn&#x27;t even put it on my face as it just crumbled between my fingers and my face.  Maybe it dries out before it&#x27;s purchased.  The tube it comes in is so cumbersome to use and seems to be more air than product.  Maybe that&#x27;s why it is all dried out.  I threw the box away, but I have my receipt and I&#x27;m returning it...</li>
    <li> This is an awesome facial cream that I purchased at a very low price. This facial cream is wonderful on the skin and makes it feel very soft while reducing fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;The price was great with super fast shipping</li>
    <li> I was expecting more &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; with this product than I got. I use it over my usual moisturizer. I&#x27;m 66 with pretty good skin but was hoping for more fading of small lines and reddish spots. I have other primers I like better for fading out small lines and reddish spots. It does leave your skin smooth and protected and no irritation on my sensitive skin. When I use it I follow up with a tinted cc cream and then it works well.</li>
    <li> This way too thick and tacky for me. I tried it under my make up and then I tried it over my  make up in my troubled areas and it just never seemed to work for me.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what to say about this since I’m no expert but I see nothing that I can really complain about with this.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel greasy.  I purchased the product in hopes to use it as an alternative to foundation, as I don&#x27;t like the heavy feeling of my face, but it didn&#x27;t really work out.  In fairness, I do have oily skin and I don&#x27;t typically wear products on a daily basis, so perhaps I just wasn&#x27;t used to the feeling of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product... Feels great and keeps my make up neat and fresh.  It will be part of my make up regiment...</li>
    <li> OMG, people, I cannot believe that anyone has a bad word to say about this truly &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product! I first heard about it on the fourth hour of the Today Show with &amp;#34;Kathie Lee and Hoda,&amp;#34; as an amazing new product, and it TOTALLY is! I am 63-years old; I have age and sun-related wrinkles, as well as large pores. As some other reviews here have said, this product is rather-like a spackle that reduces the appearance of pores and wrinkles, better than ANY product I have ever used in my life! I was so impressed, I shared it with my 25-year old daughter to try (I felt compelled to share with SOMEone,  but not necessarily someone my own age ;-). She was, of course, dubious at first, but once she tried it on a section of her face, she proceeded to use it all over and said, &amp;#34;Wow, I look like a teenager again!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough about this product. It is, indeed a miracle, and I have already ordered/bought all of the other products offered in the Miracle Blur Cream line!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Not greasy at all. However it is dificult getting out of the tube, even for me and I am under 30 and have no joint issues. The lack of the 5th star is due to the packaging.</li>
    <li> I tried this, I noticed immediately a difference between both sides of my face....then I started to chuckle about the skit Cheech and Chong did......I&#x27;m at that age where putty and sandpaper are needed......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be on the thicker side....but so is putty and plaster.  What do you expect?  If you are younger and concerned with fine lines, then use Clarins Perfecting Touch or another lighter primer.  This, I feel, is for a more mature skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!  I have HUGE pores, and this acted like a spackle to fill them in - in a good way!  It&#x27;s not something I wear every day - only when I go out with full make-up (mineral powder base).  The consistency is very similar to a few other primers I&#x27;ve used, but I like this one the best.  It is pricey, but since I&#x27;m not using it a lot, I&#x27;m fine with the cost.  I will definitely buy more - I like this a lot, and I love the way it makes my skin look.  (BTW, 54 yrs old, mild wrinkles, and HUGE pores)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on buying loads of beauty products but i read a review of this in a magazine and felt compelled to buy. I can&#x27;t explain how it works, but it does.</li>
    <li> No time for all the questions</li>
    <li> I would not recommend or purchase again. Its very greasy I might have smeared Crisco on my face &amp; I couldn&#x27;t tell it masked lines or imperfections. Total waste of money I threw it away after a few uses</li>
    <li> No difference.  Won&#x27;t buy it again. It made no difference in my skin. I won&#x27;t buy it again. Won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best item I have used.  It makes my skin look smooth and soft, literally &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34; of all oiliness, wrinkles and also gives a smooth beginning for foundation. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I am a very tough crictic wheb it comes to my face hair and nails. This product is exactly what it says it would...instantlyaand then gradually reduces the look of fine lines the more you use it. I believe most on here uses the product incorrectly. You nee  to use it as follows as over the aast 3 months of using it i did see some change in my face:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. do your normal face regiment - toner moisturizer first. Remember this product not a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. apply sparingly to create a silky layer on your skin almost like cashmere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. No primer necessary...apply your makeup a  usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my make up easier to remove. My pores are not filled wihh makeup since it is not directly applied to my skin. Ladies it is really only meant to make your skin feel like satin. Dont expect it to.moisturize...it is a great product unfairly critized.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin look amazing, but it has an odd side-effect: when I&#x27;m washing my hands afterward (or washing it off my face), it immediately gets rid of all the lather in soap. It happens if I use bar soap, hand soap, or foaming soap. It&#x27;s bizarre! But it does make my skin look nice, so it&#x27;s worth the minor hand-washing trouble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used for a few days, but I do not see any effect on my (pretty good) 53 yo skin. Note that I do not wear makeup. I&#x27;m using this over my moisturizer. I am not unrealistic - I was hoping for a little bit of a smoothing action, but don&#x27;t see that. Additionally, I find this product greasy (wish I had bought the oil-free version) and sticky. I will continue to use and report back if my opinion changes.  Well, my teenage daughter just asked, unsolicited, about my (now visible) pores. I have tight pores, but apparently this product makes my pores more obvious?  **Update - Still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great, but I found a technique for managing the sticky/greasiness of the product. Before you open the lid to apply the product, repeatedly squeeze the contents &amp;#34;up and down&amp;#34; to mix the ingredients. You&#x27;ll get a more consistent product in your hand.</li>
    <li> Well, I feel totally ripped off. I used to be pretty faithful to L&#x27;Oreal skin products, but no more. This is described as a &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; product that &amp;#34;instantly blurs fine lines&amp;#34; etc. THAT&#x27;S NOT WHAT IT IS. This is a sunscreen and ONLY a sunscreen. Thank you, no. I already had a perfectly fine--in fact, much better--sunscreen product for my face and I didn&#x27;t need this $13 ripoff representing itself as something else. Product arrives. I&#x27;m fresh from the shower and it&#x27;s no-make-up day, so I put it on my face and neck. It has the consistency of vaseline and I find that unpleasant, but hey, &amp;#34;instantly blurs fine lines,&amp;#34; so what the heck. I turn the bottle over and read the Active Ingredients list and everyone of them has &amp;#34;Purpose: sunscreen.&amp;#34; What? So, I fish the box out of the trash and read it, looking for retinol which I believe is the only FDA-approved wrinkle solution. Not listed on the ingredients on the box either. What I do see listed is dimethicone. This is a comedogenic. It clogs pores. Why would I put that on my face? Well, I won&#x27;t. So, I was duped into buying a sunscreen I do not need and with ingredients that I will not put on my skin. A $13 bottle of uselessness going right in the trash.</li>
    <li> After seeing the commercial I wanted to try it.  Happy I did, went on very smoothly over my moisturizer and  better then a regular primer. It covers the imperfections! I had previously used \\&quot;Loreal Studio Secret\\&quot; a primer. I didn&#x27;t care for the texture of the product, it felt grainy.  So, now I will stay with Miracle Blur. Some products work for some people and others just don&#x27;t. Really surprised at the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 months and love it for the fact that when I wear it I feel I don&#x27;t need to wear regular face makeup.  It takes away the shininess I usually have and give me more of a matte look.  Plus it REALLY minimizes my fine wrinkles.  The only down side is it doesn&#x27;t really absorb in but stays on top of your skin so it can be &#x27;greasy&#x27; feeling pretty much most of the day.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me much but thought I would mention it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this instead of the instant freeze pen.  I can&#x27;t say it works as well, but it&#x27;s much cheaper and feels great going on.</li>
    <li> So when I was 6 I was bitten by a dog on the face and now many (many) years later, as my skin has changed, the scar has become more pronounced and it has begun to really bother me.  I don&#x27;t like heavy makeup, but no amount of makeup helped cover the scaring from the sutures.  I tried various filler type products and nothing worked well until the Miracle Blur.  I am at an age where I like the regular version, but they have an oil free.  I always use sunscreen and like that it offers another layer of SPF 30.  The product has no tint to it, it has a very velvety feel not at all heavy.  It does not cover up anything like freckles, marks or discoloration at least I don&#x27;t find that it does; but using it as a primer, after my moisturizer and sunscreen and before either my foundation or Mineral powder it seems to fill in the indentations in my skin enough that they don&#x27;t jump out at me anymore.  They are still there, but as the name says they are &amp;#34;blurred&amp;#34;. I gave it four stars only because the product comes in such a small amount and is $27.00 retail.  Amazon is really the best place to get it auto delivery!  If you are trying to cover up freckles or a birthmark etc..I don&#x27;t think it would be the right thing but if you want to soften what you have, blur it, then you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because this got mediocre ratings.  And I am ALL about the ratings.  I tried it after I noticed they added sunscreen to it.  I am negligent about putting sunscreen and makeup on every day, so when they combined the two I thought I might be more motivated.  I am.  It helps.  It&#x27;s not foundation and it&#x27;s definitley not &#x27;a miracle&#x27;, but it does matte out the blemishes a little .  It&#x27;s reminds me of a &#x27;primer&#x27;.  It&#x27;s worth having if you don&#x27;t like heavy makeup.  I bought one for my BFF and would buy again for myself.</li>
    <li> I dont see what all the fuss is about. My face looked the same after using it. The cream is thick and it made my face feel kinda heavy. I think the only pro is that there is sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer who likes this a lot, says to use a pea size dollop, and rub it in well. I then let it \\&quot;set\\&quot; for a couple minutes and follow with a tinted moisturizer. This product works so well as a primer, and skin refinisher that I don&#x27;t use foundation anymore. Tinted moisturizer on top of this works fine. Thank you L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim only bc my local Acme had it on sale for 50% off ($9.99) but I instantly fell in love with it! It&#x27;s so smooth that I barely feel like I&#x27;m putting anything on my face! I actually came here just to write a review bc I liked it that much and I read a few reviews saying how people thought it felt so greasy that they couldn&#x27;t even use it as a SPF hand cream. Well a few days after I bought it, I tried a sample of it in Walgreens and it was much different than the one I just bought, then I noticed that it had SPF in it (mine did not!) So I&#x27;m assuming that the people who said it was very greasy must&#x27;ve been using the SPF one bc it definitely was very thick and greasy feeling...I even had trouble washing it off my hands!</li>
    <li> LOVED THIS!!! I&#x27;m 41, so when I don&#x27;t wear make up, I hear how &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; I look, but as soon as I put this on, it took the &amp;#34;tiredness&amp;#34; away, as wells taking years off, instantly. It&#x27;s not like anything I&#x27;ve ever used before, it has a very pasty, filler type of consistency but it works so well!!!! I need a lifetime supply!!! Lol!</li>
    <li> Works some what but still looking for a miracle! Needs to b more like plaster to take care of my problems, but thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I really like this cream or not leaves a different feel to my skin and changes the appearance of the texture and I am not sure if it is for the better or not...verdict still out on this one.</li>
    <li> This really works!! Makes disappear almost. I use after foundation, rub in my hand to warm for easier application. You only need a pea size drop to put on problem areas. I will always use this from now on.</li>
    <li> Should be charged with unfair advertising. There was no mircle. It was nothing more than expensive sun screen.  Face was left sticky.  It was hard to get out of tube and did not go on smooth. If I could give less than a 1 star I would.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because it is mainly just a sunscreen.  My eyebrow pencil runs when I use this product so after a few uses I decided not to use it anymore.  I find better results using another sunscreen.  Also the claim that it minimizes pores, I think is false.  It was a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Magnified my pores and was pasty.  It was hard to smooth my makeup&lt;br /&gt;on over it, I now carry it in my car and use it for a sunscreen on my hands.</li>
    <li> No, this does not do what it claims.,  not worth the money. It doesn&#x27;t hide any inperfections as it claims.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product but more for older skin with wrinkles or large pores. It seems to do the trick for me and I&#x27;m 55 yrs old.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Nothing but surgery can lift as much as these product promise, but I definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Miracle Blur for several years now and it definitely makes my skin look better and feel softer.  I use it in the mornings underneath my foundation.  If I run out and don&#x27;t use it for a week, I will definitely notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I purchased it, I got the tube with the SPF30 because I like to spend a lot of time in the sun during the summer.  that was a mistake.  I do not like this formula and prefer the original.  It is thicker and doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly and makes my face feel greasy.  I ended up putting this tube in my beach bag and I am using it for a very expensive sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I switched to the RevitaLift Double Lifting Gel for my face (amazon carries it) and I like it a lot better.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal!  Other products I&#x27;ve purchased from this company have been very good and that is why I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase the RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream.  It does nothing on my skin to make it appear smoother or less wrinkled.  In addition, it is like a thick paste and very difficult to dispense from the tube.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff!  Shame on you L&#x27;Oreal for marketing this very poor product!</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple of weeks and notice it clogged my pores. Beware use a base before putting this on.</li>
    <li> I am truly puzzled about the fact that L&#x27;oreal takes sunscreens, puts them in a little tube, charges a premium price for it and calls it a Miracle blur wrinkle cream. I wish that someone could explain to me how a SUNSCREEN can become a WRINKLE cream.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! Works extremely well!! Will buy more once I&#x27;m done with this tube.</li>
    <li> Goodbye wrinkles! Great coverage filling in lines. Doesn&#x27;t seem cake-like.</li>
    <li> Bought it to cover some deep surgery scars on my face, as well as aging lines.  Fills in well and is basically invisible.  Will come off easily if you rub your face.  Don&#x27;t dust makeup powder over the top, or it shows badly!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but has lasted me for months with daily application, so probably worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin and its very thick, it doesn&#x27;t glide on. Maybe I need to try the oil-free.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money.  Very disappointed.  Thick, slick, and Philly when you try to put makeup over it.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I just use moisturizer during the day, and a nightcream, especially round my eyes - and that&#x27;s how I use the Miracle Blur. It&#x27;s really nice and thick compared to other eye creams that I often find way too thin (plus usually expensive). During the day I put just a tiny little bit round my eyes over my usual moisturizer and dab it really well, then use concealer. At night, after cleaning, put some more on, just round my eyes. It has a 30 SPF factor, which is a nice extra and something ALL daycreams should have these days. Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve seen so far, with $19.99 in Target. Other products I use are Origins and Nivea - don&#x27;t really go for the expensive stuff. (age: 51)</li>
    <li> Within hours of enthusiastically applying Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream, my skin broke out horribly. Huge zits in previously clear skin. It clogged every pore. Huge painful zits underneath the skin surface. Lots of whiteheads across the chin, forehead and sides of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package said I would get a &amp;#34;younger look.&amp;#34; And I did. I looked like an acne-plagued adolescent. Not exactly the look I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied hot compresses and my daughter&#x27;s acne medicine mixed with neosporin, and skin is calming down. But after this disappointing experience, I&#x27;ll stick with my wrinkles!</li>
    <li> It came opened and used.  I&#x27;m not spending the money to return it, but I&#x27;m very unhappy.  No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> While this product did \\&quot;blur\\&quot; my skin and smooth it out as promised, it also made my skin dull and lifeless looking.  I tried it twice under two different foundations and both times I ended up washing my face and starting over without Miracle Blur.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in product. Haven&#x27;t used it but one time since I received it. It is sitting in my bathroom cabinet and will probably be tossed out.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased 2 times.  I really love this product.  It is a heavy duty primer.  It makes my skin so smooth.  I don&#x27;t have to wear any foundation with this.  I just apply after my moisturiser and then apply a small amount of clear powder to set.  It says fresh all day.  I am 51 and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, and this does seem to smooth my face, especially around the eye area.  I have oily skin and this controls oil all day.  I have not had any breakouts.  I love this product and  hope that L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t discontinue it.  This is a must have beauty product for me.  My only complaint is the packaging.  It is hard to get out of the tube.</li>
    <li> Got the product and it&#x27;s too hard pest. Cream Doesn&#x27;t come out. So I have to cut from bottom to use it. May be old product&lt;br /&gt;Not a good experience.  I bought from cvs that was great</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see that it seems to reduce lines or discoloration</li>
    <li> I got the oil free version of Miracle Blur and it does absolutely nothing on my skin.  I&#x27;ve read alot of reviews saying it&#x27;s thick like a paste, but mine is clear and more like a gel so I&#x27;m wondering if the oil free version just doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Either way, this product doesn&#x27;t do what it says, not even close.</li>
    <li> Amazing how it makes your skin look airbrushed. A little goes a long way - it can feel caked on.</li>
    <li> I got a sample and decided to try it out. I put it on half my face under my usual makeup, the other half my face I just did my makeup normally. It does have an unusual consistency and does goes on pasty. I looked at the half of my face before I even applied makeup and it did make my skin look better. I have the kind of skin that has a lot of imperfections so I never fooled myself into thinking I couldn&#x27;t wear foundation so I applied my makeup normally. I could definitely see a difference. When I took off my makeup later that night I could still see a difference. I think that this may be a good product to wear during winter months when my skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> First of all the container only seemed to be half full, so ran out VERY quickly.  It does seem to help the look of my skin somewhat but not nearly what I had expected or hoped for.  Maybe I am beyond help at that level.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis because the results are not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> It does an okay job at \\&quot;blurring\\&quot; out my pores but it stinks terribly.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off my face!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all!  I am 36 and have a smooth complexion and was hoping to maybe lessen my pores a bit.  This stuff is just like a wax that does absolutely nothing but make me look waxy!  I purchased it even after reading negative reviews because I wanted to give the product the benefit of the doubt.  I don&#x27;t typically like L&#x27;Oreal products anyway so this didn&#x27;t surprise me.  I will stick with my current drugstore brand primer that does the trick much better than this expensive product claims to do.</li>
    <li> Not sure it really does anything, your skin feels soft to touch when wear it but no great fix for a 58 year old woman..</li>
    <li> This product is great. A little goes a long way I would recommend this product for anyone!! Great product :)</li>
    <li> I like the way it goes on but not how it feels ON my skin, especially after a few hours. It sort of feels &#x27;grainy&#x27; then. I like that it is a good pore &#x27;filler&#x27; and makes makeup base spread on nicer over large pores. It does get a bit greasy looking after awhile which I don&#x27;t like but that happens to me with pretty much any foundation. My question is has anyone noticed their pores seeming to enlarge while using this product? Or did you notice &#x27;bumpy skin&#x27; being a problem? Both have appeared after having used the product a few times. I&#x27;m so unsure as to whether continue using it or stopping all together.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have what I&#x27;d call sensitive skin but I broke out in hives 3 times thinking maybe caused by anxiety/stress. It really was like an itchy sunburn but I hadn&#x27;t been in the sun or wind so after it looking up my conclusion was hives. I got it at Wallyworld not here.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is the best primer I have ever used. Before make up it makes it go on flawlessly. No make up? Your skin looks like velvet. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Mini photo shop blur ability. Only downfall is can make you feel slightly shine but then again I don&#x27;t use powder.</li>
    <li> First i was apprehensive after reading some of the comments here.  It was on sale and i was curious.  This stuff is amazing.  I am 43 years old, and let&#x27;s just say i have good genes.  I have a few wrinkles on my lower forehead, ( doesnt everyone my age) and this stuff is wonderful!  obviously its a temporary fix, but i&#x27;ll take it.  It sure beats botox or any other chemical out there or even plastic surgery.  My skin is very dry, and this does not cake on.  I apply it after my BB cream and it is wonderful.  Anyone who expects a facelift from a cream shouldnt even bother writing a review.  It&#x27;s temporary and wonderul.  Blur&#x27;s out the fine lines.  Love it and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This miracle sun screen and base cream glides on easily and makes your foundation appear flawless.&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks pourless and you look photo shopped in broad day light. Don&#x27;t know how I survived before&lt;br /&gt;discovering this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;d do exactly what I expected, but still great.  I will definately get the oil free though next time.  More of a mattifier, but definately helps blur scars and blotchy skin patches.</li>
    <li> Not nuts about this product.  I goes on thick and pasty, and it feels heavy.  Makeup coverage over it is less than ideal -  overall not a great fit for me.</li>
    <li> Its just okay.  Probably would not order again.  I Dont hate it but not sure if really does anything either.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it as a base for make-up and am very pleased! I recommend it strongly to all ladies who wants to look good for longer!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product in the mail, used it, liked it and decided to buy the product. It does exactly what it says it does and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I tried the sample and then purchased the product, without the cream.....just the blur.  I LOVE it.  It did not react with my skin as a lot of products  do, ot is not noticeable......I put it over my moisturizer and under my Mistura finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it.  Also, I only use it in my problem places, not all over.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> No I didn&#x27;t purchase on Amazon-I FORGOT to look --and I wish I had--I paid DOUBLE in the store!!&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the reviews I truly had MAJOR expectations for this product - but I REALLY consider it a MAJOR FLOP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following directions to the letter and using a very small amount of product---it remains EXTREMELY greasy on my face and never loses that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly I see nothing---NARY a thing has changed or \\&quot;blurred\\&quot; on my face - I think people who think they actually \\&quot;see\\&quot; some sort of improvement are just buying into the hype, as I DID, purchasing it. Also-as a side note (I should have read MORE reviews) it makes my eyes STING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend this product nor will I continue using it&lt;br /&gt;Sorry L&#x27;Oreal-I really love your products-just NOT this one!</li>
    <li> It was old and dried up&lt;br /&gt; I won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other primers that are better</li>
    <li> Does NOT work, do not waste your money. Peels off after you put foundation on. After you put this on alone it leaves a heavy white film on your face which peels away. JUNK!</li>
    <li> Miracle Blur is fantastic! My pores and imperfections disappeared. I would have given it 5 stars if the fragrance was more appealing</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;It is just like the Revitalift. I didn&#x27;t see anything different. I thought it was stronger than the ordinary cream but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I too, do not understand the negative reviews.  Used sparingly it makes a tremendous difference on how well my makeup stays for the day and does what it says \\&quot;Blur\\&quot; the lines and pores.  Love it</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about three weeks ago.  I am fifty one and have some fine lines on the side of my mouth, on my forehead and under my eyes.  My pores on my nose is also noticeable.  I use this product both morning and night.  I have to say my skin looks amazing.  I first put on my undereye cream, then my oil of olay face serum, then my oil of olay face cream, then the miracle blur.  My little bumps that I have had on my forhead, they are not pimples, but something else have slowly disappeared.  I have not had to wear any foundation or face powder because my skin just looks flawless.  My skin is so soft after the product sinks in and the lines on my face are blurred.  My pores completely disappear after use.  I am blessed with good skin to begin with but this product has done an amazing job giving me a healthy glow.  I just went out and bought a couple more bottles so I have it in stock.  Oh and when I bought this product, I was thinking &amp;#34;Yea, Yea, just another product that is not going to work.&amp;#34;  Well I am glad I bought it, now I do not think I could live without it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little like a mild face plaster. I mean, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re really doing, is plastering in the fine wrinkles. you&#x27;re face feels a bit tight when you&#x27;re done - use sparingly, and I wasn&#x27;t amazed by the results.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this is another pie in the sky item that doesn&#x27;t do anything except feel greasy and thick</li>
    <li> The first hint I had that this product was really great was when my cousin who is 10 years younger than myself commented \\&quot;Why is it that I am 10 years younger than you, but your skin makes you look younger than me? What do you use?\\&quot; My first thought was that I stopped sunbathing a long time ago and that I always use sunscreen--spf50. So, that&#x27;s what I told her. Then I recalled that I had just begun to use the Miracle Blur product. I have to say that I love it. I have no idea what a primer \\&quot;should\\&quot; do, but as far as I am concerned, this product really does it all. It is not cakey, it&#x27;s a great sunscreen and it really does blur fine lines for me, and I am 60! I am not sure what others were expecting, but I don&#x27;t know how much more you can ask of one product. Oh, yes...almost forgot...I can wear it with a tinted moisturizer or foundation over it and it will mattify it, and I can also wear it alone and it looks really good. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> i would use this as an 6 to 8 hour wear primer, i know some people would compare this to the pore fessional from benefit but i cant because i havent tried that&lt;br /&gt;*i am oily to combination skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-i personally dont like the feeling of this primer after applying it to my face, my fingers still like i still have product on them maybe because its really smooth&lt;br /&gt;- i also dont like how hard it is to squeeze the product out of the tube&lt;br /&gt;- after those hours i do get really oily on my nose and my chin gets quit cakey , and so do my smile lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*the pore filling aspect of this is not quit as a miracle but it does blur some of them out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- i do like the packaging&lt;br /&gt;- i like this an an everyday primer,has a lasting power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*do not like the price its expensive for something in the drugstore&lt;br /&gt;but the shipping only took two days thanks to PRIME</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Balls up on your face and looks terrible.</li>
    <li> It does fill in a little bit but that is more than any other primers do...also it really does make your pores look smaller...also has a good sun block and your foundation looks better....you can&#x27;t beat it for the price</li>
    <li> This is an excellent under makeup skin smoother. Makes skin feel softer than before use. Can be worn alone or under make up.</li>
    <li> Somebody said it&#x27;s like spackle for the face.  It&#x27;s true, but I say that with a smile.  I got a sample in a magazine and dabbed it into a few of the deepest crevices on my face.  Sure enough, within a couple of minutes, they looked softer. I immediately ordered some from Amazon. This morning I&#x27;m using it over moisturizer, but with no foundation at all.  I put it on a couple of minutes ago and went back to check the mirror and everything is nicely diffused - including some red splotches (Rosacea.)  Tomorrow I&#x27;ll experiment with foundation over it - imagining a much closer-to-smooth look than I usually have.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  It&#x27;s a beauty treatment and science experiment all in one tube.</li>
    <li> YES I LIKE IT VERY MUCH. IT WAS REALLY WORTH THE PRICE AND I SHALL BUY MORE WHEN TIME COMES</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all. Very greasy feeling, felt very thick on my face. It did nothing to decrease the appearance of lines on my face. Total wast of $20.00</li>
    <li> I saw no change but works for primer</li>
    <li> I am 46, have super fair, super sensitive skin. This is the first sunscreen I have used ever to hat does&#x27;t burn my skin and turn it beet red and/or give me a rash. It is strange stuff, but I like it! I don&#x27;t wear make up or lotion, just this, and I like how it mattifies my skin like I am wearing powder. I do not think it really does much for my wrinkles or pores, but it does not make them any worse. Like another reviewer said, cut the tube in half when you cannot squeeze anymore out because there will be another 2 to 3 weeks worth in there.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing. Im only 30, with minor issues, and it did nothing for my lines. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this has truly been a miracle product for me. Tried it, mostly to use as a primer, and was pleased with the results. Liked the normal formula but really like the oil-free formula, since I have oily skin. It worked as well as any primer I had spent $50 on at Sephora and less than half the price. So good primer at a cheaper price, I was happy. After awhile started noticing my skin was smoother and more even - a nice extra bonus. After a couple of months of use, I am shocked that it has truly, almost completely, evened out a major furrow in my brow. I&#x27;m talking big-time, dramatic, nasty furrow. That has only previously gone away with botox! It&#x27;s been two years since I did botox - it was kind of scary and expensive - so I had just made peace with the fact at age 41, I had a deep brow furrow. But not anymore! Again, everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I highly, highly recommend you buy this product and keep using it. I definitely saw some results in a few weeks but it probably wasn&#x27;t until my second tube that major changes started happening. So keep with it and see what happens!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at this product which is sold as sunscreen. It does exactly what the name implies. It is a &amp;#34;miracle blur&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s almost as though you are looking at your face through a soft focus lens! I love it!</li>
    <li> Evens out your skin tone so you look like you&#x27;re wearing foundation when you&#x27;re not. I love this stuff. Recommended for ladies who don&#x27;t like to deal with foundation</li>
    <li> I do not have big pores or age spots on my face. However I do have wrinkles from too much sun in my twenties. I am early 60&#x27;s now.  The container says it &amp;#34;instantly erases the look of wrinkles...&amp;#34; NOT true.  I am sorry I did not buy this from  Amazon; it would have been a little cheaper than the grocery store.  It feels soft on my face but that is the only redeeming quality of this stuff.  I will not waste my money again.</li>
    <li> I turned 40 this year and while I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet my skin could use a little perking up and this just seemed to make my little imperfections fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my share of good and bad L&#x27;Oreal products but this by far has been the best. After reading all the negative reviews about how thick and greasy it is all I have to say is YOU&#x27;RE USING TOO MUCH. If you put a super thin layer on your face the product works and after a minute the greasy feel goes away. It&#x27;s just a texture that takes getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is accentuating your wrinkles then you&#x27;ve taken the term Miracle too literally. If you&#x27;re looking for a face lift in a tube this isn&#x27;t it but if you&#x27;re looking for a little something to smooth out your face and minimize your pores then you should give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst that can happen is you don&#x27;t like it and you&#x27;ll have to return it. I&#x27;m on my third tube since last year, I use it over my daily moisturizer once it dries and then the Miracle Blur. If I&#x27;m having a break out day then I add Rimmel London&#x27;s BB cream to cover the major flaws and I&#x27;m good to go. I found L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BB cream to be overpriced and it did not work as well as Rimmel which surprised me.</li>
    <li> This stuff DOES NOT SINK INTO YOUR SKIN. They say you should use it as your final step. Eww! There is NO WAY you could appy powder foundation or blush (that so many of us shiney girls use) to this, w/o gunking up your brushes. And if you are in the north and need to bundle up with a scarf or hat or high necked coat near your face, you can expect to be scrubbing this gunk out of everything you own. What on earth were they thinking?</li>
    <li> It really does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34;. I think this is probably the third or fourth I&#x27;ve used. The first time it was kind of weird when you first squeeze if from the tube - looks like it may be old but that&#x27;s just the way it looks - feels marvelous too</li>
    <li> Awful. Made my skin look worse. Set my skin on fire and made my eyes burn like crazy. Even though I was very careful to avoid the eye area. I live in Arizona and drive a convertable. Bought this for extra protection from sun damage. Shall go back to BB cream much gentler!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with it.  It is way overpriced and brings so little in the tube.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> So many have written in to say they use as a primer. It&#x27;s directions clearly state its the last thing you use, therefore it goes OVER foundation. What it does is not spackle, it kind of takes the shine off your face, and makes it look smoother. I used to use powder to do this ( and it would cake up). So, now I use instead of powder to smooth the face. I actually like this product. I&#x27;m 49 btw. :)</li>
    <li> Did absolutely NOTHING for me.  Feels good on my skin, but after using the entire tube on a daily basis I could see NO change before or after applying make-up!!</li>
    <li> If I could give negative I would. I have used several other brands of this type of product and this one is horrible. It&#x27;s thick, doesn&#x27;t spread easily and pills/balls up with makeup application.  I would suggest bare minerals prime time or other boutique name primers over this, and the prices of those are comparable to this! In this case it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few more bucks.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as former L&#x27;Oreal wrinkle-filling product. Previous was in a tube and sand colored. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a primer after it was recommended to me. I can not STAND the texture. It&#x27;s like rubbing a dry cream mix on my face. I have dry/combination skin as it is so this did not help my make up look very good! It always felt and looked cakey. I use Vaseline as a moisturizer sometimes (no it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts) and was able to put this on top of that and it didn&#x27;t feel as bad. So maybe if you have oily skin it won&#x27;t be so bad? But dry/combination I would pass.</li>
    <li> I do like L&#x27;oreal products so I thought I would try this one.......what a disaster!  If you never wore foundation, it might work but combined with foundation, it rolls up into tons of little cylinders all over your face.  It&#x27;s a mess to clean up and to get off of your skin.  Likewise if you use it as a night cream as it does the same thing on a pillow.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> When I received it I noticed it was expired ..i was not a happy customer</li>
    <li> The lesson to be learned here is to read/know and learn a product&#x27;s ingredients. Label reading is a practice that all consumers--albeit food items or beauty--should adopt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The featured active ingredients are LITERALLY sunscreen components:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homosalate (10%),&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate (5%),&lt;br /&gt;Octocrylene (5%),&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone (6%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT&#x27;S ALL, FOLKS. Sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can google each individual active ingredient and you will see that the purpose is (*drumroll*)...SUN protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inactive ingredients are nothing more than binders, thickeners and standard emollients and fragrance. The thick, greasy, unpleasant feel that some are experiencing is the same as that of which when applying your lotion at the beach: the skin has difficulty absorbing the \\&quot;lotion,\\&quot; as it is heavy and it ADHERES to the skin rather than absorbing into the skin (like a BARRIER). The \\&quot;line erasing\\&quot; premise behind this product lies with the fact that the cream (very temporarily) fills in/SINKS into lines. And, more than anything, sunscreen PREVENTS further wrinkles/skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this product is a very manipulative ploy to rob pockets. I&#x27;m giving it TWO stars because I support using sunscreen as a part of your facial care regimen. But other than that, this is just a total dig into your pocket book and wholly unnecessary. Most good moisturizers and foundations for mature skin have a sunscreen component in them anyway. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND AVOID!!!!</li>
    <li> My mother had a sample packet of this which migrated around her bathroom counter and ended up underneath the base for an electric toothbrush, where it leaked. As she was trying to wipe off the leaked glob of cream, she realized that the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; was the softened plastic itself. While I realize my face is not made of plastic, I am hesitant to put something like this on my skin. DEET melts plastic too, and I don&#x27;t use that.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t live up to what it claimed to be. Too greasy, too thick in consistency. And after 2 weeks there was no improvement to my skin. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this  product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from another place but felt the need to write a review. This product seems to work as far as hiding fine lines but it has a greasy feel to it. My face feels like I used a can of Crisco on it. It would be better to just find a good primer and skip this product altogether.</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first.  It made my skin look dewy and smooth, but after a couple weeks, it seems like  it changes and doesn&#x27;t apply as easily on skin, making my foundation splotchy.  Anyone have any ideas?</li>
    <li> DID NOTHING ! ! !  It was dried out when I got it.</li>
    <li> Beauty items rarely work or look as good in person, as they do in the ad or on TV.  This is one of them.  It did not &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; my skin and it is greasy, which doesn&#x27;t go away. Anything you put on, on top of that, smears and rubs off due to the grease or oil.  My Smoky Eyes turned into Raccoon Eyes...  Not a good look.</li>
    <li> This is the first L&#x27;Oreal product I did not like.  It creates a film over the face when applied and face looks like it has a heavy layer of pancake makeup.  I wold not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a youtube review of a woman applying this this.  I watched some middle aged woman apply this with what seemed to be very drastic and noticeable results.  I thought that this stuff must be awesome, she was not a model... just an average lady so I thought for sure I could duplicate the fabulous effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it doesn&#x27;t fill in crevices and wrinkles like it did for the lady in the youtube video (and mine are not nearly what hers were).  What it does do is eliminate SHINE so that they are less noticeable.  However I note that this effect (for me) is limited to an hour or two and my shininess is back.  I do have rather oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does at least come with a sun screen built in, but I wanted this for the beautifying effects which for me are not there.</li>
    <li> Horrible consistency...not the same as what I bought at CVS</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff...it smoothes out everything for a flawless look...coming back for more...</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is kind of oily which is not good for me due to my already oily skin. After a couple of hours I find that I need to remove the product from my face and apply a new coat. I think my experience is due to my own error in judgement though because there is an oil-free option, next time I will try it.</li>
    <li> Did nothing to improve my skin in any way, It didn&#x27;t make lines disappear it didn&#x27;t do anything. the directions on the tube did not even say that it would blur my lines -- that info is all in the false advertising.  bah!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, it doesn&#x27;t help a LOT but it does help somewhat and for the price it&#x27;s a great makeup primer.</li>
    <li> This is just a lot of sunscreen put in a little container.  It&#x27;s really nothing special and really not worth the $20 or more.</li>
    <li> Soft and gentle. Just started using it...so cannot say if it will be a miracle product. It does feel very good on my skin. Price a little lower than some stores, but I was able to get it very quickly as a prime customer of amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Wow, how I love this product. I paid 20.00 for it and now I find it on here much cheaper. YEAH!.&lt;br /&gt;It really works and I have given up my foundation and just use this for awesome coverage!</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 star because it worked fairly well initially but got a little oily after a while.&lt;br /&gt;It acts as a decent primer. worked better on my teenager.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product and that&#x27;s good enough for me to post a good review.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but what isn&#x27;t these days.</li>
    <li> Pretty bummed about not liking this more! First I feel it&#x27;s helpful to tell you I am 21 years old, and I have pretty sensitive normal/combo skin. I currently don&#x27;t have any breakouts but do have some scarring from past breakouts. I have some fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes, and some small pores around my nose. Nothing too major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I didn&#x27;t like this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Weird consistency, it felt like a really thick primer. Felt weird rubbing onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;2. It made my whole face look smooth yes, but also very washed out for some reason&lt;br /&gt;3. Did NOT like the way my foundation went on over it, my foundation would go on alot thinner, and patchy.&lt;br /&gt;4. Also while it did smooth out my fine lines some and fill in my pores, when I put my liquid foundation on over it the foundation would pack into those pores and fine lines ALOT making them way more noticeable than they were before.&lt;br /&gt;5. It will sting if it is near your eyes at all&lt;br /&gt;6. The smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;7. The price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin&lt;br /&gt;2. If I was to not wear any makeup over it, it would be nice to smooth out my skin&lt;br /&gt;3. Love that is has spf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I didn&#x27;t like this product, I was really hoping this would be something I could wear under my foundation as a primer and sunscreen in one, but it looked awful with my foundation! Now mind you maybe I used too much or too little of this product, or maybe it&#x27;s just my liquid foundations that don&#x27;t go good with it, all I can say if you are going to try this, make sure you keep the receipt! I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> WOW! I have never seen anything like this product - it&#x27;s amazing! You put a dab on your finger and smooth it over your face, and everywhere it touches, it&#x27;s just airbrushes away the pores and fine lines. It works by putting a transparent, smooth matte layer over the pores and fine wrinkles that is undetectable to the naked eye, even up close, so your eye only sees its smooth surface rather than the rougher surface of your actual skin. This product is like a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the effect is temporary. You have to reapply it every few hours if you want the effect to last. But for a photo shoot or a special event, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  You can even dab a bit over your completed makeup to make your pores invisible to add that awesome finishing touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products like this make me feel like I&#x27;m living in the future. I bet Marilyn Monroe would have bought this by the tubful if it had been available in her day. No glamour queen should be without it. (And I hardly ever write reviews for products.)</li>
    <li> It would be so helpful if we knew ages of those using the product.  Of course it will be wonderful for the young but we need to know how it works on those who are older.  Gave it the three stars because it requests a rating in order to write this comment.  I have not actually tried the product yet. Was looking here for recommendations.</li>
    <li> I first got this product as a sample, and while I am loathe to use samples that I receive that are unsolicited, I tried this one.  I usually use high end cosmetics, but this was just wonderful, and I didn&#x27;t know of any other similar products in the cosmetics that I use.  So, I purchased it, and I&#x27;m very happy with its effect.  I&#x27;m 68 years young, a great-grandmother, and don&#x27;t look it at all.  Today was my first day using the product since receiving it, and speaking to someone in the supermarket while in the checkout line, she would absolutely NOT believe my age.  I think it had something to do with this product because, first of all, I do have very nice skin, but this puts a smooth finish onto the skin that just wasn&#x27;t there before.  The woman in the market commented on my skin and how smooth it is.  Try this product.  For the price, it just can&#x27;t be beat.  It leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky and then you put on your foundation, and it looks great.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely NOTHING - it&#x27;s no miracle and it definitely doesn&#x27;t blur anything.  In fact, I found that it exacerbaates my wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t recommend it to ANYONE.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of all the articles and rave about it.  I believe it does work very well, the areas that I need it most are forehead and eyes.  I find that when I put this product around my eyes it tends to burn.  I do not normally have very sensitive skin either.  I will probably continue to use it for my forehead.  A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I finally found something that actually hides those fine lines!  I have tried so many products over the years and am very pleased with the performance of this one.  I seldom wear makeup and when I apply Blur after my moisturizer it seems to do just that...blur.  I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product - waiting months before I write this review .... I&#x27;m in my mid-50s; age is showing you know .... I love the &#x27;blur&#x27; effect and I especially, especially love the silk smoothness of my skin all the day I wear Blur and it stays silky for nearly 24 hours.  I use mineral powder over it .....  since I started using Blur, I&#x27;ve gotten soooo many compliaments on my skin and asked many times, what are you using, your skin looks beautiful ........ and it does.  I don&#x27;t wear it every day, maybe 3-4x a week, when I&#x27;m dressing for an occassion.  Oh, and I wear it on that cleavage wrinkle area, too.  I like this best of all the other primers I&#x27;ve tried; the flake consistency &#x27;melts&#x27; immediately and glides on leaving a wonderful silky effect.  I say, give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot! It goes on like a thick primer, leaves a matte finish, and provides sun protection.</li>
    <li> This new product form L&#x27;Oreal seemed so promising.  I ordered it and I can tell you its like puttiing on a thin coat of vaseline. It left my face feeling greasy and did nothing else.  I am so dissapointed.  ..The ads said i was something new and wonderful...NOT  I would not tell anyone to buy this new crea Blur.....</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice product.  I don&#x27;t agree that it feels waxy.  Makes my skin feels soft and it has softened to look of wrinkles.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is that there is not much product in the tube.  The price wasn&#x27;t bad, but a little more product would&#x27;ve been nice. All in all, pretty decent.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on impulse at the drugstore then read the reviews before using. I&#x27;m honestly surprised at the mixed reviews. It is exactly like using the \\&quot;blur\\&quot; tool in photoshop in real life! I am 33 and I have dry skin, large-ish pores, and the beginnings of some fine lines. I was worried by some reviews where the reviewers said it gets smeary with their lotion or foundation but i have not found that to be the case. I use this product over my moisturizer (Aveeno ultra-calming) and under my makeup (Covergirl invisible concealer and Trublend liquid foundationapplied with a makeup sponge wedge) and I have no problems at all. However I do wait in between lotion and miracle blur and between miracle blur and makeup. I really love this product; it really minimizes pores and lines giving a smoother more flawless appearance. I don&#x27;t know why other reviewers had bad results; maybe their expectations were too high? Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Worked alright, but nothing great.</li>
    <li> This cream does help to make pores appear smaller, gives skin a smoother finish and does help smooth out lines around the eyes. I also use it under the eyes before foundation - seems to help the look there too. It is quite thick, so a little goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t find the cream to be too greasy or too thick when applied correctly. I think the folks reporting greasy, shiny skin have used too much of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Does not seem to work too well over makeup and if I try to apply first it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up after I apply my makeup over.  Don&#x27;t believe I would order again.</li>
    <li> This product leaves skin smooth and so soft! Great to use as a makeup primer for faces with larger pores. For the price however I would recommend Maybeline&#x27;s Baby Skin over this! Hope this helps! :)</li>
    <li> Does hide pores and wrinkles pretty well.  I use it for special occasions as it does take some effort to keep it from flaking and peeling with your makeup.</li>
    <li> Looking at the ads for this, you would think it really was a miracle.  It isn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> it does nothing!!! it is just like a  watery wax...</li>
    <li> This is not genuine product - I have used many times before but never purchased &amp;#34;online&amp;#34;.  This product was not the same in color, texture, even smelled funny.  I believe it was refilled with lotion or something.  I paid too little and was suspicious.  The box was not sealed.  Will not purchase from this provider again</li>
    <li> Well, as the five star rating says, I love it! But I will be the first to say it probably has different results depending on your skin type. I am 43 with dry skin &amp; mostly fine wrinkles except for my &amp;#34;wash board&amp;#34; forehead. I am caucasian and my coloring is very uneven-lots of freckles, pink cheeks, red nose, broken blood vessels etc. I don&#x27;t like heavy make up as most foundations either make my fine wrinkles more pronounced (especially the crepe paper skin around my eyes) while powders look chalky. The thick, waxy texture of miracle blur is fantastic on my skin; it blends in wonderfully and my moisture starved skin soaks it up. Everywhere except my forehead my skin looks virtually wrinkle free, and it does manage to soften the harsher deep wrinkles on my forehead. I LOVE the fact that it is a sunscreen too! It does not hide discolorations but rather slightly camouflages by softening edges. I can&#x27;t imagine applying over make-up as some reviewers have suggested, but I do use a serum first, and if I am doing full makeup I will apply concealer &amp; color corrector first. I then mix a small amount of tinted moisturizer or BB cream with the miracle blur (about a 1:2 ratio) and apply over. But most days I am happy just applying the miracle blur by itself. Miracle blur is also wonderful for the decolletage! You can also reapply to freshen up your look in the afternoon/evening. I will say I have noticed a very slight greasy feel towards the end of the day, which has never been a problem for me but I&#x27;m not so sure how it would work for someone with oily skin. However I believe they also make an oil free version. It is a bit pricey, but compared to the department store stuff it is it&#x27;s moderate. One last note: because its so thick, you have to really work to get all of it out of the tube. When I get to the &amp;#34;end&amp;#34; of the tube I take the cap off and roll/crush it. I have extended the life of the tube by a couple of weeks this way.</li>
    <li> It is just as described leaves your face with a smoother look makeup looks great even after 10 hours later</li>
    <li> It goops on a  little bit, but it really works. It&#x27;s like that movie affect that makes old people look young and blurry, that&#x27;s what it does to my face. I like it and I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Melt a candle and smear the wax on your face - you&#x27;ll get the same effect for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> WOW is all i can say. I have bought every primer on the market - HIGH END TOO - and this is the best in the entire world! Not greasy - does not make you break out - you can now use less foundation if any at all - the transformation is FANTASTIC!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works pretty well to &#x27;blur&#x27; fine facial lines, as advertised. It does not hide my deepest wrinkle on my forehead (I&#x27;m not surprised.) When applying it, though, I liken it to applying drywall spackle! This is not a cream, I know that. The texture, though is almost like a flour and water paste. When you squeeze out the product onto your hand, it kind of crumbles and drops out of my hand. I like the fact that it has a good daytime SPF, and it has a matte appearance on the skin. It is recommended by L&#x27;oreal to wear a moisturizer first, then this product, but for me, that would be too heavy. This stuff does not really absorb into the skin, but is like a thin mask atop the skin. I could scrape it off with my fingernail. I will continue to use it, though, because I don&#x27;t wear foundation, and the product is not shiny like most daytime facial sunscreens.</li>
    <li> While waiting for this order I purchased  a tube from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with the 20% off coupon.  The L&#x27;Oreal from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was much more creamy and squeezed out of the tube very easy.. I see the expiration date on the L&#x27;Oreal  from Amazon was November 2014 and BB&amp;B ex date id November 2014!  Why is the cream from &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; much dryer and hard to squeeze out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, live and learn... BB&amp;B from now on not worth the few pennies I saved</li>
    <li> I put this product on half of my face and felt strange as I looked at that side...like my eyes had Vaseline in them.  The untreated side had fine lines and largish pores, but the blurred side appeared much smoother.  I have no trouble putting it on (I put it over my moisturizer, as recommended) and I LOVE it!  Can&#x27;t wait to try the new Blur eye cream!</li>
    <li> when I got the Blur I could hardly squeeze the cream out of the tube . I think it was a old tube because it was so dry .</li>
    <li> Try it on your face in the store, not your hand. Tried it on my hand in the store, seemed amazing. On face? Not so much. Plus I broke out (does not \\&quot;blur\\&quot; that, either), and it burned my eyes. Yeah you&#x27;re not supposed to get it in them but I always end up doing so and I don&#x27;t think eye-burning stuff is promising on one&#x27;s skin - and OUCH!). Not cheap so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Ok so I must admit that I was sold by the commercial and absoulutely had to try it. It really does create a \\&quot;blurred\\&quot; effect HOWEVER tends to get a LITTLE greasy after a while. SO what I do is after applying the miracle blur I dab a bit of milk of magnesia(u can pick up at any drugstore. Be mindful NOT to get the mint flavored one lol) the milk helps absorb the oil and helps my make up last. I also like this product because it does contain SPF 15 and living in the caribbean the sun is always blazing hot. Overal I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 year old caucasian woman with mild smile and eye crinkles and some deeper wrinkles on the forehead. I am also prone to hormonal breakouts. Short term I didn&#x27;t see any big difference but after four weeks I did. I use a pea sized amount over Coppertone Oil Free Faces and under CoverGirl Advanced Radiance foundation.My skin feels soft but not greasy. It has a slight glow and some old acne and chicken pox scars look much better. Lighter wrinkles have disappeared altogether. No unusual breakouts or irritation. Even with all the suncreen, I can tan lightly. I think it all depends on how much you use and what other products go along with it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife as I know she uses it every day. She said that it was chunky and a dark yellowish color. She threw it away before iI could return it. Beware.</li>
    <li> It burned my face the 2nd time I used it.  Tossed in the wastebasket.  And the 1st time I used it I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Your face so silky!!!!i love it</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and after 6 mos. with a different product line started to have problems. None with this one so far.</li>
    <li> I use this on top of my BB cream or foundation like suggested by some other reviewers. I dab it under my eyes and on the lines on my forehead. It does smooth the look of fine lines. In NO way is this a filler and it does basically nothing for deeper creases. I only use it when I am going out but it could be used daily.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product because I have seen all the commercials and ads about the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures with women. Let me just say that this product does provide a nice matte look but other than that, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. From what the product claims, it really doesn&#x27;t deliver. I would not buy this product again. I was surprised because Loreal is usually a great line.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this although I thought I would love it. It definitely blurs your skin but it feels kind of cakey... as in I know its there.</li>
    <li> Just awful, doesn&#x27;t blur at all and is greasy. If you rub your face after applying it comes off like peeling skin. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because Dita von Teese recommended it in an interview. She did say she preferred the non-SPF formula, and I think I know why. This one starts to flake when you rub it in. It has a velvety texture but when you start blending it, little pieces start to flake off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying this is an odd product.  I tried it from a magazine sample, but the amount was tiny and it was hard to say what I thought.  However, it was interesting enough that I remembered the product.  After trying a second sample recently, I decided to spring for a tube.  The usual drugstore outlets had it at full price.  I got mine via a military PX for five less than the full price, but I have to say the price on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve seen anywhere!  If I buy a second tube, I&#x27;ll be purchasing here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product itself:  You do have to read and heed instructions for how and when to apply it.  Ladies:  this is NOT a moisturizer!!  I&#x27;m 64 and have very good skin with fairly small pores and hardly any wrinkles, so admittedly I&#x27;m not battling big problems.  However, my big issue is a bit of dryness and regular flakiness that I constantly have to deal with.  I do a lot of things to protect and moisturize my skin.  Pretty much on a daily basis, mornings, I have to use a bit of scrub to remove small flaky spots.  Then I use an oil as the first thing...right now I&#x27;m trying L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Glow Renewal Facial oil...so far I like it but the jury is still out as to how well it helps with the moisturizing.  I&#x27;m trying to reduce that flakiness, so that&#x27;s my main goal.  So the oil is the first thing, then I use a moisturizer with SPF, various products actually, I don&#x27;t have a favorite although right now I do really like Clinique&#x27;s Even Better Skin Tone Correcting Moisturizer...I love how it goes on, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s a nice non-greasy moisturizer for me.  Rather costly, though.  After that I use the L&#x27;Oreal Miracle Blur Cream.  Yes, it&#x27;s quite thick, almost like a paste, although if you dispense just a bit and rub it between your fingers for a moment, it softens and applies better.  Then I apply it very lightly.  It spreads just fine if you don&#x27;t use too much, and once on, gives a lovely nice smooth finish that I really like as a base.  I put BB cream on top of that, then a bit of Bare Minerals powder makeup, blush, mineral veil on top.  Seems like a lot, but it looks great and smooth like those gals at the department store beauty counters, and so far I&#x27;m happy with what I&#x27;m seeing from the Miracle Blur cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test will be when I reach the end of the first tube...whether or not I buy another one.  The jury is still out on this too, so I&#x27;ll see what I think then.  So far, I do see a better look, very lovely and smooth without looking made up, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin, it gives a great base for the mineral powder makeup, it adds a 30 spf which is nice.  I&#x27;ll update my review at the end of the tube.  Only negative so far is that it&#x27;s a fairly small tube, so I suspect it won&#x27;t last long even though I&#x27;m using a very small amount each time.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product and it seems like it is similar to products like L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Perfecting base but much more expensive and overpriced for what the products are.  HONESTLY --- If you want to fill in pores etc get over to the ladies aisle and pick up Monistats Soothing Care Chafing Relief Powder Gel -- look at the ingredients and notice Dimethicone which is the main product in a lot of these pore smoothers but for under 10 bucks!! Really!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received it yet I ordered it yesterday ... but i have been buying it at stores and I Love it!!  it smooths my lines and under makeup looks great its a waxy feel but it works great and its a lot less then the drug stores sell it thanks cant wait to use it !! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product but not with the price. I&#x27;ve read other reviews with complaints about how its greasy  and thick. This is to be used over your  lotion or face cream in small amounts. A dime size amount works fine.  I use a little bit of powder to set it and I&#x27;m out the door  looking great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay pore/wrinkle smoother.  The best one I&#x27;ve ever found is Urban Decay&#x27;s.  This one is not nearly as good, but not bad either.</li>
    <li> I approach most cosmetics ads skeptically, but found this product through a sample in one of my magazines. It works! It smooths out my skin using just the tiniest bit, and I mean just a dot. I only use it on cheeks and nose, not my whole face. I don&#x27;t wear foundation, so for me, this and some blush are it. Not that the product erases wrinkles--no--but it does make a nice &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; as the name says. I think if you put it on too thick it would pill--people should experiment.&lt;br /&gt;Also there are at least a couple kinds of this product--one is oil free. I didn&#x27;t get that kind because I have dry skin, so I&#x27;m not reviewing that one.</li>
    <li> My favorite primer so far</li>
    <li> this is waxy and hard to apply....</li>
    <li> Nice pore smoothing finish without breaking my face out like smashbox primer.  Save your trip to CVS because this is way cheaper on amazon!</li>
    <li> Used over makeup as directed and it left gummy globs on my face.</li>
    <li> Does not blur anything.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this under my foundation to create a more flawless look, but it is impossible to apply foundation after using this product.</li>
    <li> Does not work as good as other products. Not worth the price but its ok. Etude House&#x27;s was better but you have to wait for it.</li>
    <li> Works very well in &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; certain flaws.</li>
    <li> Great product, use it all the time. Unfortunately, seller did not mention product was one month from expiration date. One tube lasts me around 4-5 months, so expiration date is problematic for me.</li>
    <li> Immediate results. Smooths out skin, softens skin. Priced reasonably. Lasts well. SPF 30. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and the quality was much better. This particular tube is different, almost as though the makeup is old. I cannot even use the product.</li>
    <li> I really like Miracle Blue. At 45, I&#x27;ve grown out my bangs and was bummed to see lines across my forehead. Using high-end moisturizers helped, but, barring botox, I think those lines are here to stay. (sad trombone). Miracle Blur really does what it says it will do - blurs the lines so that they&#x27;re softer, less pronounced, and I like that there&#x27;s built-in SPF 30. I use it on top of my serum &amp; moisturizer, and under a hydrating mineral powder foundation. Looks great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a Miracle! I love this stuff. I purchased two so I wouldn&#x27;t take the chance of running out soon!</li>
    <li> Check the expiration date, it was past due, half of tube dry</li>
    <li> Satisfactory product and meets the expectation. Thanx.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  I use it over my moisterizer and under by bb cream and it really gives a smoother appearance to my skin.  I can actually go without foundation and skin looks younger.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> My favorite face product.  Other pore products always resulted in skin issues by clogging pores &amp; subsequent breakouts.  This one fills a couple large facial pores from previous acne problems and allows my CC tone correcting moisturizer (by Olay) to be all I want in coverage, especially in the summer.  Without this product, foundation gathers in those pores &amp; they actually appear darker &amp; more noticeable.  I also use it around my nose, forehead, lips &amp; very lightly under my eyes.  When my foundation is heavy,thick (or old), I have experienced some rolling of the product around my lips, but not when I use a CC.  I also have issues with heavy foundations even when I do not use this Blur Cream thus the change to a lighter coverage CC.  I too put on a moisturizer prior to applying, then Blur, then tone correcting CC moisturizer.  I am 60 yrs old.</li>
    <li> Love it! I re -ordered it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months.  I have read a lot of the reviews and feel the product has done wonders for my skin.  I only use it at night.  It is very heavy and thick.  I am 63 years old and had very visible pores around my nose.  Since using this product they appear much smaller.  Works great on the fine lines around eyes and eyebrows.  I feel this product does what it says!</li>
    <li> Pretty thick. I like Garnier blur much better.</li>
    <li> reduces the appearance of wrinkles, smooths skin, non-greasy</li>
    <li> I love this and I am very happy with the results of this product.  I do plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations!  Not worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. Maybe it was old, but I could barely squeeze it out of the tube and it just pilled up when I tried to apply it. Of course, see no improvements</li>
    <li> This product was okay. I&#x27;ve had primers work better. Didn&#x27;t seem to last especially when time to put makeup on.</li>
    <li> The change was subtle but enough for people to ask, have you done something different. I&#x27;m not telling. It&#x27;s my secret.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I just expected more. Very thick cream. It is hard to squeeze out of tube. A lot goes to waste unless you cut the container. Needs to be put in small jar. Product was not really a miracle blur cream. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> I didnt even get to try this product because when. I got it, it was all dried up inside...A bunch of air came out.&lt;br /&gt;Hard goo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just looked at the ingredients on the tube in the store and from what I can tell&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a tube of SUNSCREEN. I&#x27;m not sure where the &#x27;blur&#x27; part comes in other than the&lt;br /&gt;fact that the active ingredients blocks the sun. AT the price it is now I would never&lt;br /&gt;buy it. I&#x27;m sticking with the Golden Age balm for dry skin and testing out the Revitalift&lt;br /&gt;Night Cream - Anti Sag and the Loreal Age Perfect (mature skin) Anti sag right now to&lt;br /&gt;see if those do anything. Of course I can&#x27;t give first hand experience as whether the&lt;br /&gt;Blur does what it says it does or not and look forward to reading others reviews.</li>
    <li> Product is overpriced and does not smooth lines or hide pores. Foundation did not go on well over it. Need to use more than what it says to.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and would continue to buy it forever IF........the price stops going up.  I was forced to buy another one because each time I go to purchase this the price has gone up.  I still think this is the best one but I&#x27;ll just wait till they drop back to the original price.</li>
    <li> I looove this product! I use it on my forehead, nose and around my eyes over my moisturizer anywhere I need some smoothing out. Gives me a great matte finish and then top with BB or foundation. Its my third tube and I hope they never stop making it. Gives a great airbrushed finish. My fav primer ever and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> over priced sunblock... that&#x27;s about it. It doesn&#x27;t make pores disappear, and as a photographer I can tell you that it doesn&#x27;t make you &amp;#34;photo ready&amp;#34; like the commercial says. There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s really good about this product. It leaves an oily feel to the skin and often make the subject break out after a couple hours of wear. I&#x27;m not happy with it. I&#x27;ll just use it as a sunblock from now on. the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it functions fine as an spf.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks---testing it. I was impressed with it as a primer. I applied it under BB Cream. The cheaper brand of BB Cream tends to be too greasy to remain on my dry skin.....but placing the BB Cream on top of the Miracle Blur worked!! The cheap BB Cream, was mattified &amp; remained in place all day. I always wear powder to set even the BB Cream, but I didn&#x27;t have to when I used the Miracle Blur. I am 50 years old---I have a few fine lines &amp; sagging skin. Miracle Blur did not improve these facial complaints. Miracle Blur did shrink my pores though&#x3D;invisible. I can&#x27;t say this product blurred anything---but my face did look better when I wore my BB Cream. When I was testing it I was told to use just it too---nothing under or over it. I noticed no difference.....SO this is why I recommend it be used as a foundation or BB Cream primer.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price that is charged.&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to get out of the tube because it so thick &amp; there isn&#x27;t much in the tube.  Maybe the tube I tested didn&#x27;t contain as much as the actual tubes or maybe it was a different formulation. All I know is that you can buy premium primers for the same cost.</li>
    <li> I do not like this at all. Thick and hard to put on. Felt greasy on my face. Made the fine lines on my face more noticeable, did not blur them. The consistency does not feel good. I really like L&#x27;Oreal products. Not this one. I will stick with L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code lotion with spf 30. This was a complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you like a greasy, gooey glob on your face. I&#x27;ll use the rest of it on my hands as a greasy gooey hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m editing my review as of April 8th 2013.  Well, it was too greasy and gooey for my hands, so I have just thrown it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that there are far superior products out there including Maybelline Primer and the ROC Brilliance Anti-Aging Primer</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne prone combination to dry skin. I received a sample of this in the mail, I applied it before my foundation at 4pm, went to a concert, moshed in the mosh pit, went wild, went out to eat, didn&#x27;t come home until 2:30am and my makeup looked perfect as it did at 4pm!! I&#x27;m going to buy the full size now :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 51yo Caucasian woman with some normal wrinkling and age related pore enlargement. I had a sample in a magazine that was actually decent quantity (unusual). Instead of putting it all over I used it on the problem areas for me; the nose, chin, cheeks &amp; some forehead. By doing that I could try it more than once and see where it struggles. I loved it, but I also took it for exactly what it is... &#x27;face spackle&#x27;! :). I&#x27;ve tried others like products and really disliked how they interacted with my skin and makeup...caking and flaking. I used them in similar manners, but didn&#x27;t have this problem with this one. If I didn&#x27;t mess too much with the area after I put it, it definitely &#x27;blurred&#x27; things especially in the pore size area on nose, chin and checks. When my sample ran out, I was really bummed and I think that says it all. I wanted more.</li>
    <li> I read the bad hype and thought loreal is not a crap brand. Loreal is a france brand and when something comes from pairs its a no brainer that its awesome. Anyway I went to target to buy it and its not greasy and the key is to place it over ur foundation then put ur matte powder over it and wow I look 10 yrs younger. If I would of believed all these crappy reviews then I wouldn&#x27;t be in such a great mood. Go buy it and use a dime size amount on under eyes crows smile and frown lines the product will last u use it like that its not made to globber ur face.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s. This product blur&#x27;s my fine lines and gives my face a little lift. I don&#x27;t have oily skin so I have a matte finish when using this product. The product is thick but I don&#x27;t mind because the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> I also had high hopes for this product! Miracle Blur???? It is VERY thick, so thick in fact I wondered if I had simply gotten an old tube that had dried out or something. It&#x27;s so thick it doesn&#x27;t go on well, and putting it on top of the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code moisturizer, which I love, didn&#x27;t work- it just balled up and it was really hard to spread it evenly on my skin. As far as \\&quot;blurring my imperfections\\&quot;- it made my pores look larger and my skin look coarse. It&#x27;s awful stuff- I have no idea what they are going for here- when you get the product, all it is is a very thick sunscreen. I tried it one time and was so unhappy with how it made my skin look that I threw it into the garbage.</li>
    <li> I got a sample from a magazine and did the following to my face: I washed, toned with witch hazel, applied sunblock to my hyper-pigmented areas, moisturized all over, gave it a minute to dry, then applied Miracle Blur to my large-pore areas, and although I noticed a smooth matte surface immediately, I still waited a minute to apply a thin layer of Loreal BB Cream... then dusted with light powder and got on with my day. My face stayed put all day. I even worked out at lunch and lightly patted my face dry. Not only does the Miracle Blur fill in like spackle, it keeps your makeup where you put it.</li>
    <li> After looking at the ingredients, there is only two benefits to this product.  It has a 30 SPF protection and it has a silicone primer base, which I use anyway under my foundation.  However, this is not worth the price for such a simple product. Buying a primer and a facial sun screen would cost less.  And it is mis-named.  It doesn&#x27;t blur anything.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 50s.  I have tried many products from high end to drugstore.  Most do an okay job in moisturizing and softening.  But, for the deeper little wrinkles, the need to brighten, ect. I have not found much that does the job of masking this and making you look fresher.&lt;br /&gt;I had thought of getting Miracle Blur at the drugstore a few months back and the woman at the counter discounted it, saying that Loreal&#x27;s skin products are not that good.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I got a sample in the mail a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried it right before a family get together.&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  the compliments.  People kept saying how fresh and good I looked.  It had given me a bit of an air brushed look with my few deeper wrinkles covered pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a substitute for moisturizer.  You use your regular things.  But, you put this on top much like you would powder over foundation.  For a finished look.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick silicone product with an ingredient that gives it a matte finish. It went on gooey and slimy and stayed that way all day; it didn&#x27;t absorb at all. I tried putting some makeup over it, and it just balled up and clotted with the powder and blush, AND made a mess of my makeup brushes. Ick. When I washed my face to get it off, I couldn&#x27;t even get my face wash to lather the first time--it took two tries to wash it off. Then I pitched the Miracle Blur in the trash.</li>
    <li> It was very waxy and did not produce the effect that is is marketed to have.  Save you money on this one.</li>
    <li> The procduct smells to bad, I couldn&#x27;t use it. I would recommend a product change for people with scent sensitivities and allergies</li>
    <li> I have large pores and oily skin and I used this under my Bare Minerals.  It worked really well and I was told I looked really good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use as a makeup primer and I did use it this way but it is actually a sunscreen.  The inside packaging clearly states that it is a sunscreen.  Considering the time of year I made this purchase (winter), I cannot vouch for its effectiveness but I do like it as a makeup primer.</li>
    <li> Do not like this at all.  Feels greasy on. Didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;blurring\\&quot;.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  It is thick and difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> Literally what they only mention on the back is that all this is ... is a really expensive really low spf sun tan ... stuff... I call it grease.  But hell I&#x27;d bought it, so I started applying it around my frown lines.  That lasted two days until I realized that was what was breaking my skin out and I almost never break out to anything.  The last time I broke out, my daughter used too much Purex laundry detergent in the wash and it broke me out.... so good news, it&#x27;s about the same strength as purex laundry soap that wasn&#x27;t fully rinsed out of your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you want to waste money.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this as a gift for your &#x27;best friend&#x27; that you just found out is sleeping with your husband.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for your boss who keeps making you work over time every time she finds out you&#x27;ve got a hot date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I can&#x27;t think of any good reasons to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I&#x27;m trying to get a refund out of L&#x27;Oreally.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels like thick petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;Does not get absorbed, thus the greasy feeling persists for hours.&lt;br /&gt;And if it gets on your hair, then you have greasy strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot recommend L&#x27;Oreal Miracle Blur.</li>
    <li> Steer clear!  This stuff is heavy and will clog your pores.  I put it on my nose one morning and by the afternoon I had huge red bumps all over my nose!  I seriously looked like bozo the clown.  It didn&#x27;t blur anything - if anything it enhanced wrinkles as it sinks down into them and separates the lines, which makes them MORE noticeable.</li>
    <li> This feels like silk on your face. Yes, it is thick, but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the job done. Also, a few days after using it, your skin feels amazing after you wash it at night. I would compare this to the Origins white tea face serum (called A Perfect World) - just lots cheaper! Definitely worth trying!!</li>
    <li> This product made my normally flawless Benefit foundation look dry, pale, and cakey. It did nothing to cover lines and wrinkles, and was very difficult to apply due to its consistency. There are much better primers out there for the same amount of money (or less!). I&#x27;ll stick with my BB cream--it does all of the same things as Miracle Blur does, without ruining my foundation.</li>
    <li> I use a little as directed and it really works wonders.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> This item can be used on the face as a makeup base or on the body to soften any where. If you&#x27;re chaff, sunburned. etc. this is ideal for these purposes.  It has multi uses.  I purchased it at a reasonable price.  Since then the price has increased double and over. I will purchase it again when I find another reasonable economical price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work the way I thought it would felt really heavy on my skin I will be trying the updated version</li>
    <li> Congratulations to L&#x27;Oreal for pulling off the best beauty scam ever! They market this on TV as a \\&quot;skin smoother.\\&quot; They claim that it reduces lines. False! It is nothing more than a greasy sunscreen. On the front of the tube, you can clearly see \\&quot;Revitalift\\&quot; in large letters and \\&quot;Miracle Blur\\&quot; in even larger letters. Above \\&quot;Revitalift,\\&quot; in very small print, are the words \\&quot;Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen,\\&quot; Here&#x27;s what appalls me; the TV commercial does not have \\&quot;Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen\\&quot; on the tube. It&#x27;s just not there. L&#x27;Oreal is intentionally misleading people with that ad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my tube, I just thought that this miracle concoction marketed to \\&quot;erase the look of wrinkles, lines, and pores\\&quot; just contained sunscreen. I didn&#x27;t realize that all I was buying was just plain sunscreen until I read the back of the tube. On the back of the tube, the following is printed:&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply as the last step in your sunscreen regimen or wear alone on cleansed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps prevent sunburn. If used as directed, with other sun protection measures, reduces the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong! This is another false claim under \\&quot;Uses\\&quot; because it&#x27;s not even a quality sunscreen. You must use with \\&quot;other sun protection measures,\\&quot; and there is no Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide in this lousy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy another L&#x27;Oreal product again!!! They already turned me off by continuing to use that old, \\&quot;has been\\&quot; Andie McDowell over and over in their phony ads. How many years does that lady have on her contract? I&#x27;m so sick of seeing her. They just air brush out her crows feet! After LIE&#x27;real pulled this Miracle Blur stunt, they&#x27;ve lost me for good!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a 50+ who does not wear foundation or a lot of other make up... (blush, eyebrows, + sometimes undereye concealer)...&lt;br /&gt;i tried this product because, while i have pretty normal skin, i get shiny, esp after the moisturizer and sunscreen goes on. i use about half a pea sized drop squirted into my palm and, after i rub it around around in my palm for few seconds to make it warm and pliant, apply it to the t-zone only.&lt;br /&gt;it really does blur/soften this area and make it matte. which is what i was looking for it to do. so i&#x27;m happy. it also decreased the noticability, let&#x27;ssay, of pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have wrinkles in the area i apply it to, so i can&#x27;t really speak to that claim (thank you botox!).&lt;br /&gt;i will buy this product again and would recommend it to anyone with a similar need (reduce shine and pore obviousness).&lt;br /&gt;(heh, obvs not michael, but his wife!)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I don&#x27;t put it all over my face though.  I mix 1 part Miracle Blur with 3 parts [[ASIN:B00BEZNOB2 Garnier Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector Bb Cream, Combination To Oily Skin, Deep, 2 Fluid Ounce]] and apply it under my eyes with a concealer brush.  It seriously makes me look younger without looking \\&quot;made-up\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Somebody does not know the definition of the word &amp;#34;miracle.&amp;#34;  This is a sun screen and nothing more.  I sent it back because the contents of the tube were so dried out I had to place it on the counter and lean on it with all my weight to get a little squiggle to eke out.  But reading other reviews that refer to the product as &amp;#34;spackle,&amp;#34; I see now that maybe that is the expected consistency.  So, maybe they don&#x27;t know the definition of &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; either.  On my face it did nothing special, no blur, no lift, no revitalizing.  Find something more pleasing to the senses.</li>
    <li> I live in AZ and although I am not a sun worshiper, the low humidity and age are taking it&#x27;s toll especially on my face.  I found it amazing how quickly fine lines began to blur after using the RivitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, especially around my mouth.  It was thicker than I expected but I quickly got use to that.  I will continue to purchase the product - I have it on my Subscribe &amp; Save List and I would recommend this product to anyone, in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m diggin&#x27; this stuff!  I read the reviews - I agree - this is a fabulous primer.  My skin is usually dry by the end of the day - with the Blur - it still looks great.  I wouldn&#x27;t use the recommended amount - a dab will do.  My makeup stays put and my skin looks great.  It may diffuse my wrinkles a bit, but not a dramatic change.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement at all.  Due to the recent freezing weather in NYC I did use it to protect my face and for that purpose it worked well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone with \\&quot;FINE\\&quot; lines but if you have deep wrinkles, you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed. This products works like a primer and leaves your skin with a silky look.  My make-up stayed on longer and looked less shiny throughout the day. I gave it 4 stars because its too expensive and it&#x27;s basically a primer. I even at Walmart it costs $20.</li>
    <li> I do believe this is a good product.  My fine lines are less visible but the best part is my makeup stays on all day beautifully.  My skin looks really soft and smooths.  My age spots dont show as much either.</li>
    <li> This probably works well if you are in your late 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;m 64 and saw no real difference with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It feels a lot like the &amp;#34;smoothers&amp;#34; and the olay night balm in terms of texture which is very nice so&lt;br /&gt;that is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Hi.  I wanted to comment in case people are looking here to find out more about this product.  I had a horrible reaction to it.  I put it on and didn&#x27;t like the thick feel of it so I IMMEDIATELY washed it off.  it didn&#x27;t come off..and my soap did not foam.  SO I washed 2 more times.  After it was off..or so I thought..the burning started.  After awhile it stopped but my face became increasingly red throughout the day.  When I washed my face in the evening it HURT.  This morning it feels and looks as if I have a BAD sunburn.  The skin around my eyes and nose is raw, red, and feels like it is gone.  After I had this reaction I checked on Makeup Alley and it turns out that many people had this reaction.  Please be wary if you decide to try this out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the bad reviews. This stuff is a great affordable alternative to Benefit or Urban Decay primer. It goes on smoothly, absorbs into skin quickly, and provides a flawless canvas for your makeup. I do wish it controlled oil better, but oh well. Still not bad, not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Amazing....not sure how it works, but it really does diminish lines on the forehead, not shinny.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very thick.  Says to use it as last step of beauty routine but that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I use it first and let it &amp;#34;set up&amp;#34; then add powder as my foundation.  Probably will NOT buy again.</li>
    <li> Meh - like every other &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream I have tried. At first, gives the illusion of blurring the lines between my eyes and forehead, and doesn&#x27;t last 30 minutes. Wrinkles, stay wrinkled.</li>
    <li> This is the deal: after reading the reviews, some saying this was like spackle and difficult to rub in, I tried my own concoction. I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and am trying to look fresh and smooth everyday now. I received a sample of this in a magazine over the summer and really liked it. I have fairly normal skin, some fine wrinkles and normal aging going on. But after reading some reviews, I was slightly nervous that I would have a different experience than what I had with the sample. So, this is my routine: wash face in morning then squeeze a little of my regular moisturizer on my fingertip (Ponds Luminous Day Lotion) and then a little of the Miracle Blur onto the same fingertip (usually equal amounts). Together this is about the size of a large pea, smaller than a dime or marble. Mix the two together with my fingers and then apply and smooth on my face and neck. Some days I put makeup on and some days I don&#x27;t, but my makeup looks so nice with this mixture as a foundation and even makeup free days I think the skin on my face looks smoother and less harsh than before I began using Miracle Blur and mixing it with my day lotion. I think the point is, the Miracle Blur is easier to apply when I do it this way and I avoid the thick, spackle feel and effect. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I had a friend who gave me a sample of this to try to see if I would like it,and I fell in love after the first time!  This product has a smooth,velvet like texture to it,and to me it is not really greasy like some people describe it,to me it is more like a silky velvet matte finish on your skin. With all honesty, when I washed my face,put on my moisturizers etc.then put this on ONLY? I felt confident enough to wear this product alone with not one drop of make up and that is very hard to me because I get a complex behind some of the blemishes still on my skin that are going away slowly but surely from the other products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream gave me a naturally flawless look,where it did not look fake or made up, it really blended into make my skin even out with tones and all,but without a makeup look to it. I will be wearing this product over and over again no doubt. I wear it under my foundation,and it makes my makeup look absolutely flawless and smooth and last me all day long! When I take pictures, my makeup looks so even and smooth that someone would probably think I used a filter on my pictures it is that good! I will DEFINITELY be ordering more no doubt! I am a medium brown skinned 39 year old woman,and for the first time in a long time, I am feeling confident. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to try this product! It is inexpensive in my eyes,and you can&#x27;t beat that for what they charge for other products like this one out there.</li>
    <li> I use it to blur my pores...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alright, works like a primer.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel greasy or anything from it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually really liking it so far.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.. I&#x27;m happy it has SPF in it!</li>
    <li> After reading the mixed reviews on this product, I had to write one of my own. Many of those complaining have written that they are not using it as directed, could that be the problem??? I love this product. You only need a very small amount and I use it after my face cream and makeup, and no, it&#x27;s not too heavy! It blurs and blends easily ( if your using too much, you may have an issue ) makes my face and makeup look smooth with lines and flaws definitely diminished!&lt;br /&gt;Using too much, using it before creams and makeup will only cause you problems. I will keep using this! Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes for a great product. Unfortunately, it is still sitting in my cabinet. It&#x27;s too thick and pills right off your face as you put it on. I don&#x27;t understand why they made it so thick! Ugh WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> love this, you sure see a difference on your face when you put it on</li>
    <li> Works great as long as you don&#x27;t put any other make up on! If you put on powder it will make it clump up and make your skin look patchy.... Yuck.</li>
    <li> It seemed very tacky and greasy, hard to put a foundation on top of this. I wasn&#x27;t able to tell an difference, after using this product.</li>
    <li> The product is different of the size</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this is awesome.  It give my pores tighten and my skin is very smooth.  I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle. I have really large pores and this stuff fills them in wonderfully. I will never go without this.</li>
    <li> I put it on alone then added blush over it. Didn&#x27;t tell my husband.  He said &amp;#34;have you done something different with your makeup? I said yeah why. He said I like it. I have normal skin. This stuff is thick but clear. It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all.  I have tanned skin so its a plus that it goes on clear. Most stuff with sunscreen smells like the beach and goes ob white streaks on my tan skin. If I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen I get sunspots. I like that I don&#x27;t smell like the beach at work.</li>
    <li> I love how non greasey and smooth this product is and that it gives you a nice flawless smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Luckily, I tried this first as a free sample and never wasted money on it. It feels like you are spreading frosting on your face. I noticed no blurring of any kind, my face looked exactly the same. I did not like the texture so I decided to wash it off - it took alot of scrubbing! I still  feel like it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in the mail today, and was so excited to try it!I ripped open the sample and then applied it to my face,it went on extremely smooth and easy, but then alittle while later I felt my face and it felt super greasy. I will not purchase this item.Thank Goodness for free samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list on the description of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything,there is no smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;color:Clear, Transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel:Feels like a regular primer when you put it on your skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this after getting a free sample in the mail, and was amazed at how it works.  I have a small crater on the side of my nose from a suspected basal cell cancerous pimple that was removed.  This stuff minimized the look of it somehow and made it virtually disappear, at all angles and in all kinds of different light.  Makeup applied over it lasts all day long.  A little goes a very long way, too.  I will always use it now!</li>
    <li> This cream is great &amp; makes your face feel &amp; look wonderful! I&#x27;ll be buying this product for a long time!</li>
    <li> Feels awful on the skin. Made makeup settle into what few lines I have, making me look older. AND! to top it off... it clogs pores and caused a break out. Fan-freakin&#x27;-tastic. Really horrid product. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on the recommendation of my daughter. It does what it says it will, which is to minimize the look of wrinkles. My skin feels smooth and my makeup goes on nicely, although I do wait for at least 15 to 30 minutes before I put my make up on over it. Like most sunscreens, it tends to make my skin perspire more than if I do not have on a sun screen. I don&#x27;t know why sun screens have that effect on me. My daughter has not noticed this when she uses it. I do use Miracle blur every day, even if I do not put make up on my face. I recommend it to others. It actually exceeded my expectations. [I have noticed that the wrinkles on my chest, from sunning over the years,seems to have minimized since I have been using this product. I don&#x27;t know if this product has done that or the Vitamin E, I use alternately in that area.]</li>
    <li> Found a sample in a magazine and, thinking what a fool I was being because I&#x27;d already tried everything for large pores, including laser treatments, tried it anyhow. Love it!  I have &#x27;young skin&#x27; for my age (over 50), but large pores. This product hides them!!  Works best with NOTHING underneath, but I do apply a little of the Neocutis Peche that I use to eliminate rosacea redness. (Yes, Peche is a miracle product, too, and I&#x27;ve tried all the rosacea products, Dollink.) Forget moisturizing before Miracle Blur - it will make this product roll up into tiny noodles on your face. But wow, once it&#x27;s on!  I also apply a little foundation on top, gently, with a foundation brush (L&#x27;Oreal Cashmere Perfect). Not much foundation is needed when MB is applied first. I&#x27;d say I use only about one half of a dried green pea- size amount of foundation. MB doesn&#x27;t remove easily with just soap or foam, but I need to use Aveeno Clear Complexion acne face scrubs at night for rosacea anyway, and they&#x27;re grainy enough to both clean and exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have the L&#x27;Oreal magic base too but this one works differently. I like them both but only use this one now. It&#x27;s a different type of base than the magic base.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work worth a damn!  Waste of money.  Greasy feeling and feels very heavy.  Doesn&#x27;t smooth anything.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. It really does blur lines and pores, and it also helps with shine. I love it. It&#x27;s not heavy and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, which are kind of big. I tried to mix it with Two Faced Porcelain and they don&#x27;t mix well. I don&#x27;t know why I tried it because it worked fine alone. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product work very well! It also worked superb as a primer. As far as blurring out my pores, personally for me I still have to give a try. I just got this and this is what I noticed so far. I usually use high end products for priming  this did its job for a drug store brand! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I waited along time to try this.  It did nothing for my looks.  It has an spf of 30.  That&#x27;s about it. I wont rebuy.</li>
    <li> Greasy, there are better brands.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the US Amazon site and waited very patiently for its arrival all the way to me in the UK. I was however very disappointed after using it for a month. First impression was it was very greasy for a primer, and given I bought it for the summer it really didn&#x27;t help maintaining my foundation, by the end of the day it always made me feel very cakey no matter how little product I actually put on. I persevered with this trying different amounts and different setting powders with it trying my best not to hate it, since its not cheap, but failed very miserably. Have gone back to my old primer and will not be recommending this for anyone with combination skin.</li>
    <li> I thought it created a blurring effect on the skin like the Roc cream does (but that had no SPF). But the effect is not so powerful: the skin doesn&#x27;t get a soft touch, it only loses the extra oil; the feeling is like you rub wax on your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal products before and I have been very satisfied until I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the cream to be thick, dry and almost coarse like(Don&#x27;t know if my tube are old stock). On application I find it too heavy and my skin couldn&#x27;t breath. I did not my skin look any better or improvement using this product. I personally would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> IT has sunscreen and it goes on very easy. I like the way it fills in the large pours and hides them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the container is so small I will have to renew it soon.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but this one was rancid.</li>
    <li> Provides a smooth look!</li>
    <li> I was very please with the product and the results of using thus far.  I was extremely happy with the price that I paid although now the price that I purchased it for is no longer available.  In my opinion for the results I would pay the price listed now.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great:  it softens the skin and hides lines, as promised.  The only HUGE problem is that the fragrance in it is so overwhelming, I had to remove it after a few minutes of it warming on my skin, and the fragrance wafting up from under my eyes and burning my eyes.  I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to make-up or lotions, but unfortunately, the fragrance in this product made it unusable.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought Miracle Blur and I think that it is just &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; as a facial primer.  A light coat does a moderate job of blurring some of my spots.  The worst thing is the packaging.  The first few blobs are fairly easy to apply, but as the hard plastic tube gets less full, you have to wrangle with the bottle to squeeze out a drop (there&#x27;s only 1.18 fluid ounces in a big 4.75&amp;#34; tall tube).  No thanks.  If this happens to you, keep your receipt and RETURN it to your local RX or beauty supply.  If I would have kept my receipt, I would have over $50 big ones (I bought 2 tubes) and money towards a more efficient product.</li>
    <li> I used it under my eyes for the fine lines, and it looks beautiful.  A little is enough, just to cover the lines, like an eye cream.  I don&#x27;t put it above the eyes on the eyelid because the product travels down and irritates the inside of my eyes, but anywhere outside of that area does look better after I use the product.  After I put my make up on, it does look like I look younger.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use this as my last step over my regular sunscreen and don&#x27;t have to worry about it reducing the sunscreens effectiveness because it also has sunscreen in it!  Brilliant!  All of the other blurring products out there do not contain full spectrum sunscreens - what&#x27;s the point of that?  Why put on a product that blurrs imperfections and makes your skin look fabulous only to have to ruin it by putting another product over it to get the proper sunscreen protection?  If you put a blurring &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;  over sunscreen you run the risk of  lowering the effectiveness of the sunscreen so it is a bad idea to use one without sunscreen as your last step.  Now some may use this as a primer under makeup and  I get that,  but if you have pretty decent skin you will not want to put anything over this because it just makes your skin look awesome.  Just put it on over your regular sunscreen to make sure you are getting good sunscreen effectiveness - now you are truly getting the best of both worlds; excellent layered sunscreen protection plus a beautiful texture and finish,  your skin but better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old Caucasian woman with minor hormonal dark spots, and I saw absolutely no &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; effect anywhere on my face. The feel of this product on my skin was disgusting. I might as well have put Crisco or Vaseline on my face. Product does not absorb at all; it just sits there, not breathing and feeling heavy and slimy. I kept waiting and trying to rub it in with disbelief as it was so greasy. I couldn&#x27;t imagine this would stay put on your face with normal daily activity. One little touch to your skin with this on it, and the product wipes right off. I first used tissues to remove the product from my skin, and even after then washing twice with facial soap and a toner, I could still feel the grease. Only &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; about this was it had no discernible scent. I don&#x27;t see how this could be used by anyone since it is so thick and slimy and would rub off onto any and everything you touched to your face.</li>
    <li> Really confused about all the negative reviews for this product. It&#x27;s amazing. All the people who gave it one star missed the entire point of the product. It&#x27;s SUPPOSED to be thick and waxy. It makes your skin matte and smooth and looks amazing. It stops your face from being oily and makes your pores disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to put it on as a last step, after all your other face products, including makeup. Yes, it&#x27;s thick and has a strange texture, but that&#x27;s how they get it to work. It&#x27;s the only product that stops my face from looking shiny. It probably isn&#x27;t that good for your skin, but I only use it when I&#x27;m going out or need to look really polished for work. It keeps your face smooth and matte all day.</li>
    <li> They sent me the wrong item (the one that didn&#x27;t have the SPF 30 I&#x27;m it) but they gladly gave me a refund.  I tried this item and it&#x27;s really good.  It gave me matte younger look. I just want the one with the sun protection. But it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> Get your money&#x27;s worth out of this cream....when it gets to the end....cut the tube in half and you will have at lease three weeks  more applications of this product!  Works great for the cold dry climate of Southern California.  It keeps your face from becoming chapped in our dry Santa Ana Winds.  To apply,rub the cream in the palm of your hand to get the cream  warm it makes it easier to smooth on your face</li>
    <li> This is the only broad spectrum SPF that I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to.  The reason is that this velvety product sits on top of the skin (doesn&#x27;t sink in).  The consistency is a little weird (it&#x27;s a paste) and hard to get out of the tube.  But I like the finish and it does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; as claimed.  I wear it every single day and finally feel my skin is protected.</li>
    <li> While not perfect, this product does help minimize fine lines. I really love it! I have used this product before, but it was less expensive by ordering it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> For those of us with Oily Skin, there are very few products that help control a shiny T-Zone.  Lancome had an amazing product line called Pure Focus. For some reason they&#x27;ve discontinued this TRUE MIRACLE BLUR.  I&#x27;ve written letters begging them to reintroduce this product line to no avail.  When I saw the L&#x27;Oreal Miracle Blur commercial, I thought my prayers had been answered. I hesitated purchasing it initially because it was $26 bucks at my local market. When I thought about it later, I thought how silly of me to balk at the price when for years I didn&#x27;t hesitate paying between $40 &amp; $50 dollars at a Lancome counter for a smaller tube of something I couldn&#x27;t live without. I then remembered that L&#x27;Oreal was the parent company of Lancome and the voice in my head told me that they (L&#x27;Oreal) suddenly decided they&#x27;d make this same product available for less money so more people could have access to this amazing skincare!!!  So, the following week I drove to every store in town only to find they had  completely sold out. So now I&#x27;m REALLY convinced, and completely freaked out.  I thought, OMG I&#x27;ve missed the boat. This must be the most amazing product ever, and everyone knows it but me. So I came here to Amazon, found a vendor and ordered Six (tubes) boxes... Well, here I sit 5 and 3 quarter tubes in hand, making an attempt to save you time and expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This product does give you a nice matt finish. I&#x27;ve read some reviewers say that it&#x27;s to thick, but I think you&#x27;re using too much.  If you wash and dry your face, then apply a thin layer, You&#x27;ll look just like they do in the commercial.... for about 5 minutes.  if you wipe the resurfacing oil from your face and apply another thin layer, you&#x27;ll be golden, again for about 5 minutes.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation so I COULD do this all day,  But who wants that?  SO , long story longer, Save your money. I&#x27;m sure there are other skin mattifiers out there that work better. I&#x27;ll keep looking, but this is no Miracle.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference! I used it everyday hoping to see some results but no I didn&#x27;t honestly see anything! Sorry!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It totally &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; fine lines and make up looks better over it and doesn&#x27;t sink in to lines after wearing. Added bonus is that it has SPF 30.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Not greasy and smells great.  I have used it for only a few days, but already see a difference in my fine lines.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this is nothing more then thick sunscreen.  no blur no hiding anything least of all fine lines.  very thick and hard to put on.  ladies do not buy this and waste your  money.  i</li>
    <li> Got the product in a timely manner but when I opened my package it was already opened not to mention there was just a tiny bit of product left in the bottle.  What little I did use did nothing for my skin I agree with other reviews do not waste your money this is a horrible product.</li>
    <li> The commercials gave me such high hopes for this product. Sadly, it did nothing but disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on and stays way too greasy. I would be willing to tolerate the grease if the product really blurred facial lines and wrinkles, as claimed. It had zero success blurring anything, from the smallest of lines and wrinkles, to the deepest. No success whatsoever. I do not recommend this product, and I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Greatest product ever!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 and I actually do like it. I never thought of it as spackle. It makes my face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt and it does seem to fill in my pores so my foundation looks more natural and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t erase my lines though. I was hoping to get some reduction of the lines around my eyes but they are still there. I do like the product though but will probably not buy again because the price is too much for the amount you get. I&#x27;d rather pay the money and go back to my Kiehl&#x27;s line reducing concentrate. It gets amazing reviews and I love it. BTW, a reviewer said she noticed some pimples popping up on her chin after using this...........me too. Just little whiteheads that I can get rid of pretty easily, but I never thought it might be the product causing it.</li>
    <li> Aptly named! Blurs out fine lines, large pores, etc. Some use it under makeup, I use it over liquid base then dust powder as usual. Just a TINY bit goes a long way. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Dont see what all the raves are, it does not work. Just noticed the expiration date on these, bought two, was 6 months after purchase. There was no expiration date shown in the description. I would not have bought two had I known it expired so quickly. One expired before I even got to use it. The expiration date shown be shown on the product description.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth it makes my skin fell. It is a little difficult to squeeze the cream out...don&#x27;t like that part. Price was considerably lower on Amazon...including FREE shipping than the stores. Really good product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a lady xi buy my foundation from.  I found Tito be like soft sparkle...for repairing dents in a car!  For me, it accentuated any imperfections. The look wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
    <li> This product didnt blur anything for me,,wasnt happy at all,,I wouldnt recomend to friends,,,not worth the money,,,also made my mascara smudge under my eyes.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream did not feel good on my skin -- the effect was slick and oily. I used a very small amount, but the ultimate effect was uncomfortable for me. When I washed my hands, it seemed to stick to my hands even after I tried to remove it. With so many wonderful products out there, I see no reason to keep using something that has a negative effect rather than a positive one. The consistency of this product needs some improvement. Perhaps an oil-free version would be better.</li>
    <li> Product was old and difficult to get out of tube. Not of the right consistency.</li>
    <li> got mine at a great price from zach1845 was a pleasure going business with him and look forward to more in the future!</li>
    <li> The product I bought had a close expiry date and i bought 2</li>
    <li> I thought thisproduct was good for fine lines. It does BLUR them. But for deeper wrinkles i didnt  notice that it helped.  It does even things out like it claims. Im not sure if i would buy it again the price was right for this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; and the one made by garnier.  I prefer the garnier for the actual blur effect but I like that this one has sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; quite as well as the garnier five second blur but I doubt if others could tell the difference.  This one is a bit heavier and a bit more oily but other than that on aging skin it works very well.</li>
    <li> The oil free version of this product is better than the one with sunscreen.  There is a difference in the appearance when you use the oil free version</li>
    <li> Tried a sample that came in a magazine and liked it, so I bought a tube to use over moisterizer, under foundation. Works well on my 57 year old skin : )</li>
    <li> No!  Not good on my greasy summer skin.  I got a lot greasier &amp; my face felt like it was broiling from the inside out.The pores spread out, too.  Nothing like more grease to define yet bigger pores. Sorry, cannot indorse this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; like it says. You can still see all my pores and fine lines. It&#x27;s basically an expensive sunblock.</li>
    <li> Love it. Yes it&#x27;s a little heavy but who cares I put it on and my pesky forehead wrinkles disappeared :)</li>
    <li> Does a good job of &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> It has a waxy texture that feels a little too heavy on the skin. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in Vogue. I thought I would give it a try since I usually use Loreal products. Fifteen minutes after applying this product my face and eyes began to burn. I had to wash my face four times to get this crap off, I could not even get it off with regular soap. It is like applying wallpaper paste to your face. Yeah, it is miracle blur, it burned my eyes so bad I could not even see my face!</li>
    <li> This product went on greasy and did nothing for my face.  It is a typical silicone product.  I put on a little and did not blur my face or wrinkles.  All it did was make my face slippery.</li>
    <li> overpriced and worst item I ever put on my face. It did nothing it claimed. The stuff is so thick and felt like I put a mix of glue and talc paste on my skin. It was heavy feeling even after hours of wear. I can not believe l&#x27;Oreal would make such a poor product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I use Benefit Porefessional and thought this would be great because it&#x27;s so much cheaper.  This product doesn&#x27;t do anything it claims to do.  It did not make my pores look smaller and in fact made the small wrinkles around my eyes MORE noticeable.  I made sure to follow the directions and even used a few different ways, before moisturizer/after moisturizer, and it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  The product always worked the same.  I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with Benefit...it may be pricey but at least it actually does what it says.</li>
    <li> I like this product and how it makes my skin feel. The 30 SPF is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Wife likes this product !</li>
    <li> Ok, just thought it would do more, but does do some smoothing.</li>
    <li> I am 55, and always looking to help blur the passage of time. This is a very thick paste like substance that felt like it was damaging my skin more then helping as I felt,like I was tugging my skin to smooth it on. I only used it a few times before discarding it.</li>
    <li> I really really love this and the moisturizer is great too. I have very dry skin and this Miracle Blur line is literally like silk on my skin. I constantly think &amp;#34;I hope they never stop making this&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> First of all, I really did buy this same 1.18 fl oz for $13 something, less a $3 coupon.  It is sitting right here as I type.  So I thought for such a low price, I would try it.  It is not really as thick as reviews would lead you to believe, and I have really greasy skin, and this is not greasy.  I would say more slick.  I put it on only 1/2 of my face, and looked in a five times magnifying mirror with a strong light.  I really could see some difference in the size of my pores, and with some Bare Minerals on top, it looked even better.  And I could feel a real difference with my finger tips also, softer and smoother.  Did it take away any wrinkles?  No.  And by the way, my next birthday will be number 70.  As much as I love Amazon (and I am an Amazon Prime junkie), I would never pay the Amazon price.  But I will buy more at WalMart when I run out.  I do notice one downside.  My face feels a little \\&quot;hot\\&quot; or closed in.  However, I often get the same feeling with other products and makeup I put on.  I will not use this every day, as I do not use makeup every day.  But I will use it whenever I put on makeup, because it does give me a much smoother finish.</li>
    <li> Ok- I did a size by side comparison. This product is fantastic for doing exactly what it claims: blurring imperfections. It is clear so it does not correct skin tone unevenness. I too found it to be this - but very smooth to apply- a little goes a long way. Under the eyes this absolutely rocks. I am a mom, runner, and work so very busy- I prefer the more modern approach to make- up- I don&#x27;t want to look &amp;#34;covered up&amp;#34; but I also don&#x27;t want to look like a slob. This product is perfect for not looking over done when you just want to do your day and not look like you are going to a cocktail event. I too have melasma and need the sun screen- I applied my 70 broad spectrum liquid and then this product along with Urban Decay stick cover pencil dotted on obvious &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; blended with a dry eye shadow blending brush and was surprised and delighted with the result.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year old caucasian who judt recently discovered frown lines and forhead lines. I am addicted to this product. I put it on and it literally erased my frown lines. I seriously look 20 after putting this on my face. Im in love!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product because it promises smoother skin with the protection of sun screen.  It suggests that within 30 seconds, I will look like a newer, better version of myself.  While there are some great things about it, I don&#x27;t know that the transformation was quite that dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on, I was startled by how thick it was.  It is almost like paste.  I thought that I might have gotten an older tube, but after talking to my friend who also got it, it appears that the product is consistently thick and almost putty-like.  It goes on clear, however, and smooths over my skin to eliminate shine.  It is supposed to reduce pores and wrinkles, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change.  The fact that it transformed my combination skin into an even complexion was impressive, though.  I put my makeup on over it, so I don&#x27;t know if it works better when used alone.&lt;br /&gt;While I appreciate that it has sunscreen, it has avobenzone as one of the leading active ingredients.  Avobenzone is great as a sunscreen, but it causes acne-prone skin to flare up after repeated use.  As a result, I won&#x27;t be using this every day.  There are definitely some great things about this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to get it.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. It does indeed help &#x27;blur&#x27;. imperfections. It makes skin feel smooth and make up glides on easier</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually really loved this product. However, I put mine on *over* my moisturizer and foundation but before my blush. I find that it mattes my entire face and really does &#x27;blur&#x27; out as promised. Also that way if you have a sensitivity to sunscreens etc, this just sits on top as a buffer and not against your skin. My make-up lasts all day. I don&#x27;t feel greasy or gooey, just soft. I have it four stars because of the price. For a drug store product, it&#x27;s pretty expensive. But I recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money....doesnt do anything its supposed to do total waste would not spend another cent on this product</li>
    <li> It works but not as drastically as expected and there is an oily feeling after application.  It could use a nicer scent!</li>
    <li> and I generally do not. I just wear powder, if anything. I thought it was supposed to \\&quot;blur\\&quot; out wrinkles, which I only have around my eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t really work for there and full face makeup just creases there and looks worse (IMHO)So, if you generally wear full face makeup, it might be worth it to rub this on first (It is heavy and kindve greasy feeling)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a moisturizer do you need to put one on then ? If you are wearing one when do you use one, before or after the miracle blur ? I think if you are not wearing a moisturizer it&#x27;s ok .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 and have mixed skin, dry in winter, oily in summer.  I live in a humid climate as well.  This really tranformed the appearance of my skin immediately.  I worried it would make me break out but even in the humid summer my skin tolerated it well.  It helps me use less foundation and makes a huge difference with pores, small wrinkles, etc.  It has a waxy consistency so your skin needs to be warm to help with even distribution.  Squeeze the tube from the top like toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products however this does NOT meet there quality.  This item is thick and hard to apply.  It is not a cream it is more like an oil based paste.  Once you do apply it there is no difference in the way your skin appears.  This is not like L&#x27;Oreal at all to sell such a low quality product. :(</li>
    <li> Surprised by the negatives.  i wear this over foundation and then add blush. I had dinner last night with my girlfriend whom I have known since sixth grade. She asked what I had done ---&amp;#34;you have this nice glow and your skin looks really smooth&amp;#34;. She is the kind of friend who is honest and who notices stuff like this.  We went out and got her a Miracle Blur.  You may have to work with it a bit in terms of quantity to apply, over or under foundation, but it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in the mail and I liked the results.  I went to Amazon and ordered some.  It is pretty good.  It covers fine lines and wrinkles without giving you that &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; look.  It is very natural on the skin.</li>
    <li> This product came and sadly was unusable. The consistency of the product wasn&#x27;t what it is supposed to be. I am not sure if it has expired of was stores at the wrong temperature, but the product is chunky and won&#x27;t spread evenly like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> The blurring effect was subtle and okay, it felt nice but shortly after I was breaking out in small red bumps in random places I don&#x27;t usually have issues with (between my eyebrows, on my lip line, my under eye area).  After scrubbing it off the bumps did not go away but I didn&#x27;t get any additional when it was removed.  I do not recommend for acne prone and/or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I use this item from the store all the time and ordered here.  Tube was dried out &amp; lotion was like granules.  Not usable</li>
    <li> The Revitalift was more than a paste than a real cream.  It was hard to squeeze out and hard to apply to my face. I think was out of date. Did not meet my expectations as it was promoted.</li>
    <li> i will use this forever!</li>
    <li> This product was not a good thing for me. I only used a pea size amount because it&#x27;s very greasy and goes a long way. It didn&#x27;t soak into my skin and caused my makeup to be greasy and build up in fine lines on my face. It also caused my skin to break out. I&#x27;m sure of this because it was the only thing I was using different. I really won&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I read some bad reviews, but like others noted, this works best when applied after you have put on your makeup.  I carry it with me everywhere and will never be without it.</li>
    <li> Unlike so many here, I really find this to be a great product.  I use it under Bare Minerals foundation and Mineral Veil, and it really holds down the shine, covers my laugh lines, reduces the look of pores and lasts all day. It is much thicker than usual moisturizers etc, but a very small amount goes a very long way. If you use too much, it will feel slick - instead, take a very small amount and rub it as far as you can go.  You will be surprised how far it stretches and how long a tube lasts, and your skin will not feel greasy or slick.</li>
    <li> I am really amazed with all the negative reviews. I LOVE this product because it did just as it promised in these first two weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the box and chose to use it under my L&#x27;Oreal foundation but over my Aveda moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Used no more than a dime size as explained. Over the moisturizer it flows onto your skin smoothly, easily and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I wait a minute or two then apply the foundation. Use L&#x27;Oreal Visible Lift Pro Retinol A+ Vitamin C foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I get from this product is an airbrushed affect on my skin that lasts at least from 8 to 10 hours&lt;br /&gt;Pores shrink, lines blur, skin perks up (I even check them in a high magnification mirror to see the difference)&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 48 and this product has brought back a glow to what was normally dull skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth a try. Follow the directions to achieve maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;Please be realistic if you have more than just fine lines don&#x27;t expect skin to go from looking 80 to 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product interacts very will with this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003A88HPY L&#x27;Oreal Paris Visible Lift Serum Absolute Advanced Age-Reversing Makeup, SPF 17, Natural Beige, 1-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product, good and bad, and decided to try it.  One review suggested to put it on OVER your make-up and I think that is the way to go.  It is not like spackle like someone said, but it is thick.  I didn&#x27;t warm it first like someone suggested, but its not a bad idea if you are a bit heavy handed.  I tried it OVER my makeup and was very happy with the results.  Use a light touch, don&#x27;t rub it in.  I put it just where my pores were most obvious and liked the results.  I also tried it UNDER my makeup and found my makeup didn&#x27;t go on well and even pulled up in places.  Thank you to the reviewer who suggested using it AFTER putting on makeup.  These reviews have really helped me on several occasions and I am grateful that people take the time to write of their experiences.</li>
    <li> So disappointed in this product from Loreal.  I love Loreal but this is nothing more than a sunscreen.  Thats it, check the ingredients.  for +$25 its just not worth the money.  However, amazon, as always was great. The product arrived early and return was super easy.</li>
    <li> I did not notice the results I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think that I would by it again.  But I do like a lot of their products.</li>
    <li> this is the first time im doing this and is worth it! i had a lipo yesterday and the doc pout some of the fat on my face because he didn&#x27;t want top waste it.&lt;br /&gt;for me it was like \\&quot;great ill have great abs and face for the same price\\&quot; naturally, this morning i woke up with a terrible skin in my face, bruises... and and had to meet someone urgently. i didn&#x27;t know what to do. by chance, i saw this product as a free sample in a magazine and decided to give it a try. it was amazing! since im a man im not comfortable with visible things, and colors (foundation?) i was amazed the person i met didn&#x27;t notice the lipoinjection in my face! so, this is perfect for me. and im gonna get more. enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice. The first time I got the greasy globs others have mentioned, and it was awful. The second time I used less than half that amount and the results are fantastic! While my forehead isn&#x27;t smoothe, it doesn&#x27;t look like an aerial map of the Grand Canyon anymore, either. My pores are much smaller, and the crags from nose to mouth that make me look like a ventriloquist dummy are gone. Thank you, L&#x27;Oreal :-)</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and described. I used it and it did improve my skin so that it looked less puffy and lined</li>
    <li> I am shocked at the poor reviews.  Maybe it depends on what kind of skin you have.  The product made my skin look smoother, softer, and overall more polished.  I didn&#x27;t get a greasy feeling.  My skin felt light and loked like it had been air brushed.  I do have naturally nice skin though so maybe that is why I had such great results.</li>
