<ol>
      <li>Just delightful.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for good/classy restaurant, opera house...</li>
      <li>Best deal for the dollar.</li>
      <li>It is also a wonderful date fragrance because it is impressionable.</li>
      <li>Great deal for price and perfect condition of the product</li>
      <li>They did great.</li>
      <li>Very good bundle with nice price</li>
      <li>The quality is outstanding and everything is perfectly ballenced in this scent.&lt;br /&gt;LONGEVITY</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, this is a GREAT smelling cologne and body wash - very sophisticated.</li>
      <li>as I DJ&#x27;ed, I noted him dancing with a bunch of girls who couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how good he smelled.</li>
      <li>I loved it</li>
      <li>I get comments all the time on how good it smells, though it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>this was amazing</li>
      <li>Hubby loved the cologne and I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>I find it best suited for the slightly more mature youth, I would say 25</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells on him also</li>
      <li>There is much better out there..</li>
      <li>The service provider made sure cologne was received before the holidays.</li>
      <li>I love using it for nights at the bar/club.  </li>
      <li>and he love this one berry much specially the girl friend</li>
      <li>and I have to say, that it&#x27;s a quite impressive sweet scent, but mostly for mature, even very mature looking man</li>
      <li>Because, I&#x27;d be looking for something better and more modern, even If I were in my 40s.</li>
      <li>This is not the original smell, and the cheap scent went away after 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>now its his and my favorite new cologne:))</li>
      <li>Unique and manly scent that lasts without overkill.</li>
      <li>Obviously because I heard/saw tons of good reviews on youtube about La Nuit L&#x27;Homme</li>
      <li>- Well, it&#x27;s sweet.</li>
      <li>Bought this product for my husband as one of his Christmas gifts last year and he loved it.</li>
      <li>I just wanted to leave a quick review on this cologne for men.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple comments about how nice this fragrance smells.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it and not even 5 minutes I was seating in a company of a 28-29yo sexy brunete in a bar on New Year Eve.</li>
      <li>It is sweet, having a slight fruit, lavender and chocolate presence yet has a strong masculine skeleton of cedar combined with a fair dash of spice.  </li>
      <li>It is just like the one in a department store but so much cheaper!</li>
      <li>It is rather difficult to explain, the best word would be contradictory.  </li>
      <li>This was first time I tried YSL.</li>
      <li>It smells diferently since the first time I bought in 2011 (I still have some to compare).</li>
      <li>; That was what I exactly needed at that moment</li>
      <li>When I first saw this product online</li>
      <li>That pretty much sealed the deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I have yet to wear it and not get a single compliment from the greater sex.  </li>
      <li>but I hope he finds another fragrance he loves just as much just to switch it up a bit.</li>
      <li>Seems to have too much alcohol...</li>
      <li>it in moderation as any real gentleman should</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Very sensual masculine scent from YSL.</li>
      <li>It turns out that the Shave Gel that they send me was actually a Shower Gel which it wasn&#x27;t on the description when I first selected the product.</li>
      <li>The younger girls were more attracted to my black outfit and</li>
      <li>The scent is a little heavy, and really good.</li>
      <li>But I / we get to enjoy it everyday,</li>
      <li>It will attract mature ladies (27+).</li>
      <li>Much more time than let&#x27;s say Armani Diamonds, Dior Higher or Zegna, and therefore it has very poor clensing</li>
      <li>subtle, clean, masculine scent-</li>
      <li>Even a hound dog could not smell this cologne on me after the initial spray.it is very watered down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought this product for my husband as one of his Christmas gifts last year and he loved it. He doesn&#x27;t wear anything else. I love the way it smells on him also but I hope he finds another fragrance he loves just as much just to switch it up a bit.</li>
    <li> Very sensual masculine scent from YSL. The spray works well but sometimes the nozzle comes off and flys around the room.</li>
    <li> This is not the original smell, and the cheap scent went away after 5 minutes. Even a hound dog could not smell this cologne on me after the initial spray.it is very watered down.</li>
    <li> Great..excellent buy.</li>
    <li> It is just like the one in a department store but so much cheaper!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to leave a quick review on this cologne for men. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you... I couldn&#x27;t pronounce it either. Of course, I don&#x27;t speak French either... Nonetheless, this is a GREAT smelling cologne and body wash - very sophisticated. I initially found it when a friend of mine was wearing it and I asked him what it was. He had to show me the bottle because he couldn&#x27;t pronounce it either. So, what sealed the deal with me on this scent was when I watched the reaction of the opposite sex to the cologne. I DJ part time, and my friend came out to my gig. He was wearing this cologne and as I DJ&#x27;ed, I noted him dancing with a bunch of girls who couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how good he smelled. That pretty much sealed the deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it in moderation as any real gentleman should and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I loved it this was amazing and i recived it before the time frame</li>
    <li> The scent is a little heavy, and really good. I have used this before. Bought one from macy&#x27;s about 2 years ago.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells gooood! My girlfriend gave me a sampler of it that she got with something else - she approves.</li>
    <li> Very good bundle with nice price</li>
    <li> It smells diferently since the first time I bought in 2011 (I still have some to compare). Seems to have too much alcohol... &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product online it said &amp;#34;Toilette Spray and Shave Gel.&amp;#34; That was what I exactly needed at that moment so I put it on my cart. When I received the product I still have some of my shave gel so I didn&#x27;t bother looking at the shave gel that I received. And back then I decided to grew a beard. Now after months with the beard I decided to shave it off. It turns out that the Shave Gel that they send me was actually a Shower Gel which it wasn&#x27;t on the description when I first selected the product. I understand that several months past by but the customer service didn&#x27;t want to help me and they can&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;m very disappointing with the misinformation and service they provide me. At least Amazon gave me a $10 credit to my account...</li>
    <li> Great deal for price and perfect condition of the product</li>
    <li> Best deal for the dollar.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son and does not to wear cologne and he love this one berry much specially the girl friend</li>
    <li> But I / we get to enjoy it everyday, subtle, clean, masculine scent- now its his and my favorite new cologne:))</li>
    <li> This cologne smells good,but to me it has the smell of an aftershave.Just OK...3 Stars..There is much better out there..</li>
    <li> This was first time I tried YSL. Obviously because I heard/saw tons of good reviews on youtube about La Nuit L&#x27;Homme and I have to say, that it&#x27;s a quite impressive sweet scent, but mostly for mature, even very mature looking man and yes, it&#x27;s a bit oldfashion. That&#x27;s why I give it 4/5. It will attract mature ladies (27+). The first time I tried it and not even 5 minutes I was seating in a company of a 28-29yo sexy brunete in a bar on New Year Eve. Not joking. The younger girls were more attracted to my black outfit and Windsor-knotted red tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY OF THE SCENT - 5/5. They did great. The quality is outstanding and everything is perfectly ballenced in this scent.&lt;br /&gt;LONGEVITY AND PROJECTION - 4/5 - This EDT projects for no more than 3 hours on my skin and stays for about 5-6 hours, but&lt;br /&gt;last hour or two, it&#x27;s close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatility 3/5 - Well, it&#x27;s sweet. And all sweet scents are for night time out or casual wear only. If some (like Dunhill Desire Red, Armani Diamonds...) I could wear at work, this one is seriously a night time scent. Perfect for good/classy restaurant, opera house... Fall and Winter scent (cool/cold weather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age - 27+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, YSL Shower gel that comes with this gift set - 3/5 - takes time to wash it off. Much more time than let&#x27;s say Armani Diamonds, Dior Higher or Zegna, and therefore it has very poor clensing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal: Do I like the EDT - yes. Would I buy it again - no. Why? Because, I&#x27;d be looking for something better and more modern, even If I were in my 40s.</li>
    <li> The service provider made sure cologne was received before the holidays. Hubby loved the cologne and I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> This was my second time purchasing &amp;#34;The Night of Man&amp;#34; and Amazon had it cheaper than retail, per usual.  I adore this fragrance.  It is rather difficult to explain, the best word would be contradictory.  It is sweet, having a slight fruit, lavender and chocolate presence yet has a strong masculine skeleton of cedar combined with a fair dash of spice.  Just delightful.  As the name suggests this is an evening fragrance.  I believe it can be pulled off any time of the year but it does garner more compliments in the cold.  On that note, women go crazy for this fragrance and I have yet to wear it and not get a single compliment from the greater sex.  I love using it for nights at the bar/club.  It is also a wonderful date fragrance because it is impressionable. I find it best suited for the slightly more mature youth, I would say 25+.  But if you are younger, have some confidence about you, and want to smell different from the Le Male/1 Million/Hollister crowd, invest. Well done YSL house, you continue to amaze me.  Buy with confidence from Amazon LLC.</li>
    <li> Unique and manly scent that lasts without overkill. I&#x27;ve had multiple comments about how nice this fragrance smells.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of the YSL Nuit L&#x27;Homme. I get comments all the time on how good it smells, though it&#x27;s not overpowering. Highly recommend.</li>
