      <li>These soaps have been great for my skin, and actually they have been good for my hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Everything is fine.</li>
      <li>Soap worked fine</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth and clean after washing it...</li>
      <li>YET I STILL FEEL THAT MY HANDS ARE GETTING CLEAN,  </li>
      <li>It needs a soap dish because it tends to drizzle charcoal-tinged rivulets that don&#x27;t appear clean.  </li>
      <li>After receiving this set, I washed my face with it and it was squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>I have super oily skin</li>
      <li>I love it, makes my skin super clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>great black soap</li>
      <li>I have to use aloe vera gel to calm my skin.</li>
      <li>It rarely itches.</li>
      <li>Coastal scents is quick with delivery and reasonably priced with their products.</li>
      <li>Used for the first time today in the shower...</li>
      <li>I still like my shower gel, so I haven&#x27;t been able to fully commit to using this daily.</li>
      <li>If you want the full benefit of the natural ingredients, just be sure to buy a brand that offers the real deal and not some chemically doctored version.  </li>
      <li>Within the first few days, I noticed that my skin was clearing up nicely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you are looking for inexpensive and natural skincare products because it works!</li>
      <li>The African black soap works great for my acne and bumps.</li>
      <li>; I have far fewer pimples and, when using it with unrefined shea butter, my skin feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Luv this soap, fast shipping</li>
      <li>since changed to a local, organic diet and along with that I&#x27;ve stated using more natural products.  </li>
      <li>Smells better than other product I&#x27;ve purchased before</li>
      <li>black soaps made strictly with the African formulas and no artificial or chemical additives are superior to other soaps and Coastal Scents, so far, is my favorite brand, followed closely by the DuDu Osun brand.</li>
      <li>I used African black soap before and loved the results.  </li>
      <li>I love coastal scents black soap.</li>
      <li>I was on the lookout for natural skincare products and heard great things about African black soap, including stories about how it helps to clear acne.  </li>
      <li>Decent soap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The ingredients of true black soap are simple and should be listed clearly and should be easy to understand, without a bunch or chemical names.  </li>
      <li>recommend trying African Black soap if you haven&#x27;t already done so, but like other soaps, you may need to try different brands until you find the one that is best for you.  </li>
      <li>and I found it to be a little drying to the skin, but overall I liked it</li>
      <li>They really do go a long way; that is to say, you get your money&#x27;s worth out of these soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a strong soap, may tingle and burn a little.</li>
      <li>I really love African black soap.</li>
      <li>I have purchased different kinds of black soaps and this one is one the more processed side.</li>
      <li>In general compared to normal harsher soaps all African black soap are much better alternatives for skin.</li>
      <li>The day after using this soap my chin was clear.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anybody for a natural way to get rid of acne</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s too early to say.</li>
      <li>It could be because I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Loyal customer of Black soap.  </li>
      <li>Love this soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other african black soaps.</li>
      <li>I will, most definitely, raise my children on black soap along with raw african shea butter.</li>

<li> Love this soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other african black soaps.</li>
<li> I will, most definitely, raise my children on black soap along with raw african shea butter.</li>
<li> I have used normal US chemical soaps my entire life; harsh soaps created with NaOH and some of them containing Triclosan.  </li>
<li> Different black soaps from different companies and from different parts of Africa or sneakily enough from us have different ingredients and qualities.</li>
<li> it got red and took a week to dry and flake off.</li>
<li> Unfortunately there are not a lot of banana trees or palm kernels available in Milwaukee</li>
<li> I will continue to repurchase for as long as they make it.</li>
<li> I use Black soap daily, different brands.</li>
<li> Be careful of “knockoffs” that have black dye and chemicals added in an attempt to get in on the trend toward the natural product.</li>
<li> And then after that a few more sharp pieces i found which annoyed me.</li>
<li> Any other regular moisturizers does not seem to stop the itching and burning.</li>
<li> I have dry, blackheads and scars on my face and body and it is helping</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t feel excessively dry either.  </li>
<li> Coastal Scents African Black Soaps with either cocoa butter or shea butter added are my favorites.  </li>
<li> One of the box package was a little open also.</li>
<li> That being said you just have to be careful when you use them on your skin without a bath rag or something to apply the soap on</li>
<li> the only problem you have to be careful because i scratched my myself because of something sharp that was in the soap (look like a piece of branch or tree not sure)</li>
<li> a few types of African Black Soap.  </li>
<li> I prefer the green bar of black African black soap.</li>
<li> It probably didn&#x27;t help that I used a wash cloth to wipe off the soap from my face, but that was never a problem with other black soaps that I have used.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, but at least 3 times a week.</li>
<li> (Coastal Scents is Ghana black soap and DuDu Osun is from Nigeria).  </li>
<li> I had also previously tried a sample of their black soap with nothing</li>
<li> I have been using black soap for years and my skin now glows.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used for the first time today in the shower...very pleased so far...I will update if needed for bragging or nagging :)</li>
    <li> Very easy to switch to cruelty free. If you wanna eat meat...that&#x27;s neither here nor there...but if you can find ANY reason to justify animal testing, well...plain and simple, you are wrong...and selfish.</li>
    <li> Love these soaps. Reasonably priced and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great soaps! And a good value!</li>
    <li> This irritated my skin...it got red and took a week to dry and flake off. It probably didn&#x27;t help that I used a wash cloth to wipe off the soap from my face, but that was never a problem with other black soaps that I have used. I now only use it in the shower and let the water rinse the soap off.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Smells better than other product I&#x27;ve purchased before</li>
    <li> I love coastal scents black soap. I order from them all the time. You can&#x27;t beat this value pack.</li>
    <li> great black soap, i see a big difference on my skin since i started using this soap and I&#x27;m only on my 2nd order of set of 3. I have dry, blackheads and scars on my face and body and it is helping</li>
    <li> this is a strong soap, may tingle and burn a little. I love it, makes my skin super clean and soft.  It evens my skintone. I will continue to repurchase for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> In general compared to normal harsher soaps all African black soap are much better alternatives for skin. Different black soaps from different companies and from different parts of Africa or sneakily enough from us have different ingredients and qualities. I have purchased different kinds of black soaps and this one is one the more processed side. Not necessarily a bad thing because it&#x27;s easier for use if your skin isn&#x27;t super sensitive and smells amazing!!!😍 I assume the put some type of oil and fragrance. I don&#x27;t know what kind because in the ingredients it doesn&#x27;t say . I prefer the un scented one . One of the box package was a little open also. NOTHING was damaged though t&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had a un scented in a pack&lt;br /&gt;Good price for 3 good sweet smelling soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: keep covered when not in use</li>
    <li> I like this soap. It needs a soap dish because it tends to drizzle charcoal-tinged rivulets that don&#x27;t appear clean.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  Nothing cleans like this stuff so I&#x27;ll spring for the soap dish. This version is a more attractive color than some other brands and it has a good smell. I especially like it for exfoliating my face. I didn&#x27;t expect to get addicted but I am.</li>
    <li> Great smell and lather.</li>
    <li> I really love African black soap. I have been using black soap for years and my skin now glows. I use it on my face and skin and it has cleared up my acne WONDERFULLY. It helps with eczema as well. It rarely itches. I will, most definitely, raise my children on black soap along with raw african shea butter.</li>
    <li> This soap cleans deep but doesn&#x27;t leave you stripped. I have super oily skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Decent soap. Skin feels good. Can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness with psoriasis or eczema, it&#x27;s too early to say. I don&#x27;t use it daily, but at least 3 times a week. I still like my shower gel, so I haven&#x27;t been able to fully commit to using this daily.</li>
    <li> I used African black soap before and loved the results.  I wanted to find a good brand at a good price.  This soap is wonderful!!  It keeps mine and my son&#x27;s eczema at bay.  Prior to using this my son would only use body wash.  His was much worse than mine and his skin was thick, dry, and cracking.  Now you couldn&#x27;t even tell he has it.  I joined the subscription service and love how I can schedule the rate of delivery.  I get six bars every three months with is perfect.  This soap is wonderful.  It does rinse brown but it&#x27;s not a big deal compared to the benefits.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap! I have had breakouts on my chin since menopause set in and little hairs that are ingrown become infected. The day after using this soap my chin was clear. I will never use anything else again.</li>
    <li> Soap worked fine I guess. I use Black soap daily, different brands. No complaints about this one.</li>
    <li> Love these soaps, They smell great such a great buy. the only problem you have to be careful because i scratched my myself because of something sharp that was in the soap (look like a piece of branch or tree not sure) And then after that a few more sharp pieces i found which annoyed me. That being said you just have to be careful when you use them on your skin without a bath rag or something to apply the soap on</li>
    <li> Everything is fine. I am happy with the purchase. I think that more and buy more than once. Thank you.</li>
    <li> MY HANDS HAD BEEN BREAKING OUT AND ITCHING WITH REGULAR SOAP.  THIS SOAP IS SOOTHING YET I STILL FEEL THAT MY HANDS ARE GETTING CLEAN,  THIS SOAP IS GENTLE AND HAS A GREAT SMELL.</li>
    <li> I was on the lookout for natural skincare products and heard great things about African black soap, including stories about how it helps to clear acne.  After receiving this set, I washed my face with it and it was squeaky clean.  Within the first few days, I noticed that my skin was clearing up nicely.  I have been using this soap for almost 2 months now and my skin is the clearest it&#x27;s ever been; I have far fewer pimples and, when using it with unrefined shea butter, my skin feels so soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you are looking for inexpensive and natural skincare products because it works!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! Have been using it for a few weeks and my skin is already clearing and brightening up--both my face and body.</li>
    <li> The African black soap works great for my acne and bumps. I would recommend it to anybody for a natural way to get rid of acne</li>
    <li> Great scents, love it</li>
    <li> Coastal Scents African Black Soaps with either cocoa butter or shea butter added are my favorites.  I had also previously tried a sample of their black soap with nothing extra added and I found it to be a little drying to the skin, but overall I liked it, so I purchased the set of 3 soaps because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black soaps made strictly with the African formulas and no artificial or chemical additives are superior to other soaps and Coastal Scents, so far, is my favorite brand, followed closely by the DuDu Osun brand. (Coastal Scents is Ghana black soap and DuDu Osun is from Nigeria).  These soaps have been great for my skin, and actually they have been good for my hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying African Black soap if you haven&#x27;t already done so, but like other soaps, you may need to try different brands until you find the one that is best for you.  If you want the full benefit of the natural ingredients, just be sure to buy a brand that offers the real deal and not some chemically doctored version.  The ingredients of true black soap are simple and should be listed clearly and should be easy to understand, without a bunch or chemical names.  Be careful of “knockoffs” that have black dye and chemicals added in an attempt to get in on the trend toward the natural product.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  My skin feels so smooth and clean after washing it... it doesn&#x27;t feel excessively dry either.  PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Luv this soap, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love this soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other african black soaps.</li>
    <li> This is nice soap. Helps with acne, dark spots, discoloration, but it burns! I have to use aloe vera gel to calm my skin. Any other regular moisturizers does not seem to stop the itching and burning. I can use this soap daily, but I just can&#x27;t stand the irritation. It could be because I have sensitive skin. Still is a good medicated soap. I prefer the green bar of black African black soap.</li>
    <li> Loyal customer of Black soap.  Coastal scents is quick with delivery and reasonably priced with their products.</li>
    <li> I have used normal US chemical soaps my entire life; harsh soaps created with NaOH and some of them containing Triclosan.  I was quite understood why my skin hurt all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since changed to a local, organic diet and along with that I&#x27;ve stated using more natural products.  Unfortunately there are not a lot of banana trees or palm kernels available in Milwaukee (because I like to buy local).  But this is simply the best soap there is.  I can&#x27;t say I remember a time in my life where my skin was as healthy as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a great starter kit.  It&#x27;s been a great introduction a few types of African Black Soap.  I&#x27;ve had the bars for a month, and have just started the second bar.  They really do go a long way; that is to say, you get your money&#x27;s worth out of these soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
