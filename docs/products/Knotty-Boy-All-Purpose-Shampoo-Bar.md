<li> I had to tell them the bad news</li>

    <li> Wish the smell lasted.  Worked great on dreads.  Works great on short, textured hair/mohawks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have longer, non-dreaded hair, I&#x27;d avoid using it.  Just not made for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works okay as a bath soap too, though a bit drying.</li>
    <li> I used this last night and loved it. It smells really good and lathered up much better than liquid dread soap/shampoo. I usually use DreadHead HQ products, but this one is definitely worth making a switch to try it. I will be staying with this as my regular shampoo from now on out. I ordered the Patchouli Love scent, and my dreads smell much nicer and felt more clean that with the DreadHead HQ liquid soap/shampoo. Highly recommend it to any one making a switch.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Working great.</li>
    <li> mom asked me to order this for her because our local shop stopped selling it but it was a different brand.  she&#x27;s happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> as expected, and fast delivery! thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this soap to bathe with and not used it on my hair yet. But even if it isn&#x27;t good for my hair, which I can&#x27;t imagine it NOT being, I am more than happy to use it as body soap. The other two people I live with thought they were going to be able to use it too. They loved it!! I had to tell them the bad news-they had to get their own. It smells scrumptious. Not a strong patchouli smell but still, a very nice, earthy smell which is what I go for. I will buy it again. That&#x27;s for sure. And BTW-It&#x27;s a hard soap so will last longer than the soaps that get all soft and almost melt when they get wet. I do though hope it helps my hair to dread-I&#x27;m having a really tough time with that.</li>
    <li> I really love the way that this smells, it gets my newly formed dreads clean and leaves them smelling amazing for like two days!!!! Well worth it!</li>
    <li> Cleans very well and smells like patchouli during sudsing. However, very little scent (if any) is left on hair left after rinsing. Thus only four stars instead of five.</li>

    <li> This stuff smells so good! Everytime I use it my whole bathroom smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Good smelling soap.  I didn&#x27;t use it to wash my locs but it was of good use to bathe with in the shower.  Lasted for about 2 1/2 weeks.  Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I really love knotty boy shampoo. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used anything other than the mint, and I gotta say it smells AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered both this soap and the dreadlock starter kit. Both of them arrived when they were supposed to and work great. The every body soap lasts a long time and smells great. The scent will stay in your hair the whole day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who loves patchouli, it was a bit too sweet for him, more of a girlie  scent but nice all the same.</li>

    <li> I bought this to use at the gym so I wouldn&#x27;t need soap and shampoo. It does exactly what I wanted it to do and smells great! I am not looking for dreads - just clean and good smelling hair!</li>
    <li> Nice product, above expectations. Should be ordering more soon and will try more of their products when the time comes</li>
