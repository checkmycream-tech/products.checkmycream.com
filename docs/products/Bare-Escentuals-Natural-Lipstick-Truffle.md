      <li>I liked the color, a brown orange tint.  </li>

      <li>It is a nice chestnut color - soft brown with warm undertones.  </li>
      <li>Was happy to get my 2nd tube of this lipstick color, Truffle.  </li>
      <li>Reminded me of cheap old-lady lipstick.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and delivers a good coat of color.</li>
      <li>LOVE THE COLOR.STAYS ON PRETTY WELL.</li>
      <li>Lipstick arrived damaged the lipstick was stuck to the top of the lid when I opened it looked to me like it had gotten to hot and melted in the lid</li>
      <li>Truffle seems an odd name for this color, makes me think brown or beige but its really more of a tan rose color.</li>
      <li>Arrived in timely manner, even it was lighter than expected it was a nice color that I like very much!!</li>
      <li>It isnt heavy and feels great on my lips.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;d try it again just to make sure this wan&#x27;t a mistake as I really like Bare Escentuals Lipsticks...</li>
      <li>The first one, I bidded on it on tophatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henrietta</li>
      <li>This is my second one:-)</li>
      <li>Never flakes and never dries out my lips..very smooth, natural color.</li>
      <li>The lipstick has a funny smell to it</li>
      <li>Also the quality of the lipstick is much like a chapstick consistency.  </li>
      <li>But I really like the color and</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this brand and color!</li>
      <li>The formula is kind of heavy and matte,</li>
      <li>when you get older you may not want all that  shine and sparkle stuff in your makeup.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell old and dated but it doesn&#x27;t even go on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It is a very natural color</li>
      <li>My issue is that its the exact same color as my lips..</li>
      <li>It was a little dry but still works nicely.  </li>
      <li>That is the only positive thing I can say.</li>
      <li>The lipstick from this seller was old.  </li>
      <li>Directly in the trash.</li>
      <li>Ordered 3 of these and was sent 3 purple powder eye shadows, each in a plastic bag marked as lipstick.  </li>
      <li>The color was posted as a brown/pink..its really an orange brown and has a strange odor..</li>
      <li>Difficult to describe, but definitely a natural tone for those with fair complexions and not a lot of natural pink in their lips.</li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals has been my go to lipstick for YEARS.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out my lips.</li>

<li> Not sure why.  </li>
<li> The lipstick was completely encased in a plastic wrapper which was almost impossible to remove.</li>
<li> It goes on thick - not a gloss.  </li>
<li> Next the lipstick itself was broken within the case making it virtually impossible to use.</li>
<li> but it arrived tasting stale!  </li>
<li> when it arrived it was broke at the base and have to use a brush to get it out</li>
<li> So disappointed!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>
<li> The packaging is awful.</li>

    <li> I have tried everywhere to find my now discontinued favorite lipstick and low and behold I found it in Amazon . Was thrilled to get it .</li>
    <li> Was happy to get my 2nd tube of this lipstick color, Truffle.  It is a great color.  I have a medium complexion, blond, blue eyes.  Goes great with reds, browns, tawny colors.  Not too red, not too harsh, but still a reddish color.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLOR.STAYS ON PRETTY WELL.</li>
    <li> The lipstick from this seller was old.  It had an odd odor and would not apply due to the lipstick being dry.  Wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. Never flakes and never dries out my lips..very smooth, natural color.</li>
    <li> The truffle color is my favorite lipstick color from Bare Escentuals.  It is the perfect color for someone with a fair or medium complexion. It&#x27;s not too brassy.  It is a great color for blondes or burnettes.  It is the perfect &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; color.  Also the quality of the lipstick is much like a chapstick consistency.  Highly recommend this brand and color!</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell old and dated but it doesn&#x27;t even go on smoothly.  Very disappointed.  It did however come nicely sealed.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is long lasting and beautiful. It has this caramel color to it that fits nice with my olive complexion.</li>
    <li> It is a nice chestnut color - soft brown with warm undertones.  It goes on thick - not a gloss.  The downside is it has an off-putting smell.  Not sure why.  Reminded me of cheap old-lady lipstick.  But I really like the color and how even when it starts to wear off it looks nice - doesn&#x27;t settle into cracks or look patchy.</li>
    <li> I do like this color, Its a very beautiful color... My issue is that its the exact same color as my lips.. I guess my skin complexion is truffle because you cannot tell once i put it on.. I am a brown skin female and I cannot tell once the lipstick is applied. So for all you brown skin ladies out there this may not be the one for you.!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lipstick.  It is a very natural color and I use it for everyday wear.  It isnt heavy and feels great on my lips.  I am definately ordering this color again</li>
    <li> The lipstick has a funny smell to it and it goes on very dry.  I love the color and thought it would be a good product because of the brand, but I&#x27;m probably never going to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love the color and the lipstick stays on .But when it arrived it was broke at the base and have to use a brush to get it out</li>
    <li> Beautiful color but not for&lt;br /&gt;Me. It doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone but I&#x27;m sure others will love it.&lt;br /&gt;Looks too orangey on me</li>
    <li> This has been discontinued. so I ordered 5 tubes. its my favorite color. I really hate it when companies discontinue a product that I love and have used for years! it has a matte finish too. when you get older you may not want all that  shine and sparkle stuff in your makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product. The perfect color and quality</li>
    <li> Great color, good product...but it arrived tasting stale!  Yucky taste, even though the product was sealed.  I&#x27;d try it again just to make sure this wan&#x27;t a mistake as I really like Bare Escentuals Lipsticks...</li>
    <li> Color not like picture</li>
    <li> Lipstick arrived damaged the lipstick was stuck to the top of the lid when I opened it looked to me like it had gotten to hot and melted in the lid</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. That is the only positive thing I can say. The packaging is awful. The lipstick was completely encased in a plastic wrapper which was almost impossible to remove. Once I did it left a sticky film on the outside case. Next the lipstick itself was broken within the case making it virtually impossible to use. I did manage to dab on one application. It was dry, sticky and smelled old. Obviously an expired product. Since it is an add-on product I will not even bother to take the trouble to return it. Directly in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great deal on a primo lipstick!  Arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Truffle seems an odd name for this color, makes me think brown or beige but its really more of a tan rose color. Difficult to describe, but definitely a natural tone for those with fair complexions and not a lot of natural pink in their lips. The formula is kind of heavy and matte, no gloss or shimmer to it and maybe a little dry. I use it along with a lip balm and it works well. Good staying power and nice natural tone for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 of these and was sent 3 purple powder eye shadows, each in a plastic bag marked as lipstick.  Have tried multiple times to reach Amazon for return information, but this is apparently not returnable.  So disappointed!</li>
    <li> The color was posted as a brown/pink..its really an orange brown and has a strange odor..</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals has been my go to lipstick for YEARS. Now I found my color in the price range I&#x27;m willing to pay. It&#x27;s soft and delivers a good coat of color. Does not dry out my lips.</li>
    <li> It was a little dry but still works nicely.  I liked the color, a brown orange tint.  Not too bright.</li>
    <li> Regulary sells for $16.00 in the store, so when you only pay $6.00 you should not be surprised when it goes on dry and feels dry!</li>
    <li> It arrived falling apart.  I received a refund.</li>
    <li> This is my second one:-) I love the color. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. The first one, I bidded on it on tophatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henrietta</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely manner, even it was lighter than expected it was a nice color that I like very much!!</li>
