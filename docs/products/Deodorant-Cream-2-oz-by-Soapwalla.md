      <li>most times, I just have to take the plunge on a new product and hope for the best and learn from the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>then this is a great natural product that works and smells like a pleasant dream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was surprised to read about all the rash issues with this product. I&#x27;ve reordered it twice now with no evidence of rash whatsoever. In fact, I probably put more on than I need, just out of my own need to feel sure every inch is covered. But I have found that I can wash my pits, apply the product, then I&#x27;m odor-free for three days. On the morning of the fourth day, there is a slight start of an odor, so I wash and re-apply. This has held true the whole time I&#x27;ve been using it! Very consistently effective for me. It&#x27;s a great product, and I hope new shoppers won&#x27;t let the rash issue stop you from giving it a try. It seems less is better for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant! Smells great, you don&#x27;t need more than a pea size. Works all day with no funky odor</li>
    <li> Application is a little messy (by hand being by far the best way I have found) but it works very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to increase sweat production when I don&#x27;t wear it, as most antiperspirants do.</li>
    <li> I like the effectiveness of the cream but I wish you didn&#x27;t have to use your finger to apply it.</li>
    <li> After many years of using antiperspirant/deodorant I developed an allergy.  Extreme itching and rash under the arms.  Unfortunately this product seemed to make the rash worse.  Very surprising given the natural ingredients it contains.  I also did not like the smell of the product.  It does go away after it&#x27;s on for a while.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I could not use it.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all!!! In fact, I smelled worse by lunch time than I&#x27;ve ever smelled before. Disappointing waste of money!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this stuff,  but alas it is not meant to be after all. I love the smell,  so I guess that&#x27;s something,  but that&#x27;s where the warm fuzzies end. I broke out in a rash after the first use so I didn&#x27;t use it for a few days till my pits cleared up. I read a couple of reviews suggesting that you balance the skins pH with vinegar first,  so I did that and gave it another go. Oh boy did my poor pits suffer! Not only did the rash return but it also looked like I got a chemical burn from the vinegar/soapwalla combo! What the heck? Maybe my skin is too sensitive for this product, and I&#x27;m bummed about it.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple natural deodorants and found this one was by far the best. I can even work out in it (although I still sweat as this isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant).&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to a friend who experienced the rash others complain about. I didn&#x27;t and am happy with product. Although, an applicator would be nice!</li>
    <li> I recently became allergic to something in a lot of commercial deodorants and I&#x27;ve been trying different brands with as limited ingredients as I can find to see what works for me.  This really works on odor.  I don&#x27;t have an issue at all when I use this.  It does work a little on wetness as well.  I like the smell a lot.  I do react to it a bit, so I alternate it with another brand.  I didn&#x27;t knock off a star for that because I don&#x27;t think blaming a product for my sensitive skin is fair.  I would buy again, and I would buy other products from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant because it&#x27;s got great staying power and lasts throughout my 8 hour (sometimes longer) shifts at work. The only thing that bugs me is sometimes the oiliness sticks to my shirts and I have to wash them more often than necessary, but I think most deodorants will do that depending on the amount used. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and has a pleasant odor compared to some natural deodorants, lol. I have purchased this item about 4 times since June (2014) and intend to be a life-long customer!</li>
    <li> Excellent natural product and it works!! Never any odor issues. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant that works for me!  It is long lasting, no B.O, and I never developed a rash from it.  The smell is ok (lavender, peppermint/teatree) not my favorite, but as long as it works!!  The only con for me is that it’s pricey, but like the other reviews say a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant I use, and I recommend it to friends and family all the time! So long as you&#x27;re not bothered by manual application (I mean, why would you be? It&#x27;s your own armpit) then this is a great natural product that works and smells like a pleasant dream. You may need to reapply once throughout the day, but that&#x27;s a small trade off for a product that won&#x27;t harm you. Highly recommended. (also the seller is FAST and always sends a lovely package with some free samples!)</li>
    <li> I had grown accustomed to the idea that I would just have to suffer with being stinky halfway through the day. NOT SO! Since I have started using Soapwalla, a few weeks ago, I have been stink free! I mean all day long! I live in Arizona where temperatures reach 110 on a regular daily basis in Summer, and it&#x27;s July 14th and I can tell you that this stuff works under extreme conditions. I don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about it. And for those who are worried about having to apply it with your hands, it takes no time getting used to, and honestly I feel like I have more control over the amount used and exactly where it is applied.  I actually prefer to apply it by hand.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, thank you SOAPWALLA! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! My life is forever changed :)</li>
    <li> First, I didn&#x27;t buy this through Amazon.  I bought it through an online boutique personal care product site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.  I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t care to smell like lavender, but I was accepting of the scent after a few uses.  I was almost finished with my first jar and purchased another 3 jars to save on shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into my second jar, I developed a large boil under my right armpit and soon after two or three additional boils began developing.  I stopped using the product.  Weird thing is, days after stopping use of the product, I developed another large boil under my left armpit.  I now have a scar under both armpits because of the boils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient caused the boils, but needless to say, this isn&#x27;t the product for me.</li>
    <li> Did not cause irritation but was not an effective deodorant substitute for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I&#x27;m allergic to baking soda in other natural deodorants and I have been looking for something that has a substitute that works as well as the baking soda but have not been able to find anything that works until now. This deodorant has corn starch. I sweat a lot so I&#x27;m so excited that this product keeps it under control.</li>
    <li> I found this product while searching for a natural deodorant.  Initially I was put off by the cost but am convinced it&#x27;s well worth the $14 I&#x27;ve paid, especially when taking into account the free and fast shipping from Amazon via Beautyhabit.  A small pot lasts me between 5 and 6 months, bringing the daily cost to less than 10 cents, but I&#x27;ve saved far more than that in laundry and dry cleaning costs.  For some reason, my body chemistry combined with most deodorants, even the so called crystal types, causes silk and rayon blouses to STINK.  It was impossible to wear them more than once without cleaning before I found Soapwalla.  Now, things can go back in the closet for several wearings, even a whole season before needing to be dry cleaned.  For me, the stuff really works.  And while the fragrance is pleasant, it&#x27;s very subtle and I don&#x27;t notice it once it&#x27;s on.  And I have a fairly sensitive nose.  Masculine guys would be comfortable with the slightly sweet smell -it doesn&#x27;t linger.    Possibly more important is what&#x27;s in, and what&#x27;s not in, the formula.  I&#x27;m an oncology nurse and am constantly on the lookout for personal care products that aren&#x27;t harmful.  I&#x27;ve gifted this to family and to chemo patients in an attempt to introduce them to more natural formulas.    I read some negative reviews citing the texture and cost.  I&#x27;ll admit to initially being a bit put off by the somewhat grainy consistency but I realize now I was using too way too much.  Here&#x27;s what you do - with the tip of your ring finger, smear up an amt literally no greater than a baby sweet pea. Or a lentil.  Not much, less than you&#x27;d think. Then rub it into a clean, just showered pit.  If your skin is still slightly damp that&#x27;s all the better.  The graininess disappears in about two seconds.  And there you go. At this rate your 14 dollar pot of great deodorant will be CHEAP because it will last so long AND it will do a good job for you AND your body will thank you, too, because you aren&#x27;t alteringyour personal chemistry with things that aren&#x27;t good for you.</li>
    <li> Works for me during the colder months but not during summer I fear. The paste is easy to scoop up using your finger but feels gritty rubbing into the skin.</li>
    <li> I was having issues with the reddening armpits in the general itchiness that this deodorant cause. But then I read on crunchy Betty&#x27;s blog that the pH of my under arms maybe off due to the fact that I was using a natural deodorant. The cure was to balance my pH with a mix of apple cider vinegar and water before applying this deodorant. Now I have no more itchy under arms or reddening of my armpits.</li>
    <li> This is the first vegan deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that actually stops odor and some sweat.  But I have sensitive skin and I have to be very careful when applying because this stuff is strong (maybe the peppermint?).  Definitely listen to their advice about not using it the day you shave.  I use a very small amount and mix it with some hand moisturizer when I put it on, which usually works.  I do sometimes get irritated skin and my skin gets redder or darker when I use it too much/often.  But it&#x27;s good if you know you&#x27;re gonna be sweating all day and you can plan that around your shaving routine.  Also, since I use such a small amount, the one tub lasts a long time (like a year).</li>
    <li> I actually love this stuff. It works very well, so I&#x27;m incredibly bummed that I can&#x27;t use it. It makes my pits break out in a terrible rash, which is really an awful place to have a rash. I thought something all natural and chemical free wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin (the reason I&#x27;ve been going chemical free). It&#x27;s not necessarily the products fault, perhaps I have an allergy to an ingredient, so I will still give this product 4 stars.</li>
    <li> It works and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> After some use I may change this to five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works. I sweat a lot and this stuff keeps me stink free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Avilin deodorant cream (it works but it has a stinky/chemical like smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the Crystal (rock form) which DID NOT work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I tried Alba Botanica - Clear Enzyme Deodorant Stick Lavender and I often caught whiffs of my stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soapwalla is the FIRST natural deodorant that works for me. It&#x27;s not cheap but so far it&#x27;s worth the investment. If you are looking for a natural deodorant this is a great product. Also, I like that it&#x27;s clear, whereas L&#x27;Avilin left a clay/white residue.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant.  I have been using Tom&#x27;s for awhile, but it doesn&#x27;t last a full day.  I do get a stinky smell because I walk a lot, so I need something that works.  I do not want to use aluminum products because of the association with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.  This deodorant goes on smooth and keeps me dry and lovely-smelling for 24 hours.  I love the feel, the scent, and the way it goes on.  If there is a little left on my finger, I just rub it into my hands because I love the smell.  Superior product, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> NOTHING!! :) When I first put it on, the scent of tea tree oil and mint is pretty strong, but it only lasts a few minutes and then I smell nothing. No baby powder, no teen spirit, no floral splendor, and most importantly, no BO… just glorious nothing!  I have been searching for a natural deodorant for YEARS (much to the dismay of my husband)!! Nothing worked.  Heck, I even have a hard time finding a conventional deodorant - filled with chemicals - that actually works. Even with &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants, I would still sweat and stink! I am a sweaty girl… no sugar-coating it.&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear: Soapwalla is NOT an antiperspirant, nor does it claim to be. The antiperspirant (the aluminum) is what we are trying to avoid by buying the natural deodorants. So, while I will still sweat, I FINALLY do not stink! This stuff is magic. It seems pricey, but will last a long time since you only need about a pea-sized amount, so in the long run it really isn&#x27;t any more expensive than the chemical-filled stuff in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have found another natural deodorant called Truly&#x27;s that is also working wonders! I think Soapwalla works a tad better for me, but can be a little drying, while Truly&#x27;s is a little easier on the sensitive pits. I plan to use the Truly&#x27;s during the winter months when my skin is more dry, and the Soapwalla in the summer when I need a little extra power. I&#x27;ve been going back and forth between them for about 3 weeks, and they are both great!</li>
    <li> This cream deodorant is really good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to use a deodorant with aluminum, I used a crystal for years even though I knew that it was not working well for me.  I still had a BO scent left on my clothing, and would be able to smell myself at the end of the day.  Not good especially if you don&#x27;t want to leave a bad impression.  Forget summers and working out with the crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about making a natural type deodorant, but somehow came across Soapwalla&#x27;s cream deodorant.  No more odor at the end of the day!  I am scent sensitive and do not like lavender at all, but this peppermint and lavender scented cream does not bother me at all.  Even though it may not totally control wetness since it is not considered an antiperspirant, I still love it, and do not feel uncomfortable in the least.  However, it will be interesting to see how well it works during a hot CA summer.  It has not, as some reviewers wrote, caused any rash or burning sensation.  I do have sensitive skin and have suffered from allergies in the past, so I&#x27;m happy to report that I am not affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put in a reorder for 2 more!</li>
    <li> This is working for me since I had an infection under one arm and now cannot use harsh, commercial deodorants....seems to keep the body odor down and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have found this cream to be very effective at stopping odor. It does have a tendency to cause a rash so I don&#x27;t recommend using it directly after shaving or if there is sensitive or broken skin on the area where you intend to apply it. Other than this, I have had no problems with the product and would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking a good deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an alternative to traditional deoderant for a long time. The natural deoderants usually make my skin break out very badly and it&#x27;s quite uncomfortable. This is a great option for me! It doesnt seem to irritate my skin and its easily applied- a little goes a long way- and it actually feels pretty good on my skin. It smells pretty strongly of tea tree oil but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants- Tom&#x27;s, Jason, Earth Science, and too many others. This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used and feel comfortable wearing all day. I sweat more than before since it&#x27;s a deodorant and not an antiperspirant. That takes a little getting used to. It&#x27;s never where it&#x27;s visible through my shirt (it is still winter, though.) I got a little rash in a crease in my armpit. Like others, I applied a little less which works perfectly. I use less than a pea size amount per armpit. Maybe half a pea is my best attempt at giving instructions here.&lt;br /&gt;The only warning I would say is to be sure to wash your hands well after applying. I put face lotion on shortly after without thinking, and I got a horrible rash on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do now, is I own Honest brand deodorant and this. I apply this right after the shower. The I spritz the Honest brand when I head out. Works wonderfully this way for me.</li>
    <li> The best Deodorant ever!!! I have used pharmaceutical deodorant and they have never worked for me and I just can&#x27;t say enough on how much I LOVE this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was buying this thinking it would likely not work well, but at least it was natural. But it exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;It just works. No smell whatsoever at the end of the day, even when I have been sweating lots. By the way, it does keep my a bit drier too eventhough it is not an anti perspirant. I told my husband who is not inot natrual products to try it and he could not believe how well this worked. Now he uses it too and I wish they would sell a bigger jar.</li>
    <li> Works no better than any other natural deodorant on the market and still MUCH less effective than &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; deodorant.  I didn&#x27;t give it one star because it does give some very mild protection against odor but even after very minimal sweating this stuff is rendered powerless in a couple hours.  Would need to wash my underarms and reapply three times a day to stay smell-free.  Given that other &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; salt or glycerin based products retail for roughly $2.00 a pop at the grocery or health food store and work just about the same, I can&#x27;t say I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used - much better than an other product such as Mitchums or any other brand filed with chemicals. Following a lumpectomy, my Dr. insisted I use only a natural product.  After many tries, I found this wonderful brand.  It works for days in between showers.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this deodorant 2 years ago after reading glowing reviews how &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; this deodorant cream was. It cost $10.00. Now it is $14.00 -- interesting! First of all, the cream didn&#x27;t work at all. I sweat even more after applying it in my armpits. Secondly, it caused an extensive rash in my armpits. I have normal skin, and have never experienced a rash in my armpits. This cream must have some very irritating ingredients. Probably essential oils which are well-known skin irritants. The cream ended up in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a natural deodorant for OVER a year and can safely say that this is the most amazing and effective product on the market! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I had to stop using regular deodorants due to strange reactions I was getting like nerve pain.  I&#x27;ve also been doing my research and I am convinced that aluminum is toxic. I have been on an epic search to find a natural deodorant that actually works and meets my ingredient standards.  It&#x27;s been really frustrating and I didn&#x27;t think it was possible until I tried Soapwalla.  I still sweat but it&#x27;s a lot less and for the first time in a year, I don&#x27;t stink!  I am seriously in awe and so grateful to find a natural deodorant that works.  I even got a written note from the owner thanking me for the purchase.  The downside is that sometimes I get a little irritation but it&#x27;s temporary and doesn&#x27;t happen often.  I am hoping that it comes out in different fragrances.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, BUT so sad today. I have been using it for over a month and have developed an uncomfortable red armpit rash in the last few days. I am not allergic or sensitive to anything that I know of but see that some others have had reaction as well...possibly to baking soda, which I thought to be pretty benign. Anyway...I am not giving up completely, but will be stopping my use - maybe switch back to my LaVanilla for a bit to see if it goes away and try again to confirm? Ugggg.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant. I&#x27;ve been vegan for 16 years, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different types of deodorants and antiperspirants. This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually works, contains no harmful chemicals, and didn&#x27;t test on innocent animals. I stock up on this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that does exactly as it claims. While it is not an antiperspirant, I find it does keep me dryer than other deodorants. The cream dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily or sticky residue.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used (after trying a lot of other options). If you haven&#x27;t tried it and are frustrated with other natural alternatives, definitely try this at least once! I&#x27;ve given this to a couple friends who have given up on deodorant entirely due to sensitivity and both were delighted with this stuff and reported no issues. But I gather from other reviews that this isn&#x27;t the case for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important stuff!&lt;br /&gt;- No residue on clothes&lt;br /&gt;- Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;- Stops smell. You smell a little &amp;#34;musty&amp;#34; I would say just before it yields to your awesome power.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not sure it reduces the amount of sweat all that much - but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;- Each container lasts about 4-5 months for me.&lt;br /&gt;- For me - no sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;- Washes off nicely (not like antiperspirants that can take real scrubbing to remove)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Well ... it is amazing - but it&#x27;s no Old Spice Antiperspirant.  There&#x27;s just no topping old spice.  I would just never smell with that stuff. Never ever. ever. ever. ever. One time I even remarked how my running shirt smelled like cookies after repeated use ...&lt;br /&gt;- Application is a little weird, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;- If it&#x27;s below about 50-60 F you may have to dig a little out and warm it up.&lt;br /&gt;- If it&#x27;s above about 85 F it starts to get a little runny - no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s kinda pricey.&lt;br /&gt;- Pretty tough to put apply this while wearing a shirt - as in tough to put on as you&#x27;re running out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY other stuff that was even passable as an alternative for me was the crystal style. Sure it&#x27;ll last forever, but it seems to make you sweat quite a bit more (though with a lot less odor) and application is time consuming.</li>
    <li> Love natural things but it is smaller than I had expected. Love the natural scent and love how easy the cream goes on and stays on. Lasts for about 12hrs for me because I&#x27;m used to deorderants that aren&#x27;t good quality. Highly suggest if you wanna pay more for your body to be healthy and ditch the aluminum that is in most deorderants you can get from walmart or target.</li>
    <li> I bought this bc of natural ingrediants and size - I travel a lot. Even when sitting on my bathroom shelf - when you picked it up the outside would be cover with oil. When you opened the top the product was the consistence of a wax - similar to a wax product you would use for firm hair styling. Smelled good and controlled smell all day. But when traveling I kept it in its own zip lock - thank goodness bc there was oil everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally not usable.</li>
    <li> Excellent , last the whole day even if you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;And I teach and practice Bikram yoga.love it so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of outstanding reviews of this deodorant and although it&#x27;s only about 85% up to the task, I would like to put you at ease about using your hands for the application.  My initial fear was that it would wick all moisture from my hands and I would need to wash it off with soap and then immediately lotion them which turned out not to be the case.</li>
    <li> I have never, ever, EVER found a deodorant that could keep me feeling and smelling fresh from morning to late night, but this is the one.  I simply could not believe it...I sweat a lot, and didn&#x27;t really believe the reviews that said it worked until I tried it myself.  To this day, after a couple of years of use, I still marvel at this astonishing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different, so I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t solve everyone&#x27;s issue, the same way any product (like perfumes/colognes) that collides with each person&#x27;s unique bio-nature will have a different effect on different folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have insanely sensitive skin, and I assumed the initial rash was unique to me, as just about any new product has the potential to give me a rash/chemical-burn (and I&#x27;ve reacted to almost every deodorant/anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve ever tried, organic/all-natural or not)...most times, I just have to take the plunge on a new product and hope for the best and learn from the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when the rash began to occur (it wasn&#x27;t immediate for me, but after some build-up), I tried a trick I&#x27;ve used on a number of products that I initially reacted to: I basically built up my tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used it every other day, or every few days, and eventually my body learned to tolerate it.  When the rash would appear, I&#x27;d take some time off and start again.  I now use it consistently every day and never have any redness/rash/reaction...and I&#x27;ve been reactive-free for almost two years (it took a couple of months for my body to adjust).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was well worth the effort because Soapwalla is one of those products that comes pretty close to perfection for me.  (I hate paying shipping, and I think the direct purchase shipping is a tad high, so I run around Los Angeles to purchase it depending on who has it in stock.)</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum most of my life, a pretty heavy duty Anti-Perspirant and as I have aged, I have wanted to get off the aluminum products, even though there still continues to be some questionable results on whether there are long term effects or not.  Mitchum works great and I never had a worry with it.  When I switched to the deodorant solutions, I had little success staying odor free.  The fact that I have been hot flashing for the last 5 years has not helped the situation, but I was just about ready to give up, since I have tried many products.  In searching blogs once again for potential alternatives, I saw this product mentioned several times and decided to buy it.  I kept passing it over because I was turned off about having to stick my finger in the container to apply it.  When I received it the product had separated, and I was concerned, but I read the directions (and this is not an off nominal condition) got a q-tip, mixed it up, and the next day it was solid.  It absolutely works and actually, it works as long as the mitchum does. That is, multi-day.  I still have no odor, even after my long runs.  I did get a bit of a rash under one arm, but followed some feedback from other reviewers to just put a bit of coconut oil on before applying and that healed it right up.  I do wonder if the clays and all clog pores, but I am having no problems and again, it really works.</li>
    <li> This is literally the worst thing I have put on my body. It&#x27;s basically perfumed lotion. I&#x27;ve used it for a week and my pits and the skin around them are breaking out like crazy. As for the smell...it&#x27;s just a mask. It&#x27;s like febreezing your pits. This is horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found, and I have tried a LOT. Most left me stinky by mid day, some didn&#x27;t even make it through morning. This one lasts all day long. Only drawback is that it has made the skin under my arms flake and peel a bit. (Other natural deodorants did too) I think either I needed to get acclimated to it or alternating 1-2 days a week with just coconut oil has helped.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. My wife is from Germany and has an unusually pungent naturalness to her. She also channels stress into sweat which creates problems for her clothes. Since she started using the deodorant cream a few months ago, she has had zero odor issues, and no longer sweats profusely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for application: wash and dry your underarms before applying - key word being, dry. Also keep it in a cool place as it is made from natural ingredients and will &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; occasionally.</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for a deodorant that actually work without using aluminum (anti-perspirant).  So far this is the best product.  It takes a little getting use to smearing the paste under your arms, but by the end of the day I no longer smell like a stinky French woman (thats what my boyfriend said I use to smell like).</li>
    <li> I am allergic to everything but not this deoderant. I tried every natural deoderant on theshelves. None of them kept me from smelling bad. I read about this brand in a magazine and decided to give it a try. I never smell bad and I don&#x27;t itch anymore! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of using an all natural deodorant. I will say I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It goes on silky smooth and protects me all day. I will be recommending this product to all of my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first jar of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it effective enough, but not particularly special. The smell is pleasant, and on a normal (non-cardio workout) day one application would get me through &#x27;til the end of the day. By the next morning I&#x27;d be smelly again, but that seems like a reasonable deodorant limitation to me. The strength of this deodorant is better than others that I&#x27;ve used (looking at you, Tom&#x27;s of Maine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did occasionally get slightly irritated underarms (not something I&#x27;m accustomed to), but this never became severe and never persisted for more than a day, so it never became something that I had to address or think about much. Still, a nice thing to avoid if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, having used the whole container, what really irked me over time was having to apply the cream and then rinse it off my fingers. I&#x27;m sure a more solution-focused person worried about this could use a brush or sponge or something, but I am not that obsessed with this stuff, and just found it tedious to apply by hand. Afterwards my fingers would be coated and I&#x27;d have to rinse them off to properly remove the grainy texture of the cream. I didn&#x27;t think this would be a big concern for me (and I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t for some), but as a lady whose normal beauty-routine involves several phases of hand-washing (after applying tinted moisturizer by hand, etc.), I just ended up not wanting to have to add *another* hand-washing to the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll try out the crystal spray next. The stick worked really well for me in the past (I just didn&#x27;t love having to wet it/sometimes deal with dripping water during application--but I&#x27;d be scent-free for ages), and the spray seems more convenient.</li>
    <li> At first the deodorant cream worked well and was able to keep me smelling fresh in the Texas summer. However, after three weeks of use I developed a yeast infection in my armpits. I know one other person who had the same experience with this product.</li>
    <li> The best around!  I&#x27;ll never use another deodorant again.</li>
    <li> I truly wanted to like this deodorant.  It smelled good and went on nicely.  At first I thought it worked great, but then it suddenly stopped working and after a week of using it I developed an itching rash.  The skin under one arm even began to peel!  I stopped using it and the rash cleared up after a couple of days.  I won&#x27;t be trying it again.</li>
    <li> I loved this deodorant, bought it for both my husband and sister in law.  All three of us have developed rashes from this product. My husband hasn&#x27;t used it for 3 weeks and still has a rash.  My left armpit itches ALL the time. A product with so much potential needs some work on the side effect.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not enough I can say about this product. This is the best natural deodorant I have ever tried, hands down. It keeps me fresh, clean and is made from basically edible ingredients! I will be simply devastated if Soapwalla ever stops producing this. :D</li>
    <li> This deodorant is AMAZING!!! My daughter and I are both using it, and we both get very stinky with typical anti-perspirants/deodorants. I also use crunchy betty&#x27;s recommended apple cider vinegar/water mixture before applying so I do not have irritation. I&#x27;m thrilled with how dry I stay as well!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.. after trying several other all natural deodorants to avoid aluminum, finally I&#x27;ve found one that really controls odor.  It is a only a deodorant though, so perspiration is still an issue at times.  As other have commented, I also had a nasty rash that took approximately 3 days to clear up (very painful) BUT I&#x27;m fairly confident it was due to applying directly after shaving..  I&#x27;ve been using this product approximately 3 months and it has only occurred one time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a deodorant that works so well. This cream goes on and absorbs quickly. I used it before going on a horseback riding lesson. I didn&#x27;t have time to shower but I put this on. It took away existing odor. After my lesson I still had no odor and the next morning still no odor. It is very long lasting and non-irritating. The smell is a fresh lavender. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> A friend posted how much she loved this deoderant on Facebook.  I gave it a try and now my entire family is hooked!!  We love it!!  Works well for the day, doesn&#x27;t leave a film!  A+++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant cream for about 2 years now, and have never had any bad skin reactions to it! If you don&#x27;t want to slather your armpits with the toxic materials in typical deodorant brands, this is the stuff!  And unlike other all-natural formulas that are super ineffective, it really works.  The container lasts a good long time, too--worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is the first natural deodorant that works for me and I have tried them all! It smell great, goes on easily and lasts ALL day.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product when it first arrived. The smell is fresh and clean and I didn&#x27;t mind applying it with my finger because it comes off pretty easily. After using it for about 2 weeks I developed a really terrible rash in both armpits. Pretty sure the culprit is the amount of baking soda in the formula. Stopped use for a week, then tried again and the rash came back immediately. Much better suited for someone without sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was sick of yellow stains on my white shirts but was dissatisfied with the natural options from the drugstore which didn&#x27;t work at all for me. This product works so well! I typically put it on around 6 am directly after a shower and usually I don&#x27;t notice any smelliness until around 12 or 13 hours later, and only if I&#x27;ve been active during the day. It also controls perspiration WAY better than aluminum deodorants I&#x27;ve used (I used Secret for about 4 years prior). I also used to get rashes and itchiness after shaving while using aluminum deodorant and this is completely gone! I have had no irritation with this product - it also smells really good (minty, similar to the smell of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap) but does tend to fade during the day. I find that as long as I apply after a shower and before I get dressed that the cream application style is not a hassle. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a natural deodorant!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I don&#x27;t smell at all.  Even when I was in Texas for 2 weeks and I had to deal with the humidity.  This product was such a trooper.  Even after being at the river all day, I still didn&#x27;t smell.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! The only stuff that actually works.</li>
    <li> I have a rash under my armpits and my skin is super sensitive.  Most non-toxic natural deodorants don&#x27;t actually work very well since I have to wash and reapply during the day.  This product is amazing.  Works great, smells great and good on sensitive skin.  Also, it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> It came fast.  I am trying it now</li>
    <li> Works well. Love the idea of non-toxic. Not a huge fan of applying with fingers. Packaging could be redone to allow applying by rubbing on underarm. Other stores brands have it. Then it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this deodorant. This works better than regular, toxic deodorants, except without all the yucky chemicals. It smells great, and (more importantly) keeps me from smelling in 90+ degree weather. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I get no burning sensation - this stuff is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  It has no harsh chemicals and is all natural, is rated 0 in Skin Deep database, and most importantly, IT WORKS!  I have absolutely NO odor whatsoever.  In using the old traditional stuff, my skin would break out horribly after using it for a few months.  After jumping from deodorant to deodorant, I&#x27;ve found this and have had absolutely no irritation or breakouts.  It smells AMAZING, lasts all day, and one purchase will last you as long, if not longer than a deodorant stick.&lt;br /&gt;With the old stuff, if I didn&#x27;t wear deodorant on the weekend, by Sunday I would smell.  If I don&#x27;t wear Soapwalla all weekend, I still have no odor.  I recommend this to all of my friends looking for an effective, safe alternative.  Aluminum, an ingredient in antiperspirant, is being revealed as posing a health risk, and possibly being linked to breast cancer.  When I use this, I know I&#x27;m not being unnecessarily exposed to toxins and chemicals that could affect my health.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It is a solid, legitimate product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone 7 days without a shower on my deployment under moderately sweaty conditions, and this stuff performs like a champ.  I just re-applied every day.  Works better then my other D.O.  FANTASTIC PRODUCT!! WILL BUY AGAIN!! YOU NEED TO TRY THIS!!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous other natural and regular deodorants only to smell worse than not wearing any at all. Soapwalla Deodorant Cream works very well even in hot humid southern Florida!</li>
    <li> I like it. I didn&#x27;t give me a rash and I find that it works better than some regular deodorants. I&#x27;d repurchase it! It is pretty pricey for the amount that you get though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I&#x27;d rank it pretty high as far as natural deodorants go. I actually like that it&#x27;s a cream (albeit grainy) that you rub in, too. It helps it last a little longer, as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The first couple of weeks the deodorant cream worked fine, no odor I was happy with it but then I started to get a rash and I got itchy, but I kept using it just to see if the rash would clear up, but it didn&#x27;t so I stopped using it and the rash cleared up. I have to find another deodorant to try.</li>
    <li> Works great for an all natural deodorant! Tried others that just made me stink worse but this one works well for me and I swear it&#x27;s even made me sweat less! It may seem like a lot for a small container but mine lasted over 6 months as long as you aren&#x27;t over doing it.</li>
    <li> I will not go back to using regular deoderant.  I have been impressed with how well this product works.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I had recently read about the dangers of metals in commercial deodorants and chose this to be the best option to try. I was so pleasantly surprised to find out that it works BETTER than the previous clinical strength deodorants I was using with which I would still have BO at the end of a long day. I love the smell and consistency, don&#x27;t be put off by having to apply with your fingers -it comes off easily with a tissue.</li>
    <li> Soapwalla is the best thing ever. I&#x27;d never go back to the aluminum-based antiperspirants after finding this one that&#x27;s healthy and works!</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant that I have found that will keep my odor free when sweating. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I order 3 at a time. I was finally able to throw all the inferior natural deodorants out!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m not giving it a five-star rating. It makes a bit of a mess on my shirts no matter how careful I am applying it and putting a shirt on. And if I sweat a lot, this deodorant tends to clump into the middle of my armpit and fall off in little yellowish pebbles, which can be embarrassing. However, this formula does a pretty good job masking my armpit smells for the whole day, even when it&#x27;s hot outside, and I&#x27;m beginning to think there is nothing else out there that can do that. Every other deodorant I have tried, even those that work well for a few hours, leave me with a foul blend of odors by the end of the day. Even if it&#x27;s winter and all I&#x27;ve done is sit at a desk that day. Natural deodorants, conventional men&#x27;s deodorants, and even anti-perspirants when I used to wear them, created this horrid smell that sometimes seemed worse than if I hadn&#x27;t been wearing any deodorant at all. Soapwalla doesn&#x27;t do that, so every time I give up on a new natural deodorant that seemed promising but just doesn&#x27;t make me smell presentable, I come back to Soapwalla. But man, this stuff is expensive with shipping.</li>
    <li> after 40 years of looking for a deodorant that works, I found one and even better it&#x27;s not filled with chemicals</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant cream off and on for awhile now. It&#x27;s just been in the last few weeks that I&#x27;ve started using it consistently. When using it sporadically, I loved it... Now... Different story. I have dark skin under my arms because of excess insulin in my body, and after two weeks of consistent use with this product, the skin is now darker than ever. I developed a rash surrounding my pits, I have had two large boils in the last two weeks (I never get them under my arms), and deodorant no longer lasts. Now after a few hours of moderate to little activity, I start smelling a starchy dirty scent that my body has never produced. I loved the product when I first got it, so hopefully there is something else that will prevent these issues going forward. Now off to fix my embarassing rash and dark skin pits.</li>
    <li> This product is really effective,  but I had to stop using it because I experienced stinging and skin irritation after using it for a while. I tried giving it a rest and going back to it,  but the stinging and irritation was still there. The whole purpose of me using a natural deodorant is because I am prone to skin irritations. If you are someone with less sensitive skin, this product may work for you. The weird part is that looking at the ingredients list, I can&#x27;t figure out which ingredient causes the irritation. I use all of these ingredients except maybe corn starch in other products, so maybe it is the corn starch? As far as the positive aspects of the product, it  definitely prohibited any odor. I&#x27;m don&#x27;t sweat, but this deodorant seemed to be somewhat anti-perspirant.  When I used Crystal deodorant, it kept me odor-free, but not dry. This product did both. I really wanted it to work and rather liked the creamy consistency.  It was annoying to apply by hand,  but it seemed to absorb pretty quickly. Good luck if you try it. It seems to be pretty hit-or-miss.  I am going to try Lush deodorants next.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant based on the review. I love it. It is a natural product which really works. My husband tested it while he was playing squash : just perfect. Soapwalla deodorant cream is my favorite!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works well in two ways, deodorant and antiperspirant.  I don&#x27;t love it during the summer-but I have to say that I haven&#x27;t found many better than this one.  I do love it during the winter! I live in the midwest and the summers are hot.  I have been trying many different natural deodorants in search of the best one. This is one of my top 5 for sure.  Use a generous scoop to rub on in the mornings, and by the time I get home around 6 or 7, I only have a faint odor that I can only detect from a close sniff of my underarms, it&#x27;s even better in the winter.  It helps with perspiration in the summer until after lunch time.  In the winter it works all day long.</li>
    <li> I also was very excited to hear of a deodorant that is natural and works but was disappointed. It definitely kept the stink away but not the sweat which ruined a few of my light colored shirts with stains on the the under arm. Also, I broke out in a rash and with continued use I got a huge lump under my right armpit which went away about a week after discontinued use. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I was surprised to have this reaction.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Love love love this deodorant! On my second jar! All natural and cuts smell.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this deoderant! I was looking to dump my harmful deoderant and after a lot of online research, I decided to try this. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;m a mother of a toddler, constantly movingand running around.... this deodorant really works amidst all of that! I even forgot and  wore it to an interview. .. wasn&#x27;t planning on it. .. but it WORKED.  I love the smell of it and it is very effective.  Much healthier too which was the main reason I tried this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant cream for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s the only natural deodorant that actually works for me!  No more smell!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me that is truly natural. I have been buying this for years, initially I was purchasing this from the maker on etsy.com. It is very pricey and lasts about 2 months, but worth it. I am someone that perspires a lot and can have body odor in the summer. In those cases i pat myself dry and reapply if need be. (Note this is not an antiperspirant, only deodorant) I know it sounds like it doesn&#x27;t work, but for a truly natural deodorant w/o aluminum, this is the winner of all sticks, sprays, creams, you name it, I probably have tried it. Until I find a truly natural antiperspirant, I am sticking with this.</li>
    <li> The product works very well, but it burned my skin so I had to discontinue.  Still searching for the right one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for several months now and initially I developed the irritation that other reviewers have complained of, but I had really good luck following some advice I found online about balancing your pH. Apparently natural deodorants are rather alkaline so applying a little apple cider vinegar mixed with water fifteen or twenty minutes before applying the deodorant has really done the trick. www.CrunchBetty.com explains it pretty well on her blog in \\&quot;New News and pH Balancing Your Old Homemade Deodorant Problems\\&quot;. After using the ACV first every day for a few weeks I find that I rarely need it at all now. I found that this worked with some other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried too, but the Soapwalla has been, by far, the best I&#x27;ve tried. My husband has even switched to it as well.</li>
    <li> I have always used Secret antiperspirant but want to avoid aluminum. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried at least 6 other natural deodorants and none of them worked. I was so surprised that this actually works! I can even go a few days without showering and just reapply (though I really don&#x27;t sweat much).  Does it work as well as Secret? Of course not. But it works well enough that I gave up my antiperspirant. I like the smell but my husband doesn&#x27;t. It just smells like essential oils to me (sort of eucalyptus/menthol).  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product. I wish I could find it locally though. The price is steep but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I wish amazon sold this in \\&quot;prime\\&quot; or free shipping;  I get this from another source which sells for $12 and free shipping.  I refuse to wear deodorants from the regular stores, all are full of chemicals and worse.  That stuff goes in your bloodstream people!  Anyway, I have tried many natural deodorants, all failed.  I am not a sweater but I do there.  This is wonderful.  IT WORKS!! No odor!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and was searching for a toxin-free deodorant. I am not interested in an antiperspirant, because perspiring is healthy, but the odor factor is key here. I tried many well known brand names ( Aubrey Organics, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, etc.) and the best they would do is last a couple of hours.... not  long enough by anyone&#x27;s standards.... and that was on a cold day. So, I ran across Soapwalla, and took a chance. The fragrance is clean, and application is easy and quick. Bottom line is that it works ALL DAY. No odor, no kidding! I had no rash or irritation, even after shaving. The most effective and safe deodorant ever!! My compliments to the chef--- go online to Soapwalla.com and read her story. She is an inspiration. This product is safe and made in USA. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The deordorant didn&#x27;t work at all. It ended up breadking me out, and I developed a rash. Also, it stung and burnt after applying 3 or 4 times.</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff!!!  Takes care of both odor and perspiration!  I was DESPERATE to find a product that would last me at lease 1/2 day and this product definitely does that and lasts all day as well.  It is organic and natural and contains no chemicals!!! I have tried every product on the market, including some men&#x27;s deodorant.  Nothing works as well as this!  It has a clean fragrance neither male or female in origin, just clean, and it only lasts until you are finished applying the product.  I will be using this forever and highly recommend it to everyone who needs extra odor/perspiration protection.</li>
    <li> The most effective natural deodorant we have tried. Worth the cost because it actually works all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I have to wright at least 20 words to post a review, didn&#x27;t 17 really say everything?</li>
    <li> caused a red reaction on my sensitive skin. my search for a natural deodorant continues.</li>
    <li> When I found out I was pregnant I did a lot of research to find a great natural deodorant. I tried several, none of which worked, and then I heard about Soapwalla. It really does work. Everything was great for about a week, and then I started breaking out in a rash under one arm. Only the one. I tried stirring it before application, and alternating what side I applied first -- still just the one armed rash. It doesn&#x27;t bother me throughout the day, but obviously something is wrong. My one armpit is apparently more sensitive than the other, which is a real shame since none of the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried actually work and things are starting to heat up here in Florida. It&#x27;s going to be a long, stinky, pregnant summer.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works the best of any natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (and I have a cabinet full of various others). My daughter-in-law originally gave me some and encouraged me to toss out my Secret in exchange for a healthy alternative. Since then I&#x27;ve become a fan. I am not a big &amp;#34;sweat-er&amp;#34; generally, so it does keep me dry and odor free, while it may not work as well for those who perspire more profusely. My only issue, as others have mentioned, is that some days I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of stinging and my underarms would get red. I figured out that the irritation would occur on the days I had just shaved my underarms, but not so much on other days. So, my solution has been to use another (less effective) brand on shaving days then go back to Soapwalla for the next few days that I don&#x27;t shave. This has been an adjustment for me as I have been a daily shaver, but I&#x27;m willing to forgo that habit to be able to use this product more days of the week. It seems to be working and I don&#x27;t notice any more irritation. I&#x27;m planning to try another reviewer&#x27;s solution of applying vinegar to balance the ph prior to applying and see how that goes. Probably will sting the crap out of my armpits right after shaving! We&#x27;ll see how it goes!</li>
    <li> Being a creme, this deodorant took me back to my childhood.  I think at one time that&#x27;s all there was.  This however, has a more dry texture and it works perfectly.  I don&#x27;t mind the cost because I&#x27;ve spent more buying multiple products trying to find one that works.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have been using it for over a week now and I am still amazed when I get home at the end of a long day and don&#x27;t stink. I was a long-time user of traditional aluminum antiperspirants, but I had read about the connections between aluminum exposure and Alzheimer&#x27;s, so I decided to make the switch. I was a heavy sweater as a teen but seem to have reached a level of moderation now in my mid-20s.... Soapwalla handles this without a problem, and while I do experience a tiny bit of occasional dampness, it&#x27;s certainly not enough even to soak into my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with rashes, even when applying the deodorant in the same morning I have shaved my pits. That said, I never dry shave... So if you have irritation, that may be part of your problem. Don&#x27;t be scared off by the application, either! It takes maybe one minute to apply (versus like ten seconds for stick deodorant) but it absorbs really quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on my clothes. I only apply a tiny bit and that seems to do the job. Plus, massaging in the cream is like a tiny spa session. Love your pits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is AWESOME. Kind of citrus/slightly floral with earthy tones. Gender neutral for sure. The cool thing is that you can smell it when you put it on, but by the end of the day, there is no smell at all... no sweat, no deodorant, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is price, but it seems like one pot should last for a long time, and the peace of mind is worth it.</li>
    <li> Smelled great but gave me a terrible burning rash. Cured rash with coconut oil for a few days, tried again and in 3 days I had the se horrible burning rash. I tried to return it, submitted request via Amazon and it said I&#x27;d be contacted but I was not contacted.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product after reading about it on another website and I love it. I live in NYC, which is a hectic place between commuting on the packed subways, and working in finance, which is a stressful industry. I also notice I am naturally prone to sweating a little more than my girl friends. Currently in my early 30&#x27;s, I was beginning to feel all deodorants left layers of residue on my skin which were getting harder and harder to scrub off in the shower, and therefore making the deodorants less effective, and quietly freaking me out because in the back of my mind I was thinking about all those stories I hear in the media about the links between common antiperspirant ingredients and cancer, particularly in women. So I gave this product a try and though it has only been two weeks, it&#x27;s been great so far. Two things to note are first, for the people who say it irritates their skin, I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal on my underarms so I don&#x27;t shave, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t experienced such irritation. That&#x27;s unfortunate about the irritated skin bc this is a great product. Secondly, to all, put this product on totally clean skin; there have been a few times I took a shower at night and put this on the next morning without showering again, and I feel it was less effective. Likely because I probably sweat a little in the night and was putting this cream on over that slightly sweat-infused skin. So now on those mornings, I put a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton puff and gently wipe my armpits with this, wait a few minutes until my armpits feel dry, and then I put the deodorant cream on, and it works perfectly again.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend who said that it&#x27;s his summer deoderant. I live in SW Texas so the summers are brutal. I admit I&#x27;m not a super sweaty gal and on more temperate days/winter I don&#x27;t have much need at all for deoderant, but we&#x27;ve already had several above 80 days, even a couple 90 days and Soapwalla has held it&#x27;s own. I will continue to use this summer. The first time I used it right after shaving and developed a little redness as many others have stated but since I have not had any trouble with sensitivity. I also think that I may have to pack it with me this summer as re application may be necessary if outside for a prolonged period. Overall--great product!</li>
    <li> It should have a caution on it that contents of jar is liquid.  I opened the jar and went to smell it and spilled half of it on my shirt.  Lost half the product and ruined my shirt.  Not very happy at the moment!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Really works well.</li>
    <li> For months now I have been looking for a natural deodorant and for months I have been defeated with the over-the-counter natural deodorants at my local grocer. One day, while perusing around on the internet, I came across Soapwalla deodorant cream and I read all of the reviews and was immediately sold!! I paid my $14 and voila! it was shipped and ready to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in liquid form, but it soon hardened up quite nicely. I took my shower and applied it and it worked like a charm! No smell, no irritated arms-- it worked beautifully! But, THEN!! A week down the road, I began developing these red rashes under my arm. Noooo! Noooo! Noooo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes. Yes. Yes. :-( Huge, huge let down. All of those reviews discussing the RASH came true. Me, the girl with tough skin. The girl who never reacts to products. Yes, this girl broke out in a rash. Tragic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a day or so until the rash cleared, and applied it again... RASH. I waited 5 days until the rash cleared and applied it again, this time super apprehensively... RASH!! I waited a week... RASHHHHH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my search continues. I have to discontinue this amazing deodorant simply because of the itchy, scary looking rash and it is bittersweet. Great, great stuff, but the rash sucks, so off I go... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE for July 8th 2014~~~ Out of sheer stubborness and my love for this product, I found myself test running it again. It is fabulous stuff, but I hate the rash! Anyway, I have discovered that if I use VERY little, the rash does not come!! If I use too much, the rash shows her ugly mug. So, my method has been to use a dab, and so far, it has worked quite well. The rash still comes occasionally, but when when I get that rash, I just stop using it for a couple of days and then resume use. This has been the best deodorant, but man, I hate that rash!! I will try to build a tolerance to it, and see what happens and I will update you guys!</li>
    <li> It is winter now as I&#x27;m writing this in the frigid Midwest, so the real test of this deodorant won&#x27;t come until the sticky summers, but so far it&#x27;s holding up marvelously. A little goes a long way, which is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin- the reason why I wanted to buy it in the first place. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of unscented or sensitive skin deodorants and either they don&#x27;t keep odor away or else they give you red, itchy bumps. So far this has done neither. My only beef- which is a small, petty complaint- is that you have to apply this with your fingers. I wish it came in a tube or roll-on instead. I will update this review in the summer and let you know how it holds up to humidity!</li>
    <li> I have had many issues in finding a good deodorant (non-antiperspirant) that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. This is the only one that works! Bonus: it smells really good.</li>
    <li> I have used this for two months, the deodorant works once your body gets use to the lack of aluminum when you switch. First few uses I was still sweating then I think my body got used to the product and it provided all day coverage. I thought my quest to eliminate harmful deodorant was finally over until I developed acne like bumps under both arms. at first I thought it was a razor problem. I discarded all razors and the bumps continued. I am unfortunately going to have to stop this product because of this undesired side effect.</li>
    <li> Good on smell but no perspiration guard so I had problems with sweating.  It was an okay product. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant, but it made my armpits sensitive, red, and rashy. It worked better than my previous natural brand at controlling odors and sweat, but since my skin is sensitive to the formula I need to find another brand.</li>
    <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to review this - once everyone knows how amazing this stuff is, the mom and pop shop who make it will be overwhelmed and it will be on backorder forever. But I have to be honest: this is hands-down the best deodorant out there. It smells great, is easy to apply, and it ACTUALLY WORKS. I&#x27;ve been on &#x27;the hunt&#x27; for years; I sweat through anti-perspirants (what fun!), so why load myself up with freaky chemicals if they don&#x27;t even do the job? &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; deodorants have never cut it for me, either - the crystal, Tom&#x27;s, Weleda...they fail within hours. This, on the other hand, works all day - even on hot, humid days. More often than not, I can even wear the same shirt again without washing it - there&#x27;s no scent left behind at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons, if any, are that it&#x27;s a wee bit spendy; I probably go through a pot in 2.5-3 months. It also leaves yellow marks on your whites (at least, if you sweat as much as I do), but I pre-treat them and they wash out without a problem.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a lasting effect for me. Only lasts about an hour or so. And that&#x27;s just walking around about my day - no heavy sweating or anything...</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I&#x27;ve been having issues with typical deodorants.  I found the cream to be very thick and grainy which made it difficult to apply.  It would roll up like a dough and not stick to my skin during application without some serious rubbing and persuasion.  The smell was nice, but the product itself just isn&#x27;t user friendly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Friday and got it Saturday at noon and i didn&#x27;t even pay for extra shipping! And when i opened my package there was a cataloge, samples and hand written thank you note. Its the little things that make a shopping experience more enjoyable and its great to know that a company appreciates about its customers. I will definitely be buying from Beautyhabit again, Now on to the the Soapwalla...I love it! It smells so fresh and pepperminty. it goes on very smooth and dries well without that wet feeling that many natural deodorant leaves. And the best part? It actually works, sans all the nasty ingredients, like aluminum found in traditional deodorants. Im sold! It is pricey, but its totally worth the money. I highly recommend to anyone who is vegan or wants to switch over to natural hygeinic products.</li>
    <li> I will definirely buy this again, my new favorite thing! The price was okay, possibly a little pricey but we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts...it shipped fast which was good!</li>
    <li> Loved this for the first few months.  Now it has given me a rash.  UGH.</li>
    <li> Made with all natural ingredients, this deodorant smells wonderful, and best of all, it works!  I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works well if I shower every day. It would not hold up if you are the kind of person who prefers to wait a couple of days between showers. It applies easily and only takes a small amount to do the job. I will definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Well, I was really excited for this deodorant. I read so many good reviews and I wanted to try something natural. The first week or so, it worked pretty well. I tend to stink after a while, and this didn&#x27;t totally mask it, but it certainly covered the smell better than other deodorants. The only problem is I have developed some lovely red rashes in my pits. Now, I do have sensitive skin, but I have never had a reaction to deodorant before. Heck, I use certain dri with no problems. So I was not very pleased when this started to happen, considering how much this stuff costs. Maybe I can use it sparingly. But I would be careful if you have any sort of skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a couple of weeks, and then the red bumps came. I stopped using a few days ago and the bumps are going away. In the meantime I&#x27;m using a crystal spray. It seems to be working pretty good.</li>
    <li> Well finally I found a natural deodorant that actually works however my armpits itch as if I shaved and immediately used certain dry ;(. Iv tried shaving at night and using in the morning and tried first applying some coconut oil to soothe them, I switched razor blades thinking it was the blade and nothing worked. I do not have sensitive skin and have never had a issue like this with any deodorant so although I love that it works I think ill keep searching for something that doesn&#x27;t make me itch after using.</li>
    <li> This is the answer to our natural deodorant issues! Amazing on stink, and won&#x27;t add to your daily toxin intake.</li>
    <li> This is the best alternative to traditional aluminum-based deodorants that I have ever tried.  I have tried several roll-on types, but they were ineffective.  This product does a much better job at keeping my skin dry.  It was awkward at first to rub the product into my underarms, but I&#x27;m over that now.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th (yes 4th!!) attempt to find organic, chemical free, safe deodorant that actually deodorizes and EUREKA! I live in hawaii and am very stinky and this has finally safely tamed the stank! It is really creamy, goes on smoothly and lasts all day. I just wish there was some place local I could buy this, the shipping charges are pricey but I will gladly pay them for sweet smelling pits.</li>
    <li> After figuring out that conventional antipersperants did little to control my sweating and only masked the scent with a sickening, artificial fragrance, I had been looking for a non-antipersperant deodorant. I don&#x27;t know if I believe all the rumors linking antipersperant to breast cancer and brain damage, but I do know that there are a lot of other potentially dangerous chemical (including the sketchy &#x27;fragrance&#x27; which could be any number of toxic chemicals). I found baking soda to be effective and made my own deodorant, which worked well to control odor but irritated my skin and was visible when wearing tank tops. Finally, I found soapwalla, which smells great, works well, goes on smoothly, and never irritates me skin (I do shave at night and wait until morning to apply). I have also noticed I sweat less than even with antipersperants. The ingredients are similar to many other (cheaper) natural deodorants which are effective, but what sets soapwalla apart so the texture, which is always easy to apply even when it&#x27;s colder outside and never clumps on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I only give it four starts because it&#x27;s pretty expensive and only lasts about two months. But bottom line is you should definitely try it (give it a couple weeks switching from antipersperant because the detox period is very real and you skin needs to purge the built up aluminum which can make ya smell for a bit, hang in there champ).</li>
    <li> Does not work for me.  Does not smell very good.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad people love this stuff, but I personally have always had a bad reaction to tea tree oil, and with this product it was no different. Horrible rash that would not subside no matter what I did. If only I could get my HG Wolkenseife deodorant paste in the US :/</li>
    <li> Smells good, blocks any odor from sweat.  Exactly what deodorant is supposed to do.  If I didn&#x27;t have to apply it with my fingers, I&#x27;d do five stars.</li>
    <li> Product smells great, but doesn&#x27;t keep the smell or stickiness at bay after a few hours. Ok if just sitting around, but not useful if active.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month - and it works pretty well for me.  I don&#x27;t experience the rash a lot of people get (my skin must be made of iron!) but this could be easily remedied by Crunchy Betty&#x27;s post: http://www.crunchybetty.com/new-news-and-ph-balancing-your-old-homemade-deodorant-problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baking soda bits did disturb my skin a little, since it was essentially exfoliating the skin, but they got over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as recommended by Soapwalla - you should always TEST THE PRODUCT FIRST BEFORE SLATHERING IT ALL OVER THE ARMPITS.  If you visit the Soapwalla website itself - they actually sell this in smaller containers which is actually what I bought for testing purposes: http://soapwallakitchen.com/products/deodorant-cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, the lemony-ish scent is pleasant and not overwhelming.  And the smell stays pretty long.  But I am a super big sweater - even when the temperature of my body is not particularly hot-hot - so usually sometime during 12 - 1 PM (half the day) I usually find the deodorant not as strong and need some minimal re-application - but it&#x27;s not super bad, people-giving-you-side-stares.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is amazing.  I sweat when I&#x27;m hot, cold, anxious, angry...pretty much always and it smells bad.  Even regular deodorant that has aluminum in it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I decided to switch to natural deodorant because I strongly believe that the aluminum directly causes cancer and it didn&#x27;t work all that well anyway.  I started with Tom&#x27;s and that was absolutely horrible.  It is sticky and never seems to dry, it also does nothing for odor.  Instead of wasting a ton of time and money trying different deodorants, I came to amazon and bought this one based on the overwhelming positive reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This deodorant doesn&#x27;t always prevent the wetness but it does help.  However, even though I still sweat, it doesn&#x27;t smell at all...like at all!  I was shocked when I got home from work the first day I used it.  I am a bartender and I am constantly moving at work and often work up a sweat but there was absolutely no smell.  I also love the scent of this deodorant, it is so fresh.  I have had it for about two months now and still have half left.  I !will definitely be purchasing this again once I run out!  Thank you so much for this product!</li>
