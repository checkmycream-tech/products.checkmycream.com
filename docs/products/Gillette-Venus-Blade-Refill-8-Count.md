      <li>Wife has very smooth legs after using these cartridges!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since it came out and haven&#x27;t been nearly as pleased with my shave when having to use something else on the fly.</li>

      <li>They, by far, work best for me of the blades in the Venus series.  </li>

      <li>Nice, smooth shave!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair to shave, too...</li>
      <li>They are awesome - best shave - however, they also go dull very quickly so you have to keep stock.</li>
      <li>These are much cheaper online than in the store and if you get free shipping then it&#x27;s a great deal!  </li>
      <li>First off I got these for a great price at [...]</li>
      <li>Could do subscribe and save and save even more time and money.</li>
      <li>I shave more than my face though ,and</li>
      <li>Okay, Gillette.  </li>
      <li>that the Venus Divine cartridges are available for Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
      <li>the person/people who enjoy them will thank you!</li>
      <li>They are OK.</li>
      <li>I find that when I use the Venus, I get many fewer nicks.  </li>
      <li>Also better for the environment than buying disposable razors.</li>
      <li>What more is there to say about a razor?</li>
      <li>I have stuck with the Venus Divine razor because the blades do a better job of shaving than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>, the below rant is more for Gillette&#x27;s benefit than</li>
      <li>Save your money and get a better brand.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite blades</li>
      <li>I normally love Gilette Venus.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to save the store bargain hunting efforts ands just get razors at amazon from now on.</li>
      <li>The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions.</li>
      <li>I love these razor cartridges.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the Divine razors.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The refill cartridges fit perfectly and do a good job of shaving with minimal skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good product.  </li>
      <li>Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off.</li>
      <li>Way too easy to razor burn.  </li>
      <li>this is a great item, better value than in stores and arrived about 4-5 days earlier than the predicted arrival date</li>
      <li>(my hair gets sturdier as it grows longer, but starts out moderately fine).  </li>
      <li>Smooth legs, arms, etc</li>
      <li>skin is baby smooth...</li>
      <li>Well worth the price to sleep with silky smoothness!</li>
      <li>So glad you had them - thanks!</li>
      <li>For comparison I borrowed my husband&#x27;s Gillette Fusion and it was remarkable how different they were.</li>
      <li>This can really add up in the price department, but Amazon has a pretty good price right now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve hoped to be more ecologically minded rather than use single use throwaways but these turn out to not be cost effective.</li>
      <li>and I thought that they would be good enough, since they were still the venus brand, but you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>The other varieties of cartridge are great, though.</li>
      <li>I got these because they seemed more cost effective than some of the other refill cartridges for the venus razor.</li>
      <li>I will admit they are good, I had to use one since my electric razor head screen broke and jammed up the blades.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-I have been using this product for years and have rarely if ever gotten a nick or accidentally hurt myself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m doubly irritated because you turned my perfect purple blades baby powder pink.  </li>
      <li>Close to skin shave, no cutting myself.</li>
      <li>and I rarely get nicks/cuts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These lasted for 3 shaves -- all of the cartridges.  The other varieties of cartridge are great, though.</li>
    <li> Got these here instead of running out to the store. Packaged brand new, just like the pic and just like the store. I even saved a couple of bucks this way and saved on gas and time too. Could do subscribe and save and save even more time and money. Nice, convenient</li>
    <li> I prefer the more recent Venus razor - the Breeze - because of the larger moisture strip. However, I still use the Divine for tight places like around my bikini area. I will use it for my underarms as well but need to use shaving cream. The very small moisture strip just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> These are much cheaper online than in the store and if you get free shipping then it&#x27;s a great deal!  Also better for the environment than buying disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I shave on a daily basis, and find that for a close shave I need to change my blade every week. This can really add up in the price department, but Amazon has a pretty good price right now.</li>
    <li> The razors are much better than a disposable style, but still not nearly as good as other Gillette razors. The first time I used them they really irritated my skin and even took some skin off my shin. The shave is close, but reeks havoc on my sensitive skin. If you don&#x27;t get razor burn, buy these, otherwise pay the extra for a better model.</li>
    <li> I went from using a Schick Quattro for a few years or so to this.. and I have to say there&#x27;s a GIANT difference.  I will definitely go back to the Quattro.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipping! These are my favorite blades and I was so bummed when I thought I couldn&#x27;t buy them anymore. So glad you had them - thanks!</li>
    <li> The price is incredible and the seller ships them promptly. The razors are pretty good, perhaps the best Venus ones there are. They give a pretty close shave, but I wish the moisture strip was a bit bigger or more well, moisturizing. Still, you can&#x27;t beat the price and they work pretty well. I would recommend them to anyone, but if you have dry legs I&#x27;d suggest getting a moisturizing shaving cream and lotion for after you&#x27;re down shaving.</li>
    <li> These razors arrived quickly, intact, and less expensive than if I went to the store. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The venus divine razor cartridges I received thru Amazon are exactly the same as I buy in my local store minus the high price.  I will def. be looking to Amazon again when time to purchase my next box!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillete Venus razors for years now. Every once in awhile I get a coupon or a large discount from another brand and give it a go because I hate being tied to one brand. The problem is, other razors are really unpleasant and I wind up with cuts. I won&#x27;t go into specifics as to which those brands are, but let&#x27;s just say I am not going to try them again anytime soon. I actually prefer the Original blade mover all the others, but the Divine came up on sale, and I found out I don&#x27;t mind tham at all. Unlike the Breeze which has these really big gel bars which I found to be unpleasant and uncomfortable once the gel bars were gone, these little moisture strips are not so strong or slimy to cause much notice. I bought them because of price over the original and found them to be an excellent substitute. I would buy them again in heartbeat if the price was right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a venus vibrance for years and what is great is that the heads are interchangeable.  I usually just buy whatever heads are cheapest and these ones are a great value!</li>
    <li> Good product that I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> this is a great item, better value than in stores and arrived about 4-5 days earlier than the predicted arrival date</li>
    <li> that the Venus Divine cartridges are available for Subscribe &amp; Save! I&#x27;ve been using this product since it came out and haven&#x27;t been nearly as pleased with my shave when having to use something else on the fly. Bravo!</li>
    <li> Love these blades, and at this price I have stocked up!! Way less then in the store!</li>
    <li> First time user of these blades and like them so far.  They do the job.  The price was reasonable compared to the blades at places like Target.  I will definitely look for these again.</li>
    <li> I have used many different razors &amp; yet I keep coming back to the Venus Divine. It give a close shave without cutting my skin - which I need with my ungraceful-self!</li>
    <li> Razors are one of the absolute biggest rip-offs in life. After finding these to be HALF the price of the same exact ones sold in grocery stores ($22.99+) I have decided I will never again give a grocery store my money for razors. Great deal and hope it stays at this price for a while!</li>
    <li> good price, considering what i&#x27;d pay for them in a pharmacy. they match any Venus razor handle, too. will buy again.</li>
    <li> The Venus products with the gel strip are much easier and smoother on the legs!  But, these were less expensive so thought I would try....will not skimp again.</li>
    <li> I switched to the Venus some years ago but, with each successive order, they seem to last a little less long and shave a little less smoothly. I am not sure why. For comparison I borrowed my husband&#x27;s Gillette Fusion and it was remarkable how different they were. Hmmm. The Fusion is more expensive but I also liked his Mach III better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m spoiled by previous experiences with Venus Embrace (5-blades and a moisture strip... I leg-gasm just thinking about it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Compact.  They fit in my travel case better than any of the other Venus blades.&lt;br /&gt;2. The moisturizing strip IS sufficient for dry-shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3. Has considerable longevity.  With intermediate use, one cartridge lasts like 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Way too easy to razor burn.  I have to be super careful by making short, well lubricated strokes.  It&#x27;s just too much effort.&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t give a dynamic shave, but that shouldn&#x27;t be surprising.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Because of the short, choppy strokes that are necessary because of the blades&#x27; epic crappiness, it&#x27;s too easy to get cut.  I&#x27;m tired of chopping up my knees and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story... BUY VENUS EMBRACE!!! Your legs/the person/people who enjoy them will thank you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this can happen, but these blades are DULL! I have used Venus blades for years, and have always been very impressed with how incredibly smooth the shave was! And the blades themselves would last me forever! I have very fine hair to shave, too...so it&#x27;s never been an issue. But even if I used my prior Venus blades for months and months, the shave was STILL better than these right out of the box! Strange. But I know that I will go back to using the regular old Venus blades instead, and I&#x27;m not going to buy them online! (Mine were from BelowCostJML on Amazon.)</li>
    <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-The small cartridge head is perfect for shaving delicate areas and getting in crevices. This is the number one reason why I buy this particular razor as opposed to other Venus razors. Other Venus razors are not as good in delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;-I have been using this product for years and have rarely if ever gotten a nick or accidentally hurt myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-There are only 3 blades on the razor head so the shave is not as smooth and close as other razors.&lt;br /&gt;-Somewhat expensive.</li>
    <li> I got these because they seemed more cost effective than some of the other refill cartridges for the venus razor. Unfortunately, they are much smaller than the razors that originally came with the venus, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them, and I&#x27;m disappointed that I still have another 7 to use.</li>
    <li> I have the razor and ran out of razor blades for the razor.  I had asked myself what I was going to do to shave? I am very happy with the razor I have, it just needed refills for the razor blades.  Looked for the cheapest price online at some stores and they all wanted pretty much $19.99 for 4 refills.  Went to Amazon and they had the refills for $8.44. I thought that was a very good price for 8 refills seeing that 4 refills were 19.99. So I purchased 2 packs - that should last me a long time.  Starfire</li>
    <li> glides with your body,no nicks or cuts and lasts longer.You don&#x27;t have to shave everyday.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars because it does what it is supposed to do. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. Recommended.</li>
    <li> These razors are barely 1.5\\&quot; wide &amp; they go dull incredibly quickly. I&#x27;ve had other Venus razors &amp; thought this refill would be just the same as any of their other varieties, alas no. I would never buy them again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Venus Embrace and loved the close shave it provides, however - Venus Divine does not perform as well and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. In addition it has scratched and irritated my skin. I am not a fan! Therefore I feel like I am stuck with a ~$20 worth blades that I really do not want to use.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, and these refill cartridges will do the trick.  Fast shipping, good product.  And I thank you</li>
    <li> From the other reviews, some of which are very negative, I gather that these aren&#x27;t for everyone.  For me, though, the Divine series of Venus blades are ideal.  I get a very close shave that lets me shave every other day, and the moisture strips aren&#x27;t cakey and don&#x27;t foam up to destroy the blades like the Embrace blades do.  The blades last a good long time for me as long as I&#x27;m shaving regularly; otherwise, they do tend to get worn out faster on thicker hair (my hair gets sturdier as it grows longer, but starts out moderately fine).  That said, &amp;#34;faster&amp;#34; is still not all that fast, at least for me.  I can imagine that if someone has very thick hair or thick strands of hair, this blade might get worn out faster, judging by how it reacts to my hair at first versus after two weeks of not shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else is confused, these ARE the Divine blades, despite the new look and name.  As far as I can tell so far, there have been no changes to functioning.  I&#x27;ll update this if I notice any over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the below rant is more for Gillette&#x27;s benefit than anyone else&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Divine&amp;#34; Rant: I&#x27;m relieved to discover that Venus hasn&#x27;t discontinued the Divine blades. They, by far, work best for me of the blades in the Venus series.  They kept forcing me to get an Embrace blade with my Divine blade packs, and then the Divine blades seemed to disappear altogether, so I was worried.  Then, by chance, I came across a sticker on one of these that said they&#x27;re the new Divine blades.  Okay, Gillette.  I&#x27;m relieved but irritated.  Who renames a product without making it clear to customers that they&#x27;ve done so?  And I&#x27;m doubly irritated because you turned my perfect purple blades baby powder pink.  What are we?  Six years old?  Every time I use these, I&#x27;ll remember how much I resent Gillette for (a) putting me through that renaming/Embrace process, and (b) treating women like we&#x27;re into baby doll frills and princesses (aka powder pink).  You are no longer a trusted brand.</li>
    <li> These particular type of blades are essentially scraping my skin off.  I normally love Gilette Venus.  Did I get the wrong product?  I don&#x27;t know, but my skin hates me right now.</li>
    <li> I cannot shave with anything else,  this razor lasts forever and never cuts my skin.  I have this item on a re-occuring order so I never run out.</li>
    <li> The razor blades are a great deal. They are much cheaper online, rather than purchasing them in stores. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great razors.  Wife using them for legs. I approve of the end result but cannot attest to how well they work but this was a re-order so I believe that she likes them.</li>
    <li> Close to skin shave, no cutting myself. The moisture strip is a dream. Makes my legs and underarms feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Killer deal on replacement razors!</li>
    <li> First off I got these for a great price at [...] a box.  So I bought the remaining 3 boxes and shipping was [...] so I couldn&#x27;t beat that deal.  My wife loves these and they last her about a month a cartridge.  See doesn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts from them.  I will admit they are good, I had to use one since my electric razor head screen broke and jammed up the blades.  Can&#x27;t walk out of the house half shaved so I used a new cartridge and shaved with it.  I decided to keep that one off to the side in case it happens again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus Divine blades for years. I love that they fit on any Venus razor; although, they best match the Divine handle because of the blue text on the blade. They&#x27;re rounded so there&#x27;s no sharp edges. However, they can sometimes be bulky when it comes to feminine curves. Because there are no wires over the blades, the Venus Divine razor is quite easy to rinse off. It doesn&#x27;t have as many nooks and crannies which attract hair, soap or cream like the Quattro blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the Divine razors. I always get a great shave on my legs and underarms. Those areas don&#x27;t require any shaving cream with Divine&#x27;s multiple moisture strips. I rarely cut myself and irritation around the bikini line and intimate areas is minimal when used with a good shaving cream. The comfort coated blades glide quite smoothly over the skin without catching or scraping, with help from the smoothing cushions. I believe both of those features are only on the Divine razor blades, not the regular Venus blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture strips add moisture you can touch to the blades (much more-so than the original Venus blades); although, it can feel a bit slimy if you leave it in the shower (the slimyness and moisture both fade over time). The moisture strips are supposed to fade when it&#x27;s time to refill but I&#x27;ve honestly never noticed it so I just replace when I feel like I am not getting an awesome shave anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Same exact thing/quality that I get from Wal-Mart but several dollars cheaper on Amazon than at Wal-Mart!  :-)</li>
    <li> Wife has very smooth legs after using these cartridges! Well worth the price to sleep with silky smoothness! We will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I have stuck with the Venus Divine razor because the blades do a better job of shaving than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Good product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> if these are still $13.00 then it&#x27;s a great deal. You buy them at a store and they&#x27;re twice that</li>
    <li> Just works. Was and remains great.</li>
    <li> Great price on these.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m a guy.  Yes, these are chick razors.  I shave more than my face though ,and I don&#x27;t like using the same razor on my body that I use on my face.  I decided to give these blades a try because my girlfriend has a Venus razor.  Unfortunately these blade suck.  They&#x27;re no different than most higher-end disposables.  I though these were the good ones like my girlfriend had, but they&#x27;re not.    My girlfriend has Venus blades that have this thick layer of built in moisturizers that make shaving super easy, even without cream.  These blades do not, and they&#x27;re not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Just like what I usually buy at the store, just cheaper. I&#x27;ll be sure to save the store bargain hunting efforts ands just get razors at amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> Keeps my girlfriend&#x27;s legs smooth and that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> For years I used the Schick Quattro for women and I always got a great shave with it. I decided to give this a try and was unfortunately VERY disappointed. The blades are so dull, even the first time you use them that you find lots of missed spots (no, not from me forgetting to shave there..) - it was like I didn&#x27;t even shave at all! I had to shave each area twice just to get a halfway decent shave. You&#x27;ll also find that you have to change the blades every few shaves, which as expensive as these are, is going to cost you a small fortune. Save your money and get a better brand. Back to the Quattro I go!</li>
    <li> I have used men&#x27;s razors and blades since I was a child (thanks dad). I decided that maybe I should see what all the fuss was about - the scented razor blades with the soothing lotion, etc. What a joke. I have to shave everyday or I feel like a hairy beast. With the Gillette Sensor or Mach3 I could shave every few days, and my legs were always soft and smooth. Women, we are being taken for a marketing ride. Buy a men&#x27;s razor, buy some scented lotion or specially-formulated women&#x27;s shaving gel (but I don&#x27;t even use any of that crap) and see what you&#x27;ve been missing.</li>
    <li> I got these on amazon, simply because I was tired of waiting over 20 minutes in the store for someone to show up with the key to get them out of the case! However, They are a great product and last a LONG time! Love them!</li>
    <li> I see no difference in this head or the regular heads.  The only heads that are different are the ones with five blades (which I don&#x27;t think do a better job of shaving) or the heads that come with the weird slimy gel blocks.  Good price on these though from amazon.</li>
    <li> Not good for very sensitive skin. The dyes and perfumes in even the sensitive skin ones irrate my skin.</li>
    <li> Smooth legs, arms, etc... what else is there really to say?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who shaves his head daily (willfully bald I suppose).  I have a full head of very thick hair and these blades do a great job.  I generally get about two weeks of near-daily use out of a single cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this razor but Gillette made the cartridges way too expensive.  I&#x27;ve hoped to be more ecologically minded rather than use single use throwaways but these turn out to not be cost effective.</li>
    <li> I love Venus, since the razors last a long time and don&#x27;t cut, but you can get these for much less if you keep an eye on local sales...couponers know what I mean :)</li>
    <li> My wife does not like these as much as the blades that came with her razor. She just doesn&#x27;t remember which ones they were. They are OK. She did ask me not to get those anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for razor heads. I change mine every few months, so I expect to have this pack for a while :-)</li>
    <li> These razors are exactly what you&#x27;d buy in the shops but without having to remember to buy them with the groceries.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S DIVINE... skin is baby smooth...never felt so silky...blah blah blah...what else can I say....tired of typing...lol...he he he !!!</li>
    <li> Good razors at a good price how can one go wrong. What more is there to say about a razor?</li>
    <li> Fresh &amp; sparkling shave down to the skin. I feel like a new woman after each use.</li>
    <li> These are great!! Amazon offered a superb deal for this 8 count cartridge so it was a win-win situation for me - great razors at a great price.</li>
    <li> The refill heads are much rougher on my skin than the originals and rougher than the last, different replacements I got. I don&#x27;t think I will order them again.</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth shave! Great razor.</li>
    <li> Very good product by Gillette - I bought this for my wife. I can tell my wife is is very happy with the product. Gillette products are of the highest quality. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using venus razors for years now. It seems to me like the more simple cartridges work better than the new fancy bulkier ones. I do like that the heads are interchangeable though so if I want to try something new I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> They are awesome - best shave - however, they also go dull very quickly so you have to keep stock.</li>
    <li> I get these cartidges on a subscription and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier!  Every month I have a box instantly sent to my home with an extra subscription discount!  These cartridges also for my husbands mach 3 razor (i believe...)  With his sensitive skin, this item is wonderful.  The tree blades provide an extra close shave and the lotion strips keep things extra smooth!  So, its worth it to have a constant supply coming in.</li>
    <li> I find that when I use the Venus, I get many fewer nicks.  It gets me safely down to a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get a close shave with these razor blades, even on the first shave.  I&#x27;ve always been happy with the quality of Gillette products, but these are not up to par.  Immediately after shaving it feels like I have day-old stubble.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I always buy sensitive razors as my skin is so sensitive, but these aren&#x27;t doing the trick. I&#x27;m getting a lot of razor burn - even when using them with a good shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Harder to find this in the stores &amp; this is my favorite one. Only one that doesn&#x27;t give me knicks &amp; cuts.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with these razors, I feel like they feel sharp and slightly dragging on my skin, it is not gliding and soft. I will not be buying Venus again. I think I&#x27;ll just have to suck it up and buy the men&#x27;s Quattro razors... (I&#x27;m a girl, my fiance uses them) they are crazy expensive, but they feel great!</li>
    <li> I love these razor cartridges. I hate body hair and I use these to shave pretty much everywhere. These have been the best blades I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin. I shave often and these blades last longer than I expect blades to usually last and I rarely get nicks/cuts.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and these razors pass the test.  I don&#x27;t ever get razor burn and the purple strip on the blade let&#x27;s me know when it&#x27;s time to use a new one.  The blade is the best size and I don&#x27;t have to worry about nicks when shaving under my arms or around my ankles.  This is the best that Venus has to offer!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter as a stocking stuffer.  These are the only ones she uses so obviously a five-star rating is in order.  She claims her stubborn &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; is a snap to remove.</li>
    <li> I think these are better than the regular Venus razor blade refills. They seem to be a bit easier on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product through amazon.  Item arrived within 2 days with prime shipping.  All gillette women&#x27;s shave handles are interchangeable with the different gillette razor refill cartridges.  I was able to purchase this item on amazon for a lower price than my local store.  The refill cartridges fit perfectly and do a good job of shaving with minimal skin irritation.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love that I don&#x27;t get razor burn with this razor, it just leaves the skin smooth just like I like it ♥</li>
    <li> Not what I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> These razors are terrible.  I bought them because they were cheaper and I thought that they would be good enough, since they were still the venus brand, but you get what you pay for.  They miss spots all the time and do not give you a close shave.  Plus I ended up with a lot of nicks and razor burn.  I finally poney&#x27;d up and bought the Venus Olay razor heads, and the difference is incredible.</li>
    <li> I get a close shave and they don&#x27;t dull after the first shave. This is a good product and I reccomend</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the heads on my Gillette razor.  The nice thing about the Gillette razors is the heads are interchangeable.  I&#x27;m not sure what I had before but I did notice that these heads were slightly smaller than the old one&#x27;s I had.  Overall for the price I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Love this razor blade!</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown. Fit all Venus razors -Plus, a great coupon!</li>
