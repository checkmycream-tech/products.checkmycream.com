      <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove as easily as it could.</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely with a bright pink color.</li>
      <li>Perfect for dark lashes!!</li>
      <li>The color is more like a hot pink.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, definitive pink.</li>
      <li>If you are a very sensitive person and cry easy, make sure to reapply or maybe avoid this mascara on a day you feel you&#x27;ll get verklempt.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara so much.</li>
      <li>It clumps but its not bad.</li>
      <li>It came super fast (which made it even better)</li>
      <li>Love to try new colors!</li>
      <li>(I used it to color my eyebrows as well for the character), so I had to apply a little heavier than I wanted, but it worked out great and lasted the whole day!!!</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful hot pink.</li>
      <li>I love this and the blue one for a bit of a more colorful and livelier look.</li>
      <li>Great hot pink colour</li>
      <li>Exactly how i wanted it to be!</li>
      <li>The areas that I got to cover well appeared bright pink which is what I was trying to acheive.</li>
      <li>looks super pretty, and it&#x27;s so unique.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the color is very pink, and can see the color brightly.</li>
      <li>Not as bright on a black woman.  </li>
      <li>Super intense colour...</li>
      <li>, it has really good coverage even over dark hairs!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Pretty color.</li>
      <li>Really like the color!</li>
      <li>It gives you a nice pink tint without making you look clownish.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
      <li>note: If you have light coloured eyelashes like myself, a coat of black (or black/brown) will make it pop a lot more than without it</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>and I expected more.</li>
      <li>I expected the mascara brush to be better quality, and it seemed to encourage clumping.</li>
      <li>I love the bight pink color</li>
      <li>I wish they sold these more widely.</li>
      <li>but it really does pop.</li>
      <li>Shows up very well.</li>
      <li>The  Fast.</li>
      <li>I think I will steal a fuller/bushier applicator from one of my other mascaras to apply this more evenly.</li>
      <li>On the plus size this mascara is very easy to remove with eye makeup remover or just plain soap and water.</li>
      <li>Watch out New Years Eve!  </li>
      <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little clumpy, but I can manage to work with it:)</li>
      <li>It also gives me an &amp;#34;other-worldly&amp;#34; look that I like ... would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to take a walk on the wild side!</li>
      <li>Better than I expected actually.</li>
      <li>Wink of pink is cool.</li>
      <li>it made it look like I had no eyelashes from a far distance..</li>
      <li>Overall I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised by the color payoff for this mascara.</li>
      <li>and my eyelashes are pretty long</li>
      <li>The mascara doesn&#x27;t really elongate your lashes anymore than they already are, but when I used it, it definitely gave my lashes volume.</li>
      <li>When applied this color \\&quot;Wink of Pink\\&quot; really makes your lashes hot pink!!</li>
      <li>I think I will pick up a few more of these limited edition colors while I still can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have super dark eye lashes, but pink appeared very vibrant on my lashes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>New one for me or back my money.</li>
      <li>It drys quick and it feel heavy on the eye lash.</li>
      <li>Alone or on tip ends after I&#x27;ve used any other color first....</li>
      <li>It was inexpensive and therefore acceptable mascara, but really doesn&#x27;t show up very pink.</li>
      <li>It came in really fast and the color is so pink c: I would definitely recommend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My grandaughter loved it!</li>
    <li> So Awesome. Makes Your Lashes Scream PINK. Highly Recommend. Thank You</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by the color payoff for this mascara. When applied this color \\&quot;Wink of Pink\\&quot; really makes your lashes hot pink!! The applicator is kind of sparse so it does apply rather clumpy. I think I will steal a fuller/bushier applicator from one of my other mascaras to apply this more evenly. It seems to be the same awesome great lash formula as the original mascara. One thing is that it is not very colorfast. If you rub your eye at all you will have pink streaks all over the place!! On the plus size this mascara is very easy to remove with eye makeup remover or just plain soap and water. Overall I really like this mascara. I was afraid the color would not be visible but it really does pop. I think I will pick up a few more of these limited edition colors while I still can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: I picked this up at Walgreens for $5.99 plus tax so I am not sure why the price is so high here.</li>
    <li> I did not like this color. it made it look like I had no eyelashes from a far distance..and my eyelashes are pretty long</li>
    <li> I color my hair pink and I use this to do my eyebrows, it has really good coverage even over dark hairs!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the color to be pink. I was thinking that was just the name and the color of the bottle. I was disappointed, but it was my mistake for not reading more into it.</li>
    <li> Love. It. End of story. Best pink mascara ive ever found online. Exactly how i wanted it to be! Faveee</li>
    <li> I love this and the blue one for a bit of a more colorful and livelier look. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great hot pink colour</li>
    <li> Believe it or not I ordered this two days before it delivered, I absolutely love this product the color is gorgeous and the price was awesome.</li>
    <li> Super intense colour... no clumps or globs...it&#x27;s the best! !</li>
    <li> I love this color!&lt;br /&gt;I have super dark eye lashes, but pink appeared very vibrant on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It looks super pretty, and it&#x27;s so unique.&lt;br /&gt;It gave a nice taste in my boring everyday make-up.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive and therefore acceptable mascara, but really doesn&#x27;t show up very pink. However i&#x27;m fine with it and will get good use of it.</li>
    <li> Wink of pink is cool. Not as bright on a black woman.  It drys quick and it feel heavy on the eye lash.But you will get alot of compliments. And it hard to remove it took me 3 days to get it all off. And I used several makeup wips.</li>
    <li> Really like the color!</li>
    <li> At first when I took the brush out of the tube I was doubtful about the shape of the brush and how it would apply on my lashes. But as soon as I applied it, I loved it. The mascara doesn&#x27;t really elongate your lashes anymore than they already are, but when I used it, it definitely gave my lashes volume. Not to mention the color was FABULOUS! Better than I expected actually. It is a beautiful hot pink. I was so happy to be able to find cheap mascara in this color. Will definitely buy again when I run out. I smeared some on my arm and compared it to black mascara to show you how pink it is.</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for a pink mascara so was very excited to find on amazon.  Goes on very easy and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, wears nice, and color wears nice too.  and waterproof.  the color is very pink, and can see the color brightly.</li>
    <li> I love this.! It came in really fast and the color is so pink c: I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This has always been my go-to mascara. Loved the color. Loved the ease of application. Doesn&#x27;t remove as easily as it could.</li>
    <li> wear it with purple as and accent</li>
    <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes look unnatural. Since it looks fake and is light in color, I put brown on the tips of my lashes, and it still looks unnatural. I wanted something to make my green eyes pop, and it does somewhat, but not as well as mascara&#x27;s made for green eyes.</li>
    <li> L-O-V-E I-T! I know I was taking a chance with this but I figured what the hey! It came super fast (which made it even better) And it is awesome. It gives you a nice pink tint without making you look clownish.&lt;br /&gt;Side note: If you have light coloured eyelashes like myself, a coat of black (or black/brown) will make it pop a lot more than without it</li>
    <li> Visibly pink! Received many compliments wearing this at my 1990s party and will probably bring it out again for Halloween.</li>
    <li> This kind of made me look sick. I used it on my 5 year old and she looks beautiful! Color is awesome and it goes on well.</li>
    <li> Words cant explain how much I love this</li>
    <li> Not good, I not have that one and I think people steal that one. New one for me or back my money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use make-up, and this was for a costume, but my goodness! It was absolutely perfect! I have very dark lashes and brows (I used it to color my eyebrows as well for the character), so I had to apply a little heavier than I wanted, but it worked out great and lasted the whole day!!! However, it is NOT waterproof! If you are a very sensitive person and cry easy, make sure to reapply or maybe avoid this mascara on a day you feel you&#x27;ll get verklempt. It&#x27;s a beautiful, definitive pink. I wish they sold these more widely.</li>
    <li> Very very pink. Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I really love this shade of mascara!  It makes my green eyes look even greener!  It also gives me an &amp;#34;other-worldly&amp;#34; look that I like ... would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to take a walk on the wild side!</li>
    <li> Great vibrant color, and easy to use. It clumps but its not bad.</li>
    <li> Great product. Perfect for dark lashes!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara so much. It&#x27;s a little clumpy, but I can manage to work with it:) The color is more like a hot pink.&lt;br /&gt;I also put this on my eyebrows and get tons of compliments. :)</li>
    <li> Love this color! Love to try new colors!</li>
    <li> I love the color i just wish the brush was thicker</li>
    <li> So happy I got this and the price was perfect for it as well. I am very happy as a customer.</li>
    <li> I love the bight pink color and I think it looks cute :)</li>
    <li> I actually used this to color my eyebrows, and it worked perfectly : )</li>
    <li> Shows up very well. Alone or on tip ends after I&#x27;ve used any other color first....</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy this again soon. I absolutely love this color and how it brings out my eyes. The  Fast. Shipping is a plus too!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely with a bright pink color.</li>
    <li> Goes on a little clumpy, but stays on all day.  Pretty color.</li>
    <li> Mascara was very thin and did not coat my dark eyelashes as expected. I expected the mascara brush to be better quality, and it seemed to encourage clumping. The areas that I got to cover well appeared bright pink which is what I was trying to acheive. Overall, it was an average product and I expected more.</li>
    <li> Watch out New Years Eve!  This color is Great!</li>
