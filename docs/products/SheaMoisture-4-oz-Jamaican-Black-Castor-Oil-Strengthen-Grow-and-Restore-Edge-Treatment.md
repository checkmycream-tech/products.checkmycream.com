      <li>I also love the ingredients and benefits.</li>
      <li>As others have stated already, it works better with a head scarf.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This product does not gel down your edges as stated but does have a very nice smell.  </li>
      <li>and I am 13 weeks post right now.</li>
      <li>Its very very sticky ..</li>
      <li>Even though I am satisfied with my hairline currently, I will continue to use the product when I take my braids out.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff especially the smell.</li>
      <li>Its more like a treatment to grow and restore ur edges , it leaves the edges soft if u wear a bandana for a while to smooth them down</li>
      <li>Its very watery and jelly.  </li>
      <li>The consistency was very oily/greasy.</li>
      <li>I use all Shea moisture products and love them, but this product was not what I expected.</li>
      <li>maybe that&#x27;s why I am not so very impressed.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Very sticky.</li>
      <li>I have type 3a/b combination hair and it leaves my curls very defined and moisturized.</li>

      <li>Sometimes these products can be used in different ways and can be very beneficial!</li>
      <li>I generally work this product in with circular finger massaging, then more massaging with a little water on my hands to spread it evenly.  </li>

      <li>far as an edge tamer</li>
      <li>My hair loves its, it keeps it moistured and soft to touch.</li>
      <li>I have very curly unruly hair, especially in the front.</li>
      <li>My edges have thinned out a lot from wearing my natural hair in braids during the summer.</li>
      <li>For me it&#x27;s just right, as other, thicker products leave me feeling like my hair is greased down, and attracts dirt way too fast.  </li>
      <li>Feels a little sticky and gel textured at first</li>

<li> For me it&#x27;s just right, as other, thicker products leave me feeling like my hair is greased down, and attracts dirt way too fast.  </li>
<li> Feels a little sticky and gel textured at first</li>
<li> I generally don&#x27;t like really short &amp;#34;I hated it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I loved it&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I thought it would be a little more firm and thick gel</li>
<li> This product, like all the Shea Moisture stuff, earns very polarized reviews, and I suspect there&#x27;s a common thread there, either it works well for you, or it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> The consistency is like gel, so instead of taking the product out of the container (which can be really messy), I press down on it gently and rub my fingers in a circular motion on the surface; my fingers get a lot of product with this method, and it comes out like an oil, instead of a goopy gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but I will make it work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It made my hair look and feel wet all the time and could not hold curls from curling iron.  </li>
<li> gives my hair body, moisture, and lets me carefully comb out knots.  </li>
<li> I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
<li> I thought the bottle would have been bigger its to small for the price but works well</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old male with difficult hair.  </li>
<li> like to hold my edges down</li>
<li> It did not lay down my hair after I had my scarf on it for about two hours.</li>
<li> the excess glycerin in it really mess it up.</li>
<li> this product is not worth buying PERIOD!</li>
<li> this is a waste of money period and its way to jello like to be an edge treatment/tamer in my opinion.</li>
<li> and I noticed a few changes in hair growth.</li>
<li> Not really satisfied</li>
<li> At least not for me.</li>
<li> The last winter was dry and brutal on my hair, and I was forced to learn about hair cair before all mine shredded and ripped out in clumps.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed with the product&#x27;s texture, which was very jelly.  </li>
<li> Not happy with this product.</li>
<li> this does nothing for my edges my edges still always look crazy</li>
<li> It&#x27;s was a really bad greasy look if you put it on your edges (hairline)</li>

    <li> Great product but it was very watery when received.</li>
    <li> I love all Shea Moisture products...minimum buildup, smells great, and works fantastic to keep my hair moisturized and great for all natural styles.</li>
    <li> The product did not do what it said it would do. It did not lay down my hair after I had my scarf on it for about two hours. It left flakes on my edges.</li>
    <li> I use all Shea moisture products and love them, but this product was not what I expected. The consistency was very oily/greasy. I thought it would be a little more firm and thick gel like to hold my edges down, instead it was watery like.&lt;br /&gt;  This will definetly not stray me away from my favorite brand &amp;#34;SHEA MOISTURE&amp;#34; this just wasn&#x27;t for me!</li>
    <li> This product does not gel down your edges as stated but does have a very nice smell.  I was very disappointed with the product&#x27;s texture, which was very jelly.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells.  It seems to be a great product. I&#x27;ve been using the product every day for about a week and I noticed a few changes in hair growth.</li>
    <li> This item is really nice but a bit messy as the product is very liquidy. I wish it were more like a mousse consistency.</li>
    <li> Love it. A must have for those edges!</li>
    <li> The product was not what I invisioned it to be. I was thinking it would be in a cream form instead of gel form.  Not really satisfied but I purchased the product just can&#x27;t throw away money.  Not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Its more like a treatment to grow and restore ur edges , it leaves the edges soft if u wear a bandana for a while to smooth them down but  If u want ur edges styled to stick to ur skin I recommend trying another brand.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t like really short &amp;#34;I hated it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I loved it&amp;#34; reviews.  I think any review worth reading has a good explanation for context.  This product, like all the Shea Moisture stuff, earns very polarized reviews, and I suspect there&#x27;s a common thread there, either it works well for you, or it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m a 60 year old male with difficult hair.  The last winter was dry and brutal on my hair, and I was forced to learn about hair cair before all mine shredded and ripped out in clumps.  After washing, and even after normal wear, my hair was brittle and ttangled into knots that I couldn&#x27;t get out with my fingers.  This leave in product gives my hair body, moisture, and lets me carefully comb out knots.  It has just enough slip to do that without being &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.  Some criticize it for being too watery.  For me it&#x27;s just right, as other, thicker products leave me feeling like my hair is greased down, and attracts dirt way too fast.  I also use Shea Moisture shampoo and Restorative conditioner.  I generally work this product in with circular finger massaging, then more massaging with a little water on my hands to spread it evenly.  I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> SHEA MOISTURE JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL, IT SMOOTH MY EDGES.</li>
    <li> Yes yes! I already see the growth,i will definitely use this product again and again. Even my friends can see specifically around my edges.I also recommend products to some of my friends. I&#x27;m 90% satisfied! !!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My edges have thinned out a lot from wearing my natural hair in braids during the summer. I can honestly say I have noticed that my hairline is filling in beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as an edge tamer I would not recommend this. I think people are expecting it to have a great hold because the description does say that but it is called a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product for thinning edges. Even though I am satisfied with my hairline currently, I will continue to use the product when I take my braids out.</li>
    <li> My hair loves its, it keeps it moistured and soft to touch.</li>
    <li> It provides shine &amp; seems to be helping my edges fill in</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture of this product and it also finest lay down your edges as good as other products .</li>
    <li> Very sticky. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> It did not &#x27;travel&#x27; well in the heat. It melted and the consistency isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> This did not work well for me as a edge control gel but it worked great with my rollerset. I have texlaxed hair and I am 13 weeks post right now. I set my hair in steam rollers and to maintain it I used my fav moisturizer and a TINY bit of this product and reset my hair with satin curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the days after my hair was able to retain it&#x27;s curls and had minimal frizz and puffiness even on rainy misty days. This makes me think it is just a gel and prob could be cheaper and in a larger jar but it works so I will continue to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It it non-flaky and my hair was touchable but I used a very tiny bit on each section of my hair.</li>
    <li> Its very very sticky .. maybe that&#x27;s why I am not so very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;It doubles as wax or foam or Gel. But it does the trick with the fly outs and untamed baby hairs.</li>
    <li> eh, I don&#x27;t care for the stuff. better off getting castor oil. the excess glycerin in it really mess it up. too sticky.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but I will make it work.&lt;br /&gt;I really love Shea Moisture products, it&#x27;s all I use&lt;br /&gt;but this product is not something I would buy in the&lt;br /&gt;stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was a really bad greasy look if you put it on your edges (hairline)</li>
    <li> this does nothing for my edges my edges still always look crazy it didn&#x27;t grow my edges at all. this is a waste of money period and its way to jello like to be an edge treatment/tamer in my opinion. this product is not worth buying PERIOD!</li>
    <li> Product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> It smells very good and keeps a shine or gloss to my hair</li>
    <li> I use this product to seal my ends and it works like a charm!! I have type 3a/b combination hair and it leaves my curls very defined and moisturized. The consistency is like gel, so instead of taking the product out of the container (which can be really messy), I press down on it gently and rub my fingers in a circular motion on the surface; my fingers get a lot of product with this method, and it comes out like an oil, instead of a goopy gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It works good on my edges also- but better at defining and sealing my ends. I encourage people to try it. Sometimes these products can be used in different ways and can be very beneficial!</li>
    <li> I have very curly unruly hair, especially in the front. I bought this product to try it out, and I&#x27;m in love! Works so well at taming my edges. I use it before I wrap my hair at night and my hair looks like I just came out of the salon in the mornings. I also love the ingredients and benefits. Feels a little sticky and gel textured at first but it goes away and later feels smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff especially the smell. I tames my baby hair. As others have stated already, it works better with a head scarf. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its very watery and jelly.  It made my hair look and feel wet all the time and could not hold curls from curling iron.  If I only put it on my edges I guess it was okay but definitely not for the entire head.  At least not for me.</li>
    <li> I thought the bottle would have been bigger its to small for the price but works well</li>
