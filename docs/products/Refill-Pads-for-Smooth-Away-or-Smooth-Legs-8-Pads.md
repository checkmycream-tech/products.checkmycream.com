<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is perfect for small parts like upper lip and face.. but not for large parts like legs.. love it for the upper lip</li>
    <li> I simply love~ this!&lt;br /&gt;Its such a hassle to go into the shower and shave while you can just rub it off with this!</li>
    <li> Was happy to find the re-fill pads!  Have used this system for several years now. Recommend.  Makes life easier believe me.</li>
    <li> I would never buy this product again it does not work well.  I was so unhappy with it, Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I love this product, as it is so easy to get rid of hair without having to shave.  It might take a little longer, but I do not mind as all you do is gently go in circles and the hair is gone.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> These are knock offs!  They are nothing like the real thing and remove a layer of skin rather than the hair!  These are nothing more than sand paper.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s totally useless, don&#x27;t buy it. it doesn&#x27;t work on thick hair at all and thin hair grow back in two days.</li>
    <li> I have liked this product from when it first came out, but is not available in pharmacies any longer in this area.  I feel it is much better than cream removals and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> These hair-remover pads really don&#x27;t work unless you have 1/2 hour to sit doing nothing else but gently circling them over one small spot, over and over. Then another 1/2 hour on the next small spot, and so on. And even when you do that, say while watching TV or reading, there&#x27;s still a stubble left you can feel. And after all that rubbing, your skin feels raw and \\&quot;burned\\&quot;, and you&#x27;ll need some cool lotion to make it go away. I do not recommend this product.[[ASIN:B001R5LRW2 Smooth Away Hair Removal - 8 Replacement Pads]]</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s fast, painless and works great.  No more razor cuts!  Whoopee! It also leaves the skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Shipping took forever but got everything in one piece</li>
    <li> These refill pads are not available in the retail stores without having to buy the whole kit. I like that I can order these and get them so quickly.</li>
    <li> These pads definitely do work for me, although the effect is cumulative, so you have to keep using them to see the best results.  I haven&#x27;t had to shave for about 2 months now- I just use the pads about once a week and my legs are a lot smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT ! WORKS FOR MY DAUGHTER ! SAFE FOR YOUR SKIN ! BETTER THAN OTHER CHEMICALS ! THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT !</li>
    <li> I never liked the idea of shaving the tiny hairs you can barely see on the legs, since shaving would only make it rougher. These pads saved me from a poky skin lol! It only takes around 5 minutes on each leg, I put on cream and lasts around 3-4 days! Love these things!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and it&#x27;s perfect for me. I am 73 years old and my legs don&#x27;t have to be shaved as often as they have in the past. My legs are smooth and don&#x27;t itch.    Sharron</li>
    <li> Plus, your skin is &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; and becomes very soft to the touch.  Not to mention the hair does not come back or if/when it does, in such a small amount and thinner.  My gorilla arm hair is GONE!!  Wish I had this when I was younger:)</li>
    <li> Works very well. Recommended! Quick shipping also</li>
    <li> I first of all have previously purchased smooth away from walgreens and it worked fine, this product must be a knock off or something because after i used it my face scaped and hurt so bad.I really and truly hated this product and will never buy it agian.</li>
    <li> I use these and as long as you do the little circles instead of going back and forth it helps with the redness.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a refill to the Smooth Away set I already had. These seem to work better for me than the first batch I used.</li>
    <li> This product seems a little sharper than the original one; it scratches/burns me more easily. However, it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> This was a good price, but the pads were not like the originals. They feel like rough sandpaper and not good on the facial skin. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Zero rating is what I want to give but this forces me to give a star before I can submit my comment. The &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; u sent me r a cheap imitation of the original Smooth Away Pads. The original ones worked well on face hairs without leaving a rug burn sensation for two days like these would. I know because I&#x27;ve tried imitation smooth away pads from a dollar store and I suffered. When a person orders a refill of something they don&#x27;t expect to be scammed with a harsh version of the right ones.</li>
    <li> My items arrived faster than anticipated. It was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The refil pads are smaller and thinner than the original. The refils do not stick to the pads as well as the original. They are a good value, but they are not like the original refils. Don&#x27;t order in bulk until you try some first.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter. She loves this and has been using it for quite some time. She said it helps.</li>
    <li> I will give an A for this item! Works great and just love it !Would recommend it to anyone! Great!</li>
    <li> These are really hard to find in stores.  My daughter uses them daily and they work really well for her</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t have tabs to pull away the covering! You must use something sharp to do it. The original ones have tabs&lt;br /&gt;The pads do fine once you get them attached!</li>
    <li> These are not as good as the one&#x27;s in the pack. will not order these again. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN.......</li>
    <li> I like this product but it takes time.  It does not work on thick hair.</li>
    <li> These pads came in a very timely manner; however, they are far too harsh on the skin. I honestly feel like I sand papered my hair off. Left a red, achy mark for hours. Yes, it does get the job done but having the embarrassing red marks for hours isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do. No pain &amp; skin becomes amazingly smooth.  Def buying this again. Strongly recommend</li>
    <li> Works great for smooth legs</li>
    <li> Everything worked out well. I received product promptly and am very well satisfied. I would be pleased to use this supplier again. I have used this product before and found it effective in hair removal. The result last for several weeks and is easily repeated when necessary.</li>
    <li> These were not the real smooth away I have been using on my face for years. These were so rough on my skin that little hair was removed, yet left my skin burnt and painful! Do not buy these!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product will smooth away the hairs but for me they were back on my face that night.  recommend if this is the result you want.  The Seller was very prompt in shipping the product to me.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product does not work.  I tried many times to remove the hair from my legs with it.  Had to use razor instead.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re an active person who comes in contact with people on a daily basis and your appearance is important, you probably won&#x27;t want these.  For me, I am retired and at home most of the time, meaning the highlight of my week is going shopping, doing errands and going out here and there for lunch or supper, so I am less fussy about impressing people.  But they do work pretty good.  They miss a lot of areas and don&#x27;t get into the contours around your knees, so with the help of a disposable razor, I do a descent enough job for my needs.  Each pad lasts for about three or four treatments.  They do smooth out my legs pretty good, and don&#x27;t leave stubby spots like a razor can.  I use them probably every other day.  My only complaint is that the kit includes too many of the small size.  I don&#x27;t use them at all.  But for the price, and for how long each of the larger pads last, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I use these primarily to smooth skin.  Shaving causes razor bumps so these help with that and does remove some hair although you cannot depend on these for all areas.  Especially where hair is coarse</li>
    <li> The Refill was not as good as they were when I first bought the Removal System some years ago from a Walmart.the pads then was much more rough but they remove the hair better.The refill pads I got this time feel more smoother and they don&#x27;t remove the hairs as good.</li>
    <li> These are awesome; my daughter loves them</li>
    <li> They worked well without being rough on my skin!</li>
    <li> I use these on the tops of my feet and toes to remove unwanted hair.  This is the only thing I can use on this area to prevent ingrown hairs.  If I shave in this area bumps appear- but the pads work in a sanding motion which apparently exfoliates the skin on top preventing ingrown hair bumps.  They work and I am happy about that and will continue to buy them but they wear out very quickly and sometimes it takes awhile of rubbing to get the desired hair removal to take place.  I am glad I only have such a small area which I need to use these.</li>
    <li> I ordered Smooth Away because I had good results with a similar product (Hair Off), but the results were not nearly as effective with Smooth Away. There were two levels of smoothness to the pads. I used the rougher of the two pads and it still barely removed hair off my legs. I had to rub twice as long as I did with Hair Off. I suppose it&#x27;s ok if you are looking for an exfoliant and you want to scrub the dead skin cells off your legs...AND you have 20 to 30 minutes of time to spare in doing this! From now on I will stick with the Hair Off mitten even though it costs a little more.</li>
    <li> The refill pads for the Smooth Away looked like the real pads that came with the kit at the store, however, I did notice there were no names or identifications on the back paper of the pads.  In other words, no name brand.  I used one of the pads before going on vacation, and I ended up with red, itchy arms which developed into a rash for a whole day.  The real name pads never caused that problem for me.  Basically, in comparing the real kit with the refill pads I had gotten through Amazon, the refill pads felt like fine sandpaper!  Nothing like the name brand pads I got with the kit.  I gave them to my husband to use in the garage!</li>
    <li> Love these excieted to find them again will definately be back want bigger order next time completely happy. Glad to find them again</li>
    <li> Not actually the same quality as the Smooth Away product.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more! Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this for removing hair from my body. It works great and also leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> arrived in quick time and a great product  thank you</li>
    <li> Love it. My upper lip always looks great</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. it is not the actual smooth away that is shown in the photo.  I loved the actual smooth away but this is only sand paper that has been cut into circles and is much to harsh for the skin.  I used it the first time and it made abrasions on my skin.  I use to use the real smooth away and no matter how hard i rubbed with it; it never took the skin off.  i would never purchase from this company again because they use the photographs of the real deal but send you some cocky mame bull crap. Oh and by the way they are not refill pads for the actual smooth away because they are cut differently.</li>
    <li> Never got these particular pads because they weren&#x27;t put in the package with the other orders.  Supposed to see a credit on next cc bill.  However, re: originals and use of pads that came with unit, they are helpful.  It seems to lessen the deep pores with continual use.  HOWEVER, when I tried to use them to rub away unwanted hairs, the amount of rubbing it took to remove hairs damaged my skin.  Use gently and maybe only a couple times a week might be best and only for skin improvement, not hair removal.</li>
    <li> These pads are not the real smooth away pads-they are like sand paper and while not removing the hair at all-caused my upper lip to break out in a nice bright red for the holidays...thanks a lot HandBagel...suspect name for a beauty supply store anyway!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves these, much easier than shaving as long as you don&#x27;t rub to hard.  Made her day thank you</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy this product!  they are not the real smooth away replacement pads, and they are too rough, so much so that they will damage your skin!  You can tell that they are not the real product by looking on the back sides of the pads, they are supposed to have some wording, as my original pads did.  these people should be ashamed of themselves putting this product out there, they could cause serious damage to a user.</li>
    <li> This products t is terrible and misleading. The items received were not the brand shown in the image. The quality was terrible.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these are Smooth Away Brand. They leave a dark film on my skin when used that needs to be washed off with soap. Smooth Away does not do that.</li>
    <li> These are an off-brand and do NOT have the same functionality as the actual Smooth Away product. It buffs your skin but does not effectively remove hair at all. You&#x27;d be better off buying the real Smooth Away refills.</li>
    <li> Product works great and will purchase more in the near future. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Pain free and fast</li>
    <li> They did arive in a timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;So I recieved these and they were first off, the wrong size. They were too small. I tried one anyway on a small section of my arm and 2 things happened: one, the small size scratched my arm unpleasantly and two, it nearly tore up my arm. My arm was red and bumpy and hurt for about 4 days. I&#x27;m just so glad that I didn&#x27;t use it on my face, which is where I would normally use it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. They don&#x27;t sell them in stores any more... I looked everywhere but thus is the only place</li>
    <li> My use of these are more for exfolliating rather than hair removal.  My legs feels very smooth afterward.  I don&#x27;t have much hair to remove so I can&#x27;t really speak to that.</li>
    <li> Basically just sandpaper. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good deal thanks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually use the refill pads on the little pink thing.  I just rub away and the mustache disappered. Yeah!</li>
    <li> Sucks for hair removal, works for skin abrasion. One should note that these are 4 &amp;#34;large pads&amp;#34; 2.5inx4in appx. and 4 are finger sized, this is in fact described in the ad. but not very clear. One must refer to the image, and finely worded language to catch that one. Save your money, buy a razor. Honestly I chose this thinking it would cause less of a burn then razor, that is not the case. Inferior product.</li>
    <li> product is great but I wish I could buy just the smooth away for legs only. didn&#x27;t need the smaller pads</li>
    <li> Not like Smooth Away. These hurt.</li>
    <li> These are definitly not the same as the real smooth away pads.  Like another reviewer said, they feel like sandpaper, there are no markings or brand names, and the little side tab that the real ones have is not present on these.  I am glad I did not pay very much for these because I will not be using them on my body! I would not recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These pads are great to use, but must be used often. The deal was FABULOUS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick, and the deal was super-easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich Rooney</li>
    <li> Love this product, does exacltly what it claims. Convenient for travel, airport check, no problem. Safe around children.&lt;br /&gt;Great in a rush, for touch up.[[ASIN:B005ME81LE Smooth Away Hair Removal Kit]]</li>
    <li> While searching amazon, I came across these \\&quot;smooth away\\&quot; pads. I had used the actual smooth away pads before,&lt;br /&gt;and they have worked extremely well for me. I was excited when I came across these pads because I have not been&lt;br /&gt;able to find smooth away anywhere, so I purchased these. When I received the package, it was some make believe&lt;br /&gt;brand that wasn&#x27;t smooth away, and the quality of these pads were significantly of low quality. This seller deceives&lt;br /&gt;by stating that these are smooth away pads, when they are some cheap rendition that horribly burnt my skin! WILL&lt;br /&gt;NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER BECAUSE THEY CAN NOT BE TRUTHFUL!</li>
    <li> these were for my daughter, she&#x27;s at that age where she has hair on her legs but I&#x27;m not ready for her to begin shaving yet. Previously bought the whole kit so was glad to find the refills on Amazon, can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome way to remove facial hair without paying the expensive cost of laser removal.  I would recommend using an astringent after removing facial hair.  The product was delivered promptly and professionally as promised.</li>
    <li> My mother uses these, they are great for her because she is on blood thinners. She no longer has to worry about cutting herself</li>
    <li> These refill pads don&#x27;t work. I was happy with the results from the original system, but the refills fail to deliver. I won&#x27;t purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> These pads are the best. And the best value that I have ever found. I am very,very pleased. I have used this product for several years, but have found them hard to find in my local stores. Plus the cost in more than half of what I paid in the store.</li>
    <li> Great pads -- use almost every day -- was happy to get so many for such a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;Happy -- Happy!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me, my skin got very red, but maybe my skin is too sensitive though.</li>
    <li> I order them for my wife, who cannot due to her stroke. But, she likes the product, and was grateful for the refills. I was down to cutting the large ones to make the small ones.&lt;br /&gt;Rae</li>
    <li> Not good for hairy people</li>
    <li> worth the price&lt;br /&gt;price was right&lt;br /&gt;compared very well to others&lt;br /&gt;fit on my applicator&lt;br /&gt;smooth away smooth away&lt;br /&gt;the end</li>
    <li> Glad to find them and the work well</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for. no longer available at bed, bath, &amp; beyond</li>
    <li> it works great would recommend it to everyone that needs it i could not find it anywhere  bought it out</li>
    <li> My spouse loves these little pads. She loves these little pads. Baby loves these little pads. My spouse loves these little pads.</li>
    <li> They do what they say they will.  My girlfriend is a hairy person and she will not kiss me if she doesn&#x27;t smooth away her lip.</li>
    <li> I love it I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stors and u guys had it for a good price and it came fast</li>
    <li> I like this approach to helping young girls get their hair down, w/o shaving or chemicals. But my 11 yo daughter doesn&#x27;t like the stubble that eventually comes, and shows a few classmates she&#x27;s done something to her hairy legs. What I didn&#x27;t like about these is that they are not ovals on the small ones, so they don&#x27;t match the classic oval shape of the holders I have. I have to cut them down a bit, and they are not fully covering one side of those smaller holders. But it&#x27;s not a big deal. The bigger shapes match fine. I just wish the producer/seller would have advertised to me that it does not fit the oval holders.</li>
    <li> My wife buys this product for the last several years and is very happy with how it works.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I love these, I just wish my skin wouldn&#x27;t burn so much after using them rightfully. The smooth away cream doesn&#x27;t help either but rather makes my skin burn more :/</li>
    <li> my wife was satisfied</li>
    <li> This product is not like the original smooth away refills.  It I rough and will burn your face.  It will remove hair, but your skin is left burning an red.  Will no purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pads are similar to Smooth Away refills.  A little rougher but the same results.  I enjoy the ease of using these pads instead of shaving with a razor.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on this product by purchasing at a local store...but most of the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; products don&#x27;t usually stick around very long, so when Smooth Away was taken off the shelves, I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I looked in to hair laser removal but at $300 per square inch, that was not affordable to me.  So, I am extremely happy to have found Smooth Away products.</li>
    <li> Finally I am hair free.  I have tried everything and it did not work.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> It does buff away facial or body hair. Just remember not to buff to hard. It is one of the better buffers but nothing is absolute or complete. It works well enough for me.</li>
    <li> The Refills came and I love them! Thank You!</li>
    <li> These refill pads were much rougher than ones that came with product.</li>
    <li> Got it as promised thank you</li>
    <li> these pads are sooooo much rougher than the original ones...pretty much ripped my skin off the first time i used em, but with a little tweaking to my method they will work just fine :)</li>
    <li> Like my title says these were way too harsh for my face.  They left me chapped for 4 days.  I&#x27;ll never buy them again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.  I was supposed to get refill pads only but I received and paid too much for 3 complete sets of Smooth Away.  Will not order these again.</li>
    <li> Refill Pads for Smooth Away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just somewhat rough for my skin.  I&#x27;ll keep using, however. Might you have something more gentle??? Have a good day! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are great! I bought a lot a long time ago and still using them.</li>
    <li> These pads felt like a higher grade sandpaper. Ouch! Threw them away and ordered the real Smooth Away refill pads.</li>
    <li> They seem to work well in smoothing the skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> This item is listed that is it by &amp;#34;Smooth Away&amp;#34; and it is not...it is a generic brand and it is not the same as the Smooth Away Product it is very irritating to the skin.  The product did arrive fast.</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> These are NOT original Smooth Away pads. They are smaller, feel like real sandpaper and have left my skin red and irritated. What a waste of my money!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product and plan to buy more of this product. It did not take to long to get here.</li>
    <li> The small ones were the old style/shape and didn&#x27;t fit what I had.</li>
    <li> not smooth away brand  smaller thinner glue doesn&#x27;t want to stick to pad wears out fast  wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I would not shave with anything else,</li>
    <li> Arrived quick! Great price!</li>
    <li> The folks at jetemo did as they said they would and made this order good.  I am writing to say I would return to them as a customer in the future.</li>
    <li> Good product meet my expectations</li>
    <li> why even give this a high rating? these things suck and one pad only works for one small circular section on your leg even if you go lightly around in circles and then the pad is worn out already and you havent even got the chance to finish one leg so you have to put on a brand new pad. and people are right that these thigs are nothing more than sand paper! they can give you harsh abrasions on your skin and one whole box of these things could finish both of my legs. a razor would last wayy longer than these stupid things. nothing but a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> I love smooth away pads. I wish you could still find them in the stores instead of having to order them online.</li>
    <li> I have used the product many many times and am happy with my order.  It removes hair pretty quickly for me.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t last as long as actual &amp;#34;smooth away&amp;#34; and my skin had a stinging reaction to it unlike the &amp;#34;smooth away&amp;#34; pads.</li>
    <li> I ordered it because it looked like the original Smooth-A-Way pads but they are just sandpaper and not anything like the original. Cheap is cheap - you get what you pay for. It was half the cost of the original so I guess I deserved it.</li>
    <li> These are not nearly as good quality as the actual Smooth Away brand. Also, the small ones do not fit the smooth away pink holder thingie.</li>
    <li> Does not work - don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I ONLY REC&#x27;VD LGE. PADS ,NO SMALL</li>
</ol>
