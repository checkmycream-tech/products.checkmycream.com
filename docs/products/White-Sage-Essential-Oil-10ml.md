    <li> Fast delivery and packaged well, from the reviews it was said to smell just like smudging but not to me, smells good but not like the Indian smudging</li>
    <li> You can tell this is a quality product as soon as you open the bottle!</li>
    <li> I use it but don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> Quality product but the price is prohibitive for a Shaving soap production run such as I produce. I&#x27;ll make and use my own tincture in the future.</li>
    <li> Five stars all the way.  There is limited availability of white sage oil.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it was easy to find on the website.

    <li> I purchased this oil as a natural decongestant for my sinus problems. The aroma was earthy, fresh, pungent and complex, yet not overpowering.
