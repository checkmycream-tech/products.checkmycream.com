      <li>I am now a true believer in Crystal deodorant.</li>
      <li>As far as comparing this brand to others this is a nice product.</li>
      <li>(I can seriously clear a room lol) and these products together have completely changed the smell of my feet</li>
      <li>, I put this deodorant on after my shower and I&#x27;m good all day long.  </li>
      <li>Fast and easy shipping.  </li>
      <li>and I have hot flashes ALL THE TIME!  </li>
      <li>Amazing that this company can baldly claim no aluminum, and that their gullible customers buy it with smug assurance they are getting &#x27;natural&#x27; &#x27;organic&#x27; or whatever their pious worldview imagines is &#x27;better&#x27;.</li>
      <li>My wife and I just love this natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>When I read about the health hazards of most name brand deodorants you buy at the store, I immediately began looking for a natural deodorant solution.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Defiantly worth it.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product worth the price because it will not irritate your skin if it is sensitive to the aluminum, oils, and alcohol ingredients found in ordinary deodorants and antiperspirants.</li>
      <li>you)!&lt;br /&gt;Harvested in Thailand, the Crystal Stone from Crystalline Salts combats odor, leaves no stains and dries instantly and leaves no sticky residue and is completely free of ALL chemicals (Paraben, alcohol, and aluminum chlorohydrate free)</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>Use it ONLY after showering, and its fabulous!</li>
      <li>So are we sure the environmental conditions at a shale mine deep inside Thailand are up to first world standards?</li>
      <li>I believe this is a much better alternative than regular deodorant with all of the chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because I find I am developing an allergy to deodrants, I used it for two weeks by the end of the day it was evident it did not work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes.</li>
      <li>How I use the Stone is, I soak my feet first in some water to get them softened and then rub the dry areas with this stone and it takes the dry spots right away, and leaves my feet feeling so good and so soft!!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really tell how much you applied because you can&#x27;t really see it</li>
      <li>I had my doubts when I decided to try this deodorant, but it really works.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The bottom line is that this product really eliminates the source of odor and doesn&#x27;t just mask it with perfume.</li>
      <li>(My husband seriously thanks</li>
      <li>After reading studies on the link between aluminum and dementia he opted to quit using regular deodorant and switch to more natural alternatives.</li>
      <li>This is a highly soluble aluminum salt: ammonium ALUMINUM sulfate.</li>
      <li>High quality.  </li>
      <li>Alum isn&#x27;t very dangerous, and is a moderately good deodorant, although not as good as regular based on aluminum antiperspirants .</li>
      <li>We really like this so far.</li>
      <li>Most days body odor is not a huge issue for him anyway</li>
      <li>well, healthy, last&#x27;s a very long</li>
      <li>Seems to last the whole day!</li>
      <li>It is super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave anything noticeable behind.</li>
      <li>These jokers seem to assert the mining a material makes it natural.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34; Sulfuric acid, aromatic hydrocarbons, uranium, radium....sounds like a pristine source for natural cosmetic materials.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; this works ...</li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s natural, without any chemicals added in it.  </li>
      <li>Recieved it quickly and it has been lasting me a long time!</li>
      <li>I talk use regular deodorant if I&#x27;m sweating a lot, but I live in SE Texas!</li>
      <li>One of the major reasons for this is because I&#x27;m going through menopause</li>
      <li>I would total recommend this product as long as you can get it at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The issue is that from the comments it appears that lots of people are fooled by this nonsense ad copy into thinking this is pure, natural, healing, green, organic.</li>
      <li>After a long search for a natural deodorant with organic ingredients, I have finally found one that works for my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to last the whole day! I cannot criticize it for anything. It works.</li>
    <li> This Crystalline Deodorant is amazing. Works well, healthy, last&#x27;s a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Defiantly worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best  deodorant I ever used. I even got an extra one to use on my feet and when I come home from work my feet don&#x27;t have any bad odor .thanks!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It came broken and I am not paying to send it back. Very disappointed that I paid so much for nothing.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely amazing product. My daughter had peculiar sweating odor. Any deodorant we tried make it worse and create some skin rush. This crystal eliminates any smell for entire day and has no side effect.</li>
    <li> We really like this so far. Can definitely see it lasting us a long time so it&#x27;s a great value! So happy we can get this on amazon.</li>
    <li> When I read about the health hazards of most name brand deodorants you buy at the store, I immediately began looking for a natural deodorant solution.Everything I tried hasn&#x27;t quite worked for me until I found this product! This deodorant is truly great and isn&#x27;t harmful to my body like most deodorant you find at the store. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works good. Clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Love it, works great. No stains and no smelly armpits :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an active guy with body odor issues. I was hoping that this &#x27;Ideal for Athletes&#x27; style natural deodorant would help to keep the funk at bay without loading up my body with a bunch of toxic chemicals. Unfortunately, this really didn&#x27;t do anything to help me, even after multiple applications. Maybe others will have better results. But my experience was not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Use it ONLY after showering, and its fabulous! I talk use regular deodorant if I&#x27;m sweating a lot, but I live in SE Texas! Doesn&#x27;t stain white clothing!!</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot.  I could be 60 degrees outside and I&#x27;ll be sweating.  One of the major reasons for this is because I&#x27;m going through menopause and I have hot flashes ALL THE TIME!  I have to use clinical strength deodorant or it just doesn&#x27;t seem to help at all.  I also have a really hard time using all natural deodorants because there is something in them that my skin reacts to.  All that being said, I put this deodorant on after my shower and I&#x27;m good all day long.  There&#x27;s no scent to it, I just notice when I wear it, there&#x27;s no scent to me either.  I have also had no reaction to it, which is really nice.  Pick some up today so you can feel confident about your deodorant tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at no charge in exchange for my honest review**</li>
    <li> I bought this while looking for a deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum, was unscented and wasn&#x27;t too expensive. This product has worked very nicely for me thus far. I&#x27;d recommend giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-No white marks on clothes&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts all day without reapplying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-You can&#x27;t really tell how much you applied because you can&#x27;t really see it (You have to wet it, apply and have faith)&lt;br /&gt;-The shirt you wear has to be completely clean or else you risk getting a weird smell on it (my underarms will smell neutral but the shirt/garment will have bacteria or something that might smell if I wore it previously)</li>
    <li> My husband has used salt crystal deodorant for at least 5 or 6 years. After reading studies on the link between aluminum and dementia he opted to quit using regular deodorant and switch to more natural alternatives. Most days body odor is not a huge issue for him anyway so he gets by just fine with this type of alternative. When he does go to the gym yes he does come home smelling like he just worked out. I have tried this type of deodorant and while it helps it doesn&#x27;t work as well as traditional deodorant. So if I&#x27;m just around the house this is fine. If I&#x27;m heading out anywhere where I am likely to sweat a lot I choose a different option. As far as comparing this brand to others this is a nice product. You simply moisten with water and then apply. No noticeable difference between this and other brands we have used. I would total recommend this product as long as you can get it at a reasonable price. I received a sample of this product for review but would shop around before I would pay $18 for it.</li>
    <li> I used to use a bunch of different deodorants as did my husband, and we had to put it on daily. (I do a lot of physical activity around the house and my husband has a physically active job,  so we both smell to great at the end of the day.) Since I have used this Crystal Deodorant I can go for a few days without odor and don&#x27;t have to re-apply it. I am 100% satisfied with this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am amazed. I had my doubts when I decided to try this deodorant, but it really works. I am now a true believer in Crystal deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am Loving this Crystal Foot Stone so much! My Feet have never felt or looked better in flip flops!! How I use the Stone is, I soak my feet first in some water to get them softened and then rub the dry areas with this stone and it takes the dry spots right away, and leaves my feet feeling so good and so soft!! If you have stinky feet like me (I can seriously clear a room lol) and these products together have completely changed the smell of my feet (My husband seriously thanks you)!&lt;br /&gt;Harvested in Thailand, the Crystal Stone from Crystalline Salts combats odor, leaves no stains and dries instantly and leaves no sticky residue and is completely free of ALL chemicals (Paraben, alcohol, and aluminum chlorohydrate free) and they say it will last atleast a year! We shall see!! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes. All opinions expressed are completely my own.</li>
    <li> Easily gave me greater than 12 hours of odor protection. This is amazing. I&#x27;m fat and vegan so it&#x27;s hard to not smell bad, but this does the trick.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. I bought this product because I find I am developing an allergy to deodrants, I used it for two weeks by the end of the day it was evident it did not work. Also on day two it snapped off the base. Waste of money</li>
    <li> After a long search for a natural deodorant with organic ingredients, I have finally found one that works for my skin. This is a wonderful product worth the price because it will not irritate your skin if it is sensitive to the aluminum, oils, and alcohol ingredients found in ordinary deodorants and antiperspirants. When you use this deodorant it wont leave any residue on your shirts and the natural salt crystals perform excellent keeping you fresh and odor free through your day.</li>
    <li> My wife and I just love this natural deodorant. We like the fact that we don&#x27;t have to put any artificial chemicals on that will absorb into the skin. It is super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave anything noticeable behind. It is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothing.  The bottom line is that this product really eliminates the source of odor and doesn&#x27;t just mask it with perfume. We would recommend it for all ages!</li>
    <li> Plain &amp; simple...it seems to work.  Although it doesn&#x27;t always work all day especially when I am sweating heavily.  But regular deodorant did not work all day either for me.  I believe this is a much better alternative than regular deodorant with all of the chemicals.  I&#x27;ve been using this about 45 days and I am planning on continuing to use this from now on.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product! Not only does it work, but the best part is that it is natural and is not harmful for my body!</li>
    <li> My faviorite deodorant i&#x27;ve ever used. It works well and doesn&#x27;t do any harm to my skin. I would definitely recommend this product. Recieved it quickly and it has been lasting me a long time!</li>
    <li> The deodorant delivers just as it says, odor free without the worry of harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Its seems you get best results if you moisten the deodorant stick with water and&lt;br /&gt;roll it onto clean skin just as it says in the directions. I was a bit iffy about the cost of the product,&lt;br /&gt;but I say don&#x27;t let that discourage your buying something that lasts for a year and is good for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crystalline deodorant for more than a year and satisfied with the results. My deodorant is still in great condition and I had used only a quarter. It&#x27;s a great product which is made of a totally ORGANIC ingredient, safe, easy to apply, leaves no stains and eliminates the odor. It even helps with insect bites! Last summer i had a pretty bad bee bite, my foot was in pain, red and swollen. I applied insect ointment but it didn&#x27;t help and continue like this for a couple of days. I start to worried about it and made some reseaches. It happend to be that Crystalline salts is a great antiseptic. So after using it only once my pain was gone and swelling dissapeared in no time! Now when we go camping or traveling I take Crystalline with me for that cause too!</li>
    <li> Amazing that this company can baldly claim no aluminum, and that their gullible customers buy it with smug assurance they are getting &#x27;natural&#x27; &#x27;organic&#x27; or whatever their pious worldview imagines is &#x27;better&#x27;. Sad that they are so intellectually disarmed, and that sellers rush to exploit that. One star, for shamelessly milking credulous, gullible customers. Reality: &#x27;alum&#x27; is the word root for &#x27;ALUMinum&#x27;. This is a highly soluble aluminum salt: ammonium ALUMINUM sulfate. Is that a problem? Nah, probably not.  Alum isn&#x27;t very dangerous, and is a moderately good deodorant, although not as good as regular based on aluminum antiperspirants . The issue is that from the comments it appears that lots of people are fooled by this nonsense ad copy into thinking this is pure, natural, healing, green, organic. Alum is an inorganic aluminum salt (chemical!). The good (pure) alum is chemically synthesized in a factory.  The bad stuff is mined (see below). These jokers seem to assert the mining a material makes it natural. LOL! Here&#x27;s the Wikipedia intro on alum shale:&amp;#34;...is shale or clay slate containing pyrite. Decomposition of pyrite by weathering forms sulfuric acid, which acts on potash and alumina constituents to form alum, which often occurs as efflorescences on the rock outcrop. Alum shale... is rich in Aromatic Hydrocarbon... induced by URANIUM in the shale. Alum shale also contains enhanced levels of RADIUM as a result of uranium decay. &amp;#34; Sulfuric acid, aromatic hydrocarbons, uranium, radium....sounds like a pristine source for natural cosmetic materials.LMAO!   So are we sure the environmental conditions at a shale mine deep inside Thailand are up to first world standards? Labor protection? Safety?   But... if you don&#x27;t care about all that, it&#x27;s pretty good deodorant.</li>
