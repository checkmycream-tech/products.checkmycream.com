      <li>LOVE this color!</li>
      <li>love color club!</li>
      <li>It does have a nice holo effect, but not as much indoors, best in sunlight.</li>
      <li>This is all my own experience, maybe I got a crappy bottle.</li>
      <li>The linear holo shows best under direct sunlight (outdoors)!</li>
      <li>and it looked so vibrant and beautiful</li>
      <li>But I do recommend putting a top coat on it a.s.a.p.</li>
      <li>three coats were needed for me, but others might do ok with two.</li>
      <li>It looks sort if gray in most lighting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely color, but its NOT holographic.</li>
      <li>Gave this product 5 of 5 stars because it&#x27;s everything you expect and more.</li>
      <li>Love the color and yes its prettly hallographic</li>
      <li>I LOVE seeing my nails flash in the light!</li>
      <li>I put about two coats of this nail polish and applied Seche Vite top coat over.</li>
      <li>I love holographic nail polish.  </li>
      <li>when used with a top coat.</li>
      <li>I have purchased a couple, and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>They make really great nail polish in general, this was one of their earlier holographic colors,but now they make a way more awesome holo polish.</li>
      <li>but it does chip easily.</li>
      <li>It also chips easily, as soon as the day after application.</li>
      <li>polishes i love, but it&#x27;s def there and very pretty.</li>
      <li>wore great, but i usually only wear polish about two or three days, so thats all i can vouch for!</li>
      <li>You have to put your nails in the light to see the colors in it.</li>
      <li>I payed $5.00 and free S&amp;H when I purchased this product.</li>
      <li>overall its good :)</li>
      <li>The color payoff is great, but if you don&#x27;t put on a clear coat it chips so fast.</li>
      <li>pretty quick gotta love that&lt;</li>
      <li>Came quickly too.</li>
      <li>but it really is very pretty.</li>
      <li>A very pretty silver holographic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very stunning, especially in the sun.  </li>
      <li>At first in room lighting the polish just looks silver with some effect but in the sun light</li>
      <li>The nail polish was exactly as described!</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful silver with rainbow reflections made of small specks.</li>
      <li>Lasts awhile and looks nice as a top coat on top of other colors for different effects.</li>
      <li>Dries super fast and the rainbow effect in it is amaze balls!</li>
      <li>The shipping was SUPER fast!?</li>
      <li>I left it without a top coat for one day and got some mild tip wear.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a super bright shining holo polish like the Layla</li>
      <li>Super fast drying time.</li>
      <li>Very, very shimmery, esp.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but it&#x27;s a pretty silver</li>
      <li>Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stay as holographic when you apply a top coat.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Even after fifteen minutes,the first coat felt dry, yet it was easy to get nicks and smudges.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping item as described</li>
      <li>Up really close, or in sunlight, the polish shows the holo.</li>
      <li>i couldnt really see the holographic color in the paint its self but</li>
      <li>Indoors, unless you&#x27;re looking really, really close, the holo doesn&#x27;t really appear to exist.</li>
      <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t a glitter, so I presume it will come off much easier.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I use this color more than any of the other 140 colors I have, so</li>
      <li>the polish&#x27;s holographic effect really comes alive.</li>
      <li>the other is a pretty silver foil.</li>
      <li>Indoors, the holo effect is minimal, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much seeing as it sparkles in the sun so well.</li>
      <li>Consistency and dry time are normal.</li>
      <li>a little streaky on the first coat.</li>

    <li> Fast shipping item as described</li>
    <li> I bought this polish because the example that was advertised resembled China Glaze&#x27;s OMG, which is VERY expensive since it is discontinued. This was nothing like I expected. It does have a nice holo effect, but not as much indoors, best in sunlight. And  that&#x27;s IF you can be still for the drying time, which seemed very long to me. Even after fifteen minutes,the first coat felt dry, yet it was easy to get nicks and smudges. And since it needs at least two coats, you&#x27;re looking at about 45 minutes, along with patience, if you do this at home. Maybe the UV machine at the salon would help with drying time. This is all my own experience, maybe I got a crappy bottle. It also chips easily, as soon as the day after application. So I have been using it just as a base coat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this one. It&#x27;s not nearly as holographic as the pink one they sell. It looks sort if gray in most lighting.</li>
    <li> This holo is so beautiful. I have purchased a couple, and this is my favorite. I applied two coats to see if it would help, but one coat is perfect. 2 doesn&#x27;t change it. It is a beautiful silver with rainbow reflections made of small specks. Also, it isn&#x27;t a glitter, so I presume it will come off much easier. Beautiful holographic color!</li>
    <li> LOVE this color! Came quickly too.</li>
    <li> The color payoff is great, but if you don&#x27;t put on a clear coat it chips so fast.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this polish!!! Dries super fast and the rainbow effect in it is amaze balls!</li>
    <li> I heard this was a dupe for the Gosh Holographic nail polish so I purchased this hoping that I would get the same effect. I put about two coats of this nail polish and applied Seche Vite top coat over. At first in room lighting the polish just looks silver with some effect but in the sun light the polish&#x27;s holographic effect really comes alive. The price for this nail polish is very good. The shipping was fast. I recommend this polish.</li>
    <li> This really is a beautiful holo polish. You can see the holo effect in the bottle but nothing compares to seeing it on the nails. Indoors, the holo effect is minimal, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much seeing as it sparkles in the sun so well. Application was great; I got it opaque in two coats. But I do recommend putting a top coat on it a.s.a.p. I left it without a top coat for one day and got some mild tip wear. Regardless, this is a great holo polish and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> i like this color alot but it does chip easily. i couldnt really see the holographic color in the paint its self but overall its good :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a silver holographic nail polish for years and finally found this one, they nailed it! Pun intended!</li>
    <li> Love the color and yes its prettly hallographic and it came in the mail pretty quick gotta love that&lt;br /&gt;I love color club!</li>
    <li> The nail polish was exactly as described! It&#x27;s so beautiful! The linear holo shows best under direct sunlight (outdoors)! Even from indoors you can see the rainbow effect on your nails! This is one of the cheapest holo polish you&#x27;ll ever find! I LOVE seeing my nails flash in the light! The price for this is unbeatable! If you dont want to pay for the over-priced holos like OMG by China Glaze, this polish is perfect for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The shipping was SUPER fast!? It came in 3 days! It doesn&#x27;t get better than that! The packaging was excellent! It came wrapped in bubble-wrap making it almost impossible to break or leak!I will definitely order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this nail polish. Only thing is, when you&#x27;re inside it just looks silver. You have to put your nails in the light to see the colors in it.</li>
    <li> A very pretty silver holographic. Very, very shimmery, esp. when used with a top coat. I will probably be wearing this at my wedding.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 this color!  It&#x27;s very stunning, especially in the sun.  Whether indoors or out the spectrum is visible, and if it isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s the lighting, not the polish.  I use this color more than any of the other 140 colors I have, so I think that&#x27;s saying alot. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it STOP thinking and GO for it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed ;)</li>
    <li> A linear holographic effect is visible in the bottle and on the nail...even on my 6-year-old daughter&#x27;s tiny fingernails! It&#x27;s almost a one-coater, too; I can&#x27;t wait to stamp with this polish! Beautiful silver holo polish for a great price!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I have 11 other polishes that are holographic and this one is not even on the glittery side, which some polishes add to obtain a more holographic look, but this is dull, dull, dull!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nail color with a spectraflair look, I saw reviews of this online and it looked so vibrant and beautiful but when I actually got it, its very dull and the rainbow spectraflair effect is not as visable as you are lead to believe. Still, its a good one for the collection and I like it.</li>
    <li> Please be careful when ordering this polish. There are TWO versions. One is the holo that is a dupe for China Glaze and the other is a pretty silver foil. The vendor I bought mine from had a picture of both but did not mention there were two versions. I didn&#x27;t realize until AFTER I bought and received my polish. It&#x27;s a lovely color, but its NOT holographic.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the nail polish. It got here on time and was a dream to apply. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wear it so put it on as soon as I got in my house. GORGEOUS HOLO.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite polishes EVER! Two coats and done! Super fast drying time. Awesome holo effect. Gave this product 5 of 5 stars because it&#x27;s everything you expect and more. I would buy this again and will. I would buy other Color Club products. I would recommend this product to others. I payed $5.00 and free S&amp;H when I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this and was expecting a semi-dud but it really is very pretty. it&#x27;s not a super bright shining holo polish like the Layla polishes i love, but it&#x27;s def there and very pretty. three coats were needed for me, but others might do ok with two. a little streaky on the first coat. wore great, but i usually only wear polish about two or three days, so thats all i can vouch for!</li>
    <li> This polish consists of what appears to be micro silver flakes and micro silver holo flakes. Indoors, unless you&#x27;re looking really, really close, the holo doesn&#x27;t really appear to exist. Up really close, or in sunlight, the polish shows the holo. It is dense and covered well in 2 coats, so this is not to be confused with a holo topcoat. Consistency and dry time are normal.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This color is very beautiful and eye-catching under bright lights. Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stay as holographic when you apply a top coat.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and decided to give it a try. Although it looks holographic it is not that holographic unless you&#x27;re in the sun. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but it&#x27;s a pretty silver</li>
    <li> They make really great nail polish in general, this was one of their earlier holographic colors,but now they make a way more awesome holo polish. Which I now also have, but I would still recommend because I like a variety, plus then I can use this as a base coat and only have to use one coat of the newest versions for the extreme holo pop of color &amp;#34;will last longer that way&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love holographic nail polish.  This stuff looks great in the sun.  Lasts awhile and looks nice as a top coat on top of other colors for different effects.</li>
