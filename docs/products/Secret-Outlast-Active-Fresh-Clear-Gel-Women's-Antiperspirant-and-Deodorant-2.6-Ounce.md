      <li>I wish though that it did a better job at wetness control.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I was sent this product for free in collaboration with clearlybetterchallenge.com and One2One Network in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I really love how this smells.  </li>
      <li>Best of all I did not find any white stain residue on my my darker tees.</li>
      <li>The smell is ok but as I said I would like it more if it was lighter.</li>
      <li>I am blown away - I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since trying this formula</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t for sure</li>
      <li>Probably my favorite thing about this is the scent.</li>
      <li>the product was still working it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>but since I could smell it&#x27;s fragrance a couple hours after applying it I&#x27;m sure it was doing it&#x27;s job protecting me which I am grateful for.</li>
      <li>I was not a fan of the &amp;#34;active fresh&amp;#34; scent and I also seemed to get a defective stick that had a sticker that covers the top inside as well.</li>
      <li>I received this product to try through the Clearly Better challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>love that there are no streaks.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something satisfying about clicking the bottle &amp; watching the gel ooze out the top.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>This is a great new product.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately I was able to work around this and get the deodorant to come out.</li>
      <li>It offers a great scent and gives all day protection.</li>
      <li>and I felt more confident knowing that I smelled great and that I will not have any white marks on my clothes.</li>
      <li>I like how easy it was to apply to my skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>Very quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>I have allergies to strong scents and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was fine.</li>
      <li>And the scent is perfect--not too strong, not too light.</li>
      <li>but I would prefer a light scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am always looking for a deodorant that keeps me dry and &amp;#34;worry free&amp;#34; from embarrassing sweat and I think I found it in the Secret Outlast 48 hour odor protection. Secret Outlast has done just what it says &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; it has kept me dry and odor free. It states that it&#x27;s a 48 hr protection, but I exercise and take a shower so I reapplied prior to the 48 hour mark. But it gave me the confidence knowing I was protected all day. I love the clear gel so there is no white marks left on your clothes, and the scent was just enough to make you feel fresh not overly powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
    <li> I love the clear stick because I can see how much is left and when I will need to replenish.  I have the Active Fresh variety and it smells amazing. It smells so fresh and clean.  This new formula provides 48 hour protection, but I won&#x27;t be testing that out anymore. The gel is wet when you apply it, so allow a couple of minutes to dry. This will be great for the summer.

    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com, but all opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the active fresh scent. I have never tried a gel deodorant before.  I didn’t know what to expect.  I didn’t like the wetness when I applied the deodorant.  The smell lasted all day and I felt protected throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have used secret for as long as I can remember. I have not used the clear gel until now. I was impressed by how it goes on with no white marks anywhere. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t dry quickly, but it really does dry after just a bit of time. I like the smell and it kept me feeling fresh all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> I was loyal to a competitive brand of antiperspirant for years, but I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Active Fresh Clear Gel as part of the Secret&#x27;s Clearly Better Challenge so I decided to broaden my horizons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Secret Outlast Clear Gel for about 3 weeks, I am more than satisfied. It goes on smoothly and dries in much shorter time than the brand I was using previously. It keeps me dry and odor free. In fact, I forgot to put it on one day and I was fine. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to apply directly after shaving. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this Secret antiperspirant a lot, and I intend to buy another when I&#x27;m out. However, I&#x27;ll buy unscented or powder fresh, my typical scent choices.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this deodorant! They should make it into a body spray! This deodorant is great for people that are active. It kept me smelling fresh all day, even after my long, hard workout. I also like that once dried, this deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave those pesky white marks on clothes. I am so indecisive sometimes and try on numerous outfits before I&#x27;m ready for the day and I hate ruining my outfit with those silly white deodorant marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about this deodorant is that the gel takes longer to dry after applied, but other than that this is a great deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of this product for free to try and write my opinion.</li>
    <li> *I was sent this for review, but it does not affect my opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally wear a powder deodorant and i love them. So, i was curious how this one was going to be since it is a gel. The scent was really fresh smelling and i love it. However, the odor protection is super low. It was last 20 minutes and then i start to smell. I wish it was a little stronger especially since it is meant to be used when you are active.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the business.The first thing I noticed was the &amp;#34; 48 hr odor protection&amp;#34; sticker on the cap-can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t skeptical as other deodorants have made the same claim and not perform. I&#x27;ve given quite some time before giving this review so I could report from a thoughtful, non rushed state.I follow the routine of showering,applying once a day and checking(sniffing)and to my delight I still smell/ed fresh,fragrant and clean hours later!The gel feels cool upon application and stays put(so your shirts will be spared). In my experience, I only need to turn the dial once and a good amount of product is released.I truly don&#x27;t have anything negative to write about this item,I recommend all to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
    <li> I have to admit - I am NOT a fan of gel deodorants. They just never seem to provide the odor control and protection that I need, and I hate that wet feeling that just lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled with the light scent, and the excellent coverage that the Outlast Clear Gel gave to me. I am constantly on the move from early morning until well past midnight most nights. The Outlast Clear Gel hung tough with me and protected me every single minute of my long day and kept me dry, comfortable and odor-free. I love the scent as well. Definitely going to be a regular purchase for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> Note: I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an Invisible Solid deodorant for years. I thought I was getting good odor protection from my previous brand but after trying this new Secret Outlast Clear Gel I realize I was wrong. With my regular deodorant I would have to reapply at least once through the day, especially if I was outside or working around the house (which is quite often). Since I&#x27;ve been using the new Secret Outlast Clear Gel I can go through the entire day without having to reapply and I still smell fresh even when I&#x27;m ready for my shower in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ Great scent!&lt;br /&gt;~ Lasts all day even when you&#x27;re working hard.&lt;br /&gt;~ Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ No white marks on your clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ Even when using the recommended amount, it runs out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;~ It&#x27;s a little pricey (but worth every penny!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this new deodorant from Secret and I will be buying it regularly as it is now my go-to deodorant. I can&#x27;t speak to the other fragrances in the Secret Outlast Clear Gel line but the Active Fresh fragrance smells wonderful. It&#x27;s not too overpowering and even my husband has commented on the fragrance (he&#x27;s normally oblivious even to perfumes I wear so that is saying something)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want great protection from perspiration this spring and summer when it&#x27;s hot, this is the product you should turn to. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this product to try through the Clearly Better challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use a gel deodorant that lasts me through the waking hours but not the night. Secret Outlast performed just as well, perhaps better, on regular days. I woke up smelling almost fresh as a flower, which was pretty impressive. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to get 48 hours out of this product, but that&#x27;s because I only use a single click and not the 2-3 per arm as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is because the slots administer a lot of product. Although it dries quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky, I wouldn&#x27;t want to use any more, especially considering how strong the scent is. It&#x27;s not bad, but it certainly took me by surprise. Count me with the other reviewers who said they want an unscented version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this product didn&#x27;t cost twice as much as my typical deodorant. I guess I&#x27;ll wait for a sale!</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I have never used a gel before so I was very leery of using this one, but I was pleasantly surprised! It was cold and wet went when it went on, but within seconds, it dried and just felt clean. I spent an entire day hiking around in the Florida heat, and it still felt fresh and clean. The Active Fresh scent is very light and pleasant. I have allergies to strong scents and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stood up to its promise of protection and was clear with no marks on my black top. I really like it!</li>
    <li> (As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE Secret Outlast Clear Gel! The Active Fresh scent is very clean and it works like it says it does. You only need 1 click per underarm. I don&#x27;t get a lot of odor but it still works great for me. I have always liked Secret&#x27;s gel deodorant and this one is no exception. It dries fast and leaves nothing on your clothes. I even put too much on one day and didn&#x27;t wait to get dressed in a blouse and you could see wet marks but as soon as it dried, the marks were gone! Love it and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it feels good on, it dries fast, no residue and it works. It keeps me fresh and smelling good. And it doesn&#x27;t make me itch like a lot of other brands.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the results. I often have trouble finding a product that will keep me dry and odor free, but this one does the trick! The scent of the product is not too strong, but is pleasant.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal Secret consumor - it is the only brand of deodorant I buy so I was excited to get to try this new clear gel formula. I am blown away - I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since trying this formula I&#x27;ve noticed two things. 1. I never have to reapply. Even if it&#x27;s been a long day and I&#x27;m going out at night? No need. 2. It leaves zero white marks on dark clothing. I wore it under a black evening gown this past weekend and there were no marks on my dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No marks on my dress and I stayed comfortable and fresh all night long (and it was a VERY long affair!). Secret Outlast gel is my new favorite deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic addition to the Secret Deodorant line. Outlast Clear Gel really does go on clear; it doesn&#x27;t dry out my underarms. More importantly it keeps me dry and odor free morning till night!! Today was a great test; a full day of chasing a 3-year-old around and then a late night hot yoga class and I am still dry (that is my underarms are dry!!) and have absolutely no under arm odor!!!! I&#x27;m thoroughly and completely impressed!! And in love with this product. LOVE!! LOVE!! LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s New Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I found the product to be great at odor protection. The scent is very strong and I don&#x27;t care for the strength of it. The smell is ok but as I said I would like it more if it was lighter. I had some trouble at first with getting more product out. It was hard to tell if the product came threw the holes some times because it is a clear gel. Overall I would recommend it but I would prefer a light scent.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.  I received the Active Fresh Scent.  I liked the scent and that this is a long lasting product.  It says 48 hour protection, but I applied this daily after showering so I am not sure about 48 hours.  The product goes on wet and you have to wait a moment before you finish getting dressed.  Since it&#x27;s a clear gel, there are no white marks on your dark clothing to worry about.  The only con I had with the product was getting it initially started.  I had to click quite a few times before it started to come out.  I find that I seem to use more product with gels than other forms of deodorant.  I will purchase this product.</li>
    <li> It had been quite some time since I tried gel deodorant, so I thought it was time to give it another try. In the past, I haven&#x27;t been particularly found of gel deodorants based on how the felt to apply and wear. However, the aspect of gel I find most appealing if the lack of leaving a white residue. It seems even stick deodorants that claim to not leave white marks do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My general impression and experience with this deodorant has been great! A little goes a long way, one twist/click of the tube is all you need for each arm pit. I first twisted it about three times and found that was FAR too much to use. The cooling sensation of the gel would be much appreciated after a long workout- once I get back into exercising, this will be going in my gym bag. And it doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on my clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this deodorant and would consider purchasing it in the future, if it were on sale. I still prefer the traditional stick deodorant to gel, but this did make me open to the idea of likely and using a gel deodorant. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my go-to deodorant just because of the price factor. I had no complains as far as how this deodorant works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was sent this product for free in collaboration with clearlybetterchallenge.com and One2One Network in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant/deodorant is fantastic !  The clear gel leaves no white marks on my clothing.  It is easy to dispense and easy to apply and dries instantly. It kept me dry all day during all sorts of activities.  And the scent is awesome and long lasting but not overpowering.  I will definitely be buying this - it is now my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> I Love Secret Outlast active fresh! It offers a great scent and gives all day protection. I love that I smell fresh no matter where I am or what I am doing- even after workouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use- simply turn the knob at the bottom a few times and a little bit of the gel comes out. Swipe it on and you are all set for a long day of lasting freshness. Plus, it&#x27;s clear gel so there&#x27;s no worries about getting it on your clothes or transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to everyone looking for long lasting protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.  And am I glad I did!  What a wonderful product on the market.  No white residue.  Goes on clear, smells wonderful and keeps me dry.</li>
    <li> The Best I&#x27;ve Tried and I think I&#x27;ve tried all the rest. I apply this once  day and never need to reapply during the day. It feels cool and comforting. The scent is light and fresh. I&#x27;m going to stock up on this product!

    <li> As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the scent of this product well enough and it dried fairly quickly. I also like that it didn&#x27;t leave any sticky or white residue but I didn&#x27;t seem to get the right amount of perspiration and odor control from it.  the fragrance didn&#x27;t last under my arms throughout the day and on days that I was very busy I didn&#x27;t get the perspiration control I get from my other secret deodorant. I certainly don&#x27;t think it would last 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teen daughter tried it and she had the same results. she wanted the fragrance to last longer and she said it was gone by the time she got to school each day.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this product since I&#x27;ve been using Degree deodorant all of my life. I have tried other secret products in the past and they just didn&#x27;t work well for me. I&#x27;ve also never tried a gel before so I wasn&#x27;t for sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pretty satisfied with this product. It goes on clear and dries quickly which is a plus. it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing like some other deodorants do. when first applied, It has a cold/wet feeling which was new to me. If it didn&#x27;t dry so quickly I wouldn&#x27;t have liked it. My only complaint about this product is that I don&#x27;t like the scent. It just smells too perfumey for me. The deodorant last me all day which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I was skeptical because in the past gel deodorants tend to not work well for me. Secret Outlast is much different. The scent is fresh and clean. There is no sticky residue left behind and it totally lasts all day! I was very pleased with this deodorant and will purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Secret products off and on for the past several years so I was excited to try this product. I usually like the gel form because it doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks on my clothing. While I do think that the scent was pleasant and long lasting, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say that it lasted 48 hours. It&#x27;s kind of hard to say since I shower and reapply deodorant daily anyways. :) I used this product on several occasions where I worked up a good sweat. (mainly exercise and yard work) The product did prevent any stinky odor but the wetness protection could have been a bit better. My armpits felt a little sticky on those occasions. Not incredibly noticeable but not as good as I would like either. Overall, I would recommend this product for general everyday use, though, as the fragrance and odor control were GREAT!! :) As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel. All opinions expressed here are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using secret product for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a clear gel deodorant. I really love it! Only a small amount goes a long way. The gel is easy to apply and dries instantly, leaving no white marks or sticky streaks. The scent is pleasant and long lasting -- well over 24 hours. And it doesn&#x27;t get on any of my clothes. It&#x27;s great for workout and everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.*</li>
    <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel really did outlast many other antiperspirant/deodorant products I have used in the past.  While I did not experience the full 48 hours of odor control that the product claims, it did regularly keep me smelling good and feeling confident for a full 24 hours +.  (Though it did not necessarily keep me dry) I read that some people didn&#x27;t like the active fresh scent, but I really did.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be too overpowering.  This is definitely a product I would recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> I have tried other gel deodorants and was not impressed. So I was curious to try Secret Outlast Gel to see if it was any different than the others.I was pretty surprised at the results. The gel was cool when applied but quickly dried and didn&#x27;t leave my arm pits tacky or sticky. I applied once in the morning and by the end of the day, after running errands, chasing kids and working out there was no odor and there was no white streaks under my arms or on my clothes. I am really loving the active fresh scent too. I am confident that Secret Outlast Gel will keep my under arms cool, dry and odor free. I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network.</li>
    <li> I loved the Secret Outlast Active Fresh Clear Gel deodorant.  It smells amazing and the scent actually lasts all day.  It also keeps you protected throughout the day even after a long workout.  The gel does go on wet, but it dries super quickly without leaving behind any sticky residue so I can get dressed right away.  I like that the gel goes on clear and stays clear.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks on clothes, which is great.  It&#x27;s definitely my new favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
    <li> I really love how this smells.  It is so clean and fresh.  I applied it once in the morning and it lasted all day, even working outside in the heat. It dried quickly and left no residue so I can wear it with sleeveless tops.  Great deodorant!

    <li> Secret Outlast Active Fresh Clear Gel is one of the top deodorant products I&#x27;ve used in the past few years. I like that the clear gel goes on smooth and dries fast--that means I&#x27;ll never have to worry about white streaks on my clothing. I also like the way this product lasts. I can work out and go about my day without having to reapply. And the scent is perfect--not too strong, not too light. I will definitely be buying this again.

    <li> I received Secret Outlast Active Fresh Clear Gel as a sample in exchange for my honest review and am happy to report that I liked the product. I usually use solid gels and the two most important criteria for me are that my deodorant protects me from perspiration throughout the day and does not leave white marks on clothing. This clear gel worked very well.. The large bottle has a gel that has a clean, slightly floral fragrance that is very mild and pleasant. Even after a rigourous workout, I did not have to re-apply deodorant and felt confident that I smelled pleasant. Best of all I did not find any white stain residue on my my darker tees. I will be purchasing this deodorant again.</li>
    <li> (NOTE: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use an invisible solid deodorant. I like that they go on clear and stay clear. I usually tend to stay away from gel deodorants. They&#x27;re usually messier to use and don&#x27;t seem to give me as much coverage as an invisible solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant in the Active Fresh scent. I liked that this deodorant was clear. Other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve tried are usually white. So, this deodorant goes on clear and stays clear. I also liked that the top of the dispenser had a lot of little holes. All the other gel deodorants I&#x27;ve tried only had maybe three or four areas where the deodorant would come out of. All the little holes ensured even coverage. I also found that I didn&#x27;t even need a full click to get enough deodorant out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel deodorant does go on wet and so I have to wait a little bit before getting dressed, but it&#x27;s not that bad. The Active Fresh scent was nice. Not too strong, though, I usually prefer a floral or clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Clear Gel claims to provide up to 48 hours of protection, but I can&#x27;t really comment on that, since I shower everyday. I can say that I didn&#x27;t experience any wetness or odor during the day while using the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend Secret Outlast Clear Gel and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recently got a free sample of Secret&#x27;s new &amp;#34;Outlast Clear&amp;#34; deodorant from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network. I am rather picky with my deodorant and normally wear clinical strength, but I figured I would give it a try. I was not a fan of the &amp;#34;active fresh&amp;#34; scent and I also seemed to get a defective stick that had a sticker that covers the top inside as well. Fortunately I was able to work around this and get the deodorant to come out. Aside from the scent I liked how it worked and kept me protected and dry throughout the day (even in an office that can often feel like a sauna.) I would certainly try this product again - assuming it had a scent that was more to my liking.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my DH &amp; myself.  We love that it does not seem to mark up clothing.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. i would totally recommend this to anyone, the gel goes on smoothly and dries quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on your clothes and the odor protection definately outlasts any other deodorants i&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I am normally not a huge fan of gel deodorants but decided to give this a try, and I am glad I did. When first applying the gel, yes it made my armpits feel wet, but within 10 minutes they were no longer bugging, which was always my biggest issue with gel deodorants. When it came to protection, I feel that Secret Outlast did a great job, it actually lasted all day, which my regular deodorant does not always do. So the smell, I liked it, it was different, but not over-powering, but enough of a scent to make me feel fresh through the day. I will continue to use this product and recommended to anybody else that is not a huge fan of gel deodorants to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
    <li> I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network.  Normally, I use a men&#x27;s formula antiperspirant/deodorant. Of course I used Secret when I was younger. It was a right of passage. And once we were allowed to shave our pits, Secret promised that it would not sting. Now, I&#x27;m old. Old, and I sweat like a man. When I got this new version of Secret I really wanted to LOVE it. It&#x27;s a little embarrassing to use men&#x27;s deodorant. Day one I opened the Secret and was leery of the gel format. I tried it and lo and behold, it stung my newly shorn pits. Strike one. However, by the end of the day I was not drenched nor did I stink. Ok, points for P&amp;G. Day two and three, more of the same. By day four not so good. Did I build up an immunity? I don&#x27;t know but my shirts were drenched and I was a stinko. I gave it a couple more days and noticed the active fresh scent was really overpowering. Yes, it&#x27;s a lot better than the overpowering stench of B.O. but it was not altogether pleasant. Now, I&#x27;m not saying that this product is no good for someone who doesn&#x27;t spritz like a fountain. It would be a great starter deodorant today just as it was in the 1970&#x27;s. So, if you have a daughter or other female in your life who is starting to smell like a woman, or a sasquatch like me, then I strongly suggest you go ahead and pick this up.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of this product from clearlybetterchallenge.com for review. Upon receiving the item to review, i took the cap off and smelled the deodorant. it smelled heavenly. after smelling, i removed the protective label and twisted it until deodorant came up through the top. i applied the deodorant to my underarms and although it felt cold, it also felt good once it dried. it felt like there was absolutely nothing there. i put the deodorant to the test by working out. after my workout, i noticed i still smelled good and the product was still working it&#x27;s magic. this secret outlast clear gel leaves behind absolutely no white residue. its truly a product worth buying and i look forward to buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. That being said, I honestly think that Secret Outlast Clear Gel is amazing! I was excited to try this sample because I have never used a gel deodorant. I always out my deodorant on before my shirt, and even the solids that say non-marking still leave a mark. Secret doesn&#x27;t. It lives up to its 48 hour claim too. I am impressed with it. It doesn&#x27;t drip or run down your side like claims from other brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a week now and i do like it.  Although it goes on feeling wet it does dry quickly and it does not leave any white marks, streaks and I love that there is no flaking. The directions advise to apply 2-3 clicks as needed and I&#x27;ve been using only 1-2 because I seem to get plenty of product with that.  i think it does a great job on odor control. I&#x27;ve been using it when i run and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m very smelly when I finish. I wish though that it did a better job at wetness control.  I&#x27;m still sweaty and wish that I wouldn&#x27;t feel that wet under my arms.  I may just need to apply product again in early evening pre-workout.  I do like the active fresh scent.  It&#x27;s not a strong scent, but it&#x27;s pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge as a member of one2one network,</li>
    <li> Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.  I loved being able to apply this product and not worry about white marks on my shirts! It smells great, though the scent didn&#x27;t last a whole 48 hours like it was supposed to. I definitely felt the scent lasted about 24, which is good enough for me.  My only disappointment is that it didn&#x27;t keep me dry on the days I was doing more strenuous activity (gardening or working out). This is the reason I knocked it down a star. Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> *As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All antiperspirants/deodorants are not created equal. After using this for the last couple weeks, I have decided that this is the one that I will continue to use. It goes on clear, leaves no stains like the powdery ones I have used before. It lasts all day for me and I don&#x27;t have any issues with it not covering any odors that may occur during the day. One huge plus is that I only had to use a little bit and it still worked perfectly for me. It had a great smell and I felt totally fresh the entire day.</li>
    <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I have been using it for about two weeks now and I LOVE it! I don&#x27;t typically use gel deodorant, but this one dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling wet. It also works really well all day, no matter what you&#x27;re doing. Probably my favorite thing about this is the scent. It says &amp;#34;Active Fresh&amp;#34; and it smells fresh and floral. One day (and this was hours after I put on the deodorant) I was standing in the living room and I smelled flowers and I was trying to figure out where it was coming from. It was from my armpits, LOL, it was the deodorant that I could smell! Anyway, I really like this deodorant and although I got a free stick to try I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a great new product.  It is a clear gel so is invisible.  It goes on easily.  I like the container and how it is applied, just turn the bottom a couple of times and a little gel rises up.  Swipe both armpits and you are done.  Very quick and easy.  It smells great.  The protection lasts all day.  I am mostly sitting at the computer all day and it is not very hot here yet so I don&#x27;t sweat much anyway but I can tell it does work and my underarms are completely dry.  I am very happy with this product and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
    <li> I have been a major fan of Secret since I was a teen. This brand doesn&#x27;t fail. As a matter of fact it over delivers. The deodorant goes on wet but dries to a clear finish. Match that with an awesome scent and I am one happy/repeat customer. I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
    <li> The first time I used the Secret Outlast Clear Gel it took awhile to get the gel to the top to actually be used. After that though it seemed to work decently. The directions say to apply 2 - 3 clicks as needed to your underarms. I tried one click and that amount seemed good enough for me. I liked the fresh clean scent that this Secret Outlast Clear Gel comes in. Applying the gel to my underarms felt cool but it dried decently. I like that it didn&#x27;t leave any white marks. While I don&#x27;t sweat or produce a lot of odor typically, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was protecting me but since I could smell it&#x27;s fragrance a couple hours after applying it I&#x27;m sure it was doing it&#x27;s job protecting me which I am grateful for. I even decided to see how well Secret Outlast Clear Gel holds up for 48 hours this weekend and it seemed too. I was really happy about this. Now if I do happen to forget and not use deodorant in the morning that day, it&#x27;s ok because Secret Outlast Clear Gel will protect me and do it&#x27;s job.

    <li> As a member of One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the Clearlybetterchallenge site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Secret user off and on for over 30 years. I usually use it if it is on sale at my local drugstore. I have had problems usually with gel deodorant, but when I was given a chance to try the product I jumped at the chance. I hate having the &amp;#34;white marks&amp;#34; on my clothes so usually that would be the only reason I would really consider a gel. I sweat quite a bit and was hoping that this product would be able to cover and smell incredible. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Active Fresh scent. It was not overpowering and I felt more confident knowing that I smelled great and that I will not have any white marks on my clothes. It goes on wet but dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and really liked it. I like how easy it was to apply to my skin. Once applied, the antiperspirant worked really well and protected me from odor for a long time. I did not have to reapply at all the day I used it. I think the scent is really good as well. It is not too strong but smells nice. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample from clearlybetterchallenge as a member of the one2onenetwork.</li>
    <li> I think this product is awesome.  I tend to shop around, a lot. I like to try new products and compare to what I already use. Recently, I received a sample of the secret outlast clear gel. I have used the clear gels, and I have used Secret, in the past, but never the Outlast line. I love it. It smells great and the protection is long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are no streaks. I wear dark colors, often, due to work and I love that I don&#x27;t have white marks on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would purchase!</li>
    <li> *As a member of One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the Clearlybetterchallenge site.    I&#x27;ve been a Secret user for over 25 years. During that time many new products &amp; scents have been released but I have faithfully stuck by the original solid. My husband has asked me time &amp; time again why I continue to use the solid when I know it leaves white marks on my clothing. The thing is I have tried the other &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; products and they didn&#x27;t work for me &amp; some of them actually left me with &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34;.  I suffer from PCOS so I have high testosterone levels that come and go &amp; even though the clear products worked for my friends &amp; family it has always been a no go for me. The only exception has been the clinical strength, which I love and used after having all 3 of my babies (when you&#x27;re prone to excessive sweating).  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Active Fresh scent.  Although the scent was a bit overwhelming, once you put it on its noticeable just enough to not annoy you, yet still let you know that you&#x27;re &amp;#34;good to go&amp;#34; throughout the day. Not overpowering at all. It goes on wet but dries very quickly.  I thought for sure it wouldn&#x27;t last through one of my tough workouts but after an hour of extreme cardio I smelled awesome! I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Pros: * When showering I didn&#x27;t have to scrub it off before I could shave. It came off a lot easier &amp; didn&#x27;t clog up my razor like solids sometimes do. * There&#x27;s something satisfying about clicking the bottle &amp; watching the gel ooze out the top. Am I right?  Cons: *The only downside here is the price is a bit steep for this scent &amp; the bottle doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the regular solid.  I&#x27;m definitely going to stay stocked up on it though for those days I wear dark clothing or work out extra hard because it&#x27;s nice to FINALLY have a clear gel that works for me!</li>
