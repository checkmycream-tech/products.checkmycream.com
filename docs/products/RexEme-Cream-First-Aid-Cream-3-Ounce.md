      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for my dry itchy skin!  </li>
      <li>Product is fine.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m super glad I found it on amazon.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hands moist and crack free.  </li>

      <li>As I have gotten older my skin bruises more easily.  </li>
      <li>but it goes away quickly</li>

      <li>A beautician told me about this gem of a first aid cream almost 20 years ago.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of J&amp;J first aid cream (before they gave it up).&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>THANK you for Rex Eme First Aid Cream .</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magical powers if mixed with the other magic potion - coconut oil.  </li>
      <li>Cleared up the spot of psoriasis on my husbands forehead but not the large spot on his calf.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing moisturizer that was highly recommended to me after I had some extreme microdermabrasion and chemical peels.</li>
      <li>Really wish it was cheaper and more available in store because it is the only thing that works for my cracked dry hands.</li>
      <li>Thanks for asking.</li>
      <li>Really helps to heal damaged skin.</li>
      <li>Your delivery was very prompt.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Sure it smells for a few minutes, but when you weigh all the benefits, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It pretty much stopped the itching, but had to reapply it hours later.  </li>
      <li>When my dad got skin grafts, it helped heal the new tissue.</li>
      <li>Well at least for me, having tried many, many creams for my dry skin this one actually works!  </li>
      <li>It does not have the same ingredients that Johnson &amp; Johnson First Aid Cream has.</li>
      <li>This Rex creme was recommended by my dermatologist and so far it&#x27;s the only thing that has really made a difference.  </li>
      <li>The only hand cream that really works.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it is too old.  </li>
      <li>Heat sensitive in your mailbox in the summer.</li>
      <li>Unlike any other cream it absolutely does what it says.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little medicinal, but it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>even though nothing can come close to its healing properties, this is the only product that works on my young toddlers with their rashes or dry skin.</li>

<li> and so one tube lasts for a long time.</li>
<li> Smells a little medicinal, and is a little sticky, but still works very well.  </li>
<li> My hands tend to get really dry and cracked this time of year</li>
<li> Dry skin, cat scratches, mosquito bites.</li>
<li> The tube of Rex Eme Cream I received was so dried up, I could barely squeeze anything out of it.  </li>
<li> if you have uber dry skin, TRY IT!</li>
<li> so I&#x27;ve always got some on hand for my now dry itchy hands!  </li>
<li> I live in super dry utah where the winters can be brutal on your skin, especially hands and knuckles.</li>
<li> It has become harder and harder to find in the stores</li>
<li> so I&#x27;ve never really viewed it as a quality hand cream although it might spread</li>
<li> Dulls the pain &amp; in some cases stops blistering.</li>
<li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a smidge pricey, but a little goes a long way</li>
<li> A little does go a long away.</li>
<li> Total waste of money!</li>
<li> I am more than disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> I use it every day until the problem with my skin is under control and then use it every other day.</li>
<li> Seriously, I would use it over Neosporin or other medical creams.</li>
<li> It works where other lotions have been too thin and its effects last longer.</li>
<li> (ha ha), but a little pricey.</li>
<li> If you have serious dry itchy skin in the winter, use this like a lotion.</li>
<li> I have found it in a few salons and beauty supply stores, so Amazon is the easiest way to purchase.</li>
<li> I put Rex Eme on and within a few days the bruises are gone.  </li>
<li> A few years ago a friend recommended Rex Eme and it has worked like a DREAM.</li>
<li> Have a small cut, burn, rash, insect bite?</li>
<li> several people in my family suffer from several eczema, to the point of bloody knuckles, etc.</li>
<li> In the summer stops sunburn from peeling &amp; again, helps dull the pain.</li>
<li> Because it is a little expensive</li>
<li> This cream is very thick and causes my skin to itch.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it sparingly on the last of an annoying breakout.  </li>
<li> within a couple of days you will see dramatic results and be a believer.  </li>
<li> This product works when others fail.</li>
<li> Stops your nose from cracking when you have a cold.</li>
<li> It is terrible and useless while it is supposed to moisturize.</li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before. Great for skin problems. Dry skin, cat scratches, mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> It actually works. Really wish it was cheaper and more available in store because it is the only thing that works for my cracked dry hands. I put this on and see results right away. A little does go a long away.</li>
    <li> My husband especially likes this cream. The smell is a little medicinal, but it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I live in super dry utah where the winters can be brutal on your skin, especially hands and knuckles. several people in my family suffer from several eczema, to the point of bloody knuckles, etc. For years we tried everything, Eucerin, Cetophil, perscription lotions, you name it, nothing worked well. A few years ago a friend recommended Rex Eme and it has worked like a DREAM. This is VERY thick, so we usually only put it on at night right as we are headed to bed. however, it works so well that using it just once a day like this is enough. within a couple of days you will see dramatic results and be a believer.  It&#x27;s a smidge pricey, but a little goes a long way and so one tube lasts for a long time. It has become harder and harder to find in the stores so I&#x27;m super glad I found it on amazon. if you have uber dry skin, TRY IT! you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smells a little medicinal, and is a little sticky, but still works very well.  The travel size are very handy (ha ha), but a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Always works great. Love it!</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT..EVERYTIME</li>
    <li> This cream works good for burns AND tattoos!  Promotes healing &amp; minimizes scarring.  Has a medicinal smell like eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> Product is fine. Heat sensitive in your mailbox in the summer.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older my skin bruises more easily.  I put Rex Eme on and within a few days the bruises are gone.  Nothing else does this.</li>
    <li> A beautician told me about this gem of a first aid cream almost 20 years ago. Have a small cut, burn, rash, insect bite? I&#x27;ve used it sparingly on the last of an annoying breakout.  Smooth some on on tonight and notice that the burning and swelling disappears or is almost gone when you wake up tomorrow. The cream is touted as a first aid cream so I&#x27;ve never really viewed it as a quality hand cream although it might spread it&#x27;s magical powers if mixed with the other magic potion - coconut oil.  The smell, yes, it&#x27;s there but it goes away quickly and I consider it part of the mystery.  Showed it to my brother and sister in law pharmacists and they were uncertain as to why it works so well but find it helpful for fishing hook and berry picking scrapes, etc. Seriously, I would use it over Neosporin or other medical creams. My only problem is keeping enough on hand as family members borrow it. I have found it in a few salons and beauty supply stores, so Amazon is the easiest way to purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.  It pretty much stopped the itching, but had to reapply it hours later.  THANK you for Rex Eme First Aid Cream .</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for my dry itchy skin!  I bought the purse size so I&#x27;ve always got some on hand for my now dry itchy hands!  It&#x27;s medicated --- it seeps into the skin and leaves no greasy feeling.  It does have a menthol smell (thus the medicated part) --- but that too subsides in time.  There&#x27;s nothing better out there.  Trust me.</li>
    <li> The BEST for sore, chapped hands! Gives all-day protection from detergents and the elements.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer that was highly recommended to me after I had some extreme microdermabrasion and chemical peels. It&#x27;s really great for flaking skin or during harsh winter conditions. It absorbs fairly quick and the smell is one of a medicated product but quickly goes away. I highly recommend it. It also does not cause me any breakouts.</li>
    <li> Mentol is an irritant who would thimk it would be in a first aid cream. Warning if asthmatic or chemical sensetive do not buy will cause an attack.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick and causes my skin to itch. It is terrible and useless while it is supposed to moisturize. Not soothing at all. I use it for two days and had to throw the tube out. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my tattoos and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Used this 5-6 years ago for a stubborn hand issue.  solved it quickly after others didn&#x27;t..Same issue now...tried others..went back to RX..problem solved</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected. It does not have the same ingredients that Johnson &amp; Johnson First Aid Cream has.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cream. It really works. Like anything else you need to use it every day. Because it is a little expensive I use it every day until the problem with my skin is under control and then use it every other day. Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss</li>
    <li> I am a fan of J&amp;J first aid cream (before they gave it up).&lt;br /&gt;And even though nothing can come close to its healing properties, this is the only product that works on my young toddlers with their rashes or dry skin. It is a very good product and we have been using it for 1 year and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> My hands tend to get really dry and cracked this time of year and I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers, none of which had a lasting effect.  This Rex creme was recommended by my dermatologist and so far it&#x27;s the only thing that has really made a difference.  It keeps my hands moist and crack free.  It&#x27;s especially effective if I put it on right before bedtime then cover my hands with cotton gloves and keep them on overnight (this also works with vasoline).  The Rex creme has my seal of approval.</li>
    <li> I have had excellent results with this product and I intend to order another tube.Your delivery was very prompt. Works much better than steroid ceams</li>
    <li> I have been using since our local drug store carried it. MI made product, which is nice. Not a big pharmacutical company. When I worked in food service, it was a life saver for burns. Dulls the pain &amp; in some cases stops blistering. In the summer stops sunburn from peeling &amp; again, helps dull the pain. Cleared up the spot of psoriasis on my husbands forehead but not the large spot on his calf. Stops your nose from cracking when you have a cold. If you have serious dry itchy skin in the winter, use this like a lotion. When my dad got skin grafts, it helped heal the new tissue. Sure it smells for a few minutes, but when you weigh all the benefits, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> The tube of Rex Eme Cream I received was so dried up, I could barely squeeze anything out of it.  The tiny amount that emerged did nothing for my skin.  Perhaps it is too old.  There is no expiration date on the product.  I am more than disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> The Rex Eme cream is wonderful! It works where other lotions have been too thin and its effects last longer.</li>
    <li> This product is great. pricey but great. It was recommended by my dermotologist and works as prescribed. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product works when others fail. Really helps to heal damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT IT IS VERY GOOD FOR MY FEET.</li>
    <li> The only hand cream that really works. Unlike any other cream it absolutely does what it says. Follow the directions and you will see remarkable results.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Kohnson&#x27;s first aid&lt;br /&gt;Cream (not made anymore) Burberry good.</li>
    <li> Well at least for me, having tried many, many creams for my dry skin this one actually works!  And it lasts!</li>
    <li> I had thought that it was in a smaller container but it&#x27;s fine.Thanks for asking.</li>
