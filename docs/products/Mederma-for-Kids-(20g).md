      <li>We are so happy - this was really amazing.</li>
      <li>it is indeed a good product for recover from a wound.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s all good news regarding this product -</li>
      <li>It has no scent, which is good.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this company thought purple would be a good idea to put on a kid.</li>
      <li>A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
      <li>I hear bio oil is good too but will finish this tube before buying that.</li>
      <li>They sent the product with a letter saying that its still good after 2 yrs of expiration date.</li>
      <li>not as good as I</li>

      <li>I seems to stay on all day which is nice.</li>
      <li>I heard that this is good for mom, you bought a try, hope as her wish!I hope it will be ok</li>

      <li>I personally think it&#x27;s a great product for a good price!</li>
      <li>So far I am very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>design humane, quality and price amount, suitable for children.</li>
      <li>It does go on easily and have a nice smell, but some of the gel hardens on the cap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>, I LOVE Mederma</li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;m sure the purple coloring and added scent to the product didn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure about the reviews stating that it made scars purple...</li>
      <li>still helpful in any way, just make sure that it will be applied twice a day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However the grape scent is overwhelming and my child hates the smell.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>, it was a good price and works good so far on my daughter.</li>
      <li>Great Product Fast Shipping</li>
      <li>More like 5.</li>
      <li>My sons scar looks a lot better after using this.  </li>
      <li>Shouldn&#x27;t have bought the kids version for my grand daughter.</li>
      <li>Love Mederma.  </li>
      <li>i love it&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyway, I love it</li>
      <li>It says it can take awhile, like 8 weeks or more, but it is working for the deepness of the scar.</li>
      <li>Vitamin E capsules worked better.</li>
      <li>Absolutely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I had also used Silvadene (RX) and Egyptian Magic ointment…&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>If you child does not want to draw attention to their scar by putting purple goo on top of it, do not buy this version of Mederma.</li>
      <li>It is way more visible than the scar itself.</li>
      <li>easy to use</li>
      <li>I like that the gel is purple so that it is easy to see when applying.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t fade or easily rinse off -</li>
      <li>Pretty effective, no wonder it&#x27;s always out-of-stock everywhere.</li>
      <li>It was a fine one time purchase, but never again...</li>
      <li>fine as I feel the cellulite do</li>
      <li>Yes, this Mederma is purple, it has a pleasant scent and as an adult</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet.</li>
      <li>The scars were lighter and smooth.</li>
      <li>I started using coconut oil works amazing and so much cheaper</li>
      <li>It does take some effort to rub it in so the purple goes away, but I think the extra rubbing/massage of the scar tissue is what helped up have great results.</li>
      <li>But you have to do everything you can for these kinds of events, and I&#x27;m comfortable using Mederma scar cream.</li>
      <li>They sent this on time but my problem is they did not tell me that it was expired(thats why its cheap).</li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>ha ha Time will tell how well this product works - so far so good.</li>
      <li>It made me as a parent feel good about not putting too many chemicals on my child&#x27;s recent surgical scar on her chest.  </li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Adult Mederma was working on my son&#x27;s face, but I saw \\&quot;kids\\&quot; and a good price, and thought, why not?  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m most impressed with how flat and soft it is.</li>
      <li>Amazon products are really pleased with the recommended response is just right for getting reliable and&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
      <li>I like it better than the regular kind.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure you can imagine how much he loves me rubbing gel onto his hands.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Mederma.  </li>
      <li>It does leave a purple colored film so make sure you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>I bought this on sale for such a good price</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even use it the full 8 weeks...</li>
      <li>So, when one of my beautiful daughters needed stitches on her forehead after falling down in the grocery store (don&#x27;t ask), I bought the kids Mederma.  </li>
      <li>Worked tremendously with my grandson&#x27;s scars.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and the scar seems to be lightening up more and more every day.</li>
      <li>Not a filmy product either and is very gel like smooth applying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But the damn stuff is PURPLE, and while it does fade as you rub and rub and rub, it needs to be rubbed everywhere it touches, not just at the scar where the rubbing is useful.  </li>
      <li>honestly, these made me second guess buying this because my daughter; scar is on her cheek.  </li>
      <li>I have to change and put it in the wash (a fun delay in the morning.)  </li>
      <li>and i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, as it was a fresh scar when we started.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It helps to remove a scar on my baby&#x27;s nose:  and remove my guilty!</li>
    <li> Worked tremendously with my grandson&#x27;s scars. Almost completely gone. I also used a cocoa stick.</li>
    <li> Bought the childrens version for my son because hes a child and i didnt feel safe using the adult version. Worked great he had a scar from stitches and after a months use it disappeared. I rate this product a 10.</li>
    <li> Have noticed no improvement.</li>
    <li> we follow the direction to use this gel&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, our kid&#x27;s new scar near the eyes really disappears&lt;br /&gt;now we are fighting with the old scar made 3 months ago,&lt;br /&gt;hope the old scar will be removed in next month.</li>
    <li> Love Mederma.  Love it.  I&#x27;m one of those people who gets bug bites out the wazoo and Mederma helps scars heal.  So, when one of my beautiful daughters needed stitches on her forehead after falling down in the grocery store (don&#x27;t ask), I bought the kids Mederma.  Um... no.  So here&#x27;s the deal.  It looks like purple jelly.  It says it dries clear.  I put it on her forehead/face.  It stayed purple.  So basically it made an already ugly looking scar look a hundred times worse because now instead of being just a scar, it also now had a big purple blob of jelly on it.  It made her feel self conscious so I finally stopped putting it on.  But I was annoyed I had spent so much money on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - get the adult version and put it on your children.  Same stuff, just not purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product was hard to find even though it&#x27;s web site listed Wal-Mart as one of the sellers.  It was even in their computer as a regularly stocked item, but nobody could find it.  It was unfortunate that it did not qualify for prime shipping considering being a medical item normally means you need it in a hurry and had to pay next day delivery prices.  Other than that, it was a good price and works good so far on my daughter.</li>
    <li> Has a distinct &#x27;grape&#x27; scent, but has worked wonders on our son&#x27;s forehead scar.  We&#x27;ve used it for 4 months, although not as religiously as the instructions direct, and the improvement is very clear.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is actually making a difference, but it is easy to use. I really like that is purple so you can see where you put it.</li>
    <li> My son had surgery in May and the Dr said recently that his scar is becoming to hard and thick and recomended this product.  After a little over a month the scar is noticably softer and thinner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and I think I am seeing an improvement on my daughters scar. Either that or I want to see one that I&#x27;m making myself believe it! ha ha Time will tell how well this product works - so far so good.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a scar above her eye brow from a cut that required multiple layers of stitches..... Unfortunately we couldn&#x27;t keep using the mederma for kids long enough to see if it actually worked because she developed a red, bumpy rash after usage (approx 5 days after we started using it). She does have eczema prone sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t surprise me. But, I&#x27;m sure the purple coloring and added scent to the product didn&#x27;t help. Sent it back.</li>
    <li> Works fast with only 2 weeks of using it on my sons scar, it faded.</li>
    <li> My dauther recently had to undergo open heart surgery and our cardiologist recommended Mederma. We use it twice a day on her chest and unlike other people&#x27;s experiences her scar has not turned purple nor are any of her clothes stained. I personally think it&#x27;s a great product for a good price!</li>
    <li> i hope it works for my scarf. now i will use it every day and hope it works . please~~~</li>
    <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t mind this cream, but I&#x27;m not sure how well it worked.  Also, looked like she had bruises on her face if it wasn&#x27;t rubbed in well enough.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s face got scraped with a fingernail and after the scab had healed, she had a pink spot that wasn&#x27;t fading and was indented a little bit, so I bought mederma.  This was 2 years ago and there is no trace of where the scar was.  My son crashed his chin into the edge of the picnic table, so he has a pink line down the middle of it. I will be using this to help it fade.</li>
    <li> They sent this on time but my problem is they did not tell me that it was expired(thats why its cheap). I should have bought this from other seller that is more expensive. I&#x27;m about to return the product I cannot believe that they will sell expired stuff for kids. They sent the product with a letter saying that its still good after 2 yrs of expiration date. I tried to contact Mederma but they are not answering.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference after 6 months of use and the purple color is a mess. My kid looked bruised because of the remaining purple- even after rubbing it in for a long time. Vitamin E capsules worked better.</li>
    <li> My husband had a mole on his nose and used the mederma to help prevent scarring after he used the itworkspaste. He has no scar now. no Mole, no scar...he&#x27;s very pleased! Just keep with it. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but does work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for a few weeks and I believe it does make a difference, but the results will vary.  The grape type of smell helps out.  Followed the instructions and applied daily for a few weeks once the wound is closed.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I used this on my son&#x27;s scar on his eyebrow from when he had stitches. I think it worked great. My son&#x27;s scar has since faded and the hair is starting regrow over the spot so it&#x27;s no longer obvious. I credit this product for helping the scar to heal so well. It does take some effort to rub it in so the purple goes away, but I think the extra rubbing/massage of the scar tissue is what helped up have great results.</li>
    <li> Hope that can help my baby&#x27;s scar on the head. I used another gem before but it seems not work well.</li>
    <li> I combined this with something else that I received from the Dermotologist so I&#x27;m not 100% sure it worked, but it smells good, is affordable, recommended by my son&#x27;s doctor and last a long time. A little goes a long way so use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Our son got a large cut on his chin and we could tell it would scar.  This Mederma for kids really worked well to reduce the redness and inflammation of the scar.  The difference was visible after just a few uses.  We found it helpful to apply at night after he went to sleep so he didn&#x27;t mess with it.  It is very nice that it comes out of the tube a non-staining purple color so you know you applied it correctly.</li>
    <li> new product date. easy to use</li>
    <li> Start to use it after one month later.&lt;br /&gt;But it is indeed a good product for recover from a wound.&lt;br /&gt;A helpful product.</li>
    <li> Just started this product a week ago so really can&#x27;t give much feedback but so far so good. It looks like my scar is flatter.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this, it comes out purple and I have rubbed it in and it looks like a bruise afterwards. I started using coconut oil works amazing and so much cheaper</li>
    <li> Amazon products are really pleased with the recommended response is just right for getting reliable and&lt;br /&gt;Your best effort ~~</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the tube to be so little. I have to use more than usual bc my daughter has bug bites everywhere on legs and arms from playing outside everyday that caused scars bc she scratch the bites plus its uncomfortable to wear. I&#x27;ve only used it for a month and ran out with all the scars looking the same. I&#x27;m thinking about getting a new tube but I&#x27;m using something else before paying for another</li>
    <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Product design humane, quality and price amount, suitable for children. Beautifully packaged, safe to use. like it very much.</li>
    <li> My son has a couple of small scratches on his face that he got at daycare. We are hoping that this works but so far, about 2 months of use, we have no seen a huge improvement. We will keep using it though as it says it may take 6 months for scars to heal. It seems expensive for a little bottle but you do not need much for each application. It does go on easily and have a nice smell, but some of the gel hardens on the cap. I will update this review in the future.</li>
    <li> now my daughter scar on her face almost fade away&lt;br /&gt;and I will like anyone who have scar to try it</li>
    <li> I  only used for 4 weeks but was able  to see definate results. The scars were lighter and smooth. I will buy again to pick up where I left off with  the regimen.I&#x27;ll probably buy a larger tube next time. Great product!</li>
    <li> It claimed it will take a while to make the scar go away. Haven&#x27;t seen any result on my kids yet</li>
    <li> Shouldn&#x27;t have bought the kids version for my grand daughter. It leaves a purple film!</li>
    <li> Great Product Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this company thought purple would be a good idea to put on a kid. Looks like a bruise.</li>
    <li> Bought it a month ago for my toddler&#x27;s face. Too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> This gel is easy to use and it smells very good. I like that the gel is purple so that it is easy to see when applying. I have been using it on my 3 year old for less than a month and the scar is already visibly lighter.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old daughter unluckily received a pair of small scars on her face from the tip of some wood screws. The wounds have been healed for a couple months now. A family member in the medical field recommended this product to use.&lt;br /&gt;The scars are at least 2-3 months old at the time of first use. I have been applying labeled directed amounts and at least multiple times per day to the scars on my daughters face for about a  month now. I can already tell a slight reduction of the scar tissue and the skin is smooth. I&#x27;m shocked at how quick this product is working since most information I&#x27;ve read stated it could be a couple months at least to see noticeable results. I will try to post an update and pics when we are finished with the process.</li>
    <li> What we ordered was just what we expected - now if we can just remember to apply it every day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure about the reviews stating that it made scars purple...honestly, these made me second guess buying this because my daughter; scar is on her cheek.  Well, I just decided to go with Mederma reputation and bought this anyway thinking it would just be safer for her face.  Well, yes the gel is purple, but it DOES rub in clear just as described.  I&#x27;m assuming the people with the purple problem are not actually massaging it in fully.  It takes patience...it&#x27;s not like rubbing on Neosporin or something.  Scars require massage for scar tissue, etc...I look at the fading from purple to clear as my &amp;#34;you did it enough&amp;#34; timer.  Anyway, I love it, it smells great, my daughter likes it....just get it if you&#x27;re wavering.</li>
    <li> I really wish I&#x27;d noticed the few reviews that warn about the awful purpleness of this terrible version before ordering.  Adult Mederma was working on my son&#x27;s face, but I saw \\&quot;kids\\&quot; and a good price, and thought, why not?  Read a few reviews, seemed like a nice deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the damn stuff is PURPLE, and while it does fade as you rub and rub and rub, it needs to be rubbed everywhere it touches, not just at the scar where the rubbing is useful.  So as I run around the scar the area nearby can&#x27;t just get some on it - that needs to ALSO be rubbed and rubbed until it&#x27;s clear.  If I miss a spot there&#x27;s then a visible purple blotch on my son&#x27;s face that doesn&#x27;t fade with time, only with washing.  Having him sit totally still while I try to dab on a tiny bit only over the spot is not easy, and if he moves (because he hates all the rubbing) and I get some on my shirt sleeve it doesn&#x27;t fade or easily rinse off - I have to change and put it in the wash (a fun delay in the morning.)  Plus the instructions say it needs to be applied THREE TIMES A DAY for months while the adult version claims once a day is enough!  Really an amazingly poorly conceived product.  My nearly-full tube is going in the garbage as soon as my replacement adult tube arrives.  And, yes, I *did* read the directions, which is why I knew to rub it to clarify, but they don&#x27;t negate the awfulness of this product.</li>
    <li> its been a few months and i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, as it was a fresh scar when we started.</li>
    <li> still helpful in any way, just make sure that it will be applied twice a day. think of buying another one</li>
    <li> What was Mederma thinking??  There is NOTHING written on the box that this product is bright purple and stains clothing.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE Mederma but I think the product manager should be fired for stupidity.  Clearly this person does not have children.  The product does not dry instantly and even when dry it rubs off and stains everything.  I thought the kids version would just be a milder version of the adult one but the only difference I see is the coloring.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this and buy the original version of Mederma (which is clear!)</li>
    <li> My son, who is almost two, was bite by a Chihuahua in the face not long ago. I was worried that this wouldn&#x27;t be a great buy since there is only .70 oz, but you don&#x27;t use that much at a time and it is a bigger tube than I thought it would be. I have been noticing a difference in the last couple weeks while using this. It says it can take awhile, like 8 weeks or more, but it is working for the deepness of the scar. I will be purchasing again if needed. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it does fade from purple to clear, but I do still see a faintness of purple while it&#x27;s on. Not a filmy product either and is very gel like smooth applying.</li>
    <li> Turns skin purple, but seems to be working... You have to apply it 3xs a day for it work though. It&#x27;s hard to remember. We&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and the scar seems to be lightening up more and more every day.</li>
    <li> My son fell and scrapped his nose this past winter.  He had a nasty scar on his nose that was not lightening on its own.  This was recommended to me by a pharmacist and I needed to purchase it on Amazon because his store did not carry the product.  He felt that this was the safest product for a young child.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have worked in a short amount of time.  The scar is barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;However the grape scent is overwhelming and my child hates the smell.  He cries and makes me wipe it off.  I have to sneak into his room at night to put it on him.</li>
    <li> It worked very well. I didn&#x27;t even use it the full 8 weeks... More like 5.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good for my baby.</li>
    <li> My son had a burn on his arm from a cup of hot tea - we were so scared he would have a scar forever.  We used Mederma for only a few months and it&#x27;s practically gone - if you didn&#x27;t know he had something there, you wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.  We are so happy - this was really amazing.</li>
    <li> This product contains parabens and dyes.  Sad to market to parents and kids with these ingredients.  Am returning.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that this product is purple and does not turn clear as it dries like, for example, a purple glue stick. If you child does not want to draw attention to their scar by putting purple goo on top of it, do not buy this version of Mederma.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to be working very well. I had a pretty awful 2nd degree burn on my leg and as soon as blister was gone and skin was intact following formation of skin buds etc….I applied me derma 2 times a day for a week and so far I am noticing rapid healing and very little scarring which is miraculous considering the damage I had done to my leg. I had also used Silvadene (RX) and Egyptian Magic ointment…&lt;br /&gt;but the Mederma seems to be working very well.</li>
    <li> Cream worked great, definitely have to be vigilant and apply it three times a day to get the best results</li>
    <li> I just started using this based on the recommendation of my pediatrician so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it reduces scarring, but I can speak to the color and smell.  It absolutely does dry clear. It only takes a very small amount to apply so maybe the reviewers that say it stays purple and looks dirty are using too much product. I also don&#x27;t have a problem with the odor lingering. It smells like grape while applying but I don&#x27;t notice the smell after a few minutes. So far I am very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/13/14 Update: This product works. My daughter has four scars and only let me put the Mederma on three because she said the fourth burned. I can definitely see a difference. The scars that received the Mederma are lighter and smaller than the one that didn&#x27;t. She&#x27;s now letting me treat the fourth scar as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for almost two months on a dog bite my kid has and i still have not seen any remarkable improvement of the scar clearing up.  the scar itself is under his chin and is about 1 cm long.</li>
    <li> Our toddler had a nasty fall and fell against a furniture corner, and got two cuts on her face -- one on her cheek, and one on her upper lip.  We&#x27;ve been using this cream for months now, and the scars get better daily.  What was simply horrible is now reduced to a nearly invisible lip scar, and a small faint scar on her cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Is it 100%?  No, and never will be.  But you have to do everything you can for these kinds of events, and I&#x27;m comfortable using Mederma scar cream.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the amazon&#x27;s services</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet. I have been using it twice a day for 2 months. I hear bio oil is good too but will finish this tube before buying that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who required 18 stiches to her face due to being bit by a dog. I couldn&#x27;t find the kid version at any store in my local area so I got a subscription of kids Merderma through Amazon. I started using it immediately after the suturesdissolved. Now the scars are not removed, but they heal nicely with use of this product.</li>
    <li> I think it is very easy to use, very effective, I like it very much!The price is very suitable!I Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale for such a good price I thought I&#x27;d try it for myself on a scar I have on my neck. (I&#x27;m an adult).  I didn&#x27;t know if it was a milder strength or what the difference was with it being for kids but in just two weeks it&#x27;s made an amazing difference on my scar.  I used it twice a day for two weeks and already my scar is flatter and softer.  I am totally impressed!  Yes, this Mederma is purple, it has a pleasant scent and as an adult I like it better than the regular kind.  I massaged it onto my scar for less than a minute twice a day, and then put another thin dab over my scar after I massaged the first application into my skin.  There was no purple residue at all, don&#x27;t know where it went but it disappears.  My scar was a rather large and deep mole removal my dermatologist did and it left a thick and raised scar.  I asked him about Mederma and he said don&#x27;t bother, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Where he got that from I don&#x27;t know, because it worked for me. You would think the dermatologist would have gotten positive reports from his patients, or maybe he had something else he was selling but I didn&#x27;t ask about it because I figured if he did have something, it would be ridiculously expensive.  Skip the expensive stuff and try this first!  I&#x27;m going to keep up my twice a day routine and I&#x27;ll report back in another few weeks&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 12/8/2015&lt;br /&gt;I meant to update sooner but it&#x27;s all good news regarding this product - I continued to use this twice a day for several months and I am happy to report my scar is barely noticeable!!  It is flat, smooth and not pink/red or white, same color as surrounding skin.  I&#x27;m most impressed with how flat and soft it is. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Mederma.  My advice is to be consistent.  I automatically put some on whenever I brushed my teeth to remember.  I used it sparingly and I still have half a tube left after it worked it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 2yo daughter for a small abrasion under her nose. I thought that the smell and the purple tint would dissipate after a few minutes but both the scent and the color were so strong that I could not have it on her face and had to wash it off immediately. This would be appropriate for any other body part but should denote that it is not for the face!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied  Just started this product a week ago so really can&#x27;t give much feedback but so far so good. It looks like my scar is flatter.</li>
    <li> Este artículo es muy bueno, yo quedé muy satisfecho con ésta compra, creo que la relación costo-beneficio es excelente, por lo tanto recomiendo este producto.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it worked great!!! I then bought the cream for adults and it takes a bit longer.  Went back to kids Mederma for post surgical shoulder scars a it is working beautifully!!</li>
    <li> This work wonders for kids. My niece had a bad burn the size of 3 x 4. By using this everyday, it healed her skin and the scar was gone. I&#x27;m glad I bought this. Her nice skin doesn&#x27;t need a scar to blemish it!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a scar from stitches on her forehead. I use the tiniest amount and it stays purple unless you really really rub it in. Then I feel like I&#x27;ve rubbed it all off. I seems to stay on all day which is nice. It&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s helping the appearance if the scar at this point or not.</li>
    <li> Been using 3mos. My daughter had a dark scar on her face. Now I really have to look for it. The scar is almost gone. This was a scar she got from a year prior.</li>
    <li> No effect, continuous use of a year, the child is still very obvious scars, no fade</li>
    <li> I like that this is for kids.  It made me as a parent feel good about not putting too many chemicals on my child&#x27;s recent surgical scar on her chest.  She loves the purple and that she&#x27;s allowed to put this on herself (she&#x27;s 7), but doesn&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s still shows purple and is slightly sticky if she gets too much or doesn&#x27;t rub it in all the way, which is usual.  It has no scent, which is good.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old daughter had a great gash on her forehead which left a tiny but deep scar on her face.  She&#x27;s so young, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll disappear when she&#x27;s older but I didn&#x27;t want to take chances and bought this product.  Since the scar was from months ago, I have apply 3x per day for 6 months.  It&#x27;s only been about a month but it does seem to be working.  Sometimes the scar seems to be just as noticeable as before (if I forgot an application) but I&#x27;m still hopeful that this will work if I stick with it.</li>
    <li> Smells like grape. Great for kids!</li>
    <li> My son had some road rash under his nose and this has definitely lightened the scar, but it doesn&#x27;t work immediately. After several weeks of application we saw a difference.</li>
    <li> I am not usually a review writer unless a product is amazing or horribly bad. This product falls under the &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34; category!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter was bit in the face at 1 years old by a terrible chihuahua. Two puncture marks were left on her face. The one punch mark smoothed out and cleared up but the other other became raised and white. It was so terrible I felt awful! I thought perhaps laser scar treatment was going to be in her future. She was about 22 months when I realized we needed to take a proactive approach to fixing this little puncture scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the mederma for kids. I Tried to put in on her as religiously as possible, and in about three weeks time, the scar is no longer white, no longer raised, and has significantly diminished in size. I am elated and a forever customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple coloring didn&#x27;t bother me so much, at least I knew I applied it in the correct spot. The only time minded the coloring was if we were headed out in public... But seriously with these results I would have painted her whole face purple knowing that I would have had this outcome. Absolutely satisfied.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to avoid the children were injured in the play.With this product can be the first time to protect my child&#x27;s skin</li>
    <li> Now we just will have to apply and wait and see if it actually works! I am crossing my fingers....</li>
    <li> not as good as I though, my son has a cut on his forehead recently, I used this and hope to reduce his scar, but no much good result, the scar seems not get less or fading away. the Gel is little bit dilute</li>
    <li> After applied on the skin, need massage about 1mn to get the purple color gel disappear, if compare to the Triderma Scar Block it doesn&#x27;t have any color.&lt;br /&gt;As for the result though, I will update again once I got the result.</li>
    <li> goods is rigth,but the express too later!</li>
    <li> I like it because it seems to work almost as well as regular Mederma, but is a lot cheaper. However, I feel regular Mederma is a slightly better product.</li>
    <li> The product might work as promised but the purple which turns into a stain-like color, makes it look like you&#x27;re child&#x27;s face is dirty. It is way more visible than the scar itself. I would just purchase the regular product as suggested by others here. Should have listened to the reviews. Serves me well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece, 9 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this can work, we will see it after six months.</li>
    <li> I was told to get this after my son&#x27;s fingers healed after a surgery he had to separate his webbed fingers (syndactyly)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this stuff! It&#x27;s slick, thin, sticky, purple, and smells strong! My son is only 14 months old so I&#x27;m sure you can imagine how much he loves me rubbing gel onto his hands. He hates it! He wants to speed around the house destroying things, not sit while mom rubs crap on his hands. The reason this matters is he&#x27;s wiggly and doesn&#x27;t like the process (his hands are also sore and sensitive ever since his surgery) and lots of times as I&#x27;m applying this he yanks his hand away and ends up smearing the crap on his clothes or my clothes, and whatever else is nearby. Because this stuff is super thin (not lotion or cream like at all, more like watery hair gel) it comes right off and I have purple all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;I eventually was advised that I could use straight up vitamin E oil instead and though I&#x27;d prefer to use the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; I do use the vitamin E oil almost exclusively because when my son smears it all over us while I&#x27;m putting it on him (and just after I put it on) it leaves *clear* oil behind. As in, you can&#x27;t see it! So I don&#x27;t have to change his clothes if we&#x27;re going out because even though there&#x27;s something on his shirt or pants or whatever, who cares if you can&#x27;t see it and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34; Just oil.&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I wish so much Mederma would remake this without the purple coloring. Or the scent for that matter. I don&#x27;t need my son walking around looking and smelling like he just had a grape popsicle :/</li>
    <li> This product did not work out quite as well as we had truly hoped it would. Our expectations were not high, but we noticed absolutely no change in our child&#x27;s scar or its appearance. Also, the Mederma leaves a rather hard to wash off purple mark on your child&#x27;s skin and it has quite an obnoxious odor. It was a fine one time purchase, but never again...</li>
    <li> I flinched when I saw the price for such a little amount, however you only need a little for the scar on your child. After using it religiously for a month I saw definite improvement- worth the money spent. And it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon that in the stores!</li>
    <li> smells nice I use it deal with my cellulite on my buns and thighs，works fine as I feel the cellulite do became not that obvious</li>
    <li> recommended by my neurologist for existing problems....amazed that my skin reacted so well to the baby formula. ugliness, eliminated..yea!!! thankx</li>
    <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;good is very good and wonderful more&lt;br /&gt;good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> The size was not what I had expected I thought I was getting the bigger one, so it was a bit costly for that size</li>
    <li> I think it works on my son... thanks!</li>
    <li> My kids have very fair skin and scar easily.  When my 6 year old needed stitches in his forehead, I was hoping that we could get that scar to lighten up.  This has drastically reduced the appearance of the scar.  I can still notice it because I know it is there but others have a hard time even seeing a faint scar.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my 2 year old son.</li>
    <li> I heard that this is good for mom, you bought a try, hope as her wish!I hope it will be ok</li>
    <li> My 14 month old fell and hit her head on some metal bleachers about 2 months ago and after her e.r. visit I knew it would leave a scar, so we purchased this product hoping to help the scar fade. I have used it for about 2 weeks and the scar is fading. It has a great smell also. It does leave a purple colored film so make sure you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> It works!!!! My 5 yr old got a scar on her cheek. I thought it&#x27;d go away at first, but it didn&#x27;t. Gave Mederma a try, and it really does work! It does take time, though. It took about 6-8 weeks, and i applied it about 5 times a week at night.</li>
    <li> With continued use, we did see improvement in my daughter&#x27;s scar.  She had a large scar across her nose from a cousin scratching her.  After about 6 months of use, I no longer need the cream.  I do attribute it to the scar cream because the scar had not healed on its own for the previous three months after the accident.</li>
    <li> The pediatrician recommended this post medical glue for a deep scar, I don&#x27;t apply as often as I should but I am noticing the scar seems to be getting much less pink.</li>
    <li> This is the only scar cream that works for my nephew&#x27;s skin. Pretty effective, no wonder it&#x27;s always out-of-stock everywhere.</li>
    <li> My sons scar looks a lot better after using this.  He has a scar all the way across his cheek and my wife and I tried hard to find something that would work on it to make it to where it wasn&#x27;t so noticable, and this mederma worked very well.</li>
    <li> Stains purple, better to get the clear one.</li>
    <li> A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
    <li> it smells nice,  it&#x27;s not harmful,and it seems working. i think i&#x27;ll try it also.&lt;br /&gt;but a little bit  expensive.</li>
    <li> This item arrived at an amazing speed. I received it in two days after I purchase it. I am not able to give a complete review since I just begin to use the product and I am sure it will take a few weeks to see the actual results.</li>
</ol>
