      <li>Pretty good, I love it.</li>

      <li>But it&#x27;s still a good facial mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin but started to notice fine lines forming shortly after I had my first child.  </li>
      <li>Instead of leaving my skin beautiful and glowing, it sucked every ounce of moisture out of it and made me look years older, instead of &#x27;younger&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s a good thing and proves that there definitely IS bee venom in this mask.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it really makes my skin feel smooth AND gets rid of blemishes</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference even right after it is washed off.</li>
      <li>love this product and those lucky enough to be receiving gifts from me</li>
      <li>This product is a pure lie!</li>
      <li>I very like the product!</li>
      <li>Bee venom was like last on the ingredient label meaning there is more of everything else than the venom.</li>
      <li>Sleep is one of those things that has eluded me since my first child was born over three years ago</li>
      <li>I have looked up a lot of the different kinds of bee Venum masks that are available on the market and found that this one is one of the ones that has the most natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I probably should&#x27;ve test it on my arm or hand first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the first to admit, I&#x27;m no Kate Middleton</li>
      <li>For the most part I look younger than my mid-thirties age but have been blown away by the reaction I&#x27;ve had since I&#x27;ve started using this mask.  </li>
      <li>Get a jar of Red Palm oil and get better results.</li>
      <li>Very misleading!  </li>
      <li>I am the last person to buy into the hype over beauty creams that claim to work magic.</li>
      <li>have to get used to it,butnrs when applied at first.</li>
      <li>more next time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
      <li>bought this for the wife after seeing the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft, and in good condition, due using the mask.  </li>
      <li>Makes you skin feel nice and tight and does everything it says it does.  </li>
      <li>It really does work.  </li>
      <li>I really how my face looks after i use it.</li>
      <li>In addition to the effect my friends and family have noticed, the sagginess around my eyes seems to have gone, my mouth area is firmer and my whole face has a dewy glow that I have never had before.  </li>
      <li>abeeco pure new zealand bee venom mask can be facail and scream in the night.</li>
      <li>As a business owner and Mom to two toddlers, my life is very busy, I&#x27;m always on the move and don&#x27;t have much time to relax or pamper myself.  </li>
      <li>Thanks fisrt and foremost to the bees for their natural generosity.</li>
      <li>I will use a few more times and update the review.</li>
      <li>Not only does my skin feel amazingly soft but the combination of ingredients in this mask/cream heals breakouts quickly.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve tried so many other things for my sensitive, prone to breaking out and now mature skin, I figured why not - it&#x27;s natural?</li>
      <li>Since I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin,hormonal breakouts,and ex smoker.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t messy, and once you apply it, you can barely see the product on your face.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to slow aging down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one who only wants all natural products and this fits the bill!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product, I have only used Kinerase products and was hesitant about using this, but after a few days I could feel and see a difference, my face felt  smoother and after a month the difference was really noticeable, being told i looked younger than i did last year was  a surprise.  </li>
      <li>and it has dried my mild acne out already!</li>
      <li>Gradually my skin has taken on a dull and sallow appearance, probably as a result of needing more sleep and disjointed nights.  </li>
      <li>They should be clear about this point, they were not.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m too young to have them yet.</li>
      <li>In panic, I then put on some aloe gel to cool my skin down and thank god it worked.</li>
      <li>And to be fair, my other friend who tried the same product didn&#x27;t have any trouble with her skin.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this product together with my usual moisturizer, it is fantastic</li>
      <li>complexion!&lt;br /&gt;I bought two pots and gave one to my Mom, she says co-workers have already made comments about a general improvement in her appearance.  </li>
      <li>I am 61 years old, and although there are just some wrinkles that will not go away, overall, it looks to me like all of the wrinkles have softened, and some have gone away, especially around my eyes.</li>

    <li> Pretty good, I love it. abeeco pure new zealand bee venom mask can be facail and scream in the night.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different Bee Venom masks, and this is one of my favorites.  My skin is soft, and in good condition, due using the mask.  I am 61 years old, and although there are just some wrinkles that will not go away, overall, it looks to me like all of the wrinkles have softened, and some have gone away, especially around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my dry skin. Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference even right after it is washed off. Wont buy again. The quality is a shame for this price.</li>
    <li> Great sipping-and great product.</li>
    <li> As someone who is picky about what I put on my skin, I purchased this product based on the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients listed on Amazon and the Abeeco website. However, the leaflet that came with this product shows the following ingredients: Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Decyl Oleate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Jojoba Seed Oil, Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Glycerin, Pea Extract, Manuka Honey, Lavender Oil, Menthyl Lactate, Carbomer, Manuka Oil, Vitamin B3 Niacinamide, Vitamin B5 Calcium d-Pantothenate, Vitamin B6 Pyridoxine HCl, Vitamin C Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin E tocopherol Acetate, Beta Carotene, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Bee Venom.&lt;br /&gt; I am sending this item back.</li>
    <li> With Botox and BBL lasers and all those invasive procedures out there it&#x27;s nice to know you can use something a step lower before you have to go to extreme to get great skin. This does have a nice tingle too it. It does an amazing job at firming the skin. My skin looks very plump and firm. People always think I am 21 or 20 and I am actually 28. This is a great product to slow aging down.</li>
    <li> I had a high expectation over this mask, but after putting it on my face for 10 to 15 minutes it started irritating my skin. I immediately washed it all off and found out my entire face was red like a lobster. In panic, I then put on some aloe gel to cool my skin down and thank god it worked. Since I have very sensitive skin I probably should&#x27;ve test it on my arm or hand first. And to be fair, my other friend who tried the same product didn&#x27;t have any trouble with her skin. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The mask make my face very smooth and hydra. I very like the product! I think i will come back to buy</li>
    <li> Used 5 times, but I did not see any visible differences. I will use a few more times and update the review.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or anything cause I guess I&#x27;m too young to have them yet. However, I do believe that prevention is the best medicine. I have dark circles under my eyes from not getting allot of sleep due to my career however so I&#x27;m hoping to get some results in that area. Additionally, it&#x27;s supposed to make skin even firmer and plumper than ever after continued use. When you put this on, you do feel sensations which are hard to describe. Almost like prickling or light stinging. I guess that&#x27;s a good thing and proves that there definitely IS bee venom in this mask.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this venom mask before as an overnight cream and my skin was flawless.  I intend on using it 2x a day now.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin,hormonal breakouts,and ex smoker. I&#x27;m 28 and I do enjoy my share of drinks as well so my skin looks dehydrated half the time. I have only used it 3 consecutive days and it has dried my mild acne out already! I have combination skin. Oily Tzone. It is nice and light but yet moisturizing. No burning,stinging nor irritation and I leave it on all day!!I have been using it under my foundation. I will try it for 6 weeks and I will c if I get the result it claims to have. So far so good. I do recommend it. I would say that for the$ everyone should use it. I&#x27;ve wasted my money in more expensive creams and I&#x27;ve never seen results in 3 days. I say GO FOR IT!</li>
    <li> Makes you skin feel nice and tight and does everything it says it does.  I will keep ordering as needed.</li>
    <li> have to get used to it,butnrs when applied at first.Need to apply for at least 10 consecytive days before burning.</li>
    <li> I just got this only used twice. I have sensitive skin yet I did not experience anything (redness or otherwise). Does make my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;I am a label ingredient reader and yet there is no picture of the box with the full ingredients or full ingredients on the bottle. Very misleading!  The jar just tells you the key ingredients the box itself however lists everything that is in it- in order.  Bee venom was like last on the ingredient label meaning there is more of everything else than the venom. Mad that I spent this much money when I did see something else with the venom being the third ingredient. ! Wish I could return. Not saying it&#x27;s a bad product but the should have a pic of the box so consumers can read the FULL label!  I will use for a couple weeks and post again.</li>
    <li> Apply Daily 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes in the evening: who has the time to do this? They should be clear about this point, they were not. Had I knew about it, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought the product for sure.</li>
    <li> good product - didn&#x27;t think it was going good for me though</li>
    <li> Received as promised. Good Seller.</li>
    <li> This is not worth the money. Get a jar of Red Palm oil and get better results.</li>
    <li> As a business owner and Mom to two toddlers, my life is very busy, I&#x27;m always on the move and don&#x27;t have much time to relax or pamper myself.  Sleep is one of those things that has eluded me since my first child was born over three years ago and I long for the days of uninterrupted nights.  Gradually my skin has taken on a dull and sallow appearance, probably as a result of needing more sleep and disjointed nights.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wouldn&#x27;t trade my life for the world but would give anything for 8 hours of snooze time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after my second child was born I started to notice droopiness around the corners of my eyes and jowls where I never had jowls before.  They were probably only noticeable to me but I decided to try a bee venom mask after reading about them in InStyle.  I&#x27;m the first to admit, I&#x27;m no Kate Middleton but I&#x27;m no Camilla either!  For the most part I look younger than my mid-thirties age but have been blown away by the reaction I&#x27;ve had since I&#x27;ve started using this mask.  In addition to the effect my friends and family have noticed, the sagginess around my eyes seems to have gone, my mouth area is firmer and my whole face has a dewy glow that I have never had before.  And if that wasn&#x27;t proof enough, I&#x27;ve been carded at the grocery store twice in the 4 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and those lucky enough to be receiving gifts from me this Christmas will find a little pot of (bee venom) gold in their stocking.</li>
    <li> Interesting product. Did notice a slight difference in pore size and skin tone. Arrived on time, undamaged and unopened. Pricey product so I may not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  It really does work.  You can feel and see it after a couple weeks of use.  My husband asked if I got a mini face lift.  :)</li>
    <li> amazing products. although it is expensive,i will by more next time.&lt;br /&gt;i used it on night, and second day, my sking looked very nice and shinning.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, I have only used Kinerase products and was hesitant about using this, but after a few days I could feel and see a difference, my face felt  smoother and after a month the difference was really noticeable, being told i looked younger than i did last year was  a surprise.  I will continue using this product together with my usual moisturizer, it is fantastic</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks fisrt and foremost to the bees for their natural generosity. This creme adds to the dream, and it delivers.</li>
    <li> The result is not as good/magic as I imagined. There is no significant change on the skin.  But it&#x27;s still a good facial mask. Skin looks a little brighter and hydrated after using it.</li>
    <li> Looking for something besides botox.  This stuff is great, read a million reviews, took the plunge and bought it.  Never got so many compliments on my skin.  Wonderful.  Does not hurt at all, do not let bee venom scare you....you won&#x27;t feel anything.  I leave it on all day instead of using it as a 20 min mask...I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin but started to notice fine lines forming shortly after I had my first child.  Perhaps because of the sleepless nights or maybe a side-effect of ageing, I decided to give this product a try after reading about bee venom in a magazine.  After a week of using morning and night, I had already noticed an improvement in my appearance and complexion!&lt;br /&gt;I bought two pots and gave one to my Mom, she says co-workers have already made comments about a general improvement in her appearance.  We both love the lightweight silkiness of this product and I truly believe that it has improved the look and feel of my skin by reducing those annoying fine lines, evening out my skin tone and helping to retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to firm up sagginess and improve your general complexion, this is the product to try.&lt;br /&gt;(Although I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging, I did notice a pleasant tingling sensation shortly after I put it on my face.  It only lasted a few seconds and lead me to believe that the bees were doing their work!)</li>
    <li> I have looked up a lot of the different kinds of bee Venum masks that are available on the market and found that this one is one of the ones that has the most natural ingredients. If you check the ingredients carefully a lot of them do have some chemicals in them. I&#x27;m one who only wants all natural products and this fits the bill! I use it every night as a night cream and it&#x27;s excellent. Ppl have noticed nice glowing skin.</li>
    <li> bought this for the wife after seeing the positive reviews. she seemed excited at first, but unfortunately has yet to try it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month and have already seen visible results!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer, healthier looking and more evenly toned. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> i got stung by this one..&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t see any change ....no tingling bee feelings either.&lt;br /&gt;only a sting in my wallet</li>
    <li> Like so many other folks on here, I have tried expensive brands and drugstore brands in skincare. Either the products do little or&lt;br /&gt;seem to work and then stop. This product after using for about 2 weeks has worked better than anything else I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to tighten and lessen wrinkles. It was cheaper than some similar bee venom brands and that is why I bought it instead of&lt;br /&gt;similar ones.</li>
    <li> This bee venom is too heavy and not even close to the feel,smell, and results from Heaven bee venom. I&#x27;m an esthitician and use bee venom in my spa, I was trying to save some money with the abeeco but it was not worth it.</li>
    <li> I am the last person to buy into the hype over beauty creams that claim to work magic. Something in the science of it all made me curious about abeeco&#x27;s mask. Since I&#x27;ve tried so many other things for my sensitive, prone to breaking out and now mature skin, I figured why not - it&#x27;s natural? Not only does my skin feel amazingly soft but the combination of ingredients in this mask/cream heals breakouts quickly. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The mask definitely smooths your skin - at least temporarily. I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t messy, and once you apply it, you can barely see the product on your face. I didn&#x27;t have any sort of allergic reaction to the bee venom. Sometimes I don&#x27;t leave it on for the entire 20 minutes (which I think is what they recommend). I also don&#x27;t use it twice a day. After using the mask I wait a few minutes and then apply moisturizer, since your skin is a bit dry you rinse the mask off. It gives your face almost a powdery, matte finish. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this Abeeco mask, however, since it IS costly (and difficult to find), I alternate using it with other products.</li>
    <li> This product is a pure lie! After a month, there is no difference in my skin! It was a waste on my time and money!</li>
    <li> I really how my face looks after i use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not greasy and it really makes my skin feel smooth AND gets rid of blemishes</li>
    <li> item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
    <li> I had used another brand of Bee Venom mask and LOVED it. I wish I had purchased it again instead of trying to save a few bucks. Instead of leaving my skin beautiful and glowing, it sucked every ounce of moisture out of it and made me look years older, instead of &#x27;younger&#x27;. Won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for!!!! A must mask for those who love their skin. Buy it without any side thoughts. Just do it!</li>
