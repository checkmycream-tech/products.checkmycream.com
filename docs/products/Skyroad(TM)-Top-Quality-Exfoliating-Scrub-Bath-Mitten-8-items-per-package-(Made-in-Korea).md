      <li>The good news is you can give away extras to friends.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>Good for face too.</li>
      <li>The quality is nice and great for exfiliating the body.  </li>
      <li>and it surprisingly didn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
      <li>A snug mitten fit seems ideal to me, because you want the scrubbie to stay on you while exfoliating.</li>
      <li>OMG I LOVE THESE!</li>
      <li>i love these!</li>
      <li>Those scrubs on a stick is nothing compared to this amazing product.</li>
      <li>Amazing.  </li>
      <li>Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin.</li>
      <li>I soaked in a tub of warm water (just water --</li>
      <li>that is VERY important) after showering and began using the towels to scrub.</li>
      <li>(it builds up on the mitt and attracts more, it seems).</li>
      <li>Having the ease to wash yourself with precision and quickness is so nice and the exfoliating part is just a HUGE benefit on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>I have never been able to use self tanner because it doesn&#x27;t go on that evenly, but I think I am going to try it again because my skin seems so much more even and softer now.</li>
      <li>My mother is Korean and she used to attack me with these when I was younger -- but I had the greatest skin ever!</li>
      <li>so we&#x27;ll see how much better my skin takes the tan.</li>
      <li>Great for regenerating new skin and blood flow to provide a better appearance and feel to skin over time.</li>
      <li>I ordered these as a cheap alternative to the Baiden Mitt and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy my exfoliator scrubs.</li>
      <li>Use firm pressure and rub in one direction on your skin for the best results.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking into purchasing these, buy the largest size available because they will shrink.</li>
      <li>This will do for light biweekly scrubbing.</li>
      <li>Fair enough, honey :)</li>
      <li>and I compared this item to one of the original ones.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  </li>
      <li>but you will never feel so clean).</li>
      <li>You think you were clean before?</li>
      <li>I paired these up with a special scrubbie spray from a Korean cosmetics shop, and whoa, it really was as effective as doing the full monty treatment at the Korean spa, sans the cute old lady smacking me around.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will make these mitten a normal purchase I love them .  </li>
      <li>Once you&#x27;re scrubbing is complete, you can re-wash/rinse with soap to get a more refreshed clean.</li>
      <li>Uber small but great for scrubbing the skin clean.</li>
      <li>Feels very abrasive at first so go easy.  </li>
      <li>These take your dead skin off, so be a good roomate and clean the bathtub</li>
      <li>That said, they DO do a nice job of exfoliating, and unlike a sponge or pouf, dry completely between uses, which is more hygienic.</li>
      <li>They really make you feel clean</li>
      <li>So these are easy on your wallet and they are fairly effective, but beware, they&#x27;re harsh.</li>
      <li>It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Only the top of the hand fits in it.</li>
      <li>You can stretch most of the size back by pulling lengthwise on the mitt.</li>
      <li>so I just put a hot washcloth on my face while I soaked in the tub).  </li>
      <li>I used it on my arms and legs first.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to clean your cloth after use since it removes dirt, sweat and dead skin (cells).</li>
      <li>Some areas may need to be scrubbed more than once and the cloth may need to be rinsed during the scrub if it becomes full of dead skin.</li>
      <li>You need to soak or shower in fairly warm water for 15 or so minutes before using them, but they really do get rid of dead skin.</li>
      <li>They really do work.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much pressure to exfoliate with it.  </li>
      <li>but this item shrinks so much</li>
      <li>Gave one to my whole family and will continue to repurchase for gifts and stocking stuffers.</li>
      <li>You have to make sure your skin isn&#x27;t too wet (or the mitt), and once you start getting the impurities out, it gets easier</li>
      <li>I put lotion on afterwards, but you don&#x27;t really even need it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like exfoliating with very fine-grained exfoliating cream, but much faster (the cloth just takes off the dead skin cells much faster - no need for too much scrubbing).</li>
      <li>:) I will continuously buy these forevermore, they get the dead skin off and I always feel soft, clean, and renewed.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t do sensitive areas at first - like decollete.  </li>
      <li>I mainly use these on my face, which is time consuming to begin with</li>
      <li>As a guy, need a little more scrub power</li>
      <li>Anyway, the original is 5\\&quot; wide even accounting for stitching and it doesn&#x27;t shrink at all whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>I have somewhat sensitive, fair skin, with lots of little issues (vitiligo, eczema, dry patches, etc)</li>
      <li>Akin to a nice Brillo bad scrubbing, you&#x27;re kind of left waiting for de lousing powder to be thrown on you after.</li>
      <li>My skin was so soft afterwards!  </li>
      <li>I soaked in a hot bath with epsom salts for about 20 minutes, and the gunk definitely rolled off (and I use a scrubby sponge every day in the shower).</li>
      <li>I rinse off quickly with soap, letting my body become completely wet for 10 minutes</li>
      <li>My skin felt bizarrely soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>These actually work very well, and I recommend them.</li>
      <li>After I finished I could not believe how soft my skin was.</li>
      <li>Exfoliates and makes your skin feel soft after.</li>
      <li>I like these a lot, very well made and will last for years!!!</li>
      <li>Nice value, but a bit on the thin side.</li>
      <li>They are small, but more than adequate, and although they do get smaller in hot water, they are never too small to use.</li>
      <li>You definitely get a smooth face afterwards, and helps get rid of small bumps/dead skin very well.</li>
      <li>They do shrink when they get wet, but I expected that from what others said so I was not disappointed when it happened.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
      <li>If you do it right, you won&#x27;t believe how much dead skin you&#x27;ve been carrying around.</li>
      <li>It took a few minutes for me to find the right combination.</li>
      <li>Hard to not be gross with a detailed review</li>
      <li>It shrinks when wet, so it doesn&#x27;t slip off the normal sized woman&#x27;s hand when exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>Your face will get a little red the first couple of times of use, but it goes away.</li>
      <li>Then: emerge from the bath like a shiny new pink piglet.&lt;br /&gt;Getting</li>
      <li>too small to fit a small adult hand in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was a little amused by the quality of these mittens as they looked rather thin. However i got a rude shock when i used these in the shower. It felt really tough and did the job just as is all the rave about it. i like these for exfoliating</li>
    <li> Feels very abrasive at first so go easy.  Don&#x27;t do sensitive areas at first - like decollete.  I used it on my arms and legs first.  Feels like your skin is being massaged.  I like it.  Got used to it after a few uses.  It also softens a little after a few uses.</li>
    <li> i love these! Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> OMG I LOVE THESE! I was so skeptical about the quality, but wow do they work well. The dead skin just sheds off (gross yes, but you will never feel so clean). Don&#x27;t use soaps, soak your skin with water for at least 5 minutes and then turn off your shower and scrub away! You think you were clean before? You will never feel cleaner! Gave one to my whole family and will continue to repurchase for gifts and stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates and makes your skin feel soft after.</li>
    <li> Really was not impressed with the results</li>
    <li> Great exfoliators!  Hard to not be gross with a detailed review, it is what it is. These take your dead skin off, so be a good roomate and clean the bathtub well when you are done.  If you do it right, you won&#x27;t believe how much dead skin you&#x27;ve been carrying around. Bought these to use prior to self-tanning, and they really help your fake tan look as even as possible and stay fresh looking longer.</li>
    <li> I mainly use these on my face, which is time consuming to begin with so I don&#x27;t mess with any other part of my body. Your face will get a little red the first couple of times of use, but it goes away. You definitely get a smooth face afterwards, and helps get rid of small bumps/dead skin very well.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s 5\\&quot; x 6\\&quot; but due to the stitching the actual width is 4 5/8\\&quot;.  After a couple of uses it has now shrunk to 3 3/4\\&quot; wide which is barely wide enough to put my hand in without my thumbs.  I posted a photo.  I&#x27;ve been using these types of cloths for my entire life now and I compared this item to one of the original ones.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to find them anywhere so I&#x27;ve resorted to online stores.  Anyway, the original is 5\\&quot; wide even accounting for stitching and it doesn&#x27;t shrink at all whatsoever.  5\\&quot; is enough to insert my entire hand so by extending my thumb it can actually hold it on my hand.  Now it just keeps slipping out.&lt;br /&gt;Oddly by feel it seems they&#x27;re the same type of fabric and can do the job equally well but this item shrinks so much it&#x27;s crazy.  I&#x27;ve never seen one that shrunk at all and that&#x27;s over 35 years of use!!&lt;br /&gt;Please stop making 8 and use the same amount of fabric, charge the same, but make 7 so the width would work out even after the shrinkage.  Perhaps preshrink them BEFORE stitching so it remains at the width the customer purchases.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering buying the long towels and sewing them into mits myself.</li>
    <li> So these are easy on your wallet and they are fairly effective, but beware, they&#x27;re harsh. Akin to a nice Brillo bad scrubbing, you&#x27;re kind of left waiting for de lousing powder to be thrown on you after. Your legs, body, face etc will be smooth-just in a slightly violated kinda way, but hey, maybe you&#x27;re into that.</li>
    <li> Uber small but great for scrubbing the skin clean.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but these work as long as you soak for at least 20 mins.  I tried the pink ones on my face and though I felt like it exfoliated my skin - I don&#x27;t think any skin peeled off like it did on my body (I also don&#x27;t know how you could soak your face for 20 mins without drowning so I just put a hot washcloth on my face while I soaked in the tub).  The green ones worked on my legs, arms and back.  Amazing.  My skin was so soft afterwards!  They DO shrink up A LOT but it&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;m trying these again before I go get a spray tan so we&#x27;ll see how much better my skin takes the tan.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I like them they work great and inexpensive. Only 4 stars because they come off of you hand quickly because they are so small (and I have small hands)</li>
    <li> These are the BEST scrubbing Bath Mittens period! Those scrubs on a stick is nothing compared to this amazing product. Having the ease to wash yourself with precision and quickness is so nice and the exfoliating part is just a HUGE benefit on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Skyroad for selling these!</li>
    <li> I paired these up with a special scrubbie spray from a Korean cosmetics shop, and whoa, it really was as effective as doing the full monty treatment at the Korean spa, sans the cute old lady smacking me around. Soak or steam bath yourself for at least 15 minutes beforehand to loosen up, then I hunker down on a little seat in the shower with a tub of water nearby, spray the magical skin removing elixir on myself (sorry, you&#x27;re going to have to track this product down yourself at your nearest K-town) and scrub away in alternating circular and straight motions. Bliss out in those minutes, get all meditative on the scrubbing (like kneading dough, right?), snap back to reality every once in a while by being half creeped out and half amazed at all the dead skin coming off. Then: emerge from the bath like a shiny new pink piglet.&lt;br /&gt;Getting 8 scrubbies in one set seems a bit overkill, but it&#x27;s not like they spoil before a &amp;#34;best by&amp;#34; date. The good news is you can give away extras to friends.&lt;br /&gt;They do tighten up and shrink once wet. I don&#x27;t have big hands so even when smaller they are still loose on me. A snug mitten fit seems ideal to me, because you want the scrubbie to stay on you while exfoliating. You can stretch most of the size back by pulling lengthwise on the mitt.</li>
    <li> The quality is nice and great for exfiliating the body.  The only problem is, it is very small and when wet it turns even smaller.  If you are looking into purchasing these, buy the largest size available because they will shrink.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin. It&#x27;s not so rough it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells. It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use soap with this product however my wife uses it in the traditional way, which is without soap, after which she applies moisturizing lotion.  She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  I tried it and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body is when you&#x27;re done.  I like to use it with soap because I&#x27;m just used my Zest smell, plus I don&#x27;t get the unsightly noodles.  She says I don&#x27;t do it that way I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  Fair enough, honey :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
    <li> My mother is Korean and she used to attack me with these when I was younger -- but I had the greatest skin ever! :) I will continuously buy these forevermore, they get the dead skin off and I always feel soft, clean, and renewed.</li>
    <li> shrunk after a few uses to a size too small to actually use.</li>
    <li> The price for value doesn&#x27;t seem to be here.  I think you could indeed buy these at any Asian market for much less.  And they are about an inch smaller on each side than they should be.  That said, they DO do a nice job of exfoliating, and unlike a sponge or pouf, dry completely between uses, which is more hygienic.</li>
    <li> These actually work very well, and I recommend them. I gave 4 stars (not 5) because I was disappointed that they&#x27;re not as good as the almost identical ones that I bought from a Korean spa. Specifically, these are as textured and they wear easier.</li>
    <li> Nice value, but a bit on the thin side. Not as abrasive as i would&#x27;ve wanted it. Used to the scrubs from the Motherland, but didnt want to drive all the way over to K-Town to get it. This will do for light biweekly scrubbing. Good for face too. As a guy, need a little more scrub power</li>
    <li> Very nice exfoliating cloth.  You don&#x27;t need much pressure to exfoliate with it.  It shrinks when wet, so it doesn&#x27;t slip off the normal sized woman&#x27;s hand when exfoliating.  It&#x27;s kind of like exfoliating with very fine-grained exfoliating cream, but much faster (the cloth just takes off the dead skin cells much faster - no need for too much scrubbing).</li>
    <li> Great texture.  Way too small.  It balls up into an annoying ineffectual clod.  Even when used like a mitt.  I&#x27;m constantly trying to reconfigure it into a usefull shape.  It&#x27;s cheaper than others I&#x27;ve had and perhaps equally less effectual.  I can replace this often with the quantity, but I find myself pining for the micro version I had paid 35 bucks for once upon a time.  These coming in 2 colors, my hubby can have one as well.</li>
    <li> I was looking at some more expensive exfoliating cloths (close to $45 for one) when another reviewer mentioned these. I took a chance because they were so inexpensive and I was pleasantly surprised. They really do work. You need to soak or shower in fairly warm water for 15 or so minutes before using them, but they really do get rid of dead skin. Use firm pressure and rub in one direction on your skin for the best results.  The mitts are pretty small, but they do the job.</li>
    <li> I will make these mitten a normal purchase I love them .  I placed one in the shower, one in the tub, one on the sink and gave one to my mom and sister and they loved them also.</li>
    <li> too small to fit a small adult hand in.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my exfoliator scrubs. They really make you feel clean and I can see the dead skin falling of. They are a little small though.</li>
    <li> I bought the exfoliating mittens about a month and a half ago after reading a few reviews, and I am hooked! They do shrink when they get wet, but I expected that from what others said so I was not disappointed when it happened. These things WORK! I soaked in a tub of warm water (just water -- that is VERY important) after showering and began using the towels to scrub. My skin started rolling off in little pieces! After I finished I could not believe how soft my skin was. I have been doing this once every week or two and am hooked! I now recommend this to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a cheap alternative to the Baiden Mitt and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. They are small, but more than adequate, and although they do get smaller in hot water, they are never too small to use. I soaked in a hot bath with epsom salts for about 20 minutes, and the gunk definitely rolled off (and I use a scrubby sponge every day in the shower). My skin felt bizarrely soft afterwards. I didn&#x27;t find it painful or irritating at all, although it did leave some red dots (for lack of a better word) near my ankle the first time (which went away in a day or two). I think it was my fault because it was hard to stop once I got going. It took a few minutes for me to find the right combination. You have to make sure your skin isn&#x27;t too wet (or the mitt), and once you start getting the impurities out, it gets easier (it builds up on the mitt and attracts more, it seems). I put lotion on afterwards, but you don&#x27;t really even need it. I have somewhat sensitive, fair skin, with lots of little issues (vitiligo, eczema, dry patches, etc) and it surprisingly didn&#x27;t bother it at all. I have never been able to use self tanner because it doesn&#x27;t go on that evenly, but I think I am going to try it again because my skin seems so much more even and softer now. These little cloths are addictive!</li>
    <li> I like these a lot, very well made and will last for years!!!</li>
    <li> The gloves are too small. Only the top of the hand fits in it. Too bad because they are exactly what I used to buy in corean spas. They are excellent scrubbers. I was happy to found them on Amazon. But they need to be at least double the length.</li>
    <li> Great for regenerating new skin and blood flow to provide a better appearance and feel to skin over time. Usage should be dependent on climate and body changes. Be careful not to scrub to hard or you&#x27;ll create a scrub &amp;#34;burn,&amp;#34; especially if you&#x27;re not use to it. They shrink after use but can be stretched out once they&#x27; wet again. Be sure to clean your cloth after use since it removes dirt, sweat and dead skin (cells). I rinse off quickly with soap, letting my body become completely wet for 10 minutes then I step out of the water, not the tub, or tilt the shower head downward and scrub off dead skin. Some areas may need to be scrubbed more than once and the cloth may need to be rinsed during the scrub if it becomes full of dead skin. You may need another person&#x27;s help for hard to reach areas, such as your back, but again be mindful of how hard or how many times you scrub your skin, and be extra careful of use on your face or other delicate areas of your body. Once you&#x27;re scrubbing is complete, you can re-wash/rinse with soap to get a more refreshed clean.</li>
