      <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
      <li>I really love how this fragrance smells and</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the sweetness of Joop</li>
      <li>It has been my favorite cologne for almost 20 years.</li>
      <li>Personally, I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Nice cologne if you like really sweet smelling fragrance.</li>
      <li>I loved it the first time I smelled it.</li>
      <li>Smells sweet, sexy and people love it, on Men or Women.</li>
      <li>I looove this sweet &amp; spicy scent on my man!</li>
      <li>Joop is smooth and does&#x27;nt have a strong scent thats over powering.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t like this one very much, and I can&#x27;t see myself ever wearing it, specially considering that I have many better colognes.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite scents delivered quickly and in it&#x27;s original box.</li>
      <li>The arrival time was super good, and, not surprisingly, the cologne smells as great as it would have if I&#x27;d paid a bundle more.</li>
      <li>Smells masculine but sweet and pleasant  </li>
      <li>and he told me that is not the original one.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this fragrance, love the smell &amp; it just lasts the whole day and than some.  </li>
      <li>I prefer to be more open minded and trust my own sense of smell.</li>
      <li>Its a bargain at this price and the man that wears this cologne will have a clean smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as sweet as people make it out to be.</li>
      <li>maybe because it´s really sweet.</li>
      <li>He has wore it and only this for years, yes it smells that good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like sweet scents.</li>
      <li>It is worth a try as one of the most reasonably priced &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It is a very pleasant and unique fragrance that is long lasting.</li>
      <li>Putting it on one is wafted in a somewhat sweet, but not at all cloying, peaceful and again.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 27 year old son after reading many reviews.</li>
      <li>Overall a good purchase and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>The name, logo, and color right off could perhaps make some feel otherwise before even taking a sniff.</li>
      <li>Caution, do not use very much...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely different and quite potent (one spray and people will smell you from 2-3 ft away).</li>
      <li>Go it for my husband -- it&#x27;s his favorite cologne (the only one he&#x27;ll wear).</li>
      <li>I first tried this at a PX at Ft.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t work for me, and I most likely wont wear it.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be ording more when this runs out.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the aroma (not to mention the girls that loved it then too) -</li>
      <li>I decided to try the real thing, only to realize the knockoff smelled a lot better.</li>
      <li>I often get comments on the fragrance, positive ones that is.</li>
      <li>A classic!</li>
      <li>Idk really how to describe it&#x27;s scent</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it</li>
      <li>It is actually very &#x27;90&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Me and sweet do not belong in the same sentence.</li>
      <li>Not  bad, but it was a little sweet smelling.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t look for heavy woods, greens or exotic spices here.</li>
      <li>Not a single issue  both product and seller are thre real deal !</li>
      <li>GREAT HEAVY LONG LASTING AROMA.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not very customer friendly to monitor what&#x27;s in the cart and increase prices.</li>
      <li>, it reminds me of bathroom fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;Not a very masculine scent either.</li>
      <li>Not for the faint of heart (at least at first) but mingles with your own essence to mellow into a nice, maculine fragrance.</li>
      <li>The cologne that I recieved appeared at first visually as the \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; thing, but it didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; scent when sprayed on your body.</li>
      <li>Its a timeless classic, and no other scent can compare!</li>
      <li>is a assertive scent in a soft  and powdery way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a rather soft.</li>
      <li>Even though that era is gone, I&#x27;ll still wear this as an &#x27;old man.&#x27;</li>
      <li>Was out the whole day, went to bed &amp; still the smell was present.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a young man&#x27;s fragrance, someone who&#x27;s running around and whatnot.</li>
      <li>The product description emphasizes \\&quot;masculine scent\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>and it drove me wild.</li>
      <li>, this is definitely not for the older crowd.</li>
      <li>Sill during my AIT back in 99 after I had graduated high school.</li>
      <li>it really goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Having had said as much, this is not a classic masculine scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a good buy. Have used this cologne for 25 years and the women love it. It&#x27;s the only cologne I have ever received compliments on and you can&#x27;t get enough of those especially at 66 yrs of age.</li>
    <li> My own fault on this, but I had purchased a knockoff bottle of Joop oil a couple of years ago that smelled soooo good.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try the real thing, only to realize the knockoff smelled a lot better. DOH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, this is definitely not for the older crowd. Picture club hopping, and you&#x27;ll know who this would smell good on.</li>
    <li> got here very fast, and the product is GREAT! smells amazing will definetely order again!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3MCPA68HNMLAU]]This is a video review for the cologne JOOP!</li>
    <li> Son loves&lt;br /&gt; this cologne!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents delivered quickly and in it&#x27;s original box.</li>
    <li> This product smells so great,I appreciate the way it makes me smell</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband. I want to eat my husband when he has it on. Lol</li>
    <li> GREAT HEAVY LONG LASTING AROMA.</li>
    <li> Great price and just the right size for my husband to carry when he is traveling.</li>
    <li> This was one of the first colognes I received as a gift while i was high schooler in the late 90s early 2000s. A guy whom I had a major crush on wore it and it drove me wild. It has a strong musky fragrance and smells amazing. At the time I smoked and it did a great job of covering up the smell but now I like to wear it when going out, or if I know I&#x27;m going to sweat in excess (like at the gym). ! What a blast from the past. Love it. One of the oldies but goodies.</li>
    <li> I bought one in my travel to USA but I didn&#x27;t like it. But it&#x27;s not a problem, I&#x27;ll give someone as a gift.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful just like I remember in the 90&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;I purchased for my teen son he likes it. Smells masculine but sweet and pleasant  could almost be a unisex scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 27 year old son after reading many reviews. He absolutely loves it and I guess so do the girls.....so I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice cologne if you like really sweet smelling fragrance. Only got it cause my wife loves it. It&#x27;s my date-night only cologne...LOL</li>
    <li> I really love how this fragrance smells and also the great sillage it has. I don´t know why many people hate it... maybe because it´s really sweet.</li>
    <li> Whenever my husband wears this, he is always complimented on his smell. I love it, nice musky, manly smell with a touch of sexy. Will buy from seller again. The delivery was prompt and on time.</li>
    <li> Colone for Men. Smells sweet, sexy and people love it, on Men or Women. It lasts all day. You get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Not  bad, but it was a little sweet smelling. Me and sweet do not belong in the same sentence. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was bad , because I lot of guys or gals might dig that, but for me personally? No. it didn&#x27;t work for me, and I most likely wont wear it.</li>
    <li> Excellent. The arrival time was super good, and, not surprisingly, the cologne smells as great as it would have if I&#x27;d paid a bundle more. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I looove this sweet &amp; spicy scent on my man! It makes me weak in the knees! MMmmm! Its a timeless classic, and no other scent can compare! If you have never smelled Joop! Go out and find a bottle just to sniff it, you will see what I mean! Yummy stuff ladies!</li>
    <li> A classic! Go it for my husband -- it&#x27;s his favorite cologne (the only one he&#x27;ll wear). It&#x27;s just like I remember on him.</li>
    <li> Well and but this perfume for some body else that usually use it and he told me that is not the original one.</li>
    <li> VENDEDOR RESPONSABLE, EL ARTICULO ESPERADO EN PERFECTO ESTADO, NUEVO SIN INCONVENIENTES. PRODUCTO QUE RECOMIENDO COMPRAR. TAL COMO LAS ESPERABA. VERY GOOD!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t treated myself to a cologne in a very long time. There are few scents I will wear and out of those I do like, such as Dolce Gabbana, VS Rapture, I chose to buy Joop! its the bomb!</li>
    <li> Not a single issue  both product and seller are thre real deal !</li>
    <li> This is good deal on Joop.</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product description emphasizes \\&quot;masculine scent\\&quot;. The name, logo, and color right off could perhaps make some feel otherwise before even taking a sniff. I prefer to be more open minded and trust my own sense of smell. Having had said as much, this is not a classic masculine scent. It does rather match it&#x27;s marketing presentation. It&#x27;s a rather soft. clean, bright and happy smelling scent. Putting it on one is wafted in a somewhat sweet, but not at all cloying, peaceful and again. happy smelling aroma. It would be a great scent to wear if you were to meet with people you wanted to communicate with in a non-threatening friendly but not over-powering way. This is not to say it is a weak scent at all. It has some potency to it. Joop! is a assertive scent in a soft  and powdery way. While Joop! is not an especially \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent, it&#x27;s certainly not a feminine scent nor does it have the insipid and immature aroma of the typical unisex colognes. It is actually very &#x27;90&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t look for heavy woods, greens or exotic spices here. Just a balanced and pleasant scent, not my favorite nor one that would be for me a signature scent but one that has it&#x27;s very appropriate time and usage.</li>
    <li> The cologne that I recieved appeared at first visually as the \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; thing, but it didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; scent when sprayed on your body. I&#x27;ve owned the \\&quot;REAL\\&quot; Joop! before &amp; people smell it when applied to your body...this didn&#x27;t have that effect. It was also watered down. When I sprayed it on the bottom palm of my hand, it ran off like water. I&#x27;m pissed!!! I would like to get a refund!!!</li>
    <li> It has been my favorite cologne for almost 20 years. It is a very pleasant and unique fragrance that is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I love this smell and it lasts all day! I can even smell it on me in the morning. It&#x27;s not as sweet as people make it out to be. I smell a hint of sweetness to it but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Great, potent cologne. Not for the faint of heart (at least at first) but mingles with your own essence to mellow into a nice, maculine fragrance. It is worth a try as one of the most reasonably priced &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; men&#x27;s colognes. I often get comments on the fragrance, positive ones that is. One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> My boy friend and I both LOVE this colonge! He has wore it and only this for years, yes it smells that good. Way cheaper than trying to buy some where else, so were both very happy with this purchase. Will definitely be ording more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my collection after hearing some buzz about this cologne. Idk really how to describe it&#x27;s scent but it&#x27;s like they mixed a fragrance for a very young man (16-18yo) with a fragrance for a 30-35 yo man.  It&#x27;s definitely different and quite potent (one spray and people will smell you from 2-3 ft away). The bottle I received has some staying power and the scent will be with you all day. I&#x27;ve had a lot of people say it&#x27;s a very good scent on me. Overall a good purchase and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this fragrance, love the smell &amp; it just lasts the whole day and than some.  I do believe it is a fragrance that you  either love or hate...my wife does not enjoy it.  There was an earlier poster who wrote about it not lasting very long, perhaps they received an old/ tainted bottle, my Joop! does last a very long time.  Was out the whole day, went to bed &amp; still the smell was present.  Caution, do not use very much...it really goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> This cologne is not for GUYS ! Do not buy it if you do not want to smell like a cotton candy....&lt;br /&gt;Buy another cologne !</li>
    <li> Joop is smooth and does&#x27;nt have a strong scent thats over powering. I love to smell this scent. Its a bargain at this price and the man that wears this cologne will have a clean smell.</li>
    <li> Apparently this is the type of fragrance that you either love or hate. Personally, I love this fragrance. Joop is a prime example of a scent that reminds me of days long gone by. I first tried this at a PX at Ft. Sill during my AIT back in 99 after I had graduated high school. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the aroma (not to mention the girls that loved it then too) - I love the sweetness of Joop and it&#x27;s incredible longevity. I loved it the first time I smelled it. It&#x27;s a young man&#x27;s fragrance, someone who&#x27;s running around and whatnot. Even though that era is gone, I&#x27;ll still wear this as an &#x27;old man.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I smelled this scent over a year ago and after finding that the price had gone down I purchased it. I have gotten several compliments and now it is my &#x27;go to&#x27; scent. Mmmm.</li>
    <li> It was A GIFT FOR MY FATHER, SMELL WELL</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. Has great longevity. But I don&#x27;t like the smell, it reminds me of bathroom fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;Not a very masculine scent either. Just really sweet in a bad way. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like sweet scents. In fact La Male is one of my all time faves. I just don&#x27;t like this one very much, and I can&#x27;t see myself ever wearing it, specially considering that I have many better colognes.</li>
    <li> i love this cologne i would recomended but some people dont like the smell i do love the smell is so citrus</li>
    <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female, but the scent of the male Joop was just so intoxicating I never cared to smell the female version. Also, it seems like the only scent I can wear at work that doesn&#x27;t offend the other men that work there.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that they increased the price of this item twice in just a few hours while it was in my cart. It&#x27;s not very customer friendly to monitor what&#x27;s in the cart and increase prices.</li>
    <li> i sprayed a little on my hand then washed my hands with soap and water and hand sanitizer and i could still smell it don&#x27;t use alot and you will love it.</li>
