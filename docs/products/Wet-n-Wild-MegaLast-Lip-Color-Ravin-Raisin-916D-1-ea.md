      <li>I love dark lipsticks, and this one was beautiful.</li>
      <li>Had a lot of fun with it on Halloween!</li>
      <li>This color is more on the blue side of purple than the deeper purple/plum, but its still a lovely color!</li>
      <li>One of my favorites and last long too great for every skin color might not be good for</li>
      <li>Great quality lipstick, although it is darker in colour than expected.</li>
      <li>Love the color, fast shipping</li>
      <li>Bold color.</li>
      <li>You could get it much cheaper from a local drugstore but nonetheless very nice color.</li>
      <li>its a very pretty color.</li>
      <li>The shade didn&#x27;t compliment me as much as I liked (in dark-skin, African American, if you&#x27;re wondering), but good service and</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite brand</li>
      <li>I tried a new lip color and I love it..</li>
      <li>Dark, matte beautiful exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get my first plum lipstick</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased with how long it lasted throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Such a bold and sexy color with a creamy finish.</li>
      <li>As a lip stain....it actually comes across as more of a bright berry pink color.</li>
      <li>Wet N Wild makes a great lipstick for an affordable price.</li>
      <li>Overall i loved the color, great for those wanting to experiment with more colors other than red and pink.</li>
      <li>but it goes great with my dark tone!!!</li>
      <li>What I love about this color is: it can be both light and subtle for day, but as you apply more, the raisin color really pops out and gives your lips a fuller look.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented!</li>
      <li>More of a deep burgundy.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Not too creamy, but somewhat more long</li>
      <li>The item came a day earlier, not bad!</li>
      <li>Most of the good colors are discontinued at the stores sadly!</li>
      <li>Not bad we definitely need a lip balm.</li>
      <li>Love the creamy texture and  price of Wet N Wild lipsticks.</li>
      <li>As with most long-wearing formulas, it can be a little drying</li>
      <li>I get compliments on this particular color frequently.</li>
      <li>Goes on super creamy and it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out at all for a matte lipstick.</li>
      <li>Not TOO dark but not so light that you feel like you&#x27;re wearing a balm chapstick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s darker than sugar plum fairy 908c, and not as much of a daily look for me, but it is a pretty plum color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of dry and exaggerates the little cracks and lines in my lips.</li>
      <li>This Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild, Ravin Raisin lipstick has made my everyday outings a little more sophisticated.</li>
      <li>Wild is timeless and affordable.</li>
      <li>they are really good quality and you would think the would be expensive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a matte, purply-raisin color that doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips and lasts pretty well through a meal and some drinks (even when I skip the lipliner).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> really liked it. its a very pretty color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of dry and exaggerates the little cracks and lines in my lips. It works better to pat it on like a stain. As a lip stain....it actually comes across as more of a bright berry pink color. However, swiping it on as a lipstick - this color is very dark. I was looking for a deep plum color but this is just too dark for my pale skin.</li>
    <li> Such a bold and sexy color with a creamy finish. All of Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild lipsticks  are super affordable and can be a great alternative to mac cosmetics.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this lipstick. Beautiful color!!!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this color.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ITTT!!!! it looks so beautiful on my tanned complexion and it&#x27;s so heavily pixated that even if you eat it won&#x27;t smudge off much when  you lick your lips.  the plum color is peerrrfect  for the winter season i feel like buying another one for next year</li>
    <li> The item came a day earlier, not bad! I was so excited to get my first plum lipstick and it is the perfect plum color. It feels silky on the lips and does not stop moisturizing. It does indeed last 4 hours and a little more, it only fades slightly after the 4 hours. I would buy it again :)</li>
    <li> this lipstick was amaaazing,its great for all skin tones !!</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the color.</li>
    <li> Love the color, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This color is a dark purple not too dark but it&#x27;s definetley a raisin color. I love it, I&#x27;m glad to have it added to my fall collection. It doesn&#x27;t beat Sugar Plum Fairy but it&#x27;s up there.</li>
    <li> Love this color ! So glad I made this purchase. first time trying a Wet n Wild product and I was very pleased with how long it lasted throughout the day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great lipstick. It&#x27;s just like any other matte lipstick and can be a little drying , but that&#x27;s nothing a little lip balm can&#x27;t fix. I love it and its true to its color.</li>
    <li> I tried a new lip color and I love it..the matte texture last a long time.</li>
    <li> Not at all how it looks on the picture. I&#x27;m probably never gonna use it.</li>
    <li> Great product and good shipping,AAAAA+++++</li>
    <li> As lipstick (and cosmetic) brands go, Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild is timeless and affordable. I get compliments on this particular color frequently. It&#x27;s a matte, purply-raisin color that doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips and lasts pretty well through a meal and some drinks (even when I skip the lipliner). It&#x27;s a pretty vampy color, but with the right outfit and subtle eye makeup, it can be worn even during the day.</li>
    <li> sorry terribly disappointed. The colour was not even close to the colour shown.....</li>
    <li> Great quality lipstick, although it is darker in colour than expected. Nice purple colour when a lighter amount is worn. Smooth and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is great it just stains easily but it stays on your lips for a very long time. The color is beautiful and it was sent to me before my estimate date.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I bought this to cover up my cold sores and it does the job. Not only that but it gave me Kendel Jener lips on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: this product makes random unknown males approach you and ask for something called a &amp;#34;blow job&amp;#34; I do not work at blow company so I can not give jobs out sorry.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect shade , great quality . Glad I bought it! If your double thinking , don&#x27;t! Definitely buy</li>
    <li> Cute, it was my go to lipstick! 😍</li>
    <li> Wife likes how easy it goes on</li>
    <li> I have the entire wet n wild collection and I absolutely love everyone. The colors are a matte finish and it is beautiful. They last for a decent amount of time. I will be doing a lipstick review and swatches on these products on Youtube @bsbeautymix if you want to see the swatches.</li>
    <li> It is a little brighter than the picture.... but it goes great with my dark tone!!! And it lasts for a very long time...</li>
    <li> I tossed this in the trash not that it was a bad product thats why i gave it a 5 star its color was perfect i just wasnt perfect on me so if you like raisin then this is a great choice nice lipstick.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fall and goes with anything and anyone!!! :)</li>
    <li> too messy when applying</li>
    <li> The color i expected was not the color it looks like on my lips. It is still a very good lipstick but i just wasn&#x27;t to happy with the color.</li>
    <li> For the life of me, I would like 2 know why is this lipstick called wet &amp; wild, it goes on dry and lifeless, dull, there is no wetness 2 it, unless you use some type of lubricant before or after application. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because of the longevity of it, other than that, boring.</li>
    <li> Love this color applies very smoothly and it does have the raison color to it :)</li>
    <li> it stay for days and days in my lips</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! The shade didn&#x27;t compliment me as much as I liked (in dark-skin, African American, if you&#x27;re wondering), but good service and Wet N Wild makes a great lipstick for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all women. I&#x27;ve never been a person who wore lipstick; until recently. This Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild, Ravin Raisin lipstick has made my everyday outings a little more sophisticated. What I love about this color is: it can be both light and subtle for day, but as you apply more, the raisin color really pops out and gives your lips a fuller look. Because this is a matte lipstick; after putting it on I like to pair it with a simple lip gloss, it makes the color brighter and your lips softer.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS COLOR WILL PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> It has the same texture with my other wet n wild lipsticks. Not too creamy, but somewhat more long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s darker than sugar plum fairy 908c, and not as much of a daily look for me, but it is a pretty plum color.</li>
    <li> Bold color. Pretty dark too! I was expecting something a bit more subtle. Putting on a light amount works for me. Overall, great for the price. Had a lot of fun with it on Halloween! Looks good with my tan skin. Maybe I&#x27;ll try something a little less out there next time!</li>
    <li> Dark, matte beautiful exactly what I wanted. Have to order one more.</li>
    <li> Most of the good colors are discontinued at the stores sadly! But i swear by wet n wild megalast lipsticks! they are really good quality and you would think the would be expensive. yes the can be drying but i do prefer dryer lipstick VS wet ones if that makes any sense. This color is like a Bluish purple! Looks awesome on my medium skin tone! I receive a lot of compliments. Everyone asks me if it is MAC.</li>
    <li> Lovery the shade!! It came just in time for my fall winter collection</li>
    <li> Absolutely love love love this color. These stay on for a long time. Will be getting the rest of this collection.</li>
    <li> This color is ok, but its better on lighter skin complexions. Good for now though :)</li>
    <li> Never thought I would like a lip color like this but it&#x27;s beautiful. Goes on super creamy and it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out at all for a matte lipstick. I love it.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE WITH THIS LIPSTICK. its the first time I come out of my comfort zone and buy a bold lip color but its the perfect shade of purple. Not TOO dark but not so light that you feel like you&#x27;re wearing a balm chapstick. Just perfect &amp; moisturizing. I uploaded some pictures, hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Another lipstick that is one of my favorites I can wear it as is or mix it. It&#x27;s Gorguse either way!</li>
    <li> This brand is one of the few brands that doesn&#x27;t contain mercury.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful lipstick, it&#x27;s creamy and richly pigmented. As with most long-wearing formulas, it can be a little drying so it helps to put on a little balm before applying.</li>
    <li> Overall i loved the color, great for those wanting to experiment with more colors other than red and pink. Most reviewers say it is a moist product however it seems to dry out my lips quite quickly, but still lasts long !!</li>
    <li> This color is more on the blue side of purple than the deeper purple/plum, but its still a lovely color! Love the creamy texture and  price of Wet N Wild lipsticks.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites and last long too great for every skin color might not be good for autumn skin shades may wash h out but it&#x27;s a amazing Color</li>
    <li> It was melting kind of may have been temperature of drivers truck but didn&#x27;t last long ;(</li>
    <li> I love dark lipsticks, and this one was beautiful. One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Certain Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild shades such as the one I purchased do not exist locally. I did not even know this shade existed and I am glad I found it. I bought the Ravin&#x27; Raisin shade and I love this lipstick! it is the best matte deep purple in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Not bad we definitely need a lip balm.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented! You could get it much cheaper from a local drugstore but nonetheless very nice color.</li>
    <li> looks great on me ::)</li>
    <li> Not a very deep dark color at all. More of a plum color. Not what I was looking for. Unfortunately wasn&#x27;t very pleased.</li>
    <li> Kinda dry and the color is not as purple as it looks in  the picture. More of a deep burgundy.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite brand n im in love with the color ... great quality, matte with tint moisture .. Awesome wear</li>
