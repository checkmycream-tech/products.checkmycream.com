      <li>Too fly away and flat looking.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff so much!</li>
      <li>Plus, I love the smell of this product ;-)</li>
      <li>People think im full of it when i tell them i have had my hair bleached two times in two months.</li>
      <li>Thanks to this, my hair has maintained most of its integrity during this process.</li>
      <li>This product is the best that I have found so far for smoothing and softening dry frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and the product helps to define the curls and makes it feel healthy and non-frizzy when I straighten.  </li>
      <li>I started using this right after I got out of the shower and</li>
      <li>rxcellent results my skin looks vibrant and smooth</li>
      <li>This has made my hair smooth, and healthier in just two uses!&lt;br /&gt;It smells different, a good different.</li>
      <li>It has a lotion consistency which worried me a bit the first time I applied it</li>
      <li>Softens and detangles my hair pretty well.</li>
      <li>This product is my favorite leave in conditioner - silky finish, non oily, won&#x27;t flatten hair but instead keeps my hair healthier especially at 55 years of age</li>
      <li>so i don&#x27;t exactly use it</li>
      <li>I really recommend!</li>
      <li>I have medium length and very fine, dry, hair.</li>
      <li>After years of dying it continuously, I pretty much have fried my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love how I can air dry without styling it</li>
      <li>I tried this product as a sample and decided to buy both the shampoo and conditioner in a large bottle.  </li>
      <li>Very good product for thick coarse hair.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser suggested this and it really adds strength to my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I notice many other reviews here for the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Wife really likes this stuff, makes her hair soft after shampooing.</li>
      <li>This system has not kept my hair from shedding or grown new hair (and that&#x27;s not what this product advertises)</li>
      <li>It does not weigh my fine hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
      <li>I am only 19, and I eat lots of fruits and veggies, but my hair is still fine and dry.</li>
      <li>Works on heavy hair or light hair.  </li>
      <li>but it was completely sold out</li>
      <li>This product has taken my hair into the next century and given me a very tamed look without any effort.  </li>
      <li>I have natural 3c/4a hair</li>
      <li>, it makes my hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>Went back to my older product</li>
      <li>My hair is not dry anymore.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been dying and bleaching my hair at least once a month for the past 4 years and this product makes it feel just like new again :)</li>

<li> I have tried so many hair products that left my hair sticky, greasy and dirty.</li>

<li> This is one of the few products that actually makes my hair feel fuller and gets rid of humidity-related frizz at the same time.</li>
<li> I bought a full size even though I thought it was expensive.</li>
<li> A little big goes a long way.  </li>
<li> The only thing i notice with this is it make my hair feel slightly thicker</li>
<li> My hair is naturally 1980&#x27;s esque with a lot of volume, big waves, and very thick.  </li>
<li> It is worth it for my sad state of hair.</li>
<li> Only used it a few times, but so far it&#x27;s manageable for thick, curly hair without weighing it down, drying it out, or adding frizz</li>
<li> I feel it protects my hair from blow-dryer &amp; other styling.</li>
<li> In the thinned out areas due to breakage I have some growth.</li>
<li> I have very thin, fine hair that has been falling out lately at an exponential rate.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product, just need to find best product for my hair.</li>
    <li> ...then you just found a great product, specially for fine hair like mine! It smells awesome and my hair feels a lot better, stronger and it looks healthier. I only used it 3 times and i already feel a difference. It doesn´t give the hair a heavy feeling, like a lot of other leave in products. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been ill and hair is thin and prone to breakage. I have used this for a year. Not a miracle but it helps in those thinning areas by keeping them stronger. In the thinned out areas due to breakage I have some growth.</li>
    <li> Works great for those frizzy days!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair is naturally 1980&#x27;s esque with a lot of volume, big waves, and very thick.  After years of dying it continuously, I pretty much have fried my hair.  This product has taken my hair into the next century and given me a very tamed look without any effort.  It does not make it oily and it leaves it very smooth.  I love how I can air dry without styling it and I no longer have a big poofy mane around my face anymore!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  IT&#x27;s great for my hair, and it smells SO GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> I have used matrix products for years! But this one I truly love!  It helps to restore my aging hair giving it healthy shine and more control as I have curly hair! And as a bonus it has a wonderful fragrance! ! I really recommend!</li>
    <li> I tried a sample before buying. It seems to help my very fine flyaway hair. This year my hair has been full of static. This product seems to help thicken my hair without making it greasy. I am happy and highly recommend. A little big goes a long way.  This review is for the Fiberstrong cream, not the shampoo or conditioner.  I notice many other reviews here for the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair and I use this as a cream in the &amp;#34;LOC method&amp;#34;. I love it because it moisturizes and makes my hair stronger. It also helps with frizz and shine! Definitely worth the money because it helps keep your hair healthy and get healthier</li>
    <li> My wife uses this once a week as indicated by her stylist. It keeps her color looking good, strengthens the hair, and keeps it from drying out.</li>
    <li> Good leave in product from Biolage. I am a faithful customer of biolage. I would not be without them. Not too good on chemically damaged hair, but still and excellent product.</li>
    <li> Maravilloso te protege y rellenna la hebra</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that actually makes my hair feel fuller and gets rid of humidity-related frizz at the same time., great styling tool, and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Great product makes my hair feel thicker and healthy. Love it. I&#x27;ll purchase it again!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel great and so healthy!  I have naturally curly hair and the product helps to define the curls and makes it feel healthy and non-frizzy when I straighten.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I am slowly highlighting my hair from a level 1 to a level 6.  The fiberstrong line is my holy grail as of now, along with pm skinny serum to lock in moisture. People think im full of it when i tell them i have had my hair bleached two times in two months. Thanks to this, my hair has maintained most of its integrity during this process.</li>
    <li> Best leave-in conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the way it reacts on your hair.  Too fly away and flat looking.  Went back to my older product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am happy with this product. My hair is not dry anymore.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and healthy.  I quit using my heat protector when I started using this as it seemed to help for that also.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a month. I can already tell a difference in my hairs texture. Loving it!</li>
    <li> This product is seriously amazing. I bought it because I noticed that when I would brush my hair, quite a few strands of hair would fall out. I am only 19, and I eat lots of fruits and veggies, but my hair is still fine and dry. I started using this right after I got out of the shower and this stuff is a miracle product. My hair feels thicker and fuller, and it is so easy to brush through. I no longer have pieces of hair falling out when I brush my hair. I will definitely buy this again....but not anytime soon as this stuff lasts FOREVER. Thank you so much, Biolage!!!</li>
    <li> Anti-Frizz and not greasy feeling.  Works on heavy hair or light hair.  Rinses out easily.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so much! Does wonders for my hair, also great price and shows up earlier than eta. Can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Softens and detangles my hair pretty well. I like this because it is a pump and i am tired of using spray detanglers that go everywhere but my hair.</li>
    <li> Noticed a slight difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Did not like the product, but good seller. This makes my hair feel like straw. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser gave me a sample pack. Tried it out and I was pleased. I have very fine hair that tends to fly away.  This product keeps tamest hair without weighing it down.  Also it makes my hair smell great.</li>
    <li> Wife really likes this stuff, makes her hair soft after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Only used it a few times, but so far it&#x27;s manageable for thick, curly hair without weighing it down, drying it out, or adding frizz</li>
    <li> This has made my hair smooth, and healthier in just two uses!&lt;br /&gt;It smells different, a good different. I love it.</li>
    <li> rxcellent results my skin looks vibrant and smooth</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite leave in conditioner - silky finish, non oily, won&#x27;t flatten hair but instead keeps my hair healthier especially at 55 years of age</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do it for me. I see no difference when using this product. I have fine, somehow frizzy hair so I was hoping it would help, but no, it didn&#x27;t. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell though</li>
    <li> The only thing i notice with this is it make my hair feel slightly thicker</li>
    <li> This product is the best that I have found so far for smoothing and softening dry frizzy hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling sticky or crunchy.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and it worked!  I bought a full size even though I thought it was expensive. It is worth it for my sad state of hair. Love this product. I have medium length and very fine, dry, hair. I find it easiy to use after towel drying and feel I get a better absorption. It has a pleasant scent but won&#x27;t over power any perfume you might wear.  It does not weigh my fine hair down or make it look greasy. I Like the pump as the product stays sanitary. The pump also allows you to use any amount you want. Great product. I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived with a layer of sealed plastic in case of leakage. Will order again.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my hair one time and I loved it but it was completely sold out so when I finally found it when I went back I bought it only to have the security agent at the airport confiscate it so I immediately bought it online. I have naturally curly hair so I use this as my styling product when my hair is dry just to give it some added definition to my curls. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen great improvements in my overprocessed hair. Plus, it helps keep my perm from looking at all frizzy. Recommended product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It has a lotion consistency which worried me a bit the first time I applied it BUT it did not end up making my hair greasy (or too crunchy). If applied sparingly and evenly, it coats your hair with something that appears to make it seem a bit thicker. I feel it protects my hair from blow-dryer &amp; other styling. I use the Fiberstrong shampoo, conditioner and this fortifying cream. The whole system is wonderful. I have very thin, fine hair that has been falling out lately at an exponential rate. This system has not kept my hair from shedding or grown new hair (and that&#x27;s not what this product advertises) but I could tell a difference in my hair&#x27;s strength after just a few washes. My hair seems healthier and less brittle. Plus, I love the smell of this product ;-) I think of the 3-product system, I like the fortifying cream best. I think the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; is in this last step.</li>
    <li> i love this product. just one bottle has lasted me over 11 months with regular use, and i have waist length hair that is very thick and damaged so i don&#x27;t exactly use it lightly.&lt;br /&gt;i use it every time i shower, it makes my hair feel so soft and silky. i&#x27;ve been dying and bleaching my hair at least once a month for the past 4 years and this product makes it feel just like new again :)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this and it really adds strength to my hair. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Improves hair texture and adds moisture.</li>
    <li> I have to say this product has helped my hair not too weight it down. thats important I have thin hair and this makes my hair so soft&lt;br /&gt;and manageable. A little goes along way.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many hair products that left my hair sticky, greasy and dirty. My hair is damaged from bleach and using this product during styling is a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as a sample and decided to buy both the shampoo and conditioner in a large bottle.  It feels great on my hair and also the seller was out of stock when ordered but sent the product as soon as they recieved it.  Very good product for thick coarse hair.</li>
