    <li> I used to have this pallet a while ago, then i gave it to my mom. She loved it a lot, so we had to order another one for her! Very good quality, nice everyday colors!</li>
    <li> I hate that they discontinued this eye shadow in stores. I love that I can still find it on amazon. It&#x27;s not shimmery like most eye shadows I find. It stays on all day and I love the color with my green eyes.</li>
    <li> These colors make the best bronze smokey eye. I would put those colors up against any high end palette. Very pigmented!!</li>
    <li> This might be out of trend in colors but I like it!  I have enough now to last me for probably the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> So I got this in NYC sometime before I moved to TX. Never really used it much till recently.. Someone, I forget who, told me how u can just wet the dry eye shadow to give it a wet look. Works WONDERFULLY and easy to apply. I own diff color set..back grey dark blue silver. I usually just use the black. Wetting the brush before applying really does the trick and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Recently some teenage girls at the pool told me about elf eye product. Checked out the reviews on it but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t stay on! U would need to reapply an hour later. That sucks. With this that doesn&#x27;t happen. I almost never need to reapply my makeup, let alone this eye shadow!!! Awesome!</li>
    <li> Had for a long time.... Looks small but had for almost a year. I wear it allot too, still can&#x27;t see the bottom of the eyeshadow. Werk</li>
