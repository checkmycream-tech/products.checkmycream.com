      <li>great!  </li>
      <li>My daughter and I are very fair skinned.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen for a great price.</li>
      <li>GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
      <li>I had been searching for a sunblock with a good score on EWG&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>The effect is good, not greasy.</li>
      <li>This is a really good product for a good price.</li>
      <li>Received in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Very beautiful, very like</li>
      <li>Good rating by EWG, which is really important to me.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s also more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and safe for the kids.</li>
      <li>it is fine if you are ok with chemical sunscreen</li>
      <li>it is easy to apply to skin.</li>
      <li>This is excellent, easy to apply - not too heavy or greasy, and stays on even after swimming.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock goes on smoothly, it does not sting my sons&#x27; eyes, and it lasts well in the water.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find this sunblock because it had an EWG score of only 2 (much better than most)</li>
      <li>It is by far my favorite sunblock!</li>
      <li>On top of that, it&#x27;s broad spectrum, and contains no dyes or perfumes.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the ones with the best scores were extremely expensive and did not always have the best reviews for protection and waterproofness.</li>
      <li>Her first couple summers</li>
      <li>Works very well on all of us, even my fair-skinned kids.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very diligent about re-applying either, and</li>
      <li>Works very well as advertised.</li>
      <li>The production date is  Feb. 2014, so it only can be used for no more than one year, which is not so good.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle, it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t burn around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Anything with zinc oxide is white when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>My bottles don&#x27;t say Pure &amp; Simple like the picture shows.</li>
      <li>We use this daily on my daughter, who is very fair-skinned.</li>
      <li>is the same product as the Water Babies Pure &amp; Simple, they also market it under another name for adults, but it&#x27;s all the same thing.  </li>
      <li>We were out in the sea and under a tropical sun for 2 hours around midday, the hottest time of the day, and my baby (only 8 months&#x27; old) did not even get a tanline.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this product that makes it different from other sunscreen products, but what I do know is that myself, my wife, and my three children all had cracked and bleeding skin in the neck, wrists, ankles, and knees from this product while on vacation.  </li>
<li> It runs when wet.</li>
<li> It goes on everybody in the household, and has never let us down.</li>
<li> There is no special flavour.</li>
<li> My husband, who gets a rash from almost all sunscreens, can use this without trouble.  </li>
<li> This is one of the few drug store/affordable brands recommended by Environmental Working Group&#x27;s sunscreen guide.</li>
<li> This one is one of the few on the EWG list that you can buy for under $10.</li>
<li> Makes the kids into little ghosts, but at least they don&#x27;t get sunburned when swimming all summer.</li>
<li> I had a hard time finding something that didn&#x27;t cause a rash.  </li>
<li> Lots of zinc oxide may be annoying for application, but this stuff works like a charm without more dangerous chemicals.</li>
<li> I would rather deal with thick sunscreen than burning eyes and rashes on my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I hate spray sunscreen and this really dose the trick.</li>
<li> It is also VERY thick and hard to rub in, but that&#x27;s because of the zinc oxide which is replacing chemicals...</li>
<li> Zinc ocide is sticky thick and impossible to rub in.</li>

    <li> i donot like the tax to china .</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are very fair skinned. Her first couple summers I had a hard time finding something that didn&#x27;t cause a rash.  This product was our answer.  It is very gentle, it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t burn around my eyes.  It is also VERY thick and hard to rub in, but that&#x27;s because of the zinc oxide which is replacing chemicals...zinc oxide is a physical barrier! I would rather deal with thick sunscreen than burning eyes and rashes on my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same product as the Water Babies Pure &amp; Simple, they also market it under another name for adults, but it&#x27;s all the same thing.  My bottles don&#x27;t say Pure &amp; Simple like the picture shows.</li>
    <li> Lots of zinc oxide may be annoying for application, but this stuff works like a charm without more dangerous chemicals.</li>
    <li> Received in good condition.  IGGCastle. TUTU</li>
    <li> The effect is good, not greasy.</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
    <li> This is one of the few drug store/affordable brands recommended by Environmental Working Group&#x27;s sunscreen guide.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised, does the job.  This one is one of the few on the EWG list that you can buy for under $10.</li>
    <li> Makes the kids into little ghosts, but at least they don&#x27;t get sunburned when swimming all summer.</li>
    <li> it is easy to apply to skin. There is no special flavour.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my friend’s boy.This guy likes sports, especially like swimming.He likes this sunscreen, and already in use.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for a great price. Works very well on all of us, even my fair-skinned kids. Good rating by EWG, which is really important to me.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a sunblock with a good score on EWG&#x27;s website. Unfortunately, the ones with the best scores were extremely expensive and did not always have the best reviews for protection and waterproofness. I was very excited to find this sunblock because it had an EWG score of only 2 (much better than most) and it was in my price range. This sunblock goes on smoothly, it does not sting my sons&#x27; eyes, and it lasts well in the water. It is by far my favorite sunblock!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this product that makes it different from other sunscreen products, but what I do know is that myself, my wife, and my three children all had cracked and bleeding skin in the neck, wrists, ankles, and knees from this product while on vacation.  What on earth did they put into this product?</li>
    <li> not what is advertised. wanted physical not chemical. this is chemical. returned it.&lt;br /&gt;sure it is fine if you are ok with chemical sunscreen</li>
    <li> Works very well as advertised. My only complaint is that you have to really rub it in; otherwise you have a white coating on your skin.</li>
    <li> great!  does the job!</li>
    <li> Anything with zinc oxide is white when you first put it on. But it&#x27;s also more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and safe for the kids. We use this daily on my daughter, who is very fair-skinned. It seems to be working well. She hasn&#x27;t ever burned in the sun while wearing it.</li>
    <li> Zinc ocide is sticky thick and impossible to rub in. It runs when wet. You can&#x27;t apply it if your kids are in the pool all day, which is pretty pointless. And it leaves a white residue. But it has that coppertone smell. I guess that deserves 1 star. Won&#x27;t get again.</li>
    <li> The Zinc ocide is what makes this lotion so valuable.  Getting laser hair removal you must keep treated areas protected.  The pros recommend products with either zinc or titanium in them.  This is a really good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> The production date is  Feb. 2014, so it only can be used for no more than one year, which is not so good.</li>
    <li> I just wish I could still find the SPF 70.  I hate spray sunscreen and this really dose the trick.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is a staple at our house.  The price is much better then most of the equivalent sunscreens, and it contains none of the nasty compounds that shouldn&#x27;t be in sunscreen.  On top of that, it&#x27;s broad spectrum, and contains no dyes or perfumes.  My husband, who gets a rash from almost all sunscreens, can use this without trouble.  It goes on everybody in the household, and has never let us down.</li>
    <li> I bought the Babyganics sunblock which was like spreading tar on my baby, so in desperation I forked out for this as we were going on holiday.  This is excellent, easy to apply - not too heavy or greasy, and stays on even after swimming.  We were out in the sea and under a tropical sun for 2 hours around midday, the hottest time of the day, and my baby (only 8 months&#x27; old) did not even get a tanline.  I wasn&#x27;t very diligent about re-applying either, and yet he still stayed pearly white.</li>
