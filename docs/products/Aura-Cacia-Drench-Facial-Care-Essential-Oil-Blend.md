      <li>This is really great for my headaches and it works when blended properly.</li>
      <li>This is a good, strong quality essential oil.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand of peppermint oil and it is so much cheaper here than at the store.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s definitely different, but still good.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to use VERY sparingly as it is pretty strong.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for curing headaches but rubbing in temples, freshening breath, and helping allergies when combined with other oils.</li>
      <li>It was worth the money in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It always adds a fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my rooms smell so fresh</li>
      <li>I have bought other oils from this company and loved them.</li>
      <li>It has kind of a strange smell to it.</li>
      <li>It is fresh and pure.  </li>
      <li>I have also found it to be a great stress reliever after a run or hard day at work.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a problem with an Auara Cacia oil</li>
      <li>Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth.  </li>
      <li>(diluted a bit obviously :-))</li>
      <li>Love using peppermint essential oils.</li>
      <li>The actual oils are fine...</li>
      <li>Well this really smells nice and it has helped my headaches a little bit.</li>
      <li>With the organic peppermint, I smell straight peppermint.</li>
      <li>In my opinion this peppermint does not smell like real peppermint.</li>
      <li>We use this and have found it very helpful.  </li>
      <li>I love Aura Cacia products and I frequently buy them at various health stores.</li>
      <li>But in many recipes, a touch of mint can be the SECRET INGREDIENT :)</li>
      <li>The oil smelled a little different than I was expecting but still a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>But decent.</li>
      <li>You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil.  </li>
      <li>used as a substitute in recipes if I don&#x27;t have fresh mint, such as:  tabbouleh, Lebanese dressing, smoothies, etc.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t open my bottle right away when I got it</li>
      <li>The cap is childproof, which may be good for some people, but it makes it ind of hard to open.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a candy cane-type smell (after all, I was purchasing it to add to sugar scrub to make &#x27;candy cane&#x27; sugar scrub) but the smell is just different from what I expected.</li>
      <li>It definitely smells like peppermint, probably more like the leaves than any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It was my first time purchasing peppermint essential oil, and to me it smells a bit off!</li>
      <li>I added a few drops to a spray bottle filled with distilled water.</li>
      <li>do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>They even have real organic essential oils as well.</li>
      <li>I just found an Aura Cacia peppermint oil in my cabinet that I purchased at a Health Food store... and the smells are very noticeably different.</li>
      <li>and now that I have, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s too late to send it back.</li>
      <li>(my last bottle wasn&#x27;t completely gone yet)</li>
      <li>I think in the future I will stick with young living, though.</li>
      <li>My reluctance to buy this product again is not necessarily due to not liking the oil, but how LONG it took for me to receive it.  </li>

<li> Dont&#x27; buy any other brand if you want real essential oil.  </li>

<li> Nice try... :(</li>
<li> When they arrived, however, they leaked out of their packaging and half of the oils were left to soak through the package.</li>
<li> Unlike my old bottle, which could calm my stomach and headaches, this one smells a little unpleasant.  </li>
<li> ...mixed in combinations with other oils to scent my skin as I quit wearing perfume years ago.  </li>
<li> I suffer from migraines due to sinusitis and use this as a miracle cure to my problems.</li>
<li> I searched for peppermint after finding THREE, yes, THREE roaches in my kitchen from some neighbors who, shall I say, were not very clean.  </li>
<li> Something&#x27;s not right here.  </li>
<li> so I haven&#x27;t used it in much as it leaves a very weird smell when mixed with other oils.</li>
<li> and when I wipe down counters and floors.</li>
<li> To the point where it was extremely nauseating!</li>
<li> Not cool or minty at all.</li>
<li> I immediately noticed that this smell was a little off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does not smell as wonderful as Young Living&#x27;s peppermint oil. I purchased it for the purpose of roach repellent.  It does work for this.</li>
    <li> Ended up throwing this out.  I use this for DIY toothpaste.  Very strange &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; flavor and scent.</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift because I know what peppermint can do in so many ways and this brand is one of the best. I buy this brand and the Now brand.</li>
    <li> Oil is perfect to use for pain application</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of peppermint oil and it is so much cheaper here than at the store.  I will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> This is a good, strong quality essential oil. I&#x27;m using it to ward off roaches. It arrived promptly and intact.</li>
    <li> Never leave home with out it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this peppermint does not smell like real peppermint.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as minty as some peppermint oil that I have got from other companies.  It has kind of a strange smell to it.</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit off so I haven&#x27;t used it in much as it leaves a very weird smell when mixed with other oils.</li>
    <li> I love this peppermint very strong smells wonderful and works great!</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I tried buying other brands of oil and cannot believe the poor quality of other oils.  I have been using Aura Cacia for many years now and I was buying from a local supermarket and cannot find any other products that can&#x27;t even compare to this quality.  Dont&#x27; buy any other brand if you want real essential oil.  They even have real organic essential oils as well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells delicious and is working great in my anti-itch cream and lotions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok..always a good price. Something kinda weird about t the smell to me that I don&#x27;t like compared to other peppermint oils. But decent. I like to use for headaches.</li>
    <li> I have bought other oils from this company and loved them. This has got to be the worst smelling oil I have ever smelled, it smells nothing like peppermint! do not waste your money.The smell makes me sick to my stomach.</li>
    <li> It was my first time purchasing peppermint essential oil, and to me it smells a bit off! I was expecting more of a candy cane-type smell (after all, I was purchasing it to add to sugar scrub to make &#x27;candy cane&#x27; sugar scrub) but the smell is just different from what I expected. it still smells nice and everything, and I still used it for the sugar scrub, it just didn&#x27;t smell as candy cane-y as I thought it would. :)</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful smelling peppermint essential oil. All my clients love the scent and many have asked what it was and where they could buy it.  Every time I use it I am reminded of yummy chocolate covered peppermints.  It is cooling on the skin and can help unclog nasal passages when used around the neck and chest area.  I buy a few bottles of this every year.</li>
    <li> Something&#x27;s not right here.  I ordered a replacement bottle of the same peppermint oil, same brand as the one I just ran out of and it smells completely different.  Unlike my old bottle, which could calm my stomach and headaches, this one smells a little unpleasant.  I don&#x27;t know.  It might still work the same.  Time will tell.  Of all the Aura Cacia oils I&#x27;ve bought on here, this is the only one that&#x27;s disappointed.</li>
    <li> A quality oil great for eliminating headaches when applied to the temples and/or forehead.</li>
    <li> I use this for a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1..added to little cotton muslin sachets and hang them in the closets, under the bed, door knob, etc...and my rooms smell so fresh and it helps keep critters out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2...added to my homemade tooth powder to make it taste better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3...used as a substitute in recipes if I don&#x27;t have fresh mint, such as:  tabbouleh, Lebanese dressing, smoothies, etc.  Just be sure to use VERY sparingly as it is pretty strong.  But in many recipes, a touch of mint can be the SECRET INGREDIENT :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4...mixed in combinations with other oils to scent my skin as I quit wearing perfume years ago.  It always adds a fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5...added to my homemade epsom salt scrub for a refreshing morning shower scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6...used in an aromatherapy diffuser especially with a cold or sinus congestion...it can be added as a combo with other oils for specific therapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are tons more of things, but these are just off the top of my head.  It&#x27;s an essential oil that I always have on hand.</li>
    <li> Love it. I am all about naturopathic remedies, and I am in concussion therapy now with a naturopathic occupational therapist. She told me to get some peppermint oil because it helps relieve headaches and cloudiness in your head. Well this really smells nice and it has helped my headaches a little bit. I also have Aura Cacia Lavender oil and it&#x27;s great for relaxing or massaging into sore spots</li>
    <li> I gave two stars because it arrived timely and intact. But, as others said, it smells rancid. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. I&#x27;m trying Aura Caci out because doterra is breaking the bank. But I guess there is a reason. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item a few times.  It is fresh and pure.  Great for baths as well as a natural bug repellant.</li>
    <li> I love Aura Cacia products and I frequently buy them at various health stores. I&#x27;m a little obsessed with peppermint oil, it is by far my favorite oil and I use it often for migraines. I immediately noticed that this smell was a little off. I just found an Aura Cacia peppermint oil in my cabinet that I purchased at a Health Food store... and the smells are very noticeably different. The product appeared to be sealed. Not sure why this is, but it makes me a little cautious about buying things like this online...</li>
    <li> I luv peppermint.  This is really great for my headaches and it works when blended properly.</li>
    <li> Love using peppermint essential oils. It&#x27;s in almost every recipe I use.</li>
    <li> I added a few drops to a spray bottle filled with distilled water. Instant room freshener.  I use it on linens and when I wipe down counters and floors.</li>
    <li> OK to diffuse, but I like YL better.</li>
    <li> I love the affordability of Aura Cacia essential oils, and they work great for all of my family&#x27;s needs</li>
    <li> Smelled REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. To the point where it was extremely nauseating! It smelled like a rancid, peppermint-y smell; as if it had gone bad (i.e: expired), and Aura Caia decided to sell it anyways hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t notice. Nice try... :( I ended up throwing it away, and I bought myself another peppermint essential oil elsewhere. Sorry Aura Cacia, but your peppermint oil sucks. Very, very terribly.</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love. I searched for peppermint after finding THREE, yes, THREE roaches in my kitchen from some neighbors who, shall I say, were not very clean.  To top it off, the neighbors moved but left their friendly guests to invade my apartment - LOL!!!  Started burning this in my oil burner (electric) every morning for about an hour and in the evening for about an hour in the kitchen.  Haven&#x27;t seen my uninvited guests again!</li>
    <li> The smell did not smell like peppermint to me.  However, another family member said the smell did not bother them.  ?</li>
    <li> My reluctance to buy this product again is not necessarily due to not liking the oil, but how LONG it took for me to receive it.  Almost 3 weeks is not acceptable for something I can buy over the counter.</li>
    <li> In the summer it is much better than deodorant! (diluted a bit obviously :-))</li>
    <li> Works great to relieve headaches!</li>
    <li> Use this to make a DIY teeth whitening paste -- very cool and refreshing!</li>
    <li> The oil smelled a little different than I was expecting but still a pleasant smell. Would buy from again. It was worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom. She loved it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Using to sent my wool dryer balls along with sweet orange - love it</li>
    <li> The actual oils are fine...I ordered enough for two locations.  When they arrived, however, they leaked out of their packaging and half of the oils were left to soak through the package.</li>
    <li> We love this product at our house.  My son suffers from Type 1 diabetes, often getting bad headaches.  We use this and have found it very helpful.  I have also found it to be a great stress reliever after a run or hard day at work.</li>
    <li> it helps with headaches</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aura Cacia oils for years and I love them. I recently ordered this peppermint oil and it smells awful! Not cool or minty at all. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a problem with an Auara Cacia oil and I&#x27;ve had plenty of their peppermint oil over the years. It looks like lots of people who ordered peppermint oil over the past few months have had problems. Maybe a bad batch or who knows what. I didn&#x27;t open my bottle right away when I got it (my last bottle wasn&#x27;t completely gone yet) and now that I have, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s too late to send it back. I&#x27;ll just toss this and replace it with Eden&#x27;s Garden...I won&#x27;t take a chance on getting another bottle from this batch.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil has so many uses, but I use this in an essential oil mix and rub on my scalp to control itching and to help stimulate hair growth.  The smell is strong, but as suggested, mix with other oils like jojoba, almond or olive oil.  You can also add other &#x27;growth&#x27; stimulating oils (such as rosemary, lavender, castor) to create your own growth mix.</li>
    <li> Arrive on time and it help to lower my son&#x27;s fever. Great product</li>
    <li> I have the Aura Cacia Organic Peppermint and let me tell you these two smell night and day. With the organic peppermint, I smell straight peppermint. With this oil, I mostly smell oils although the package does not mention that it is diluted with any type of oil. I purchased two unfortunately but I do not use this on my skin or any of my diy products. I only use this to diffuse.</li>
    <li> All these oils are the best. I use some on my hair and skin. I love this brand.</li>
    <li> The cap is childproof, which may be good for some people, but it makes it ind of hard to open. I also like to put a sticker on the top for easy identification from a top view, and you can&#x27;t with this lid. I have no problems with the oil, just the packaging.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand at my local farmers market. It definitely smells like peppermint, probably more like the leaves than any other brand I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as pleasant as young living...it&#x27;s definitely different, but still good. I think in the future I will stick with young living, though.</li>
    <li> I suffer from migraines due to sinusitis and use this as a miracle cure to my problems. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this stuff. It&#x27;s great for curing headaches but rubbing in temples, freshening breath, and helping allergies when combined with other oils.</li>
    <li> great product. i&#x27;ll buy again</li>
</ol>
