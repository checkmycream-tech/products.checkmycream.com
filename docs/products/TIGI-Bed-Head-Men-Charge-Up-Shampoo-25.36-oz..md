      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this shampoo a try, and boy am I glad I did!  </li>

      <li>I have fine hair strands, which I never knew, so it works great.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair full feeling and gives it a great sheen.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best men&#x27;s thickening shampoo I have found</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve never had nice shampoo before, but this seemed really nice at first.</li>

      <li>I finally found a good replacement.</li>

      <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo.  </li>

      <li>It smells very chemically, like a house cleaning product, and it dried out his soft, shiny hair.  </li>

    <li> I recently switched to the Charge Up shampoo and I love it!  Makes hair fuller (or at least it&#x27;s convinced me it does) and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had nice shampoo before, but this seemed really nice at first. My biggest complaint with it, though, is that it seems to have the consistency and viscosity of conditioner and does not lather up really easily, leading to using way too much.</li>
    <li> I used to buy L&#x27;oreal for Men but for some reason it&#x27;s gone!  I finally found a good replacement. It makes hair fuller and thicker.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work.  Its not the cheapest but it does what it says it does.  You hair does thicken a bit.  Would give 5 stars if it was less expensive.</li>
    <li> I put my hair up with wax every day, so I was looking for a shampoo that would make it a little more full, and with this stuff I noticed a difference. Would reccomend!</li>
    <li> ordered this before for my husband after he  had found in a local store-can&#x27;t now. This time I ordered larger containers for him. He reallky likes how it gives his hair body since it is getting alittle thinner now.</li>
    <li> Fabulous men&#x27;s shampoo, my husbands hair looks fabulous with this product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for thinner hair. Adds thickness and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> Love it, the bottle presentation is great. The shampoo works great, it&#x27;s just what I needed. It lathers up ALOT when using.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, which can be a problem with a lot of shampoos because they strip all of the natural oil from my hair and leave it lifeless.  I thought I&#x27;d give this shampoo a try, and boy am I glad I did!  It leaves my hair full feeling and gives it a great sheen.  I don&#x27;t even need conditioner!  I love it, and definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for something that will give your hair a little more life.</li>
    <li> Sulphate free. Great shampoo and a good price. We will buy this again. My husband will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best men&#x27;s thickening shampoo I have found and I have tried just about everything on the market.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, it works well and with some conditioner after, it makes my hair perfect.</li>
    <li> Lathers up and cleans well</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo.  Bed Head is usually a brand that I like, so when my husband was looking for a new shampoo after his was discontinued, I ordered this one for him.  It smells very chemically, like a house cleaning product, and it dried out his soft, shiny hair.  He stopped using it after just a few weeks and now we are stuck with this huge, expensive bottle!</li>
    <li> I used this after researching it online. I have fine hair strands, which I never knew, so it works great.</li>
    <li> Used to smell better. Too perfumy now.</li>
    <li> and already have had issues with dandruff, this product will bring the nightmare back in the worst way. If that isn&#x27;t bad enough, the feel of your hair after using this shampoo makes you want to shave your head and start over again. The texture and actual feel of your hair is awful. Maybe the dandruff is an intended result to help grow your hair back faster with dead skin??? No. Try again!</li>
    <li> Best product that I have used to keep my hair looking full.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely makes my hair *feel* different than when I use a standard run-of-the-mill Suave product, for example.  I&#x27;m not sure that there is really a visible difference.  However, in the interest of trying to thicken my naturally fine hair, I&#x27;m comfortable with saying that it is doing something.  Since volumizing/thickening shampoos leave a residue of active ingredients in your hair, every so often you should consider using something else to wash that away, then start over.  If nothing else, it&#x27;ll make you appreciate and feel the volumizing effect more dramatically again!</li>
    <li> Does the job. Also a little bit goes a long way.</li>
