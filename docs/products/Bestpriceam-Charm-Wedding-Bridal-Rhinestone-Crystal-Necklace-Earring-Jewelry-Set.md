    <li> Beautiful necklace set. Amazon has great products at a great price. Thanks</li>
    <li> It took 5+ weeks to get here but is worth the wait.  Very pretty and dainty.  Perfect for prom or winter ball.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant at first after reading some of the reviews.... but I took a chance and ordered 10 of these necklace/earring sets for my bridesmaids on Dec. 26, 2014 and received them today Jan. 5, 2015 all the way from China to Baton Rouge, La....They are PERFECT!!!!! They arrived sooner than I expected. .. and can&#x27;t wait for my ladies to walk down the aisle looking flawless in them... I will definitely order from them again.... Trust me It&#x27;s worth it and the quality of the product is great ya&#x27;ll !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I luv it!  Great quality!  Sparkles like diamonds.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Cheap material, nice fit</li>
    <li> While the rest of the necklace might look okay from a distance, the center &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; is incredibly cheap looking and very obviously plastic. Unfortunately it will probably cost more than what I paid for it to return it, but I will not be wearing this for my wedding.</li>
    <li> It has a nice shine. It is cheap looking jewelry but you can&#x27;t tell from afar and is perfect for one time use or costume wear.</li>

    <li> I bought these for my bridesmaids in hopes of saving some money. They looked nice online so I took a chance, but they were really cheap looking when I received them. The rhinestones are plastic and shiny, and some were halfway out of the place settings on the necklaces. I didn&#x27;t use them for my wedding. I will be donating them.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Slow shipping, but worth the wait. I love that they provided extra stones and glue in case one falls out.</li>
    <li> The necklace looks more impression in person. Sparkles beautifully. The main stone on both earrings is not centered but unless you&#x27;re staring they look nice. For the price and quality, am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Halloween costume quality. The glue that holds on the charms is highly visable and some of the charms are glued in crooked. It even comes with extra glue. Great for a costume party. Remember, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> The jewelry was satisfactory however it did not arrive on time for me to wear at the event that I purchased it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackie H.</li>

    <li> Took very long to receive, but I am happy with the product. They do not look cheap and they have a good weight to them.  They aren&#x27;t heavy, but they do not feel like cheap plastic.  Crystal looking (good shine).  They also included glue with each of the 8 sets I ordered. Things happen and get damaged during delivery. I like the fact they included a quick fix solution if it did arrive not in tact. Can&#x27;t wait for my bridesmaids to see them!</li>
