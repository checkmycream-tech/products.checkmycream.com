      <li>[[ASIN:B0000WWP5G Zadro S-Neck Surround Light Vanity Mirror]]  </li>
      <li>I thought I was buying this fluorescent version of the Zadro 6X S-Neck Surround Light Vanity Mirror, replacing one I had had for years that got stuck in the off</li>
      <li>The incandescent version was no where near as bright as the fluorescent version and the diameter of the mirror is 1/2\\</li>
      <li>There is no distortion and the circling light provides for no shadows.</li>
      <li>Ik First let me say you will never find a makeup mirror with better lighting that this one.</li>
      <li>The light is very bright and you can see EVERY little thing.</li>
      <li>and I thought it would be bright enough based on reviews.</li>
      <li>Good lighting and magnification - I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>any further away &amp; its all BLURR.&lt;br /&gt;I returned mine even thought the lighting was beyond amazing.</li>
      <li>Fabulous really.</li>
      <li>Its a lovely mirror, very sleek and modern.</li>
      <li>I wanted to mention this because in BBB I saw many good quality mirrors that you could focus just the center of your face (eyes, nose, mouse) but anything around it, would be completely blurry that could get you a bit dizzy....</li>
      <li>I think there are others out there just as good for less money.</li>
      <li>After three years of consistent use, my first Zadro mirror must be replaced.  </li>
      <li>Mirror performs exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>It works just like the first day I got it.</li>
      <li>This mirror is exactly what you need to put on makeup.  </li>
      <li>which was my first choice anyway.  </li>
      <li>just enough to be able to put make up.</li>
      <li>I was interested in did not give off enough light.  </li>
      <li>It bought this mirror because my new place didn&#x27;t have natural light in the bathroom</li>
      <li>It is a chrome finish that I don&#x27;t like much, but didn&#x27;t have choice.</li>
      <li>I am very picky about vanity mirrors and this one fits the bill.</li>
      <li>While it has some brightness, I don&#x27;t think the one sided magnification and amount of light are enough to warrant the price.</li>
      <li>The surround light is terrific for makeup, eyebrow tweezing, etc.  </li>
      <li>Nothing is sexier than a red pout and nothing more turning off than the red spilling out over your lip lines like you</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This fluorescent version is definitely worth the extra $27.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  </li>
      <li>Once you get to the right distance to the mirror, your entire face looks focused</li>
      <li>I will update when the bulb goes out and if it is easy to change and see how long it last.</li>
      <li>If I had to pick any flaw at all it is that there is not a regular mirror on the backside as many of the other models offer</li>
      <li>I ordered this light after doing a lot of research, maybe too much research that in the end it was hard to make a decision and ended up buying this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;MY LIGHT IS STILL WORKING, AND I USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
      <li>I wound up with Jerdon Brushed Nickel Lighted Pedestal Makeup Mirror and am much happier</li>
      <li>The first one arrived with broken glass but as usual Amazon quickly handled that and shipped a replacement which was fine.</li>
      <li>I saw this mirror at a major deparment store, but they were out of stock.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend that more care be given to pressing the on/off switch, being careful not to use it more than necessary, and using a lighter touch when depressing the switch.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is instead of the fixed \\&quot;s\\&quot; neck, make the neck flexible.  </li>
      <li>Its track record is far better than previously owned mirrors (some less expensive, some more).</li>
      <li>Other than the plug, it still looks brand new.</li>

    <li> There is no distortion and the circling light provides for no shadows. Keep the glass cleaner handy as the magnifications will show every speck of dust.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what you need to put on makeup.  You can see EVERYTHING, yikes!  I could see my enlarged pores, the hairs up my nose and the tastebuds on my tounge! I love it because it allows me to put on my makeup with precison.  The lighting is great and very bright. You can pluck your brows or any other unwanted hairs.  Its also great if you wear glasses, I can easily apply my makeup. Than pop my glasses back on my face and not worry if I missed something because I couldn&#x27;t see.  Its a lovely mirror, very sleek and modern. I love this mirror, definately good beauty investment.</li>
    <li> Well, I received this mirror for Christmas today, and it does not work. So disappointing. Will be returning it tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Works, have had no issues, it just a bit big for my bath vanity.  But you can see every pore.  Makes putting on mascara exceptionally easy.  Really makes you want to get your skin peeled off when you see how bad it looks that close up..</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0000WWP5G Zadro S-Neck Surround Light Vanity Mirror]]  I stand (not seated), while applying my make-up.  Mirror must sit on bathroom counter.  Mirror does not have telescoping neck to raise it to height I need.     Mrs. J. Blandford</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying this fluorescent version of the Zadro 6X S-Neck Surround Light Vanity Mirror, replacing one I had had for years that got stuck in the off position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I ordered one advertised with the same name but that uses a 24 watt incandescent bulb.  The incandescent version was no where near as bright as the fluorescent version and the diameter of the mirror is 1/2\\&quot; shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mistake for not reading the description.  This fluorescent version is definitely worth the extra $27.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  My husband straightwired the plug so now I just plug it in to turn it on.  I have been using this mirror for over seven years now and just love it.  Other than the plug, it still looks brand new.</li>
    <li> The surround light is terrific for makeup, eyebrow tweezing, etc.  Much superior to older versions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I had a vanity mirror for many years that I liked very much that finally quit working.  I looked and looked for a replacement, looking at less expensive models of mirrors that you can find at bed bath &amp; beyond, etc.  I saw this mirror at a major deparment store, but they were out of stock.  I looked on line and found it at amazon plus, the price was less than at the retailer!  This mirror is great, and it sits taller than most mirrors so you don&#x27;t find yourself slouching to look into it.  Also the mirror is a good quality mirror, and the mangification is perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Mirror performs exactly as advertised.  Good lighting and magnification - I would definitely recommend this product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I ordered this light after doing a lot of research, maybe too much research that in the end it was hard to make a decision and ended up buying this.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Monday and it was here Wednesday. Pretty good. It is a chrome finish that I don&#x27;t like much, but didn&#x27;t have choice. The light is ok, a little bit more would have been perfect. I wish it would be re-sizable (make it taller you can do that with few Zadro models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is excellent. I went to Bed Bath and Beyond to see other mirrors and I can say this mirror is great. You have to get your face close to it tho (about 7\\&quot; more/less to the mirror) just enough to be able to put make up. I think closer than that you could have a hard time using the brushes for eye shadow. Once you get to the right distance to the mirror, your entire face looks focused and obviously you can see every hole, mark, wrinkle ... etc (scary). I wanted to mention this because in BBB I saw many good quality mirrors that you could focus just the center of your face (eyes, nose, mouse) but anything around it, would be completely blurry that could get you a bit dizzy.... do you know what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was debating between 6x, 7x or 8x and even 10x. BBB didn&#x27;t have 6x only 8x -&gt; 10x. I risked it and got 6x. I was afraid that it would not bring enough magnification, but I must say it was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it will last. By reading the reviews, some people complaint that the bulbs go out soon, some didn&#x27;t even work, but then again I read that with other brands. So decided to just get it and try my luck. I will update when the bulb goes out and if it is easy to change and see how long it last. I will probably be pissed if it happens too soon... oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S.) any bad grammar or spelling I apologize. My English is a second language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  02/12/2014&lt;br /&gt;MY LIGHT IS STILL WORKING, AND I USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the brightest magnifying mirror, this could be it.  The clarity of the mirror is excellent and the magnification is just the right amount for \\&quot;up close\\&quot; work.  The only thing I would change is instead of the fixed \\&quot;s\\&quot; neck, make the neck flexible.  The mirror part swivels up and down for angle adjustment.    The first one arrived with broken glass but as usual Amazon quickly handled that and shipped a replacement which was fine.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great for applying makeup.  The light is very bright and you can see EVERY little thing.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before I choose this mirror and it appeared that some of the cheaper models as well as a battery model I was interested in did not give off enough light.  So far I have been extremely  happy with this mirror. The amount and color of light seems great. If I had to pick any flaw at all it is that there is not a regular mirror on the backside as many of the other models offer but I just look in the regular bathroom mirror since I keep this on the bathroom counter anyways.   I like the 6x magnification.  I would not want it stonger as then I would have to put my face a couple inches from it to be able to use it.   6X works well for me.  If your unsure what magnification you need, go into a drugstore and look at the mirrors (without lights) in different mag so you can compare.  This was a much better quality and price then when I looked at Bed, Bath and Beyond.</li>
    <li> After three years of consistent use, my first Zadro mirror must be replaced.  The on/off switch got stuck and no longer functions.  I searched for different mirrors but opted to purchase the same mirror again.  Its track record is far better than previously owned mirrors (some less expensive, some more). I would recommend that more care be given to pressing the on/off switch, being careful not to use it more than necessary, and using a lighter touch when depressing the switch.</li>
    <li> OMG.  I have this mirror adjacent to the HDTV so that I will have perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA:  still works in 2013.</li>
    <li> I looked a many magnifing mirrors before I purchased this one.  All the others were quite a bit more money.  This one was somewhat cheaper and is a great mirror.  The surround lighting along with the magnifing makes it easy to see and is great for plucking eyebrows and putting on make up.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fabulous really. The lighting is outstanding. I am very picky about vanity mirrors and this one fits the bill. I searched forever and finally came back to this one- which was my first choice anyway.  You have to get up close though- b/c of the magnification it blurs if your face isn&#x27;t close enough. I think all magnification mirrors are this way.  Anyway my makeup looks so precise using this mirror.  I love it!  Update: October, 2011. It&#x27;s five years later since purchase. Haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it. No bulb change, nothing. It&#x27;s easy to clean and just as bright as it was five years ago.  Update October, 2016.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been ten years! Time flies! Still have had no issues or lightbulb change. It works just like the first day I got it.</li>
    <li> It bought this mirror because my new place didn&#x27;t have natural light in the bathroom and I thought it would be bright enough based on reviews. While it has some brightness, I don&#x27;t think the one sided magnification and amount of light are enough to warrant the price. It&#x27;s just okay. I think there are others out there just as good for less money.</li>
    <li> Ik First let me say you will never find a makeup mirror with better lighting that this one. The big problem is in order to get a non distorted view of yourself you have to have your face two inches from the mirror. any further away &amp; its all BLURR.&lt;br /&gt;I returned mine even thought the lighting was beyond amazing. The one I have is 1/3 the price &amp; no destortion. but the lighting is only 25 watt as opposed to the 100 watt of this one I have returned. I traded image for lighting as i can always add lighting. In fact if you have Vertigo even a little bit. This mirror will trigger it. Dont do it. I wound up with Jerdon Brushed Nickel Lighted Pedestal Makeup Mirror and am much happier</li>
    <li> Before you reach out for that deadly non forgiving Red lipstick , please do yourself a favor and apply it with precision. Nothing is sexier than a red pout and nothing more turning off than the red spilling out over your lip lines like you just ate diner greasy pork chops.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you got it.&lt;br /&gt;Luv&lt;br /&gt;Seema kg</li>
