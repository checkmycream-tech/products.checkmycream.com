      <li>The smell is awesome.</li>
      <li>The bowl works perfectly.</li>

      <li>the shave is wonderful once you get used to it, and the cost per blade is under 10 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works okay but the cup could be bigger</li>
    <li> Ok for beginners but is kinda cheap in quality</li>
    <li> The brush is smooth against the face, and the bowl is easy to clean. The soap lathers very nicely, and works as it should: becoming a slippery lubricant. It dries out if it&#x27;s left for too long.</li>
    <li> It works and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The feel of the bowl is fine for my hands, while the soap don&#x27;t really last very very long/</li>
    <li> I would purchase this again...The brush is good for the price no shedding yet and the soap gives a great lather and I love the smell...I dont expect this to last forever at such a low price but it is more than worth the money i paid for it...</li>
    <li> Great starter kit, but if you end up &amp;#34;getting into&amp;#34; DE shaving I&#x27;d recommend getting a better brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The soap lasts for about a month. No complaints there&lt;br /&gt;- The bowl is, well, a bowl. No reason why this couldn&#x27;t last you  number of years&lt;br /&gt;- I thought I liked the brush, but then on a whim I bought a $15 badger hair brush. Compared to the badger brush, this brush is pretty mediocre.</li>
    <li> best shaving cream ever brush is good too</li>
    <li> Nice Bowl, good brush, but did not like the soap which is why I gave it 4 stars. I just couldn&#x27;t get a good enough lather with that soap and I much rather use Barbasol shaving cream. It&#x27;s still a must buy for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend top dollars on a badger hair brush or for any beginners to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> awesome, great present</li>
    <li> All of the items are good for the low price if you want to get into wet shaving (with a safety or straight edge razor). The bowl is good quality. The soap is acceptably good but not amazing and you&#x27;d definitely want something better when you use it up. The brush is boar hair rather than badger, so you&#x27;ll end up with some bristles on your face, especially early on. Still, it&#x27;s a great way to get introduced to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Soap and brush are absolute crap. Got a neat little bowl out of the deal though</li>
    <li> I purchased this set as a gift for a friend. It is complete with everything necessary for shaving except the razor.</li>
    <li> Good product but definitely on the cheaper side. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love the soap, dish &amp; price, but the brush falls apart &amp; makes shaving somewhat impossible, leaving hairs everywhere</li>
    <li> Great quality brush, good bristle life, stays soft yet raises your facial hair and gets the soap where you need it. a quick rinse of the bowl and soap then pour it out with a finger holding the soap in the bowl. That&#x27;s easy cleanup!</li>
    <li> The brush stops shedding after a while. The bowl is a good size for a puck. The glycerin soap works well and I still have over half after 3 months, though it is now used in rotation with 3 other soaps.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a starter kit with a straight edge razor.  It smells good and the cup is real ceramic, not plastic.  The brush has great course hair too and doesn&#x27;t look like it will fall out, I tried pulling on them a bit to see how easily they came out.  I hope he will love it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my dad for Christmas, along with a Merkur safety razor. He loves it! Before he was using Barbasol shaving cream and Bic throw-away razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great gift, because of the low cost of this set it&#x27;ll be no loss if the person doesn&#x27;t like it, and if they do, it&#x27;s a good base to start to build off of. Since he liked it so much, for this father&#x27;s day I ordered him some of the higher line VDH shaving soap and a better brush (my dad seems to be a little rough with his brush, the hairs seems a little bent after a few months of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how anyone can argue with the price of this kit; for less than $10 you get a brush, bowl, and soap. I guess my dad&#x27;s not a picky person, but he really enjoys it and said it was the best shave in years. For those who complain about the kit and give it bad reviews, what do you really expect out of $10?</li>
    <li> Very good great hot shave</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart after a couple weeks. Nice introduction to brush shaving though. I just learned I need a better brush.</li>
    <li> The shop is good, it works better with really hot water. The brush will fall apart in about a week, save your money look for another brush.</li>
    <li> This is an average quality product for an okay price. I think it was 2 dollars cheaper than it was at wallmart. The brush isnt the highest quality but it works. It a good buy for someone as a starter set to go with a first time safety razor user.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is true of all but the bristles come loose every time I use it. Other than that, perfect.</li>
    <li> This is an easy and clean way to lather your face for a good shave.  No messy hands fumbling over the faucet to turn on or turn off the water, leaving shaving cream all over the faucet handles.  All the shaving cream is on the brush, the bowl, and your face...  Hands are as clean as a whistle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look there are some reviewers that don&#x27;t like the brush.  Yet they say they enjoy the bowl, and the bowl alone is worth the price.  For that type of mentality, i&#x27;d go to the dollar store to get a cheaper bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the brush too.  Some of the brush hairs will fall out, but for the most part they stay intact. Just be sure to clean the brush after each use, which you can do by running some water on it while cleaning the bowl as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the lather soap, I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I like it.  But before I got this set, I had bough some shaving cream at Wal-mart, hence I want to use the shaving cream up first.  So, I&#x27;ll spray it into the bowl, and use it till it finishes.  But I&#x27;ve been doing so for about 2 month and the shaving cream can still feel almost full.  Geesh those cans of shaving cream foam really do go a long way, and they only cost about 1 dollar (Wal-Mart brand).</li>
    <li> This kit is great. I use it all the time. I could not see using another bowl and brush. The price is right as well.</li>
    <li> Brush is really nice and seems to beholding up great.  Bowl is OK, not needed.  It is a good size and works well with the soap.  The soap helps give a good shave with little irritation.</li>
    <li> Purchased this at my local big box store for 8.89. The soap quality is very good and has a very mild baby powder like scent that never lingers. The lather is creates is very creamy and the soap itself can be melted down to fit your bowl or any container should you decide you need to. The bowl is well made and attractive, however made is a bit small should you decide that you want to lather in your bowl. Works decent for the job. The brush is a plastic handled with much flash...boar brush sheds 6 or so hairs each time I shave and is very abrasive. I suggest a tweeserman pure badger or any badger for that matter over this. You get what you pay for in the brush...throw it in your travel bag for a back-up. Over all...all products will get you started and you cant beat that price!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the user really likes the set, for me it was a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I chose this set because of the large number of good rating and reviews. I think I should have read more of the negative reviews though, as they would have helped me choose a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap is very good. The bowl, totally acceptable. The brush, however, is very poor quality and immediately began to lose bristles. They come out in droves. I usually have ten or twelve on my face after applying the soap. They interfere with shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I recommend avoiding this brush and buying the soap separately.</li>
    <li> Love the set the brush is soft and so is the soap the bowl is super cute. Def worth the buy and so cheap.</li>
    <li> This kit is great to start off with. I became tired of buying razors and decided to go with a straight razor. I feel like the soap doesnt lather as well as i would like and after a few times the hairs do start to fall out of the brush. If you decide to commit i reccomend buying a better set later.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with similar items. Upon first use the brush let loose a couple bristles on my face, but has been a decent performer since. The shave soap works as I expected it to after watching youtube videos but like other people have stated the bowl is awful. It is slippery and there is nothing to hold on to. When I use the set the bowl frustrates me every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple Weeks later re-Review: You are considering this product because you are probably sick of the garbage that comes in a can and you are looking for an alternative, right? This product is garbage. As I mentioned before the bowl is garbage and the soap is disappointing. I bought a name brand product and was blown away by the difference between the soap and the name brand product. You get what you pay for. Do yourself a favor and instead of spending 10 dollars on this cheap garbage spend 20 dollars. Search and find a 10 dollar badger hair brush and a name brand soap/cream. There is a huge difference.</li>
    <li> For the price the brush gets the job done, not $50 quality but not cheap. The bowl doesn&#x27;t need a handle because it&#x27;s made to fit in your palm. The shave soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and applys nicely with low scent.  I saw the kit at Wal-Mart for $8 and the soap cost less than $2. Would recommend, I have no problems at all with this kit.</li>
    <li> Item was everything I expected it to be and it came in packed neatly and also arrived in a prompt timely fashion! :)</li>
    <li> Got this kit for about $8.50 at a Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, considering the price, its an awesome value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing about brush shaving, its really nice.  It feels good on your face, it results in a nice close shave, and its honestly kinda fun to do it the old school way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part is, you go on the internet and find out that there&#x27;s a super elite group of people who will tell you that THIS brand of shave soap is the best soap and you should only use THIS brand of badger brush because the other types don&#x27;t compare and how you can only use THIS kind of razor because the other kinds will somehow destroy your face and make shaving the kind of unspeakable horror only sick, twisted people dare entertain their minds with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point I&#x27;m trying to make is this:  there is actually a community of shaving snobs.  People who&#x27;ve actually invested over a hundred dollars in particular, elite equipment to SCRAPE LITTLE HAIRS OFF THEIR CHINS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they see this cheapo set and turn their noses up at it, because its ONLY EIGHT DOLLARS and you can BUY IT AT WAL-MART!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like wet shaving.  Its a good shave.  I shave with a double edge safety razor (a Merkur) and this particular kit.  And it works out GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRUSH:  Its a boars hair brush, and its fine.  It lathers well, it works the way it should, its not rough on my face at all.  Yes, it has a plastic handle.  WHO CARES?!?!?!?!  Its the HANDLE of a friggin BRUSH!!!  Do your hands start on fire if they touch plastic?  Do you get an allergic reaction if your fingertips handle a brush thats not metal or wood?  If you answered \\&quot;No\\&quot; to both those questions, then you&#x27;re fine.  Complaining about the material of a shaving brush handle makes you a snob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOWL:  Its a bowl.  The soap sits in it, it holds steady when you lather.  Its fine.  You know why? Because its a FREAKIN&#x27; BOWL!!!  How do you honestly complain about a bowl?  It functions, it doesn&#x27;t offend the eye, its fine.  Don&#x27;t be a snob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SOAP:  Honestly, I&#x27;ve tried so many canned shaving creams its ridiculous.  I&#x27;m a man with sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t matter how moisturizing the cream was, I still had nicks and cuts and irritated skin.  So imagine my surprise to find this soap to be a key part of a very clean, enjoyable shave.  I seriously get better results from this soap than I do with my gels and creams.  Way to go, VDH shaving soap.  Are there better shaving soaps?  Probably.  Do I care?  No, because this one leaves my face moisturized and refreshed, costs 1.80 per bar, and I can actually get it without ordering it over the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  A great wet shave kit, especially for the price.  Avoid the snobby opinions and give it an honest shot.  If you&#x27;re not a total tool you&#x27;ll probably be surprised by how nice this kit is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of things in this world where the level of craftsmanship and attention to detail make a huge difference.

THE SOAP:  Honestly, I&#x27;ve tried so many canned shaving creams its ridiculous.  I&#x27;m a man with sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t matter how moisturizing the cream was, I still had nicks and cuts and irritated skin.  So imagine my surprise to find this soap to be a key part of a very clean, enjoyable shave.  I seriously get better results from this soap than I do with my gels and creams.

    <li> To be fair i wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I have been wet shaving for about a year. I generally lather with my hands, but i wanted to try a bowl and brush. Dont get me wrong for the money it aint bad. Although the brush does shed, the bowl and soap work just fine lol. If you are a tiny bit curious about wet shaving , i would say get this or something similar, just to get your feet wet.</li>
    <li> Nice cerimic Bowl, nice bristle brush, and Great smelling Shaving Cream.  I bought it because im fed up wasting half of my shaving lotion.  With this no waste, and not much mess.    During the second use, at least 10 bristles fell out of the brush, at this rate, I will have to buy a new brush in about 2 months.  If I had paid more for this set, I ould only give it 3 stars, but for the price it is a good deal.    Supper Savor Shipping was a few days fast.</li>
    <li> used this product for a week now and no complaints, brush works up a lather, apply to face, and shave... pretty simple.  the brush will lose a few hairs but not a knock by anymeans and it kinda stinks at the first. i washed mine with shampoo a few times to get rid of the smell.  bowl is good but a handle would be nice.. and soap is decent and not overbearing.. smells clean...  nice shave with both a mach 3 and with my DE razor.  you can spend more and you are welcome to, but in my humble opinion, a shave is a shave, get over it and get to work.   btw. thick full beard, shave daily, not by choice so i make the most of it.</li>
    <li> TLDR: Just starting out? Buy this set now. /TLDR    I picked this set up at the Wally a few years ago when I first started wet shaving. It&#x27;s a superb value.    I have been using the brush with only occasional bristle loss for about 3 years. I keep saying I&#x27;m going to get myself a more expensive synthetic brush, but time and again I can never really justify it with this one working so well.    I didn&#x27;t care for the bowl. My first shave bowl had little ribs on the inside to keep your soap from spinning around uselessly as you try to whip up lather. This one does not. I also found it to be a little small for building up a really nice lather. But at the time I was not aware that you could melt the soap into the bottom of the bowl, which conveniently solves both problems. Your soap will stay put and it will make the bowl seem bigger since there won&#x27;t be a bunch of wasted space under your soap puck.    If you are considering getting started with wet shaving just buy it. But it now. It&#x27;s less than ten bucks! You can always upgrade later, but why agonize for hours (or days) over what brand of brush and soap to buy when you have a perfectly good set that you could run out to the store and pick up today.</li>
    <li> EDIT 8/24 - A hunk that consisted of 1/3 of the hair left in the brush fell out this morning while I shaved. I&#x27;m dropping one star from my review.    Bowl- Great, it&#x27;s a bowl. What more can I say?  Soap- Great, it&#x27;s soap. It smells nice and makes a nice lather.  Brush- SHEDS LIKE CRAZY.    I got this set because it was cheaper than the badger hair sets (this one is boar&#x27;s hair I think) and I&#x27;m new at this method of shaving, so I didn&#x27;t think I would notice a difference. The hair is stiff (but so might be better brushes, I&#x27;m new at this) which isn&#x27;t that bad, you just kind of slather it all over your face. Produces a good lather, but when you put the brush against your skin, without fail you will get brush hairs stuck to your face. Maybe this is normal, but it stands to reason that they could do something in the manufacturing process to A) remove any loose bristles or B) just attach them so they don&#x27;t fall out EVERY TIME. Go with a better more expensive brush set, it will cost twice as much (or more) but at least it won&#x27;t ADD HAIR when you&#x27;re trying to shave!</li>
    <li> I agree with Alex Nennig. The soap is on bar with Colonel Conk&#x27;s soap, and the brush is just as fine as any other that I have used.  The bowl fits the soap very well. For the price, this is a great started set. I recommend this set  and will use this as a gift in the future.</li>
    <li> This set works well and it was worth the money. The brush is not the best, but I certainly gets the job done. I would recommend getting this if your just starting to use safety razors, its a great starting product.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an excellent set of shaving gear to get started with.  The brush or bowl alone is worth the price of the kit.  And the soap is very good to boot, rivaling many of the more expensive and exotic brands.  It would make for a great gift, to someone who has never tried wetshaving, or has never used a brush to apply lather.  The brush, while not luxurious, is still a decent boar hair brush -- it will certainly get the job done.  At this price, it won&#x27;t hurt to try out a new way of shaving, be it with your old trusty double edged razor, or a new-fangled Fusion or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I noticed some complained about the smell of the brush.  As with any brush, it should be cleaned thoroughly before using it.  Give the bristles a good working with some dish detergent, soak for several minutes, rinse well.  Some say to also soak new brushes in a weak solution of vinegar, and cleanse with shampoo and conditioner.  Just be sure to clean it somehow - this is true of any brush.</li>
    <li> Aren&#x27;t sure if you want to get into brush and bowl shaving?  This is a great deal to test the waters, or a great gift for someone.  Me, I&#x27;m hooked.  The reason I only gave this 4 stars, the brush has been losing bristles every time I use it.  I know it was cheap, but that&#x27;s too cheap for me.  For the price though, this is a good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this cheap from the walmart. It gets the job done but I&#x27;d suggest go with a  better product, if you can afford it.    Pro&#x27;s    Gets it done if you aren&#x27;t too picky    Cheap    Less waste then the spray can shaving cream    IMO it works better then shaving cream since you can push the hairs into your stubble and lift up on the facial hair, making it easier to shave.    Con&#x27;s    Really it&#x27;s kind of bad quality, but I can&#x27;t complain too much    The hairs fall off the brush and get stuck on your face    The soap lathers kind of thin, just don&#x27;t add as much water try to wet the brush, shake it out really good and swipe up some thicker stuff that fell off the side of the soap.    All in all it&#x27;s all right, you can&#x27;t complain for the price, but you will want to upgrade eventually.</li>
    <li> This review is specifically for the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a shaving snob.  In fact, I am a beginner and this is the first brush I have ever bought/used.  The brush&#x27;s hairs have been falling out at a fantastic rate.  From the very first lather my face was covered in countless boar&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be a rookie, but this is unacceptable.  Spend a few more bucks on an functional brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for the most part because it was cheap, figured why bother spending anymore money... wrong. The only decent item in the set is the bowl and you can always just build the lather on your face or on your palm. The soap does the job but it is hard to build a lather and it left my skin feeling dry. The brush also did the job... until the the handle came off the actual brush in just a month of use. If you want my advice your probably better off just buying a separate brush with a decent shaving soap instead of wasting your time on this \\&quot;premium\\&quot; shave set.</li>
    <li> In terms of wet shaving, I&#x27;ve probably been in the game shorter than most, but I would definitely recommend this kit for someone new or just trying it out.  If nothing else, you&#x27;re out $10 in an area where a top quality brush can run up $125+. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews about the brush falling apart, but as long as you treat it well, it will return the favor.  As for the soap that is included, I haven&#x27;t tried it yet since a friend of mine gave me an extra cake of his favorite when I started.</li>
    <li> Great set to start out with.  Don&#x27;t go spending a ton of money on fancy shaving products until you know you like this type of shaving!</li>
    <li> It seemed like a great purchase at first. The bowl and soap were great, but unfortunately the brush fell apart within a few weeks.  From the onset, every time I lathered up, I would get an errant hair which would come loose and stick to my mug. I thought it may be common for a new brush, but when a large clump of hairs came loose I quickly realized that it was all over. I bought a Tweezerman brush as a replacement and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> The Van Der Hagen set is a nice set for starters. The shave soap smells nice the brush smells good and it is inexpensive to boot. I only have one problem with this, the brush, its boar hair and a sub par brush, the bristles come out of it fairly easily and its obviously of cheap quality. One of the nicest things about \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving is having a smooth soft badger hair brush massage and exfoliate your skin. This brush kind of takes away from that. But to get a proper brush can cost hundreds of dollars, and most people starting out do not want to spend that. Even with the brush, it&#x27;s so cheap that I was impressed by the over all quality of the set! If you are a shaving aficionado then don&#x27;t buy this because you&#x27;ll want the nice brush and there are better soaps out there. That said, take this for what it is, a beginners set that is an inexpensive way to break into the world of wet shaving!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for about 3 months now, I love the way the bowl looks and feels, even though its so simple. The brush is okay, i&#x27;ve lost about a handfull of bristles, but for how cheap the entire set it I was surprised at its quality. The soap is good stuff too, I like the scent and it does a pretty good job for wet shaving.   Overall if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap way to enter the world of wet shaving I would go with this. The soap and brush aren&#x27;t the best out there but its $15 if you want high end items you&#x27;re going to have to pay more, but if you&#x27;re unsure of wet shaving, or just want something cheap until you find a good deal on a badger hair brush, this set is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my fiance and he said he liked the brush and the bowl was fine, but the soap didn&#x27;t lather the way he liked. I put some on my hand and rinsed it off. My hand did feel soft, but I didn&#x27;t shave with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving, and wasn&#x27;t really sure if I wanted to put in the money for a really nice set, so this seemed a good fit for me.  Indeed, when I received it, I was impressed.  Granted, I don&#x27;t a lot of experience here, but for the price, it did seem a good deal.  In fact, it was indeed, because the bowl that was included is rather nice.  It appears well made, and is heavy enough to not get pushed around the counter too easily.  The coloration works well with my bathroom as well.  The soap certainly doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It&#x27;s got a mild scent that I find clean and pleasing... and it lathers up quite well.  The only disappointment here was really the brush.  While it looks good, and is soft enough for me, it has a bit of a shedding problem.  In only its first use, I found it was already losing an awful lot of bristles.  This doesn&#x27;t make it any harder to use, of course, but it&#x27;s clear that it won&#x27;t last very long... and you may have to deal with getting rid of the shed bristles, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great buy for the money, especially if like me, you&#x27;re just getting into the whole wet shaving routine and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money to do so.  The brush detracts a bit from it, but not so much as to be useless.  Look at it this way - you&#x27;re getting a rather decent soap and a great bowl... and a free cheap brush.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive soap, bowl and brush set.  The price reflects the quality!!  It is just a plastic bowl, a round bar of soap and a shaving brush that sheds its  bristles. If you can find something like this at Wal-mart, you could at least smell the soap before you buy it.  I don&#x27;t know where you find this stuff except on line.  I use my double edge razor everyday, but I went back to using shaving soap in an  aerosol can.</li>
    <li> Received the set for Christmas. By the beginning of March bristles started falling out. In another week they were falling out in clumps.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as my first foray into the double edge safety razor world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a cheap kit obviously.  That&#x27;s why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has lasted me a few months and I suspect it will last another 6 months or so.  Not a superb brush but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Expect some shedding during the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is great.  It&#x27;s a ceramic bowl.  Not much else to say on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap puck isn&#x27;t that good.  Nice scent, but it just didn&#x27;t lather like you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this as a good starter kit and then get a quality cream like Proraso or something.</li>
    <li> This is great value, it includes everything to get you going in WETSHAVING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best way know if wetshaving is for you</li>
    <li> This is a cheap set.  Plain and simple.  But it&#x27;s usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving is cheap on the long run, but like buying anything in life, you have to put some money down first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect set for you to see if wet shaving works for you.  You can get this at a CVS/Wal-mart cheap, under $10 dollars.  The more expensive items will not be leagues above this, so if this is \\&quot;unbearable\\&quot;, don&#x27;t bother wasting your money buying the better stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on the flip side, this should not be your long term set.  It&#x27;s good for a few months, but if you&#x27;re gonna continue wet shaving, invest in better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush:&lt;br /&gt;- This set:  It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s a plastic handle with some hair on it.  It gets the job done, just don&#x27;t expect a \\&quot;facial\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive sets:  Search silver-tip brush.  Don&#x27;t expect magic, it will just feel softer.  It holds more water so supposedly is better for lathering.  Should cost you 60-120 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bowl:&lt;br /&gt;- This set:  Cheap ceramic bowl.  It&#x27;s a bowl...&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive sets:  There&#x27;s the mug version, and the bowl.  Then ceramic or Chrome.  No point other than aesthetics, I like my things looking the same.  Clearly you don&#x27;t need to buy a new bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap:&lt;br /&gt;- This set:  Its an aloe soap, this set is meant to be universal, so its a gentle hypoallergenic soap.  It&#x27;s alright, some people with sensitive skin love it.&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive sets: Proraso cream or soap is the best.  Some people like some brands out there, but that one is the generally considered best.  It&#x27;s cheap, unless you absolutely love the other soap, there&#x27;s no reason why not to upgrade.  A tube of the proraso is like $5, and will last you months or like an year or more... So even if it glides a fraction better, why not?  There&#x27;s a mutton fat soap for the tradition fanatics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor/Blade:&lt;br /&gt;- Buy Merkur, should be $30 dollars or under $50.  Try for long handle version first, it will be closest to what you&#x27;re used to.&lt;br /&gt;- Blade is \\&quot;feather\\&quot; blade.  It&#x27;s the sharpest, which is also the most unforgiving.  Yeah everyone has a \\&quot;favorite\\&quot; brand, but this is noones least favorite that I know of.  Or buy a variety pack and try out different ones till you like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in General, an expensive set should cost you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mug: N/A use anything&lt;br /&gt;Soap: $5&lt;br /&gt;Brush: $70&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about $90 with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll use for years to come (after trying out this pack to see if you will), even it it&#x27;s a tiny fraction better, why not?  Why are some people here acting like $100 means life or death?...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where you&#x27;ll save in wet shaving is the blades.  The general consensus for a good shave is each blade lasts you 3 shaves, or 3 days.  A pack of 100 is about $22 dollars, about.  So that&#x27;s 300 days, or close to 10 months for $22 dollars.  $22 dollars wont even buy you a Gillette fusion refill these days where I live... And let&#x27;s be honest, we usually take such bad care of it that those blades last like a week or two.  At least with this you can just throw away the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone said \\&quot;blah blah to use to scrape hair off your chin\\&quot;...  If only it was that simple, as most of us men know, shaving is an every day thing, a part of our lives.  If you&#x27;re going to do something EVERY... SINGLE... DAY... and you&#x27;ve used this box to see if you like this method, why not spend $60 dollars for a brush even if it is a tiny little bit better, and $5 for a soap that will last you 5months to a year... The $5 dollars is worth just the fun of trying out a new thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just DON&#x27;T expect this magical thing with the expensive versions, and if you&#x27;re on a tight budget, this will hold you through for a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA:  If you find a way to hold the brush upside down (the proper way), the water will seep down and extend the life and use of the brush.  Water running into handle ruins it faster.</li>
    <li> for the most the product is good except the brush would have to be upgraded bristles fell out after a couple uses.... delivery was fast</li>
    <li> For what brushes, bowls, and soap costs elsewhere, this is an excellent deal. Great starter set to begin wet shaving, and you&#x27;ll be doing your skin and your wallet a favor by giving up the aerosol cans.&lt;br /&gt; I found the bowl to be a good size, holds the soap well and not too many suds escape the top. The brush works well, too, though you may notice one or 2 bristles come out every time you shave. But its not a big deal. The soap is a great soap to learn on, it gives a good lather and moisturizes the skin well. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lubricate as well as I like, but it still does a good job (I spent a couple of extra dollars and bought Col. Conks).&lt;br /&gt; For the price, you really cannot go wrong. I recommend it, and each piece is a good product. Try this product out, and you can always upgrade later.</li>
    <li> I got it for a stocking stuffer...for this coming year - lol.  Yes, I buy ahead :)  On to the review...it seems pretty cool.  If I were a guy...I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d mind the brush...but, since it&#x27;s going to be a gift...the look kinda makes me nervous.  So, I may just buy another brush to replace it.  With that said...this is a good deal.  I have badger bristle make-up brushes...&amp; they aren&#x27;t real cheap.  I feel blessed I got a discount from school.  To me, any REAL animal bristle brush is good...they last longer than anything synthetic.    ***UPDATE: Well, I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it as a stocking stuffer - lol.  I gave it to my dad for one of his Valentine&#x27;s Day gifts.  He LOVED it.  We popped the soap out of the plastic container and into the nice heavy black dish.  It melted and then hardened to the container.  He used it today...and loved it!!!  The smell of the soap is really nice!  Yes, the boar bristle has a plastic handle...but, that didn&#x27;t seem to bother him.  It did me a little, b/c he&#x27;s my dad and I always want the best/coolest for him.  Turns out, it was perfect as is...couldn&#x27;t have done better.  He is already wanting more soap - lol.  I think he&#x27;s hooked - yay!  :D  Now, I just need to find some more of this good smelling soap for him.</li>
    <li> I purchased the set primarily for the bowl -- I use the bowl and a badger brush to generate lather for shaving.  You simply cannot find a shaving bowl for double this price.      The brush is a stiff, cheap boar hair brush.  I always had trouble making a lather with boar brushes, and this one was no different.    The soap is adequate for shaving.  Some people swear by it, others don&#x27;t.  I fall into the last camp and use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have to say I agree with Alex, the guy talking about the snobs, 100% At first it&#x27;s hard to believe that there could be a community of \\&quot;elite shavers\\&quot; but after looking them up online he was not exaggerating one bit! It&#x27;s crazy, I know, that there are people who&#x27;d be snobs about shaving, of all things, but if you don&#x27;t believe be go ahead and look them up. IT IS EXACTLY the way he said it was: \\&quot;this is the only soap that works, and you should only use that brush, and this one after shave is the only one worth it of our faces, and if you pay less than X for this razor blade then your face will rot, etc...\\&quot;    It&#x27;s hard to say anything original after someone said something you agree with 100% (Alex, not the snobs) so let me be brief.    The bowl: It&#x27;s a bowl, looks good, holds the soap, nice size, sturdy. Again, it&#x27;s a bowl.    The soap: It&#x27;s soap, nothing fancy, no complex electronic equipment inside, no secret formula, it&#x27;s soap. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, does it well, lasts a while, it is available everywhere (both locally and online) and it is priced like a soap. The scent is very very mild and soapy, which is fine with me since I don&#x27;t need to smell like a million bucks in the shower.    The brush: It&#x27;s a brush, it works. I would not buy another brush because it does fall apart quickly. For the same price I could get a Burma Shave Brush and it lasts a little longer.     - If you are a normal guy who wants to shave this is for you.  - If you are a normal guy and want to try the whole old style shaving thing then this is for you.  - If you like a good product at a reasonable price then this is for you.    This is NOT for you if:  - You are a tool  - You think soap should only come from another country  - You are too good to try something cheap  - You spend countless hours online discussing the important matters of the shaving world  - You can only use a brush properly if the handle is made of ivory, incrusted with diamonds, and the hairs are of an extinct animal.</li>
    <li> it works well and it smells amazing, the person i bought it for thinks its the coolest thing ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as my first foray into more traditional shaving techniques. Overall, I am very pleased with the set and I actually enjoy shaving now! It seems that the brush helps clean your face and the soap offers more resistance to nicks and cuts than typical shaving gels. It lathers up well and washes away clean. I will be using this product or ones like it from now on in my shaving routine.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush and Soap at Bath &amp; Body works. I skipped the bowl as i had a nice wide coffee mug that has filled it&#x27;s place. I like it. The soap has a very clean scent to it and lathers up nice. I&#x27;ve had it for two months and its still going. Although to clarify, I couldnt totally take Alex&#x27;s advice and made some upgrades (more on that later) so my girlfriend took it over. I did find that it lost a few hairs in the beginning but that stopped after the first week of daily use. It makes a good lather and has an exfoliating feel to it, which I like. I&#x27;ve recently switched to the Omega Stipely Badger brush and I&#x27;ll give you a true non-snob comparison.     The Omega is softer and feels soft like something a woman could use to apply blush with while this boar brush feels more firm like an outdoor paint brush, a little firm but still smooth at the tips (you can wash your car with it and it wouldn&#x27;t scratch the paint). Some say badger brushes smell like...well, dead badger. Mine didn&#x27;t but it did lose a lot of the die they used to make the hair black. This lasted for 2 shaves and stopped completely. To be clear it wasn&#x27;t like emptying a pen in the sink it was more like a light graying of the typically white lather when I rinsed out the brush. Oh, and the brush is still black.    The big difference between the brushes is how they lather and how they wear. The Omega makes a smooth thick warm lather than holds well on your face and lasts the whole shave. With the same effort the boar brush produces a thinner more watery lather. I can work at it longer but it just doesn&#x27;t get there  and/or stay warm. If I never bought the badger brush I doubt this would have really mattered but it is a noticeable difference. All in all I give the boar 3 stars and the Omega 4 as I wish it was a little more firm. As for wear, the badger brush dries like a used paint brush curled at the ends and stuck together, it never goes back to the straight hair look of day 1, where as the badger returns to looking new, daily. (I always rinse my brushes thoroughly and hang them bristles down to dry.( So if the badger lasts 3 times as long the price difference is negligible.) I wont spend more than $30 on a brush so this is where my journey ends.     If you&#x27;re interested, I&#x27;m using an Edwin Jagger 89de razor with Astra superior platinum blades and the c.o. bigelow shave creme (same as proraso tube) with the bigelow After shave balm. I&#x27;m very happy with all the products mentioned but still use cheap gillette custom plus 3 disposables when I&#x27;m in a hurry. The head of this disposable comes off and fits my gillette sensor excel handle and are cheaper than the sensor excel cartridges. Although I may cheat with the razor, I never pass up the brushed shave creme experience. It&#x27;s a great way to start your day.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at the drug store a few weeks ago.  The brush is made of boar hair with a plastic handle.  The bowl is glazed ceramic with no handle.  The soap is just soap.    The Brush  Aside from the cheap plastic handle, it is really no better or worse than any other inexpensive boar hair brush.  This is the best part of the set.  If you really want this brush, just buy it on its own.    The Bowl  Just a bowl.  Too big to fit in my medicine cabinet and close the door completely.  No handle.  Just use a coffee mug or invest in a better shave mug/bowl.  Not worth buying the set for.    The Soap  You&#x27;re better off shaving with a bar of Ivory.  Doesn&#x27;t have a very nice scent.  Dries out my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t lubricate very well which causes nicks when combined with my safety razor and would probably massacre your face when used with a straight razor.  Makes a very thin later that absorbs/evaporates quickly.  Spend the $4 on Colonel Conk instead.    In Summary  Why bother?  The word Premium does not belong attached to this set.  For about the same price, you can get a better boar hair brush and a much better soap.  Throw the soap in an old coffee mug and you&#x27;re good to go or spend a little extra on a nice shave mug/bowl.</li>
    <li> First, brush shaving may not be for everyone, I can&#x27;t see how though.    If you want to introduce a friend to brush shaving, this is the way to go.  If they don&#x27;t like it, no loss, if they do, this will carry them through until they get a better set.    As far as brushes go, if you&#x27;re buying boar, you aren&#x27;t going to waste your money on a metal or wooden handle brush!  You&#x27;re going inexpensive (not cheap).    The soap in this kit is actually quite nice.  I&#x27;m currently using a EJ Sea-Buckthorn soap, but the VDH soap must&#x27;ve been loaded with aloe, because it always makes my skin smooth, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent though.    The bowl in this kit (not a mug ~ a bowl) is very deep, which I actually really like.  I place my brush in the bowl and fill it to the brim with STEAMY HOT water and let it soak for 15 or 30 seconds.  It softens the soap for getting on the brush quickly and gets the brush nice and warm to the core.    At this price, pick up a few and pass them around to guys who are still in the dark about brush shaving, you&#x27;ll make some converts.    I like to leave my Edwin Jagger set at home, I have this VDH set packed in my travel kit.    For the money, it should have more stars, but compared to other shave brushes, it could have less.  Factor the cost and the product and it gets 3 stars.  Don&#x27;t mind spending $25 or more?  Go with badger.</li>
    <li> I got this at Wal-Mart.  It worked very well for the price.  I do recommend it to get you started if you find badger brushes out of your price range.  The brush consistently sheds but it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue for me.  The soap was pretty nice.    Here&#x27;s the thing, its not being a snob as some other reviewers infer to appreciate a nicer brush.  I was able to get a real badger brush for not much money and it is a huge step up.  I get much better lather and no shedding.  It is also much more comfortable on the face.  For me it was definitely worth an upgrade once I had committed to wet shaving.    I still love the bowl and will keep the brush around as a backup.  Don&#x27;t let the fact this is boar hair keep your from trying wet shaving - get this and go for it.  Be prepared to really enjoy it and want a better brush, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this set from the drug store after reading good things about shaving with a brush and soap. For the price, it&#x27;s a good gamble- if you discover you like wet shaving, you can upgrade later; if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re not out a small fortune.    Like another reviewer has stated, this set works. As a matched set, the soap is the perfect size for the bowl, which is small enough to sit on a shelf in my shower. The soap produces a workable lather with just a wet brush- and you can get a better lather by soaking it in hot water in the bowl for 30 seconds before starting. The brush lost some bristles during the initial wash, and a few more during my first few shaves, but it didn&#x27;t fall apart in clumps.    Although I&#x27;ve since upgraded to a pure badger brush, I managed to find a silicone lid that fit the bowl, and I&#x27;m now using this set in my travel kit. I plan to pick up a few more of these sets to give as Christmas gifts for my friends and relatives who&#x27;ve never tried wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I figured I could use this set until I got around to ordering a badger hair brush. The very first time I used it, hairs fell out, forcing me to pick them off of my face. The soap doesn&#x27;t lather well, and left my face feeling a bit dry. The bowl does it&#x27;s job, I suppose. I got mine at walmart, because its the only think around that I could pick up from a store. I plan on returning it as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> The brush is \\&quot;finest\\&quot; (lower quality) boar bristle which are slightly rough and tends to smell like a pig.  Has a cheap looking plastic handle, but hasn&#x27;t lost many bristles though.  The bowl is actually nice. It&#x27;s just like a tea cup without the handle.  The soap foams and shaves moderately well.  We bought this in town because it was the only set available.  I would hardly call it premium quality or gift quality, but it will help get you shaved.</li>
    <li> Just saw this kit at my local RITE AID pharmacy for $9..99, a savings of $2.00 compared to online price, go figure.  As others point out, this would make a nice starter kit for someone. I looked it over and thought the soap bowl would be nice if it had a finger hole or handle. I see the bowl slipping out of wet hands and breaking on bathroom ceramic tile floor .  I myself use a wide mouth coffee mug that I&#x27;ve had for 30 plus years that does have a finger hole.</li>
    <li> Bought this set to try it out and it is cheap which is great but the brush bristles are rough (not badger hair) and continue to fall out of the brush and being so rough they really do a number on my razor plugging it up hindering its performance.  Had no issue with the soap or bowl the soap didn&#x27;t make a very thick lather but it did the trick.  I&#x27;m on to buy a nicer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have since purchased a Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush.  I find this brush a huge improvement the Badger Hair is soft and the brush doesn&#x27;t shed much at all.  It sells here on amazon usually around 13 bucks.</li>
    <li> Purchased at Wal-Mart, fantastic value for someone taking their first dip into wet shaving, but unfortunately after only the second shave I began having problems.  Well, one problem, the brush is already leaving loose hairs on my face as I use it.  As in, the brush hairs are falling out.  It&#x27;s frustrating because they come out as I lather, they&#x27;re hard to pick out, and obviously this shouldn&#x27;t be happening so soon.  I will be purchasing a new brush, likely not the same one from this kit, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;I have incredibly sensitive skin and was going to buy the glycerin version of the soap in this pack but honestly my skin hardly reacted to the one included.  This is a huge plus.  The soap lathers well and the smell isn&#x27;t rough.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a bowl but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a very efficient bowl.&lt;br /&gt;So, i recommend it and simply hope the brush that comes in your box is better suited than the one I received.</li>
    <li> This boar bristle kit is okay for a starter set. The bristles are stiff and feel coarse on your face. I received a badger bristle brush as a gift about six months after purchasing this boar bristle model; there is a night and day difference. The badger bristles are soft and help to build a much better lather than the boar model. I would recommend a higher quality badger bristle model over this boar bristle model. The included soap cake is just okay. If you end up getting this model, then get yourself a creamier alternative, like that available from Proraso (Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation), as soon as the included soap cake is consumed.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I&#x27;ve been shaving since I was a sophomore in high school. I&#x27;ve hated shaving ever since. Razor burn, cut zits, and the sting of embarrassingly enflamed face were all aspects of shaving I dreaded. It literally got to the point where I simply grew a beard in frustration. However, in the past two years I have had to hold decent jobs at my college and now face life as a graduate. I&#x27;ve been using single disposable razors because they are cheap, but they do not get the close shave to look truly respectable (the stubble makes me look like I should find work as a cowboy, not a office worker). Well, I wasn&#x27;t going to blow a load of cash over the next few years on the Mach 3&#x27;s cartridges and I want to feel like a real man, you know, like my great-grandfather.     I gave this product a shot as my first old-school style of shaving. I don&#x27;t know what people are complaining about! The boar bristles aren&#x27;t that harsh (unless I truly do have a face like sandpaper) and the soap smells amazing! It&#x27;s a great starter set. Yes, I will probably purchase a Tweezerman badger brush after the glue has popped the top off. So far, i am pleased with the trendy bowl, brush, and soap to go with my Lord razor and Derby blades. I totally recommend this product to anyone going to start shaving with an classic safety razor or the modern razors today.</li>
    <li> I use these shaving kit and one thing you NEED to know is after cleaning the brush shaken off the water you Hang it upside down, you have to get a kit with a razor and brush hanger or it will be worthy less in a month.</li>
    <li> This is a good set either as an introduction to shaving or as a keeper.  I&#x27;ve always been a wet shaver and used canned lather and cartridges in the past.  Now I use this exact set except when travelling from overseas where I work.  I&#x27;ve actually used the soap from the plastic packaging when I travelled because I didn&#x27;t want to further risk breaking the bowl.  For the record, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and a half so the set brush is plenty durable with any basic care.  Yes the brush loses a hair every once in a while but that&#x27;s why you have a replacement on hand right?  The plastic handle is fine unless the snob factor comes in to play.  Just store it hanging from the knob with the bristles down.  The bowl is a good height in which to work up your lather (coffee mug is too tall) but a handle might be a good idea.  Lathering up is easy...just wet the brush under the hot running water and don&#x27;t shake out too much of the excess...work the brush around the bowl until you obtain the lather of your desired consistency.  The soap is fine unless again, the snob factor emerges.  Next up for me is an old fashioned safety razor instead of these WAY TOO EXPENSIVE cartidges and a decent shaving stand that will actually ship out to me.  Overall, if I could give 4 1/2 stars I would but...not 5...nothing ever gets a perfect score huh.  Addendum dated July 15th - been using this set with my Merkur Saftey Razor and a variety of DE blades for about two weeks.  I&#x27;ve used Merkur, Derby and Wilkinson blades to date with Feathers upcoming.  I can say that the entire routine of shaving oil, brushed lather and a good DE safety razor shave is a weclome part to shaving and a nice way to start the day.  This set works fine.  The bowl is a good size and fits my hand well, the brush also fits my hand well and the soap has a pleasant yet not overpowering scent.  The brush isn&#x27;t prickly at all in my opinion.  I&#x27;ve had no problem other than the brush doesn&#x27;t fit the stand I have (like the Colonel Conk), even at the base of the knot but I read about that anyway.  I have an improvised stand that I use to hang-dry the brush and I use the stand to stage my other brush leaning it against the prongs and the cap nut on top.  I rotate between the two-use one this day the next one the next day and back between the two again.  The only soap that I have used is the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap but I may try a different VDH version.  I see no need to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; as this set works well enough for me.  Hope this helps.  Happy Shaves.</li>
    <li> I have learned everything I purchase from you is as advertised. Great quality</li>
    <li> Very good deal for the price. Costs 3 times as much at department stores.</li>
    <li> This is an okay shaving set. I got mine at Wal-Mart ain 2008 I believe. The brush is pretty stiff. The soap is the best part, much better than Williams which is very dry. The bowl works but I picked up a real shaving mug at the Salvation Army with old soap still in it and a pack of late 1930&#x27;s Gillete blades for $1.50. I also got a genuine badger shaving brush with a brown/yellow/black bakelite? handle. The brush is much, much softer than this one and only cost $1. It smells bad so I am looking at getting a nice brush. Recently at an antique show where I live some folks were selling old brushes. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s good or not. I would but a new brush because you never know about sanitization. The brush here in this set has worked okay for the 2 or so years I&#x27;ve owned it. Not amazing but it works. 3 stars because you can pick up a decent small cup at any thrift store for shaving for less than a dollar, brush is mediocre, soap is really good and smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Brush leaves something to be desired but since its badger and not boar hair it is sufficient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used creams and gels, but now that I&#x27;ve tried shaving soap, nothing compares.  My face is no longer raw when I&#x27;m done and the soap leaves it moisturized when I&#x27;m done.  The kit is fine.  Looks good on my counter.    4stars because the hairs on the brush frequently come out and get stuck in the razor.    UPDATE: about 50% of the brush just fell out of the center. It looks like the glue gave or perhaps enough individual hairs came out so that it was not as tightly packed and reduced the strength. I don&#x27;t reduce the stars because the rest of the product is solid and for a cheap starter kit, the brush lasted quite well under daily use. I continue to convince cream and gel users to try soap and this is the starter kit I recommend.</li>
    <li> Got it on sale. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this anywhere in a store. The brush is great and cleans easily, the soap is a pretty neutral smell. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> The cup was broken. I bought a replacement at a dollar store. He will probably drop it and break it anyway. It&#x27;s a Christmas present so I do not  know if he will like it or not.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very little lather regardless of what type of brush you use.</li>
    <li> Found this soap at Walgreens and for $2.50 I couldn&#x27;t leave it on the shelf. It lathers up very nicely. The shea butter is a great moisturizer and eliminates a lot of the dry skin I&#x27;ve experienced after wet shaving. While I prefer shaving creams, this soap is my exception. I feel it is better than another, more expensive soap that I own. For excellent shaving creams, search Amazon for \\&quot;Taylor of Old Bond Street\\&quot; shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I started using this set about five months ago.  I really do like the soap and will continue to use it.  I have sensitive skin and a tough beard and this does a great job of softening the hair and lubricating the path of the razor.  It lathers easily and neither dries the face nor leaves a nasty film.  That is worth four stars.    The bowl is a bowl.  The soap fits it well enough and it&#x27;s deep enough not to spill but not so deep that it is awkward to make a lather with your brush.  I am not considering it in the number of stars for this review, though, as it is as good as any mug I had lying around that I would have otherwise used for this purpose and if you were to buy the soap and brush separately it would probably cost the same as this set.    The brush, though, is what brings my review for this set down to two stars.  It makes and applies lather well enough, and did it not fall apart then I&#x27;d probably consider it decent.  However, for the past five months it never stopped shedding hairs.  It was horrible at first, shedding like a cat, but even five months later it was shedding at least one hair per use.  Finally, a few days ago, the knot came out of the handle.  I certainly did not use it in a rough manner so I have to assume that it was shoddy construction.  What&#x27;s worse, looking into the part of the handle in which the knot sat I could see a number of flaws, holes and irregularities and whatnot, in the plastic that definitely imply poor manufacturing.    As a set, this isn&#x27;t very good and, while I do recommend the soap, I have to suggest that anyone in need to buy the soap and then pick up a different brush separately.  A person certainly doesn&#x27;t need an expensive badger hair brush just to prepare and apply the soap, but one that actually holds up is certainly preferable.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I wanted to try out shaving \\&quot;old school\\&quot; with a safety razor, brush, and soap. In this set you really get what you pay for. The best product in this set is the soap itself, as I have found that it does a good job of lathering up and not drying out my face. The bowl is just ok--it could be a bit larger. The brush, however, is where the biggest issue is. The bristles started falling out during the first time I shaved with it. It is annoying to find bristles on my face, in my bowl, or in my sink. It is obviously made very cheaply, so don&#x27;t expect some nice badger brush experience here. I have used it for about 2 months and I am now ready to upgrade my experience with a more high quality brush. When you buy this just keep your expectations reasonable so you aren&#x27;t disappointment.</li>
    <li> After poking around at prices, it seems like the bowl alone is worth the price (especially if you can get free shipping).    The brush is alright, the shaving soap seems pretty decent (I can get a decent lather with it and the smell is just fine), and I really like the bowl (even without a handle, it fits right into the palm of your hand).  If you&#x27;re looking to get into the world of wet shaving, this is a great place to begin.  If it&#x27;s for you, you can spend a bit more on a nicer brush and keep the bowl as, essentially, a free gift.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my husband, he loves it.</li>
    <li> Middle of the road kit. It&#x27;s not the greatest on the market but you can get a serviceable shave with this. For the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> As said by others, this set of brush, bowl, and soap will meet all shaving needs adequately. Are there better soaps out there? Undoubtedly. Brushes? I&#x27;m pretty sure. Bowls? I must take exception to my own question. No, a bowl is a bowl is a bowl. It holds a cake of soap, you hold it in your hand and don&#x27;t think too much about it. It&#x27;s perfectly sized to hold a standard shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap - nice fragrance, does not result in an allergic reaction when lathered on to the face, and spreads well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush - nice handle, the bristles hold their form (albeit, it has only been a week since I received this set). Unlike plastic bristles, which score the face, the soft bristles on this brush have a very gentle action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl - it&#x27;s green. It&#x27;s a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is the most attractive feature of this product. For this price, I would recommend this product to all and sundry. A good soap and brush are must-haves for those venturing in to the exciting world of straight and/or safety razor shaving.</li>
    <li> I used this as part of a shaving kit I put together for my groomsman gifts for my wedding. They all loved the kits and the price point was perfect to put it all together.</li>
    <li> An inexpensive set to see if you like using a brush &amp; shaving soap.  I will eventually dump this brush for a badger brush and will need to try different soaps as I am not happy with this one.</li>
    <li> HAir constantly still falling out...</li>
    <li> Bowl was cracked on arrival</li>
    <li> This was a gift,smaller than I thought but he loves it.</li>
    <li> This kit comes with everything you need to shave with except the actual razor. Its great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with straight razors and safety razors, and of course I used a brush and soap. I then went for speed and used the multiple blade outfits and canned foam. I just can&#x27;t justify the price of the latter method and recently went back to old school shaving. I bought the Van Der Hagen shave set at Wal-Mart for a fair price, but as with many things, you get what you pay for. The brush is stiff and loses hairs often. The cup lacks a handle and can easily slip when things get soapy. The soap itself works, but it is not a fine product. I am not a \\&quot;shave snob\\&quot; but I will be shopping Amazon for a better shave set, especially one with a softer brush.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal for the soap and bowl only. The brush is really umcomfortable to use and is the bottom of the barrel in terms of shaving brushes, buy and cheap badger or highier quality boar brush, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This is a good little kit to use if you are on a budget. I love the smell and feel of the soap. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the brush sheds a few hairs every time I use it. That may be normal for shave brushes, but it kinda bothers me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying I&#x27;m not a shaving snob and this is my first attempt at wet shaving with a DE razor.  I figured I would try this kit out to see what I think of going old school with a brush, bowl, and shave soap.  I have been using a Mach3 with Headslick as a shave cream on both my face and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush:  I didn&#x27;t realize going in that it would smell like a boar&#x27;s @$$ coming out of the box.  I almost pitched it after the first use due to the smell.  A quick google search about the smell of shave brushes showed that Boar brushes (and any animal based brushes) like this often stink when new.  I followed the advice of some random internet stranger who said to shampoo and condition it a few times to get rid of the smell.  That worked great and also made it feel a bit softer.  I would advise this if you are sensitive to smells as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl:  It&#x27;s a bowl.  It looks and feels solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap:  As I mentioned earlier, I&#x27;m a bit sensitive to smells.  I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of this soap.  Smell is very subjective obviously, so YMMV.  I did a side by side test of the lubrication it provided against my favorite shave cream, Headslick, and the Headslick killed it.  I pitched the soap after that and think I&#x27;m going to continue to use the bowl &amp; brush with the Headslick, as the brush helped lather it up much better than I&#x27;ve ever been able to do with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a terrible package for the price.  It&#x27;s a cheap way to see if you&#x27;re going to be into using this kind of equipment to shave.</li>
    <li> Wetshaving with a brush is a great way to improve your shaving routine. Whether you&#x27;re using a classic double edge razor or a disposable, adding the shave brush can give you a cleaner, closer shave and leave your skin feeling great. If you&#x27;re looking to improve your shaving routine, I highly recommend adding a shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to wetshaving or looking to try a shaving brush without having to clean out your wallet, the Van Der Hagen shave set is a great starting point. Not, this is not the best brush you can buy, but it probably is the best you can buy at this price level. I&#x27;ve found that this brush does take a bit more effort to work up a good lather, but it does help you practice and perfect your technique. And even though it&#x27;s not the best brush you can buy, it really does improve your shave. Once you get used to wet shaving and you want to improve your tools, then I&#x27;d suggest investing in a higher-quality brush and a nice shaving soap. But for those who want a good way to start, this is a great set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving fanatics can list dozens of reasons that this brush is not as good as their handmade silvertip badger brush, and they&#x27;re generally going to be right. This is not the best brush you can buy. But if you&#x27;re just looking to but a decent brush at a low price, this is a good option and a great way to get into the world of wet shaving.</li>
    <li> The brush sheds a bit at first. Not in clumps, though. Initially, several bristles fell out. The brush is quite thick though and losing a few won&#x27;t hurt. The problem does diminish after a few shaves. To get rid of the loose bristles I ran the brush under hot water and moved the bristles back and forth. That helped a lot. Now only one or two bristles comes out per shave and sometimes none. It doesn&#x27;t chafe my face like someone else mentioned. On its own, I give the brush three stars.     The bowl is okay if you like a bowl. I knew it didn&#x27;t have a handle when I bought it and it&#x27;s not fair to give it fewer stars for making my choice. However, as the soap lather spills over, it gets a bit slippery and loosens my grip. As someone else mentioned, I think I&#x27;ll switch to an ordinary mug lying around the kitchen.   **Edit: I tried a mug but it&#x27;s too tall and interferes with the back and forth action of the brush while attempting to make a good lather. It still possible but annoying. I immediately went back to using the bowl but I am looking around for a short mug with a wider brim than its base. They have them here on Amazon but if I can find one at a garage sale all the better.    I read more than one review that claimed the soap did not lather. It makes an extremely nice lather and has a pleasant fragrance without being overly scented. When I lather up the soap, I put hot water on the brush and shake off the excess. I use vigorous back and forth strokes kind of like making whipped cream (and it looks like it, too) but I don&#x27;t have to work as hard. For me, the soap is the star of this kit. It lubricates extremely well and I get almost no friction from my shaver. It&#x27;s better than any gel or foam I&#x27;ve every used. By the way, my shaver is a Gillette Power Fusion.</li>
    <li> Generally a pretty good product... nice bowl to use roomy enough but not so large that so soap slides around... good soap... if your staying at a decent price this does the job.</li>
    <li> Just received my kit and used it for the first time with my new safety razor. This is a fine quality set that works plenty well. I suppose if you could convince someone to buy you a fancy expensive brush, go for it; the brush in this kit is of good quality. Experiment with soaps if you like and seriously a bowl is a bowl. For the \\&quot;everyman\\&quot; this is a fine quality set. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need(except a stand for the brush) to start wet shaving. I started shaving my head a year ago and shave every two days. I used foam shaving cream and had problems with razor burn on the back of my neck. There is also a lot of waste with shaving cream. I looked around for a shaving brush and of course Amazon had what I needed. This is great for starting out and the soap will last a long time. The brush needs to hang  down to dry properly so buy a stand. You can lay it on it&#x27;s side to dry but hanging down is better. The soap lathers nicely but you will need a cup to put the soap in and make lather in the bowl. There are other methods such as building lather in your hand or on your face. I use the bowl to make lather and it works well. No more bumps or rash and the soap smells great. It contains moisturizers and my skin is much softer.</li>
    <li> Great kit for starters.</li>
    <li> Third set I bought.  One for me, one for my two sons. We all love it.</li>
    <li> Well this is my first brush set and I&#x27;m still using it after several years. The main problem with this set is the brush. The hairs slowly come out and and can be somewhat annoying to have a long hair on your face when shaving and applying your lather. Otherwise, the soap works alright and you can&#x27;t really mess up the bowl. Anyone needing something to start with, don&#x27;t even think twice about this set, go ahead and pick one up and give it a try. I actually enjoy using the brush instead of my hands to put shaving cream or gel all over my face. It&#x27;s less messy too.</li>
    <li> Used it today and was very pleased. Very soft brush and soap lathered well and very easy to use. Got a smooth shave with no burn.</li>
    <li> This has to be a must buy for any man who shaves.  Bought it with my first Safety Razor (Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L) I plan on upgrading it.   But for someone who has crazy sensitive skin and just stopped shaving for a while this is a great investment.   I have to agree with Alex Nennig on how people look down on stuff because you can buy it at Walmart (plus it&#x27;s cheaper there) or because it&#x27;s not expensive. Some of the best things in life are cheap so enjoy them.  In time you will no matter what have to replace the brush and bowl and soap so this is a great buy.  And I love the SOAP smells nice and doesn&#x27;t bother my face at all.</li>
    <li> Using soap and a brush rather than aerosol shaving cream is a great idea, but this is not a great brush.  The bristles are very coarse, but you can live with that, and they are constantly appearing on your face, which is not easy to live with.  Lately the brush has lost bristles in clumps and I am concerned that it will lose most of its bristles with time.  I will switch to a badger hair brush soon.  I recommend drying any shaving brush with the bristles/hair hanging down, to avoid water retention that lead to bristle loss.</li>
    <li> Good for grandpa or dear Old dad,,, brings them back to there early days</li>
    <li> Really gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The package is a good value. Sure the brush lose some bristles while in use and the soap lather be could be richer, but I got what I paid for, A decent product at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I returned to this style of shaving after 40 years of fighting with electric razors and disposables.  This kit along with Williams pucks and a Merkur safety razor has been fantastic.  The set is a great buy and the brush and bowl serve their purpose well.  A little olive oil on my damp face pre and aloe post shave and the whole process takes no longer than an electric shave.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> Purchased one years ago at Walmart, I gave it to my brother, who seemed to like it.  This is a great starter kit, more so if you know you going to wet shave only once or twice a month, which is what I plan on doing. Will be purchasing another set on Amazon soon.</li>
    <li> The reviews that I read of this set was that it was a good beginners (which I am) who needed an easy intro to wet shaving. While this may be true, there are some things other beginners should know before purchasing:     1. The Brush: I expected it to be less than stellar, but I feel like I&#x27;m scrubbing my face with a wet broom, or a big tooth brush. It&#x27;s bristles also started coming off right as I opened the packaging. However, it worked really well for the technique I used for lathering (see below).    2. The Soap: I initially had trouble getting a good lather from this bowl because I was trying to get the tips of the brush soapy, and then lather into a hot bowl. However, I got much better results by soaking the puck in a coffee mug with the brush for in hot water for a few minutes, pouring out the water, and then lathering directly on the soap in the mug (for a demonstration of this, check out sombercoyote&#x27;s video on Williams Soap lathering on YouTube--it&#x27;s exactly what I did). With this technique, the boar hair bristles are pretty effective so I may not pitch it quite yet.    3. The Bowl: The bowl is actually pretty nice, though it may be too shallow for the lathering method I used. It may work for others, but I think my bowl will just be used to hold my razor and brush for now.    In short, if you&#x27;re looking to start DE or straight razor shaving, this is an okay set. However, there is the [[ASIN:B004VW59DG Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set, **BONUS**, set includes TWO full size 3.5oz scented soaps]] which seems more legit. It&#x27;s gotten better (albeit fewer) reviews than this one. It also comes with a stand that holds your razor and brush, which is neat. It also has a mug that seems a little deeper than this bowl, which would be ideal for me. But it&#x27;s also almost quadruple the price. The set I&#x27;m reviewing is good for practice, but I&#x27;ll be upgrading as soon as I can&#x27;t stand it any longer (starting with the brush!).    One last note: now that I&#x27;ve started to figure this set out, I wish I had simply found the components separately. Instead of buying another kit, I may just buy better components separately one at a time, especially since the mug that I&#x27;m using was essentially free. This would be much easier than dealing with the disappointment of a cheap kit like this one ;-)    Good luck!</li>
    <li> The brush lasted for about a year before it fell apart. The bowl and soap are great. I have actually bought more of the soap since my original purchase.</li>
    <li> Man for 12 bucks you get all this, it works great just started using de shaving stuff and I have the smoothest face, I got this the Lord DE razor and the shark razors, I have a super tough beard and this is great.  Buy it now.</li>
    <li> I know what you are thinking, I am considering wet shaving, how they use to when men were men, and I want to know if this is worth getting, when there are so many more options and they all cost more.  Well, I suggest this one to you.  This is great for starting because, if it is just a phase, you spent less than twenty bucks.  No worries.  If you are hooked, as I am, you are still getting a cool little set that gets the job done.  What you will find:   1. A pleasant, very light scented soap, containing glycerin which is good for most skin types. It builds up a good lather, which is very important for a good, safe shave.  2. A cool green bowl which is designed to hold this soap perfectly for building that lather that you need.  It does lack a handle, so be cautious with your soapy hands, boy.  3. A boar brush, which will be used to develop your lather and will get it under your stubble to help give you that excellent shave. The important thing is to dry this brush correctly.  You must wash it out with warm or cold water.  Then, let it sit on its side or upside down (buy a brush holder also available on Amazon}.  If you choose to rest it on its handle, it will be more apt to hold water causing hairs to shed more rapidly. The complaint of hairs falling out is true but, if you take care of it correctly, it is fairly minimal after the first couple shaves.  Update:  It has been six months sinced I purchased this set.  It still works well.  I have replaced the soap only once.  The brush lost several hairs in the beginning, stopped then, it started acting up again last month but, only momentary.  All in all, it has more than enough to last for a few years. Now I am getting such close shaves that my wife is impressed.</li>
    <li> The bowl works like a bowl. The soap works like shave soap. The brush...well it seemed to leave a lot of hair on my face when that&#x27;s what I was trying to get rid of. A lot of the bristles fell out my first time shaving. Other than that I can&#x27;t complain. I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Husband says he will never use shave gel again. He as always had a problem with the gel getting clumped up in the razor and hard to shake out and this soap just wisks right away with water on the razor. Just a note, this soap product does contain Sodium Laurel Sulfate for those concerned with this chemical. There are probably higher end soaps disks out there to use that have organic and natural ingredients but for the price, it was a great introduction to using a brush and soap. Recommend for people who are just starting out with shave soaps, or for those not concerned with SLS.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other reviews, the brush is worthless. Mine lasted about three months. But even so, I think this is so cheap it might be an option for someone switching to this type of shaving. If you are absolutely sure this is what you want, get a better brush. I have enjoyed the switch so I can not be too critical of this  as an entry level product</li>
    <li> Like alot of other reviews have said, just because hardcore wet shaving advocates say you need an expensive brush and soap to get a great shave, ignore them. It is all a matter of opinion and comfort for each person. I for one have very sensitive skin that dries easily and the soap in this package works for me fantastically! The brush is nothing special with its plastic handle but is does its job very well. At first maybe 5 hairs on the brush fell out but after using it twice it was done \\&quot;shedding\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for about 3 months and the bursh has fallen apart.  I picked this kit up to replace an older brush I had.  The older brush lasted for about 5 years.  I suppose the money is worth the bowl and soap itself, but I would suggest buying a better brush.</li>
    <li> This is admittedly the only brush and soap I&#x27;ve used as of yet so I am only really comparing to canned gels and creams, but this is leaps and bounds better than any canned product I&#x27;ve tried.  The brush feels softer on the face than I thought it would from the picture and it seems like the soap may last forever.  As others have said, the bowl is a bowl.  I am very new to wet shaving and I haven&#x27;t had any problem getting a nice lather with this soap and brush.  Soak brush, shake dry, some circles on the soap to pick some up, then whip in the bowl with a few drops of water.  I&#x27;m sure there are nicer soaps, and I look forward to trying them, but I like the scent and the lather of this one for now.  Of course there are better (more expensive) products out there but I have to give this 5 stars as it might be the best ten bucks I&#x27;ve spent on amazon.</li>
    <li> well the soap and bowl are execlant. but the brush isnt the best, its not very easy to build a decent lather with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;good for a beginner to learn the basics, the soap has a plesent scent to it.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money. I like the scent, and it lathers very good.</li>
    <li> After reading recommendations on the internet about shaving styles, I decided to give safety razor shaving a try. Not knowing anything about what&#x27;s involved, it was tough to make a decision about a brush and soap, since, depending on the brand, they can run upwards of $10 each. It may not seem like much, but when I&#x27;m already investing in a razor that&#x27;s more expensive than I&#x27;m used to, that adds up. This is a great starter kit, and is giving me a chance to learn the basics without making too much of an investment.  While I will admit that I&#x27;m not thrilled about the brush&#x27;s plastic handle, it serves its purpose, and is exactly what I was expecting for what I paid.</li>
    <li> The brush sheds a little at first and I don&#x27;t know how the soap compares as I haven&#x27;t used anything else besides canned gels and foams in the past but I get a nice shave and my skin is not left dry at all.  I do have a tendency toward dry rather than oily skin so that is a plus that it does not dry.  If you want functional and don&#x27;t care about plain Jane style then this is for youl.</li>
    <li> This certainly gets the job done for me while I learn the ins and outs of using a brush and safety razor. Definitely not a bad deal for someone like me who shaves for work and wants it very close while staying on a tight college student budget. Pick this up with a decent Lord razor, maybe another kind of soap if you want and a good aftershave and you&#x27;re set to go!</li>
    <li> Everyone should own this kit or a similar one. Shaving any other way is complete barbarism. That being said the brush i. This kit has a tendancy to shed a few bristles into your beard while you lather up, no a very big problem, but a little annoying.</li>
    <li> Not a bad set. I didn&#x27;t use the soap that came with it (yet), instead I purchased Col. Conk Lime soap.  The bowl is slightly on the smaller side, so I have to be a bit more careful with making the lather or it&#x27;ll spill over the side.  The brush is okay. As expected, it&#x27;s from real boars, so it stinks until you get some soap into it.      Did my first wet shave with a Parker 99R and the Shark blade. Nicked myself like crazy, but I have to admit it did leave me closer than my twin cartridge ever did, and aside from the small nicks, I didn&#x27;t have any red irritation/razor burn.    All in all, a good set if you&#x27;re getting into wet shaving and you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money getting started.      I definitely recommend you buy an alum block/styptic pen if you are new to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Heya!  Bought this in a \\&quot;brick-and-mortar\\&quot; store for my son and he loved it! The items included in the kit include a soap disc that is fragrant without being overpowering, a cute little green and blue ceramic (not plastic!) soap bowl and a decent starter brush for lathering the face.   Definitely worth the money; and heck, if your S.O doesn&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;ve got a cool dish, soap and brush!</li>
    <li> My first shave kit I also bought the Parker Shavette with Shark blades. For those make sure to get a good amount on your brush and I use a separate SS bowl (pet food kind) and slap the brush side to side up and down and swirl right then left. That&#x27;s a lil hint for you beginners not getting a rich lather. If you are getting thin lather then try my way the slapping really fluffs it well and swirl to thicken it. I usually get enough to do a 3-PASS shave.</li>
    <li> For the money...this is a good shave set. The brush has very stiff bristles which is good. The soap is not too harsh and the cup is attractive.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side i will say is that because the cup is ceramic it will easily break if you drop it.  Since it can get slippery during use...it&#x27;s  a good likelihood that you will.  That&#x27;s why the wooded cups are so much better.</li>
    <li> This entire package is just great.&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush and shaving soap. The bowl works perfectly. I put some hot water in the sink and set the bowl in the hot water for a few minutes and it softens and warms the soap and the brush really lathers up well and is very soft on my face.</li>
    <li> great product smells nice, price is right.</li>
    <li> After getting tired of paying tons of money for triple-blade razors every month, I decided to try doing it the old-fashioned way. I bought a [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany]] and this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit itself is not bad for the price. The ceramic bowl, while not stylish, does the job just fine. The soap is a bit thin. It doesn&#x27;t lather terribly well, and tends to evaporate off the skin rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only give the kit three stars because of the brush. The bristles are comfortable and do a good job, but the cheap plastic handle is... well, cheap. After using this setup for a couple months, the base of the bristles snapped off from the handle this morning. It&#x27;s just a plastic base for the bristles glued onto the plastic handle; the glue apparently became brittle and broke under normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a cheap introduction to shaving, this is a decent start. I&#x27;m going to invest in a nicer brush though (and better soap once this runs out).</li>
    <li> Great starter set! Soap smells nice!</li>
    <li> super deal nice size and the soap is nice I use it as a pre shave as well with a hot towel</li>
    <li> As you can see in the picture, this kit has 3 parts:  - The soap  - The bowl  - The brush    The soap:  This is a cheap soap that gives you an excellent lather. The scent is very mild and (in my opinion) is very nice. If you use correctly, it can last for 2 months and a nice thing about it is that since it&#x27;s a glycerin soap, you can melt it in the bowl (or another bowl) or even mix it with another soap or anything you can think of to change its scent.. but the important thing is the lather, I already said it is an excellent lather and It never fails to give a comfortable and smooth shave.    The bowl:  It&#x27;s made of ceramic, dark navy blue in the outside and green in the inside. Slightly bigger than the soap (In diameter) and about 1 inch taller than it. It easily fits in your hand and is really cute (My sister told me \\&quot;awwww I want it\\&quot; of course I said no) I melted the soap inside this little bowl in the microwave and it didn&#x27;t suffered any damage. 8 secs and 8 secs in \\&quot;hi\\&quot; sill do it.    The Brush:  Well, this is a boar brush. It is stiff by default but it softens with the use, The smell is a bit weird at first but what I did was to wash it with shampoo and let it rest for one day. It didn&#x27;t soften it but when I shaved for the first time with it the smell was almost gone. Being a boar brush, it holds less water but it grabs more soap (IMHO) so you don&#x27;t need to swirl too much. Also if you need water just soak the tip of the brush in water and continue swirling.    The brush is stiff only at the very beginning of the process, I feel it gentle on my face when building lather directly on it and also I feel it gentle when applying lather from the bowl to my face.   Last but not least, the handle. You&#x27;ll see people complaining about it being cheap plastic, well is not. It is solid and not slippery, I find it trusty and I&#x27;m not afraid to drop it. Not that I will do it but I feel there is no danger.   All in all a trusty brush.    As someone said, don&#x27;t be a snob. This set is trusty and nice. The price is awesome. 5 stars without a doubt.</li>
    <li> great, just as I wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old and I bought this as a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; for wet-shaving. All-in-all, I was fairly pleased with the product, but it does have its caveats. The brush, for instance, is of a good quality, but it does lose a few hairs with every lather (I don&#x27;t know whether this is true for all shaving brushes, however). The bowl is, well, just a simple bowl - no real complaints there. The shaving soap seems to be a good quality as well. My only major beef with the product, having been using it every day for about a month now, is the difficulty with which a good lather is created. I&#x27;ve yet to discover if it is the soap, the brush, or a combination of both - whatever it is, you need to be a patient man to work up a good, thick lather. It could be my lack of technique, but after all the tutorial videos and articles I&#x27;ve consulted about it - I think not. Whatever the case may be, I think it&#x27;s an excellent starter kit and it definitely met my expectations (for the price). I would definitely recommend it to a friend getting started in wet-shaving.</li>
    <li> Just now, when I was using this kit for only the second time, the bowl slipped out of my hands, off the counter, and onto the floor, shattering into several pieces. Users of this product need to be especially careful when their hands are wet. It makes me wish the designers had thought to include a handle on the bowl or even made the bowl out of plastic. True, plastic is less elegant or classy than porcelain, but it is also less breakable. A less expensive plastic bowl might also allow the designers to include a lid for the bowl which might be useful when packing the damp soap and the kit for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, using a brush to apply the shaving soap or foam is much less messy than applying it by hand, which is what I was doing before I bought the brush, but the soap doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up as much as I would have liked. In sum, the product is OK but not great, a less pricey alternative to some of its more expensive competitors.</li>
    <li> Great set, especially for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one if needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shave set off of Amazon, because I could not find a set in my local stores.  After purchasing and receiving this set in the mail, I ran across the same set at a local drug store for less than what I paid.  Am I upset? Absolutly not! The brush is great, I recently purchased a Badger brush online so I can see what the difference is.  Once you receive your set, wash the brush with soap and warm water, this step is very important!  The more you use the brush, the better it works. As for the soap and bowl, very nice, but I found that I prefer shaving cream over face soap, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as much. There are also videos on Youtube to help explain the art of Safety razor shaving...check it out!</li>
    <li> Good sized ceramic bowl</li>
    <li> If you are new to wet shaving like myself, and want to get started quickly with a kit that includes nearly everything, I highly recommend this product, the soap included is good for getting the job done, it has a more flowery fragrance than I prefer, but if that&#x27;s what you like you can&#x27;t go wrong. The brush is your standard fare boar bristle, which can be slightly stiff upon arrival, just follow the pre-shave instructions on the side of the box,for extra softness, I recommend soaking the brush in very hot water for about 5-10 minutes just to soften the bristles a bit more.  pro tip: if you don&#x27;t want the soap to move around too much while working up a lather, try melting it into the bowl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a brush for nearly 40 years.  I know how to use and care for them.  This looked like a nice set and a very reasonable price.  It can be also be purchased at Wal-Mart and Fred Meyer&#x27;s.  I purchased several for my sons and a new set for me.  After one week&#x27;s usage, the center bristles started to come out.  Not just a few as one might expect from a new brush, but the whole center fell apart over just a few days.  I thought it was a fluke and purchased another.  It did the same thing and my sons have had the same experience (except they didn&#x27;t try another one).  It appears the center of the brush was cut too short to be held by the handle.  I added a photo that shows the problem. I have been using a different brush I ordered  from Amazon - it is working well so far.  When I have used for over a month, I will update this review and write a review on the new brush.</li>
    <li> This is an ok set for someone starting to use a safety razor. The soap and bowl are nice. The brush, however, leaves something to be desired. It is boar bristle and you can expected to loose 2-3 bristles per shave.</li>
    <li> Good price for a starter kit.</li>
    <li> For the price it isn&#x27;t bad at all.  The brush worked fine for the first 6 months or so but little by little it would lose bristles here and there.  At some point they just start coming off in clumps and now I&#x27;m investing in a Silver-tip badger brush.  It&#x27;s true that if you buy cheap products you end up spending more money.    The bowl is really nice and the soap was fine as well, but again, if you&#x27;re looking for a brush, just spend 50 -70 bucks one time rather than 10 bucks every 7 or 8 months.  Just my two cents worth.  I give it 3 stars based on the fact that it&#x27;s really cheap, c&#x27;mon what do you expect?</li>
    <li> Hubby really likes this. Says the soap must have a good amount of lanolin in it. Leaves his face feeling moisturized</li>
    <li> As has been mentioned, the brush sheds like a dog, but it&#x27;s a very good way to wade into better shaving practices. This, a good safety razor, and perhaps a good look at The Art of Manliness&#x27;s article on the merits of the \\&quot;cold shave\\&quot; are excellent ways to start reducing cost and garbage, increasing comfort, and getting an overall better shave.</li>
    <li> Great soap for shaving</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the VDH Shave Set for years (yes...the same brush and bowl). My kit has survived flights, cruises, road trips, toddlers, curious teen age brothers, 3 ex&#x27;s, and 3 moves. This kit has been on more vacations than Chevy Chase and seen more Face Time than an iPhone. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased a second kit a few months after my initial purchase because my local W-Mart didn&#x27;t have have any soap cake refills in stock and I thought it would be a great idea to have a kit just to take on Vacation or leave in my gym bag. I also use shave creams as well([[ASIN:B0006O2K1C Geo F. Trumper Violet Soft Shaving Cream 200g cream]])([[ASIN:B002QFZ1QK Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream]])([[ASIN:B0031OXOBE Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream]]) but shave soaps are so much easier to take on vacation or to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the GED graduate of shaves sets (General Education Diploma aka the \\&quot;Good Enough Diploma\\&quot;). It&#x27;s not that $300 chromed shave set, but in the neighborhood of $10.00 it&#x27;s definitely good enough. In the right hands this kit will give you a great shave. Are there better sets on the market? Probably. Are they going to improve YOUR shaving experience to the nTH degree...probably not. Are they marketed at this price. No. Save your money and spend it on a decent razor and blades. Once you have that down...then you can experiment with pricier sets if YOU want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own several brushes that I&#x27;ve collected over the years because I&#x27;m just that kind of a person. The VDH set is my work horse and I now rotate brushes for the sake of rotating brushes. Some brushes are softer...others more coarse. Some brushes are not PETA friendly, some are.  In the end, the brushes I own all give me a great lather and serve their purpose. The VDH brush is no exception. Decent brush, great price and it comes with a bowl and a soap cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to break out horribly after shaving using the mass marketed stuff with rash and irritation. I then discovered wet shaving with a dual edge safety blade([[ASIN:B002CLDUZM Merkur Heavy Duty Razor with Slant Bar #198 3\\&quot;]]) and WOW what a difference. If you are able to use the Mach-50 or whatever they call them these days more power to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back when I first started shaving I&#x27;d use the same razor cartridge for the entire school year...rust deposits and all. I also used to feel light headed after half of a bottle of beer. Sadly those days are gone and my beard would now give a cheese grater a run for its money.  Canned shaving cream also seemed to fall short and made the whole shaving experience a royal pain in the patella as it became more drying and irritating to my skin as my beard matured. Again . . . if you can get away with the canned stuff count yourself very fortunate. In my late teens a can of shaving cream would last me a whole year. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each his own as far as his methods are concerned. I will share mine, but I think everone&#x27;s skin/hair is different. Here&#x27;s what I think of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush:&lt;br /&gt;My VDH brushes look nothing like the exploded cigar sunflower thing in one of the pictures above. Hmmm...(stroking imaginary chin hair...you know...because this is a review about a shave set). I can&#x27;t speak for VDH&#x27;s quality control BUT I do own 2 separate sets purchased from 2 different stores in 2 different counties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gifted a few of these to young men in my family new to shaving and it gives me great pleasure to see these kits on their sinks when I stop by for a visit. Maybe I&#x27;m just really lucky...even though I play the lottery weekly and never win anything.  I would think that if a brush fell apart within a few weeks that I would be able to return/exchange the product quite easily due to a manufacturer defect, but some people aren&#x27;t into returning things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and don&#x27;t know how to use and care for a shave brush then google is a great resource. Basically don&#x27;t be a mongoloid and it should give you many years of great use (barring any manufacturer defects that I have yet to experience on my end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you use it? Wash your face first! Do you really want to scrape a piece of metal across a dirty, oily layer of skin? The handle of the brush fits in your palm and your fingers should grip the sides of the bristles near the base of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to crush the bristles in an attempt to create a lather. After you&#x27;re done shaving gently wipe the sides of the brush on a towel to remove any water from the surface. Place the brush on a shaving brush stand ([[ASIN:B0006O4NRQ Muehle Tortoise Shaving Brush Holder]]) and allow it to dry properly in an open location (not in the medicine cabinet). The stand does not need to be super expensive. I own one similar to the link I provided that I found on ebay for a few dollars shipped. You do need a stand. Placing the brush on its handle will definitely ruin the bristles in a hurry as the moisture won&#x27;t have anywhere to go but into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced the loss of a stray bristle here and there and chalked it up to wear and tear. Do I scream \\&quot;shenanigans!\\&quot; when I need new tires on my car after 60,000 miles despite good upkeep, frequent alignments, and regular tire rotating and balancing? Negative. At this price I don&#x27;t see why anyone would complain about replacing a brush after a few years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wet the brush and use it to moisten my face. I then wet the brush again and work up a lather on the brush using the soap in the bowl. This action allows for exfoliation and helps lifts the hair away from your face prior to shaving.  I then apply the lather for a minimum of 2 shaving passes. More often 3. When I have a date night planned I go the extra mile with a 4th pass. Yes. This means shaving multiple times in different directions. More passes paired with poor technique will leave you with nicks, cuts, and possible razor burn/rash. Use caution. If you do cut yourself it is wise to invest in a Styptic Pencil([[ASIN:B000YM76VU Pinaud Clubman styptic pencil for nick relief - 0.25 oz, 2 pack]]). They can be found for under $2.00 at your local W-Mart. They stop bleeding fast, disinfect and don&#x27;t take up much room. They work wonders! They&#x27;re advertised as sting-free. But this should be read as \\&quot;stings for free.\\&quot;  Nevertheless...the thing works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in a certain order. Top to bottom. Back to front. Front to back. Bottom to top. Shaving against the grain is the most irritating step if you&#x27;re not careful or if your skin just isn&#x27;t ready for it. If your skin is already irritated don&#x27;t irritate it further by shaving against the grain right away. Wait until the irritiation goes down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up with a toner based bump preventer ([[ASIN:B000S92OCK B&amp;C Skin Tight Product for Razor Bumps &amp; Ingrown Hairs-Extra Strength(12 oz)]] - can be found at W-Mart for fairly decent price) on a cotton pad if you&#x27;re prone to razor bumps and then after shave if you&#x27;d like ([[ASIN:B002PIPIHK Shea Moisture, Tea Tree Herbal Bump Preventer After Shave Elixir 4 oz Nubian Heritage]]). Lastly apply a shaving lotion ([[ASIN:B007OCA3UE Shea Moisture Shave Anti-aging Moistuizer &amp; Bump Preventer 2fl Oz]]). If you stick with a routine your skin will be clear, your face soft, and your woman happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option to after shave is to use an alum block after you&#x27;re done shaving (I used one when I first started wet shaving and go back to it from time to time if I experience any skin irritation or acne). Simply rinse your face with cool water. Wet the alum block with cool water. Rub the alum block on your face. Air dry. This does a few things. Disinfects, stops any bleeding, and dries to form a protective layer on your face for those of us prone to break outs or irritation post shave. Air drying keeps any lint, dust, or bacteria present on our less than fresh face towel off of ourface. If your too heavy on an application, just rub it off with clean hands and apply a thinner coat next time around. The alum block&#x27;s mild sting doubles as a critique of any flaws in your shaving technique or a dull blade that needs to be changed. Here is a link to the product available on Amazon: [[ASIN:B004QVCIKE Alum Block by Osma - 2 Pack Value]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bowl:&lt;br /&gt;Ummm. Yeh. CHECK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness the bowl fits pretty nice in the palm of your hand while you&#x27;re lathering up. It&#x27;s easy to clean. It&#x27;s round. I&#x27;ve never eaten from it. Great job on the bowl VDH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap:&lt;br /&gt;The soap is of pretty decent quality and if it causes you irritation then it&#x27;s simply not for you. I have very sensitive skin and this shave soap has never really caused me any grief. There is a learning curve to wet shaving so be careful not to blame a poor technique and routine on a good product. VDH soap has a pleasant fragrance to it and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It is my opinion that its fragrance is mild enough that it will not clash with an after shave.  I usually use an aftershave, and it&#x27;s the only thing I can smell after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using quality products like this make shaving a little more enjoyable. If I had another face I&#x27;d be in for 2 more sets!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave with the Merkur Slant Razor that uses safety dual edge blades, for those that are curious. The other products I&#x27;ve listed in my review have all worked well for my skin although I have used others depending on sales and availability of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for this kit, its price range and for its quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this set a while ago at my local supermarket for about $11, and now I see it at other chains and Walmart for about $9.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this is the soap which you can get for $2 or less retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is good. I have yet to try other soaps/creams but it is leaps and bounds better than all the Gillette gels I used to use  like Mach, Fusion, etc. To get the benefit you need to spend at least a full minute working the lather compared to the 5 seconds it takes to put a canned gel. Don&#x27;t use too much water, just soak the brush, shake off the excess water, work the tips gently against the soap and when it starts to lather, move the action to your face. It is time well spent. My face feels better and the final judge, my wife, commented that my skin looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is poorly made. It sheds bristles all over the place at first and less after 4 shaves. I don&#x27;t care much for the boar bristles and I find that the handle shape makes it uncomfortable to hold. I got a basic badger hair brush for less than the price of this set (tweezerman brand) and it is simply better on all accounts: it creates better lather, it feels nicer against my face and it is easier to hold. I threw out the original brush to the trash without looking twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leaves the bowl: it fits the soap cake nicely and because of the curvature the soap will stay put as it runs out. It looks nice.</li>
    <li> Decided to try shaving with a DE razor after deciding the Mach 3 blades were simply not cost effective nor did they give a particularly good shave. Purchased the Retrorazor and the the VDH set from Amazon and began my quest for a good shave at a fair price.  Must say that the VDH set is a pretty good deal, all things considered. The soap has a pleasant aroma and makes decent lather with the brush. In fact the lather is far superior IMHO to anything that you will get in a can or tube from the corner drugstore or super market. The bowl is easy to hold and has a nice weight. The brush does a good job of applying the lather and it didn&#x27;t loose too many bristles when I washed it prior to my initial use,  For the money you will be hard pressed to find a better set.</li>
    <li> Mu husband decided to switch to the old fashioned art of shaving so I bought him this and it was perfect. What a great value. I still cannot believe how cheap it was for all that you get.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shave set.  I love the soap so much I bought another 4 bars so I will never run out.  Its a boar brush and while not as soft as my low end badger I find its fine and great as a travel brush.  In some ways a boar brush is better for soap. It picks it up better. Its bigger than my badger and I like that.  Bowl is a good size, holds the soap (I don&#x27;t bother melting it or anything ... some guys have too much time on their hands.).  The soap is fantastic.  The lather is slippery.  It smells nice and clean and doesn&#x27;t stick or leave a residue on the razor. As long as VDH can keep a handle on their pricing, at $2.00 a bar they will have me for life. In short a great set, I recommend it and will be buying some more for my friends.</li>
    <li> This set was good enough for someone learning the pleasure of safety razor shaving.  Seven months later, I&#x27;ve learned there are better ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush in this set works, but constantly drops bristles and doesn&#x27;t fit on a normal brush stand (handle is too thick).  I&#x27;m told that quality (boar) brushes don&#x27;t drop bristles and create a better lather, so I&#x27;ll be ordering one of those soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl has no handle, so it becomes very difficult to hold when you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower and there&#x27;s soap involved.  It slipped from my hand once, just a few inches into the sink.  Now it&#x27;s chipped and has a big crack down the side.  I replaced it with a $1 coffee mug from the thrift store.  That mug has a handle and is much easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap was nice to use.  It smells great and made a pleasant lather.  I did run out of the soap very quickly (possibly due to a lack of experience with the safety razor/shave soap process). I replaced with with a well reviewed puck of shave soap that has lasted months so far with plenty more to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing this shave set buys you a puck of soap that&#x27;ll be gone soon, a bowl that you&#x27;ll drop and break, and a good enough brush.  I&#x27;d suggest shopping around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a nicer boar brush (some sell for exactly what this kit does), a two dollar puck of shave soap, and grab the old worn out coffee mug you never drink out of.  You&#x27;ll wind up with a better setup than this kit.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, I m enjoying it</li>
    <li> I was worried at first buying this because I was worried price &#x3D; quality. I was wrong. It great quality. I would definitely suggest this to someone wanting to give this a try. Good soap, nice dish, and the brush works great.</li>
    <li> this I felt was a very good buy for the money. a ceramic bowl, a boar brush, and a puck of glycerin soap.The brush handle is a cheaper plastic but I have a boar brush from another vdh set and performs ok.I love the scented soaps they have and are priced cheaply I feel at wal-mart and other outlets.I have several vdh pucks and like them all.The small bowl is just the right size for my hand also, so as I said before for the money 9.00 +sh is  good deal,</li>
    <li> The fact that this kit contains a bowl, a brush, and soap makes it a great deal for people not yet skilled enough in the art of shaving, but who want to learn. There are better bowls, better brushes, and better soaps out there, to be sure - but all of them are more expensive and need to be bought separately.    The brush looks as though it is made of cheap plastic in the images, but it has a nice heft to it, and weighs sufficiently more than it looks like it would. The bowl is ceramic and painted in an appealing mix of blue and green, though slightly brighter than in the images. The bowl is also sufficiently deep - something I had been (unnecessarily) worried about due to the description. Finally, the soap creates a good lather that is more than decent for shaving, and it is enclosed in a small plastic container, so no worries about finding a mess when you open the box.    This is a good deal for the average person who wants to learn the basics of wet shaving - for whatever reason (for me it was the price of replacement razor heads, for others it might be different) - but has no shaving bowl, brush, or soap passed down by a father or uncle or such.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find out that you sold shaving bowls as they are hard to find in the retail business. However, my husband misses a handle on the shaving bowl. He is used to having one.  Other that that the set is fine.</li>
    <li> Love it just like my first shave 45 years ago.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s the perfect introduction into wet-shaving. The bowl is great and fits in your hand nicely. It&#x27;s ceramic so you don&#x27;t have any problems with water (why wooden bowls?). The soap smells very good and lathers well. The brush is perfectly good - I&#x27;m not a shaving snob, so this brush does the trick fine. I&#x27;d highly suggest this combo and may get another one myself.</li>
    <li> Bristles are very scratchy, and soap dries out my boyfriends skin, he still uses both. I believe this would be a good starter set to really see if it&#x27;s something you want to commit too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. This is a great starter kit for the price. If you know anyone that wants to try this method of shaving, this is a good way to do it without making a large investment. The bowl in our kit was ceramic (it seems some people had plastic), which is very nicely weighted and a great size for the soap.     The brush is not a long lasting one, but will work fine for a few months if you are just looking to try this out. The one thing to take notice of is that although the brush has a base for sitting it on the counter with the bristles up, that is not the right way to dry it if you want to keep it in good shape. It is best hung upside down, so if you purchase this kit, I would also recommend a small stand to hang the brush with the bristles down.     After purchasing this kit, I also bought him a straight razor for a real old fashioned shave, but we haven&#x27;t tried that razor with this soap yet, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works with a straight razor vs a traditional razor. His face does seem to be nice and smooth and less irritated since switching from the shave gels and creams to this.     Another bonus of shaving with soap is that shave creams and gels in particular tend to clog up the drains in our house, and I hate having to pour chemicals to clear them or remove them to clean all the build up out. Shaving with soap makes drain maintenance much easier.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t get the concept.  My face is irritated by regular shaving and I thought the soap might be better.  It just didn&#x27;t lather equivalently to shaving cream and felt like I was almost dry shaving.  The kit is nice.</li>
    <li> It works! The brush does the job and the soap is OK for beginners; for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Brush is pure junk..I have had two of them and both lost bristles at a huge rate. Every time I shaved there were bristles stuck to my face. Then they started coming out in big clumps. I finally decided to get a better quality brush.</li>
    <li> I had missing items received in my shave set and I was sent a replacement but I was charged twice after sending them an email about it too. I wasn&#x27;t sent a way to return the shaving kit with missing pieces and I wasn&#x27;t going to pay out of my own pocket to return it. Wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the quality of this product for paying over $20 to get a full shaving set.</li>
    <li> Like the feel, the smell and the ease of use with the brush to apply it. Great little Item for the money and saves a lot of cash from buying shaving cream in a can. I don&#x27;t have to throw away pressured cans in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing wrong with this product. For beginners, it&#x27;s a great starter pack. Everything you need to see if you like safety razors without having to spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband last year and he loves it.  He has a thick beard, so it&#x27;s very helpful in getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a year and about half of it is still left, so it will last a while.</li>
    <li> The brush is a bit uncomfortable but besides that, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> Not bad, worth the money.  I added some skin cream to it as it appeared to be too soapy for me but, the brush and bowl are very nice.</li>
    <li> It last along while and works lime a charm it would be best to buy a better lather brush tho.</li>
    <li> The Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set is a poor product. Although the bowl has worked well (it is hard to mess up a bowl), both the brush and the soap have been useless. The soap smells bad and within a week, the brush began losing individual hairs. Soon, entire clumps came out and I threw the thing away. You may be tempted to buy this product because it is dirt cheap, but indeed, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This was much much better than expected.Seeing the prices of some of the other brushes and soaps I figured this could not possibly be very good.Was i wrong!The soap is very good with great lather,and as for the brush it is top quality that has a very good feel on your face.Do not be afaid to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, as advertised.  Brush does a good job applying an even coat of shaving lather.  Haven&#x27;t used the soap yet, as I still have a tube of &#x27;bump stop&#x27; shaving cream gel.  But the brush and cup work perfectly with that type of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these so far.  The soap is awesome if you do correctly create the lather, and the bowl is decent enough, however what is poorly made is the Badger Brush.  So far, I&#x27;ve gone through two of these and they have both broken off from the handle.</li>
    <li> This set ok if you are just starting out with safety razors or straight razors but you will quickly find yourself looking for something better. The brush never stops shedding, the bowl and soap are nice though.</li>
    <li> I started with this exact set about a year ago. Since then I have moved on to other, more expensive items like Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood cream, Silvertip Badger brush, Edwinn Jagger DE89 Double Edge (DE) razor and Prorosa pre-shave cream and post shave balm. Total cost for all was just under $225 (brush and razor were the most expensive, but I wanted to have great stuff and not have to work about anything but blades for a very long time) though you can do better at certain times and I could have cut the brush cost in half by going with a Pure Badger instead of the Silvertip Badger. I have not spent a single penny in 6 months since the razor came with a 10 pack or Feather blades and I bought a 50 pack when I bought the razor and I get about a week per blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for starting out, this kit is good for figuring out if you want to give it a try and I highly recommend it. It does work with any kind of razor so you can continue with whatever razor you have right now. The soap also did wonders for my face and I have dry/sensitive skin and as others have said, mine lasted around 6 months. If you want to continue using the soap, most Walmarts carry it in the shaving section. The box is small so look carefully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the bowl, I let it sit in hot water with the brush in it as well, I prep my face and then empty the water out but do not shake out the brush. Take the brush, put the soap just on the tips and run it around inside the bowl for about 1 minute and you will get lather like you have never seen or felt before. You can also put the soap in an old coffee mug then get the brush tips soaped and move to the bowl to create the lather or just create the lather in the cup. Either way works but doing it in the bowl keeps the soap clean that is in the mug and you can get way more lather with very little soap, in other words, you do not need much soap to get the rich lather going and since you had the bowl in the hot water, the lather will be nice and warm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider most brushes like this.&lt;br /&gt;Boars Hair &#x3D; good starter brush,&lt;br /&gt;Pure Badger Hair, middle of the road brush, but definitely better than Boars Hair by a mile&lt;br /&gt;Silvertip Badger brush, definitely the top end and can be very expensive but it does make a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t just paint on the lather on your face, do it in circular motions for about 1 minute or two until you cannot see any skin, then to get an even coat, paint the lather on lightly, this lifts the whiskers, softens them and gets them ready for the razor. When actually shaving, do not press the razor into your skin, especially a DE razor, just let the weight of the razor glide over your skin and use short strokes, like and inch or a tad more. I typically do two passes, one north/south, the second south/north and I do not get any razor burn or bumps. On date night, I&#x27;ll do a third pass,which is across the grain. My GF loves when I do the third pass, I end up with a very smooth face and my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow comes around the next morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, all brushes should be hung with the hair pointing down, if you put them on their handle which points the hairs up, the hairs will spread out, the water will soak into the handle and you could and will prematurely wear out the brush and possibly end up with mold or mildew in the hairs, especially if you do not shave every day. You can also clean the brush with a good shampoo, remember, it is actual hair, not fake so it can be cleaned and conditioned just like your own haird warm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider most brushes like this.&lt;br /&gt;Boars Hair &#x3D; good starter brush,&lt;br /&gt;Pure Badger Hair, middle of the road brush, but definitely better than Boars Hair by a mile&lt;br /&gt;Silvertip Badger brush, definitely the top end and can be very expensive but it does make a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t just paint on the lather on your face, do it in circular motions for about 1 minute or two until you cannot see any skin, then to get an even coat, paint the lather on lightly, this lifts the whiskers, softens them and gets them ready for the razor.

    <li> Been using this for a long time now and it has all held up great. The brush does loose some hairs at first, but after that it holds up great. the bowl is a nice size to hold and makes great lather.</li>
    <li> I think this shave set is very good for beginners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in learning how to shave with a straight razor, but most sets are fairly expensive, and I was worried whether I would like it or not. I decided to try a cheap set to see if this is something I would want to invest in, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is a nice set. You get a fairly decent boar hair brush and a bowl that fits in the palm of your hand, which is nice for building up a lather. In addition, the soap is good. It is moisturizing and has a nice scent to it. If you are thinking about getting into traditional shaving, this is a great place to start. Stop thinking about it and buy it. Its inexpensive, but good quality and great for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, just some things to consider. I bought this to see if traditional shaving was something I would make a ritual. After using it, I am very satisfied, but I&#x27;ve been using it for roughly two months and I&#x27;m ready to invest in higher quality products. There are some slight downsides to this kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bowl is very small. You can make a very decent lather with it, but because of its size lathering can be a bit messy sometimes. Lather tends to spill out over the sides fairly easily. You could use a bigger bowl or a large mug from your kitchen if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush will wear down with time. I notice this the more I use it, even after about two months of usage, shaving once every two to three days. Its great for those just starting and its something you can learn and practice with, but if you&#x27;re going to make brush shaving a daily ritual, then i suggest investing in a brush of higher quality made from badger hair. Badger brushes are much more porous, which makes lathering easier, and they are much softer and feel much better. Boar hair brushes can be a little prickly.  If you go easy on this brush and be gentle with it, it may last you a bit longer while you learn the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great for beginners. I gave this review 4 stars because i don&#x27;t think of it as a long term product, but an initial investment to see if this method of shaving is something i would be interested in. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this kit to learn how to brush shave, just do it. If you don&#x27;t like it, you didnt waste a lot of money. If you fall in love with this method of shaving as I have, I recommend one of the kits from [...] Think of it as &#x27;level two&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This shave set is one of the best shaving sets i have bought, it is very smooth i would defenetly recomend this and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little starter shave set with decent quality items at a value-oriented price point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is of average build and quality and gets the job done in a sturdy and reliable manner...the well-made (small) ceramic bowl fits nicely in the hand and is an appropriate receptacle for the shaving soap that&#x27;s also included in the kit...the soap does an adequate job lathering up into a thick and creamy shaving lather that goes on the face very smoothly with the boar&#x27;s hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this shaving kit as a gift or for yourself.</li>
    <li> Purchased this set after hearing about the advantages of traditional shaving soap over the modern day gel/foam products.  Overall, very happy with the quality and value of the purchase.  Some shaving tips that will help, regardless of how you shave.  1) Use Conditioner on your head/face before shaving.  2) Wrap your head/face in a hot towel for 10 minutes.  3) After shaving, use Tend Skin to completely eliminate all razor burn and any potential in-grown hairs.    Following the process above with the shaving soap and brush in this kit, and a disposable razor, I get perfectly smooth shaves with little to no irritation.      I have come to prefer shaving soap and will invest in a higher quality brush, but for the money you cant beat this set.  Great starter set!</li>
    <li> He was so happy to receive the set! He was looking to purchase one for himself, but it was really easy to find on Amazon, so I bought it for a gift. He is very happy!</li>
    <li> After being unable to get a comfortable shave with the straight razor and this product, I switched to my regular razor.  It was just as uncomfortable as the straight razor.  I have tried severarl times with this product to get a good shave but it never happened.  The whole kit went into the garbage can.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shave set as a compliment to the [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]. Well, I know it&#x27;s cheap, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be THIS cheap. The bowl and soap are actually nice, but the boar brush is terrible! Mine shed HEAVILY and after 3 shaves the knot partially loosened from the handle and during the 4th shave it completely broke off. I emailed Van Der Hagen and a nice lady replied and said they would send me a replacement badger brush, which came 2 days later. I commend VDH for their quick response and attitude, however..the new badger brush is horribly cheap as well, the knot is thin and floppy, it creates extremely airy lather, and the handle is cheaply varnished wood and after 2 shaves the varnish is already peeling and water is seeping into the wood..I foresee this one dying soon as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and want a cheap introduction, do yourself a favor and buy your soap separately, toss it in a coffee mug and invest in a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] or a [[ASIN:B000CBBYW0 Black Handled Omega Professional Boar Hair Shaving Brush]] if you want to try boar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I have to hand it to VDH, they tried to make things right with a new brush and offered a refund as well, so the company isn&#x27;t bad..just some of their products!</li>
    <li> I love it very nice and reAlly good</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again.  The brush is already falling apart after just a few uses.  The soap is okay but don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s better than regular cream just because of the razor type. I bought into that but now I&#x27;m back to regular gel cream and there&#x27;s no difference besides the gel is faster and easier.  I will keep using a shave cream brush though - that just feels really good and gets cream under the whiskers I think.  I&#x27;ll buy a better quality brush and be happy.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this stuff smells amazing. I keep finding myself sniffing this shave soap every time I goto the bathroom because the smell is so addicting. Not only does it smell great, but it leaves your skin moist and clean.Try the oldschool shaving way, its awesome.</li>
    <li> To begin with, I have some criticisms of this product.      First of all; the brush.  The brush is cheaply made.  Saying that, though, does not make me a snob as some other reviewers might suggest.  The truth is that it frays easily and the hairs start falling out of the handle after only a few uses.  Don&#x27;t expect the brush to last more than a month or so, even if you take care of it properly and store it upside down.  Also, this brush is made from Boar hair, rather than Badger hair.  Boar hair is more scratchy and prickly on the face, and doesn&#x27;t hold water as well as Badger hair.    Secondly, the soap.  The soap is not bad, it makes for a smooth shave and has a nice, very subtle scent to it.  The only negative I have to say about it is that it would be better if the kit came with a glycerin soap.  Van Der Hagen does make a glycerin soap, but apparently not as part of a kit.    The bowl is fine, it has a nice weight and I really have nothing bad to say about it.    Despite my criticisms this product is still great for guys who are new to the wet shaving technique and want to try it without spending too much money.  Even with the somewhat mediocre brush, this will still give you a closer and smoother shave than normal shaving cream.  If you use a safety razor as well it&#x27;s even better.  Try this kit and if you like it after a few weeks upgrade to a real badger brush, there are some available on here for less than $20.      Wet shaving isn&#x27;t for everyone though, so if you try it and decide to go back to shaving cream you haven&#x27;t wasted much money.  At a price this low there is really no reason to hesitate to try it.</li>
    <li> My title pretty much says it all. I am relatively new to wet shaving with a DE safety razor. I wanted to try out the skill before I invested a ton of money into razors, blades, and other accoutrement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is an excellent little set for the money. I&#x27;ll break down the individual items in the set here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl: It&#x27;s a bowl. No handle, and it got to me in one piece. Easy to clean, could be a bit deeper. All in all nice little bowl but doesn&#x27;t really add much value to the set as a .99 plastic cereal bowl or coffee mug would do the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap: Nice puck of soap. At first was hard to get a good lather but then it \\&quot;broke in\\&quot; and now it lathers great. Dries quickly in the bowl and doesn&#x27;t leave much, if any, scum. (I wash the entire puck before I store it). Not much scent but I didn&#x27;t expect it to have much of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Breaks in well. I&#x27;ve done about 10 wet shaves with it so far and it feels pretty good. At first it shed about 5-6 bristles per shave, now about 1 per shave, hoping that will decrease to zero soon. Takes awhile to dry, and dries all \\&quot;crazy\\&quot; not in a nice, uniform dollop. Might be contributing to the shedding. All in all comfortable but I wouldn&#x27;t want to stay with it forever. Also the handle is a bit hard to grip when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This said, it&#x27;s $10. It&#x27;s a good beginner set. Get it, try it, pass it on, but don&#x27;t expect too much. This might also make a good travel set for experienced wet shavers. I&#x27;ve already ordered this [[ASIN:B004L4EING Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set]] to replace it.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this set. The soap bowl is ceramic and it has nice feel to it when you make a soap lather. The shaving brush has held up so far after a few shaves and it is still in good shape.</li>
    <li> Great looking kit and the soap is high quality.  Very old school and works well.  Would recommend a higher end razor because this will not lather as much as the more modern stuff.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality on the shaving bowl, brush and soap. The only thing aggravating is getting the hang of making a nice shaving foam from the shaving soap...it just takes practice. I highly recommend this product to anyone...have a great shave.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;--Cheap: This shave set does not cost much, and will definitely pay for itself when it takes much longer to finish off one shave soap, than one aerosol can&lt;br /&gt;--Works better: Shaving soap works a whole lot better (at least for me) than aerosol based shaving cream. You also get the feeling that you&#x27;re a whole lot more classy than anyone who doesn&#x27;t use it&lt;br /&gt;--Bowl: The bowl really helps create a much better lather. Don&#x27;t be afraid to take the plastic off of the soap and place it in the bowl. It will work a whole lot better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;--Boar Hair comes out of the brush and gets into the shaving blade system. It also can cause an itch on the skin, which can be irritating when trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;--Brush: Sometimes it retains water (even after shaking off) which can be a pain when applying the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict&lt;br /&gt;--Well worth the price if you want to change up, and upgrade the way that you shave.</li>
    <li> First let me point out that i just got this just under 3 hours ago used it the first time and the brush is already loosing its hair, the brush is just garbage, im going to have to get a new one.  the bowl on the other hand is perfect for me fits in the palm of my hand comfortably and is the perfect size for me.  the soap is good not great but not horrible, didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, is slightly more difficult to get a good lather with it, but that may be the brushes fault.  all in all im giving 2 stars but i recommend for people who need a bowl and soap, just get yourself another brush pronto.</li>
    <li> Lathers good brush still holding bristles, cup is good fit in my hand.</li>
    <li> I paid about ten fifty and that seems to be a bargain for this nice little package. I&#x27;ve been shaving about 50 years and have pretty much run the gamut on the methods used. My Norelco electric will no longer hold a charge (though it lasted about 10 years) or rather than paying about two hundred for another, and probably getting less than quality, I opted to try a blade again. This decision was partly based on having found many packages of Atra blades hiding in some drawers that I long forgot that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wet shaved with a brush and soap before but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay an arm and a leg to do it again. I checked other items, vintage items on an auction site and decided to give this a try. Yes, you can buy better but since you&#x27;re just slathering some soap on your face in under a minute why bother if there&#x27;s a viable alternative to paying a lot more. The brush is good, the soap is good and the bowl is OK though slippery when wet. If you don&#x27;t like the soap you can easily replace it but its mild scent and easy lathering are fine for me. The hotter the water the better the lather process will go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now shaving three times a week because I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t care anymore. I want a wet slippery surface when I shave to avoid bloodshed and this gives it. others have a love hate relationship with this item but it&#x27;s just shaving so give it a try and for the price I can&#x27;t tell much difference between the pricey brush and soap I used years ago that are now each about three times the cost of this complete kit.</li>
    <li> hey guys,&lt;br /&gt;so i decided to try out this shave set to see what wet shaving was all about.  I definitely prefer this type of shave to the normal slather and whack.  The soap produces a good lather, the bowl is very sturdy and strong, BUT the brush has lost a lot of bristles.  I have had this for about 7 months and they;re is already a large patch of bristles missing.  However I don&#x27;t have a brush stand and there is a little more to working up a lather and post care for the brush that I didn&#x27;t know about.  The brush does provide a good lather and feels pretty nice on the skin.  ANY man who has not tried a wet shave definitely needs to step it up. It feels so much better and looks a whole lot better.</li>
    <li> Great for the price as an add on. The brush could be better, but at this price. I love it.</li>
    <li> Before ordering the set, I was already using the soap almost daily. Was very happy with lathering and the shaving comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to order set knowing the soap was good and price was so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a plastic handle, but is very sturdy, solid with some weight. It almost measures 1 1/4&amp;#34; at handle base.  The bristles are very thick and wider than depicted in photo. I thought I was getting a small brush, but it was full-sized and robust. Nice surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl is sturdy and easy to whip-up a good lather.  The bowl looks exactly as depicted, flat black exterior that easy to hold onto and a gloss green interior easy to clean.  Low profile fits easily in small bathroom drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $9 price is an amazing value for all you get!!!! Don&#x27;t you love getting something that far exceeds your expectations?!!!!</li>
    <li> Anybody that gives this product under 5 stars is crazy.  For the price, you cant go wrong.  Great brush, soap, and bowl.  Clearly there are better items out there, but again, for the price...absolutely can&#x27;t get beat.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good starter shaving set for wet shaving, buy this product.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin&amp; loves this set.</li>
    <li> This bowl, soap and brush package deal is an absolutely fantastic buy! Great price for the product! The brush is made of a very nice boar bristle, and the dish, to my delighted surprise, was not a cheap plastic but is a heavy ceramic with a very comfortable feel in the hand. The soap is great, produces a very nice lather, and leaves the skin feeling smooth. The price makes it a real score!</li>
    <li> I Purchased this with the ; &#x27;Van Der Hagen, Premium Shave Set&#x27; (not recommended.) as a gift for my love. It arrived a day later then estimated.&lt;br /&gt;This is his first experience with a straight blade so I also printed out a 19 step direction guide for him!! http://m.wikihow.com/Shave-with-a-Straight-Razor&lt;br /&gt;He nicked himself a few times on the jaw line of his neck.&lt;br /&gt;The blade comes with the blades already sharp &amp; ready to go! Comfortable/flexible hold and small for easy storage!&lt;br /&gt;The cream set was not neccesary however, he and I both had a hard time creating the foamy perfect texture... Which I pretty important for this shaving technique!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL!! He LOVED the shave!! (Me too)! The closest one he&#x27;s ever had thanks to the blade!</li>
    <li> Works great and love the look sitting on my sink.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving set. The bowl is comfortable to use and the soap is nice rich so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. The brush is holding up well.</li>
    <li> good shave better than aerosol can shave cream</li>
    <li> The hairs on the brush keep falling off every time I use it.  I replaced my old brush with this because the hairs kept falling off, however this brush is even worse.  Also the hairs are very thick and coarse and spread outwards.  I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Cool but soap does not lather good</li>
    <li> Love the old school shave.  Yeah, the brush looses a few bristles, but after a while, it is fine.</li>
    <li> Recieved at Christmas and already chunks of bristles are falling out.  Have used brushes for years and have never had this problem before. Although not much invested, don&#x27;t spend it. Can not locate manufacuter and not worth it to send back to Amazon for refund. Stuck...</li>
    <li> Everything accomplishes it&#x27;s purpose.  Nothing of terrible quality- the products were packed well and not damaged when they arrived at my house.  The bowl is some sort of ceramic I think, and is of pretty decent quality- no chips, paint probably won&#x27;t last forever, but overall pretty decent.  The brush is very lightweight.  The handle is plastic, and the bristles do come loose a little with use, but nothing terrible.  The soap works well, and it smells nice- nothing too soapy, just a clean fragrance.  I would give it five stars if the brush was badger hair, but I&#x27;ve only used boar bristle brushes, and they work fine for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a snob when it comes to my shaving stuff. I happen to like the bowl and it has a great feel to it. I like the soap as well as it \\&quot;suds-up\\&quot; fine and doesn&#x27;t have a scent that is too strong. The brush feels fine, though it does seem to lose a couple of bristles every use. I have not purchased a nice badger hair brush, but that will be my next thing to buy once this one no longer works to my satisfaction. The brush is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but even then the brush still works and feels fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Van DerHagen Premium Shave set (Bowl, Soap, Brush). The Bowl and soap are a good quality and I like them. However, the brush is of poor quality, leaving brush hairs on my face when used to apply the soap. This tends to clog the blades of the razor as well as tickle when not seen mixed in with the soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years! Had I known how good, I would have switched years ago. Where we live, outside of the US, shaving creme is $6.00 a can! And  the last can i bought, I only got 2 shaves out of it and it stopped working! That is why I bought this set! But now, that shaving creme could drop to $1.00 a can and I would not switch back!!</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Mug is useful and the soap isn&#x27;t bad. The brush could be better but at $8 for the whole set shipped who can complain?</li>
    <li> Just plain simple.  the brush and soap are fine.  The soap is moist and lubricates very well, leaving the skin feeling fresh rather than scratched and scraped.  All in all a good value and a very good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price. Far superior to shave cream in a can, not as good as a high end product. The bowl is very nice, perfect shape and size. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Sent this to a grandson in the service overseas.  He liked it.</li>
    <li> Everything included in the kit seems to be quality stuff. The brush feels great on the face and the bowl is well, just a bowl. But I am unsure if I am doing something wrong with the soap because it just does not seem to moisturize my beard very well before and during shaving. It still tugs and pulls. I am using the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor with this kit. When I just use the cheap foam in a can or gel It glides perfectly. Might just be me though.</li>
    <li> A very nice set and it was well received by my son as one of his Christmas gifts this year.</li>
    <li> Its a bowel brush and soap.. what more do you want. Especially for $8.. I just took 2 stars off because already hairs are falling off.. On the first use I had hairs lefton the soap and on my face.. Im new to DEshaving.. so unless there is a break in period where a certin amount of hairs fall off right away, which i doubt, then thats unacceptable.. then again I did pay $8 for 3 items.. Not sure if a $25 brush is any different. But this set is goodenough if you are starting out with DE shaving.</li>
    <li> The best part of this set is the bowl, in my opinion. The brush works just fine and is boar bristle. The soap is good, but you can get that soap just about anywhere. The bowl is well sized for a hand and holds a soap cake without too much room for it to shift around as you get a good lather worked up. The bowl alone is worth purchasing this set.</li>
    <li> I really love the little bowl it comes with. I used this set for over a year and while the bristles from the brush eventually fell out (well, to the point where it wasn&#x27;t full anymore), I still use the bowl with my new upgraded brush. The soap this comes with is also very pleasurable and works nicely with a straight razor. I couldn&#x27;t be happier for the price and would definitely recommend this as an inexpensive gift or even as a kit to get you started with.</li>
    <li> Although I did buy mine at Walmart same price, its a great start set.&lt;br /&gt;Has the three things important to have brush, its a little tough at first but just needs to be broken in like everything else, nice bowl to mix the soap instead of our coffee mug, soap don&#x27;t smell to bad overall if your a beginner like myself go for it .</li>
    <li> I bought this set for convenience because I just bought a Merkur safety razor.  The brush does fine.  The soap has an almond smell that I don&#x27;t really like, but it does the trick.  I have had no skin irritation using this kit with the Merkur.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about purchasing the low budget kit.  Turns out it works just fine for an amateur straight razor shaver.  I was unhappy to find the same product in the grocery store for $9.99 which is what I paid on amazon + shipping.</li>
    <li> I have had the item for about three weeks. At the beginning the some of the bristles on the brush kept falling out, but now I don&#x27;t see as many. The soup feels great on the skin and the bowl has some weight to it which I like. Great product for the price. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat it for the $$$. I had it for a few months, and decided I liked the concept (much cheaper than cans of gel), so I decided to upgrade to a better brush and soap. don&#x27;&#x27;t get me wrong-this is a nice set for the $$$; I just felt like pampering myself.</li>
    <li> The biggest downfall is the quality of the brush. I got this kit to introduce my boys into wet shaving. It is a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing wrong with the bowl and the soap, but the brush stinks rather bad. It smells like a cross between a very dirty dog that&#x27;s just got himself wet in the rain, and stale denim that&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t been washed in a long long time that was stored in a damp place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that it&#x27;s boar hair as opposed to badger? And boar hair naturally smells bad? I don&#x27;t know…but I&#x27;ll be making a trip down to the local over-priced artistic shaving supplies store to have a sniff at a badger haired brush to see if those are any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, hairs keep falling out from the handle.</li>
    <li> Even though I switched to a safety razor a few years ago, I never got into the shaving brush/soap thing.  With this kit being so inexpensive, I decided to try it.  Yep, it really makes a difference.  Soap goes on so much better and uses so much less - and using the same old razor I used yesterday, today&#x27;s shave is clearly smoother...especially the area lower on the neck!  I&#x27;m sold, and I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out experimenting with a straight razor or safety razor then this kit is the best quality vs cost on the market. Perfect for experimenting without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Nice bowl and brush. Makes good lather.</li>
    <li> I bought this set at a supercenter after I lost my very, very cheap boar brush that I had had for years.  They didn&#x27;t sell the brush by itself, so I bought the whole kit.  Here&#x27;s my review:    The bowl is fine-- I mean, it&#x27;s a bowl, and it does what bowls are supposed to do.  The soap is awesome for it&#x27;s price-- better than Williams, Colgate&#x27;s, or Col. Conk&#x27;s (except in scent on Col. Conk&#x27;s). It lathers well, it&#x27;s smooth-shaving, it&#x27;s moisturizing, and the scent is pleasing.  However, The brush lost it&#x27;s bristles after only a few months of use.  I don&#x27;t mean just a few bristles, either.  It started out that way, but one day the entire center half of the bristles came out on my lips like a disfigured mustache. Now, I&#x27;m not aggressive with my brushes.  Just look at the fact that my cheaper brush lasted for years.  Maybe I just got a bad one, but I&#x27;m not going to take my chances with another one.  I&#x27;ve bought a $22 brush and will probably give a review on that one after a few months.</li>
    <li> Works great at a great price.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Was actually slightly impressed at the quality of the boar bristle brush. Soap is of good quality, lather is rich and leaves skin smooth and smelling masculine.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized arrived on time however I believe Wally World sells it so if you&#x27;re the type that don&#x27;t like the wait just get it there</li>
    <li> I got this shave set for the guys in my family as a stocking stuffer, and it was a huge hit. The quality of the brush is adequate, and the ceramic bowl is nice and feels well-made. The soap is a little sub-par, and the packaging feels cheap, but at this price, who can complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying something for a real shaving aficionado, consider checking out the supplies carried by Art of Shaving. If you&#x27;re buying it for fun, this will certainly fit the bill.</li>
    <li> does the job  but the brush does lose bristles.</li>
    <li> I got this kit because I was starting out using a DE razor. One of my friends recommended it and it has a nice feel to it and its not to big great for my travel bag. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this bowl is awesome!  Its the right size for my medicine cabinet, but there is a problem with the brush, I will never use it because its so tough!  I do like the soap that came with this product, it makes a great later, but do yourself a favor and get a badger hair brush!</li>
    <li> This was a fun set to buy. Using it made me look forward to shaving in the morning. The bowl and the brush and the activity of wetting the soap and building a lather makes it more of a ritual than just blasting out some shaving gel and starting.    The only problem is the brush fell apart. The clump of badger hair detached from the handle. It looks like it&#x27;s very poorly glued... in fact the glue doesn&#x27;t even go all the way around the hair. The bowl and the soap are nice.    Having this as a low price comprehensive introductory set was great. Now I&#x27;m going to get a higher quality brush, hopefully one that will last. I think ultimately I&#x27;ll get another bowl as well. When the soap gets slippery it tends to slide around the bottom which makes it harder to get a lather going. A bowl with some texture at the bottom to hold the soap in place would probably be nicer.</li>
    <li> About 15 years ago, a co-worker turned me on to brush shaving, and I never turned back. I broke in with the brush and soap from Van Der Hagen (they were separate, not in a set). I would recommend this set for anyone wanting to start brush shaving. I&#x27;ve since moved on to nicer sets, and bought a nice brush, razor and travel bowl to put together my own travel set, but I still use this brand soap. I&#x27;m tempted to get this set just for the bowl (the ceramic bowl that came with one of my sets broke, and another set I have didn&#x27;t come with a bowl). I no longer have to bother with canned shaving creams, and I just love the old school feel of shaving with a brush and soap. In the end, it&#x27;s less expensive, as the soap cake lasts much longer than a can of cream/gel and are individually less expensive. I&#x27;d love to start using a straight razor also, but I&#x27;m a little scared...HA HA! The brush will last if you care for it properly - after use, rinse and shake it out, and store it hanging bristles down (gravity will draw water/moisture away from the base, as otherwise it rots out the base and causes the hairs to fall out prematurely). So if you want to start brush shaving, or maybe are looking for a low-cost travel set, I&#x27;d go with this set.</li>
    <li> Good Product , Good Price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m done paying massive amount of dough every month to shave...</li>
    <li> The bowl and soap are great.  Walgreen&#x27;s sells the soap insert for less than $3 which is convenient.  However, the brush isn&#x27;t all that great.  The bristles come loose and are not that soft.  I emailed the company and they actually sent me the badger brush for free or asked me if I wanted to return the entire product for refund.  I chose to try the badger brush and it is much better than the boar brush that the set comes with.  Not only are the bristles softer, but they don&#x27;t come loose and stick to my face.</li>
    <li> Works great so much better than I could imagine once you&#x27;ll use this you&#x27;ll see why people pay the barbers.... Foams up nice.</li>
    <li> Great value for this little kit for the beginning wet-shaver. All-in-all, decent quality however, the brush isn&#x27;t that well made. The bristles are fine but every time I use the brush some of them end up on my face. Still a good value, though. If you find you&#x27;re not willing to take the time to soap up would rather the whole process be quicker, you won&#x27;t be out much money.</li>
    <li> Simple dose what you need it to do. This is to start you off and it&#x27;s good at that. The soap is great very nice scent, the bowl retains heat pretty good. As for the brush you get what you pay for with that. Good set up!</li>
    <li> I like the shape and look of the bowl. Not anything special here, just a ceramic bowl. The soap is basic Van Der Hagen shaving soap available for under $2 USD. The soap smells good and does its job.     The only problem I see here is the brush. It is stiff even for a boar brush. While the brush did its job, it was not enjoyable. The bristles seem to irritate the skin more than those of slightly better brushes. The brush also seems to continue shedding excessively with each use.     I would recommend this kit to anyone who is not sure whether they want to start Wet Shaving. If you think wet shaving is for you, spend just a little bit more on a brush. A few extra dollars now will provide a brush that can stay in your collection for years instead of weeks.</li>
    <li> Are there better kits out there?  For sure.  Are there better kits for about $10?  Nope!  I bought one as a travel kit because I didn&#x27;t want to cry if it got lost or broken.  I like it enough to actually use it everyday at home now.  The brush is okay, but it gets the job done.  Maybe I don&#x27;t have an overly sensitive face, but I find that it works just fine for me and use it more than my badger brush.  The bowl was odd at first compared to a mug, but it&#x27;s handy and not overly large.  The soap is decent quality.  I find that I like to put a dab of Proraso shave cream on the brush and make a hybrid lather.  The Proraso isn&#x27;t necessary, but I like it.  Overall, this is a really good value-oriented kit and I recommend it without reservation.  And if I&#x27;m wrong and you hate it?  You&#x27;re out $10.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product is of good quality.</li>
    <li> Its a great set for beginners.</li>
    <li> I got this brush, bowl and soap combo from van der Hagen on amazon.   The soap not bad, has a pleasant smell and leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized. It is slick enough to have good shaves.  It will probably last for 6 months.  The brush lathers just fine and is a little stiff, but softens over time. It sheds some bristles for about a week or two.  The bowl... well its a bowl... its a bit on the small side.  I&#x27;d also recommend going to badgerandblade.</li>
    <li> Very cute set. Great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> The soap is great, it leaves my skin moisturized. The bowl keep the heat in after I fill it with hot water. The brush is a bit lacking. After awhile the bristles started coming out from the center. Still for $11 bucks or so not a bad kit.</li>
    <li> its a very cheap set. but its a very cheap set. if its your first time with a safety razor maybe try it before you but a nice set in case you don&#x27;t like using a safety razor. hate to spend hundreds of dollars on things you&#x27;ll never use again. but its cheap bowl has no grip. i broke it second time i used it. soaps is soap. brush is a brush. it did not wow me but held me off until i got my good stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my son.  He loves them.</li>
    <li> Decent price. However I wish that the bowl is a bit less deep, and I&#x27;m not sure if its normal to lose a bristle or two from the brush every time I shave. However it love the soap that came with it.</li>
    <li> Nice bowl, the brush is not bad but, not particular good either and the soap does not produce a lot of foam.I&#x27;m new to this maybe I need more practice, I do have to say it feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. I bought these for gift for X-Mas to turn some friends over to traditional shaving. they have all said great things about the VDH sets. So much so that I bought the premium one for myself.</li>
    <li> I love the soap, the soap dish and the brush. The soap lasts a long time, way longer than any can of shaving cream. I also use the soap with Shave Secret. However, the brush seems to fall apart one way or another after about 12 to 18 months. This purchase was my 2nd one in Dec 2011 and it has started to fall apart in late summer 2013.  My first one the entire brush separated from the handle while using it.</li>
    <li> The soap did work as well as I hoped. Better off with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Quite good for a shave set and an incredible price. You don&#x27;t need a fancy soap or brush or a fancy bowl to build a great lather. I am one of those people who joined one of those forums filled with shaving enthusiasts and my goal was simple learn from them but not get swallowed in by the ridiculous acquisition disorders of needing fancy silvertip badger brushes or fancy soaps. I just wanted to learn how to use this and a DE razor. And I can tell you that can be done with this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not fancy, pretty, or will smell as good as the other stuff but it will get the job done as long as you learn how to use your tools. For me that means I melt the soap down into the bowl and load up the brush in there before I face lather and get a good lather going. After I am done with each area shaving I re-apply lather there by painting it on as I noticed I get a better shave doing that as it keeps my beard moisturized and some of the ingredients in the soap soften the beard, so better shave. After I am done with all areas i whip up a proper lather on my face and go for my second pass and any touch ups I need to do afterwards and I am good.</li>
    <li> Yes, the brush is not good, but the bowl and soap worth it. The value exceed the price.&lt;br /&gt;Like another user wrote, put it in microwave and it will get the shape of the bowl. Just take care not to over heat it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razors (been shaving with an Edwin Jagger DE89 for about two weeks) so I decided to pick this kit up to see what all the hoopla was about using a brush and puck soap. My verdict so far? Inconclusive.   The brush: the first thing I noticed about the brush the first few times I used it were all of the hairs that separated from the handle while I was lathering up. So, I had to pick out the boar hairs from my freshly lathered face before I began my shave. I did like the feeling of the bristles against my skin. I can&#x27;t say if that brush massage helped get a better shave or if it&#x27;s just a \\&quot;feel good\\&quot; routine.   The soap: Before I got this soap, I used a canned shaving gel and applied it to my face using my hand. The gel felt much better against my skin and moisturized my skin way better than the included soap. Oil of Olay bath soap does a much better job at moisturizing my skin than this puck soap. After my shave, my skin felt more irritated and my skin felt drier using this puck soap than using the canned shaving gel. With the gel, the razor seemed to glide smoothly across my face. It seemed like there was a bit more resistance against my face using the puck, which could be the cause of my irritated skin.   The bowl: It&#x27;s a bowl. Unlike a mug, it doesn&#x27;t have a handle, so it can be a little trickier to hold if you have slippery hands. I could have pulled out an unused mug and been happier and saved some money.  So in the end, I spent $10 for a brush massage and irritated skin. I&#x27;m right back where I started. I still don&#x27;t know if using a brush is for me. To find this out, I may have to bite the bullet and spend the money on a quality setup. But until then, I&#x27;m perfectly happy using my canned shaving gel.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the brush and soap. I will never go back to shaving cream again .soap lathers up nice no mess that you would get with the cream.It seams to give you a closer shave</li>
    <li> Its a nice soap set, but I should of looked at walmart first, it was a few dollars cheaper there.</li>
    <li> This shave set works great for a beginner. I didn&#x27;t want to invest the money into a more expensive set without knowing if I&#x27;d like the DE shaving method. There&#x27;s just no room for complaints when compared to a more expensive set; however, for icing on the cake, it would be nice to see a cheap plastic stand thrown in.</li>
    <li> This shave set is worth it&#x27;s money but nothing more. The boars head drops a lot of hair with each shave and lathers pretty &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; (it could just be because I&#x27;m new to the game). The bowl is just a regular bowl without a handle so it&#x27;s pretty replaceable. The soap smells nice however I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet but the other Van Der Hagen soap I&#x27;ve used has been very nice and has a gentle scent that doesn&#x27;t cover you in a cloud of smell.  For twelve dollars you could do worse- consider this your crash course.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product that I would recommend to someone who wants to try a safety razor/brush shave for the first time.     This is my first time using a brush and I have an average face. I did not have my safety razor yet as I ordered it after my wife got me this from walmart. So the only option I had was a USED disposable razor (not a cartridge razor but a plastic bic that had probably been used 2-3 times). I was expecting a face melting shave but I lathered up and, to my surprise, the shave was pretty good. I didn&#x27;t even need to use aftershave and I got closer than expected.     Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bowl. Yes it works but I would really like to see an handle. (I&#x27;ll use an old coffee mug next time)    Don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews! If they moved from a $15 brush and $5 soap to this $8 set than that is their own mistake. If you want to try wet shaving for the first time and don&#x27;t want to break the bank this is the set to buy.</li>
    <li> The included soap cake is of good quality with mild scent. There are obviously better soaps available. The brush works nicely but it is only temporary, for it sheds a decent amount of bristles. A replacement will be required at some point. The ceramic bowl is good. This is something worth keeping around, although it should be noted that it is made in China. All-in-all, it&#x27;s a worthwhile kit to start with and see if you want to continue brush shaving, albeit an easy decision to make.</li>
    <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve decided to try old fashioned shaving, just straight razor and shave soap.  I picked this shave set up at wal-mart, more or less on a whim, and I haven&#x27;t seen it there since.  The soap taht comes with this set is wonderful.  I have very sensitive skin, and it actually made my skin feel better after shaving.  Occasionally, some of the bristles will fall out, but that&#x27;s sort of to be expected, especially with natural boar bristles, but usually, it only loses about 5 a week, so it&#x27;ll last a while, not to mention, it feels great when you brush on the soap for the very first time.</li>
    <li> For $10 I find it hard to complain.  The brush itself is decent.  If you are starting out in wet shaving or trying to save a few bucks I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  While it&#x27;s not the softest, I wouldn&#x27;t call it uncomfortable by any means.  I can&#x27;t really speak to the bowl as mine was totally demolished on arrival.  Again, for $10 I&#x27;m not going to complain.  The shave soap is not my favorite.  If you are just starting out like I was when I purchased this, you will probably have an easier time with shave creams.  But, to each his own.  If I had to do it over again, I would probably just get the brush by itself and get another shave soap/cream such as Proraso.  If you have the money, I would probably pay a bit more for a nicer brush, but you can certainly do worse than this one.</li>
    <li> I like the soap.  I don&#x27;t like the brush.  The cup is ok.    Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Good starter kit. Took me about a month to learn to make good cream from the soap puck. I&#x27;d recommend using a tube of cream to learn, then move on to the soap puck after you&#x27;ve learned to use a brush appropriately.</li>
    <li> This shave set is great for your first set. There is nothing functionally wrong with this set, and the soap it comes with is alright and has a pleasant smell. This is certainly no &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; set, as others have mentioned, since the brush handle is plastic and the bowl is neither attractive nor unattractive. If you are on the fence about using a brush and shaving soap for shaving, do yourself a favor and try this out. It will cost you less than a can or two of shaving gel/cream, and I guarantee you will prefer the soap and brush regardless of which kind of blade you shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If having a wooden handle is a deal breaker, you&#x27;re going to spend a lot more money.</li>
    <li> This was a great starter gift set. I did not like the soap but it works to see if you like lathering with a brush. Brush will only last a short time but again great way to see if you like it before drop coin on a better brush. the bowl is a bowl, I used a coffee cup for years before this and that worked too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these since August 2013. in that time I&#x27;ve used one complete buck of soap and about half of a second one. the brush occasionally drops a bristle or two but is IMO even better now than it was new. The Cup being shorter than a mug helps get the lather going better and wastes less soap. save the plastic blister clam shell the soap comes in and you can melt down and make your own puck out of any good and sudsy soap you want. You can be high society and spend a bunch on a better mouse trap or you can use this and get the job done just fine.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my son, and he really likes it.</li>
    <li> I was tired of canned jels running out of propulsion before the can was empty. Thought I&#x27;d give shave soap a shot. Glad I did. This soap gives a smooth close shave. The scent is pleasant but not assertive. There&#x27;s something about lathering up with a brush and soap rather than squirting some chemical brew out of a can.</li>
    <li> You can get a great close shave with this shaving set. The soap provides the lather and the brush enhances your shaving experience. You can get a nice hot shaving lather applied to your face with the set. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this for traveling and it goes in my overnight bag. I wouldnt recommend it unless you are seeking something cheap that you dont care about, or are just wanting to try out shaving old school</li>
    <li> This cheap set is great.  I did a lot of reading and research to find a simple solution for a shaving kit that wasn&#x27;t going to cost me hundreds of dollars.  I can say I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this kit.  The bowl is a tad bit small for the brush but otherwise it&#x27;s a great set.  Obviously this won&#x27;t compare to $30 or $60+ brushes, but it does what I (and most people) need it to do.</li>
    <li> gave this to my self as a gift grow up watching my dad use one and now i use it all the time grand son watchs me when i save had to get him a toy one</li>
    <li> Bristles started falling out of the brush as soon as I removed it from the packaging. This is the second time I have purchased this product. The first time I purchased it, I used the brush for just over one year and had minimal bristle loss (The main reason I purchased the product again was becuase I dropped and broke the bowl and needed a replacement for that.) I will not be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Use HOT water with this product and it works great.</li>
    <li> I love the soap, the smell, and the bowl. However, this cheaply made brush started falling apart after the second use. I turned ut upside down to dry and never pulled on it. I noticed that I would have the bristles on my face and in my razor. If you already have a better brush I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first wet shaving set.  I found it to be a good intro to wet-shaving since I didn&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;m committed to doing it over using an electric razor.  The bowl is nicely shaped and works well with the brush.  It&#x27;s not too deep that the brush can&#x27;t reach the bottom, which I find to be a problem when I use this brush with a different mug.  The soap is not bad and lathers up decently.  Creating a good lather with this brush and soap was little challenging at first but I eventually figured it out.  You really have to work it with the brush and add plenty of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not bad but a bit on the short side.  Some bristles fell off during my first few shaves.  I eventually replaced the soap with a Proraso cream and the brush with a Parker badger brush, which are nicer but probably not worth the price difference.</li>
    <li> This is a good set for a good price.  The only down fall is it does not come with a brush holder.</li>
    <li> I just bought this for my fiance to go with his straight razor. the bowl is blue and green, which was nice because i thought it was blac and green.However, the soap fits well inside of it, and is a good size to work up a lather. the brush is good, and does not loose hairs, i can&#x27;t say anything about the soap. it hasn&#x27;t been used yet but i bought a few other brands/scents just incase he didn&#x27;t like it or it irritates his skin. IT shipped quickly and the box was in great conditioning considering it went through usps.Excelent product for a very low price</li>
    <li> The brush on this fell apart in a couple months, the soap wasn&#x27;t as nice as the $1.50 Mug brand and the bowl doesn&#x27;t have a handle so it slips out of your hand when wet.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re going to want to upgrade as soon as you start to really like wet shaving. I bought this product and it&#x27;s a pretty good product for it&#x27;s price.The soap is actually pretty good, not the best for lather but for the price and for a beginner, it gets the job done. The brush itself is nice but after three weeks my brush has lost so many hairs that it&#x27;s lost a lot of its effiency. I&#x27;ve ordered a badger brush and it&#x27;s great so I suggest a Parker Badger brush for your next purchase. The bowl is the bowl. Nothing to it, gets the job done but I personally don&#x27;t like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a handle.</li>
    <li> The soap and bowl in this set are good but the brush (the most important item in the kit) leaves much to be desired.  It&#x27;s stiff, doesn&#x27;t hold water well, and doesn&#x27;t make great lather.  That being said the kit isn&#x27;t a great deal after you take the brush out of the equation.  A better setup can be put together.  I found the VDH soap at a local store for $1.50.  You can use an old mug, or find a bowl/mug at a thrift store.  And the $13 badger brush here on Amazon is 100 times better than the brush in this kit.</li>
    <li> My main thoughts: This product costs what shaving products should cost. It&#x27;s nice to see this in a market that seems wildly expensive to newcomers. All elements of the kit are durably made. Good way to see if you like shaving with a brush, which you probably will.  1. About the physical product:  Brush:  - Not too rough or too soft.  - Well-glued. In my case, the brush looked nothing like that poorly glued specimen in the product photos.  - Takes a little while to dry. Make sure to dry with the bristles hanging down (see below).  Bowl:  - Solid and a lot heavier than I expected. I could probably drop this and it would be fine.  - Nice thick glossy finish.  Soap:  - Subtle, pleasant smell.  - Good for sensitive skin. Better than my Aveeno can.  - Builds lather decently, might take more time than some are used to (see below).  - Perhaps as many uses as a can of shaving cream.  2. Tips to make the product even better:  - Make your own brush stand. Take a coat hanger from the dry cleaners, fold the shoulders in, and kink the hanger loop forward. It will exponentially lengthen your usage time and will allow the brush to fully dry after use. Yes, this is a lower quality brush, so you&#x27;ll quickly destroy it if you dry it by balancing it on its handle.  - Take your time building lather. At first, you&#x27;ll be terrible at building lather in the bowl. Take your time with it and really develop it before putting it on your face. The boar&#x27;s hair will also take a few more uses to become effective.  I bought this, along with a Concord DE razor, for a cheap introduction to safety razor shaving. I&#x27;m very happy with the start of things. I recommend it, along with some care.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, just what I wanted</li>
    <li> I am no expert of these products and I can&#x27;t even say I am moderately good with straight shaving yet but it is my understanding that the brush should not be loosing its Hair faster than my chin.</li>
    <li> my hubs switched from $12/4 razors to an old fashioned razor and decided to go all out with the brush lather too. Its kinds sexy. The bowl is a nice bluish black on the outside and green on the inside. the brush is decent starter brush, has lost a few hairs but I only paid $10 for the set so that seems fine.</li>
    <li> Works well but this is my first time using this type of shaving cream.  The brush is well made but is not of luxury quality.  Very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this on the recommendation of a straight shaving website, and I have to say I&#x27;m really glad I listened to them. The brush is good quality. Half a dozen or so hairs came out the first time, but after that I maybe get one errant hair every 3 or 4 shaves. The bowl is very nice and well glazed, no globs or imperfections really, and my wife really likes the way it looks on the vanity, as opposed to an old, rusting can of shaving cream. The soap smells great and lathers very well, goes on smooth, and feels good. The only issue I have with the soap is that if I apply it to my whole face at one time, I&#x27;ll have to freshen up the second half after finishing the first. That, however, may be with my lathering technique and how wet I have the brush, so don&#x27;t be afraid to give it a shot and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product. I even tracked down the individual soap cakes and bought a 12 pack, I like it so much!</li>
    <li> Good starter kit for those that are interested in DE shaving but not sure if you want to make the full commitment yet.</li>
    <li> All items are loose inside the box and the bowl arrived into pieces. The handle of the brush is scratched due to rubbing against the broken piece of glass. I&#x27;ll buy something else next time that won&#x27;t break. Basically, it is packaged for buying from a store shelf, not for courier delivery (particularly during the xmas rush time, they don&#x27;t have time to be careful).</li>
    <li> The people that keep complaining that it&#x27;s a cheap set bought it because it&#x27;s a cheap set (that&#x27;s why I bought it). I&#x27;ve used it for months and it is absolutely a great value. The brush gets softer the more it&#x27;s used and the soap and bowl are exactly what they should be with no offending properties. The one thing I&#x27;d change if I could would be the inclusion of a brush stand, that would make the whole set really complete. If you want higher quality, pay for it. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this budget kit and I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I had been meaning to get away from canned shave cream for quite some time. About a week ago I saw this at walmart, for what it cost I figured I had very little to lose. The very first shave convinced me to ditch the cans. Is it the best there is? Obviously not, but at the price I don&#x27;t care if I replace it all in two weeks. If I get such marked improvement with such a cheap kit it is absolutely worth investing in some quality kit.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl, it&#x27;s a BOWL! As long as it doesn&#x27;t have spikes that shoot out skewering your hand while you lather I really don&#x27;t care. Does it hold the soap? Yeah. Does it fit in my hand? Yeah. WIN!&lt;br /&gt;The brush, it&#x27;s cheap and cheesy but does it work? Yeah, it works. Am I looking to replace it? Sooner rather than later. But for the price, I have no regrets whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;The soap, it works. What more can I say? If a cheap block makes my face feel that much better after shaving than the stuff in cans then I&#x27;m on the right track. I learned how to lather with this soap, is there better stuff out there? Yeah, but this soap is like a set of cheap training wheels, use it till you get figure out what you&#x27;re doing then move on to bigger &amp; better.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great value, I would not hesitate to purchase this again or recommend it to someone looking to give wet shaving a try. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because this is still just a starter kit, there&#x27;s better out there but this gets the job done quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Waited a while for it to get in stock, and it was worth it.  I bought this for my husband because he&#x27;s lazy at shaving, but this seems to relax him and he loves to use it.  His face is smooth, he smells great, and he says he likes the bristles on the brush.  I&#x27;d almost get one for me when I shave my legs, but I&#x27;d prefer one with a more girlish smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed in this set. The handle of the brush broke off a month after using. The bowl is pretty good quality. The soap is nothing to brag about.</li>
    <li> This a great product if you are thinking of starting to shave with a brush. The brush is adequate. The soap is good and the bowl is... a bowl.    No need to spend a whole lot of $$ before figuring out you like wet shaving or not.    For the price this product deserves a 5</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Wal-Mart a year ago for about eight bucks. If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and not sure how this product will work, trust me, it holds its own with the big boys. This soap and brush will give you really great lather. There are more expensive products out there that may offer a bit smoother shave, but mostly you&#x27;re paying for the luxury of how those products feel on the face. If you have any doubt at all, don&#x27;t. You CAN get great shave with this product despite the low price.     Minus one star for the bowl getting slick when you&#x27;re lathering. It&#x27;d be nice if it had a handle.</li>
    <li> I have had this set now going on 3 years and am still completely satisfied with it.  The brush does tend to leave 3 or so hairs whenever I use it, but it&#x27;s a great set.  It&#x27;s not the most expensive one, but is still good in my book.  I have recommend this to many people and they are all satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I just got into using a safety razor. I really only bought the set because I needed the brush.  The shaving soap I purchased does not require a cup.  I guess if I ever run out of soap I will use the bowl and soap that came with the kit.  For now I will just use the brush, which has been working just fine.</li>
    <li> The good: bowl is great, soap is good (kind of smells like a hospital).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: brush sucks. It&#x27;s a very stiff boar hair brush. After about 10 shaves, multiple hairs will fall our everyday and  stick to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: a great starter kit. If you stick with this style of shaving, consider investing in a quality badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaving system as a gift. Price is just right. Looks good enough that I may purchase one of these starter sets for myself.</li>
    <li> There is something soothing about working up the lather in a shaving bowl and applying it with a brush . . . aerosol cans of shaving cream just can&#x27;t compete.</li>
    <li> good quality bristles but keeps shedding.. has been using it for the past 3 months and it still sheds.. just a matter of time before I have to buy a new one..</li>
    <li> Great product for price. We have had this for over 6 months now and the quality is excellent!</li>
    <li> Lets start with the shaving mug, which is really more of a bowl. Cant say much bad about it, it&#x27;s taken a beating as I use it when I travel and its held up well. However, a handle of some sort would be nice, something to grip with wet hands other than a slick, rounded surface. This is the best part of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap, well, it makes a decent lather. To me it spells like bug repellent though. This is why I go with something cheaper, that works better, with a much more pleasant aroma. There are MANY alternatives, a few of which I easily find in local drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the brush...&lt;br /&gt;The handle on this thing is very poor quality. It is also not badger, but boar&#x27;s hair, which to me just isn&#x27;t as good, but it&#x27;s a decent start for someone wanting to use a brush for the first time. However, the bristles fall out. They come out on your face, in the mug, in the sink, just EVERYWHERE! When using this brush I feel like I&#x27;m shaving for two. This really should not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I gave it 2 stars and not the 1 I wanted to because of the mug and the soap. They are the only things that aren&#x27;t a total loss. The brush is completely worthless.</li>
    <li> This is great to get you started, but after you begin to shave with this for a while you&#x27;ll want to upgrade the soap and maybe brush eventually.</li>
    <li> Well made product, my husband uses the brush with a lather that he purchased elsewhere and it&#x27;s been smoothing out his skin. He usually suffers from ingrowns but the brush (helping better distribute/lather his shaving product while also exfoliating) seems to be helping him out. I only with it came along with a stand for proper drying. The set also looks nice on his side of the sink.</li>
    <li> The shaving brush is a very sub-par product.  It does not produce a good lather and my face is covered with fibers from the brush.  I guess I can&#x27;t expect much for an eight dollar shaving set.  I got what I paid for.  Pay more for a better boar or badger brush, don&#x27;t waste your money on this set.</li>
    <li> The brush is functional, but not great- the hairs occasionally fall out. I disliked the soap when I first got it, but it&#x27;s pretty good once you get the hang of making it. The bowl is a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an extra $10, I recommend getting a $10 brush, a $10 soap/cream, and an old mug. It&#x27;ll probably last you a bit longer with slightly better results. However, if you want to go cheap, this shave set will suffice.</li>
    <li> This brush began losing bristles within the first week of use.  After about two months of use the bristle part separated from the handle.  There are plenty to choose from, so I would suggest you keep looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaving bowl and brush for a couple of years now, and it has served perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly because I loved the two-tone green bowl. It it simple, but very nicely finished and it has served me well for a couple of years with no cracks or chips. The bristle shaving brush that this kit comes with is a little on the cheap-side in that is has a plastic handle. However it very rarely loses hairs and once it is loaded up with soap it feels incredibly soft when brushed against your face. The somewhat stiffer bristles make it easy to build up a nice rich lather and as I have said before I have been using mine for a couple of years and it is still in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this kit is the soap that the set comes with. It is serviceable and works up a decent lather but it has a scent that is completely repellent to me. Instead I use Williams Mug Shaving Soap. William&#x27;s has a very clean perfume-free scent, works a really nice lather that doesn&#x27;t dry on your face and one cake can last for nearly a year even if you shave daily like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would really recommend this shaving kit though. It is sturdy and easy to clean and you don&#x27;t have to worry about fingerprints, water stains or any of the other easily visible blemishes you get with metal shaving bowls.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a very nice product at a good price. The quality is more than I expected. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Brush and bowl are good but throw away the soap.  It&#x27;s first ingredient is propylene glycol.</li>
    <li> Pretty entry level kit however the quality is better than I expected. Brush has held up just fine for months.</li>
    <li> Nice set to start out with. Noticed a few strands that came loose when I first started using it, but expected it even if I were to buy a more expensive one. The bowl works perfect along with the soap. No complaints here. Love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The shaving crème more than adequate.  The bristles on the brush are stiff but should soften with time.</li>
    <li> This was my first wet shaving kit since I just started using a DE razor after swapping my 6-blade cartridge razor and Barbasol aerosol shave cream for a Parker 60R butterfly DE razor.  The boar bristle brush lathers up well and feels good when applying lather.  From what I&#x27;ve heard it is a bit coarser than the badger bristle brushes, which I may purchase next, but I&#x27;ve also read that boars bristle lathers better/faster and lifts the beard better because it&#x27;s not as soft as badger.  I don&#x27;t know if this is so, but I know this brush and shave soap is enjoyable to use every morning.  I would recommend this kit for any budget-minded person looking to get into wet shaving as I have recently done.</li>
    <li> This only cost me $8, so I can&#x27;t complain too much, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the soap, and the bristles of the brush stuck to my face from day one when I applied the lather. The bowl is nice, though.</li>
    <li> Useless and waste of my money. The foam was very thin and caused razor nicks. Would never repurchase. Not like the old days, for sure.</li>
    <li> quality beginner shave kit. Great Value.</li>
    <li> Good little set to get everything you need for shaving (sans the actual shaver). Still using the bowl and brush over 2 years after ordering. Brush has lost a very small amount of bristles over time, not at all noticeable, much less affecting of the function. Totally recommendable.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this plus it&#x27;s more of a natural attempt then all the chemicals in a can of shaving cream . My husband says his face feels motorized after using it as compared to shaving cream from bottle</li>
    <li> Great way to start using a safety razor.  Nothing in this kit is what you would consider premium, but for first time safety razor / straight razor users, I don&#x27;t think it can be beat.</li>
    <li> The reason for my 5 stars are the smoothness of my skin after using this shave set. It truly feels great. Best value ever!</li>
    <li> Edit: after using the set for a few weeks, I can say the brush is holding up well. The bowl is very slippery when holding with a wet hand. I have dropped it twice, but it didn&#x27;t break. The soap does lather well, it just takes a little more work than proraso cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this set to keep at the &#x27;office&#x27; as I often shave at work. At first I thought the boar brush was going to be much coarser than my other badger brush--it felt that way dry, but in actuality it is very soft when wet. The first (and only so far) time I used it about a dozen or so bristles fell out, which as long as it doesn&#x27;t keep happening is fine, because the brush is very lush and full. The soap is ok--I like the subtle scent, but it isn&#x27;t as full of a lather as I get with the tubes of shave cream. The bowl is a bowl and a good size when you don&#x27;t have lots of space. I would reccomend it to a buddy who had never tried to shave this way--if they aren&#x27;t into it they are only out a couple bucks, and if they are, well they will upgrade.</li>
    <li> The soap and brush work well. The bowl arrived broken in the box during shipment</li>
    <li> The brush loses bristles pretty quickly, but after the bristle loss tapers off it lasts pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap isn&#x27;t great, and if you&#x27;re trying to get into lathered shaving there are even cheaper ways to do it, so long as you have a bowl to mix the soap in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall, the soap seems to be pretty neutral, and the brush for all its faults lathers things with varying degrees of viscosity reasonably well. The bowl is a bowl and at being a bowl it is quite eloquent; the green and the black colors are admittedly superfluous but otherwise it performs admirably without traditional capitalist stylistic decadence.</li>
    <li> I chose this set for the bawl it has. Brush will stay as a spare just in case something happens to my WSP brush. Soap is ok. Price is right.</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt at shaving soap that did not come out of a can, so far I am happy. Others have talked about the brush handle being plastic - it is but it is a sturdy solid plastic, not a cheap lightweight plastic. It seemed to give me a pretty nice shave with minimal razor burn so it did its job.</li>
    <li> Bowl seems good, Brush started falling apart the first time i used it.  Fortunately i was planning on replacing the brush ASAP anyway so it isnt a big deal, but the shedding was a bit annoying.  The soap i cannot say one way or the other, since it is the first time ive ever used it.</li>
    <li> i love this shaving kit and its soap.makes a very rich lather.lets you get a very close shave for your face</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin like myself, stay as far away from this brush as possible! After using this thing my face looked sunburned. I would rather use some steel wool from under the sink than put this brush on my face. I don&#x27;t mean the be ugly, but it was bad. It you have skin as tough as boot leather you will probably be fine. The handle is nothing special but works just fine. It appaers to be a reasonably well built brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a starter kit and it worked beautifully. Would purchase this again as a gift or replacement! Came exactly as described and was easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> It has been years since I lathered up with one of these. I&#x27;ve been using the gel in a can for quite a while. I shave in the shower and the cans tend to rust if I leave them in so as I was looking for an alternative and thought I&#x27;d try this style again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it feels like the brush helps get the lather into the beard, the soap doesn&#x27;t lather up that well even with our soft water. If I have time this is more \\&quot;fun\\&quot; but I think the gel from a can is more efficient.</li>
    <li> Bought the item for a gift.  It appears to be very high quality.  Brush shaving seems to be a thing of the past, but I enjoy not having to spray lather out of a can and it really helps my facial tone.</li>
    <li> Really like this kit. The soap smells and feels nice and the brush and bowl seem to be holding up. It arrived ahead of schedule and had a great price. very happy with this set.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Awesome quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adequate for the price.  The only drawback is that it constantly loses a bristle or two each shave (even after a dozen shaves). It is annoying to pick bristles off your face after you lather up.</li>
    <li> I was a beginner at this type of shaving ,but its the only to shave. The store brands work but I always have shavers burn, but since I switched to soap shaving, no more any type of burn. My face feels great after shaving the entire day.</li>
    <li> The bowl is ok, the soap smells nice, but the brush is very cheap; bristles fell off in the first use, and the handle is plastic, with coarse edges where the two halves of the mold meet. Sorry, but this item is of a poor misleading description.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave in a while...I am used to a hot lather machine. ...but this Much better....Thanks for having excellent merchandise</li>
    <li> Brush falls apart, soap too hard.  All of the bristles fall out of the brush and the soap produces little lather.</li>
    <li> I use this kit daily  for shaving with my straight razors and love it.  I have not felt the need to spend any more money for a fancier kit.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this brush at Walmart. It was on sale for $1, so the price was amazing. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely made of badger hair. I also own a tweezerman brush, and all of the bristles have the dark markings about halfway down the bristle just like the ones on the outside of this brush.  The tweezerman brush works great! This one works ok, but doesn&#x27;t produce nearly the amount of good foam that the tweezerman brush can produce. I think the bristles on the inside are synthetic, and don&#x27;t seem to produce the same about of lather as my other brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise for the beginner is to spend $15 and get a good brush, don&#x27;t mess with the shave soap, and purchase some decent shave cream. It produces a much better lather, and feels better on the face. I buy mine at bath and body works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a badger hair brush daily for the past two years to shave, and i just used bar soap.  i bought the shave soap pucks, but was never happy with the lather, so i used the bar in the shower for convenience. For Christmas, my wife bought me some shave cream that comes in a tube.. I&#x27;ll never go back to bar soap for a good shave, and it smells a lot better as well.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. The shave soap is hypoallergenic, and seems to leave me with less razor burn than other soaps I have tried recently.  The brush is a cheap one, but that should be obvious for the price, and it&#x27;s not terrible quality. The bowl is a bowl....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cheap starter kit for wet shaving - let me try it out without a significant investment.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You&#x27;ll likely want to upgrade after trying it out - It was well worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Is very inexpensive, so if all you have is this amount of money, order this.  If you have money for a good brush and shave cream do it.  Really makes a difference.  I will be ordering different brush and cream.  Nothing wrong with this, it is what they claim, but it is a cheap shave set and performs like a cheap shave set.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving and I like it so far but I think I would like it better if I didn&#x27;t use the brush that came with this set. The bristles are rough and it is cheaply made. It doesn&#x27;t dry well and it lathers poorly. The only good thing about this set is the bowl which so far appears to be well made and just the right weight to hold in your hand while creating a lather.</li>
    <li> I thing the whole straight razor thing is a passing hipster trend. I bought this on a whim and it isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
    <li> When i met my husband he had no particular style, he had a bad hair cut and wore clothes that neither flattered him nor fit him. Flash forward 8 years... my husband is the best dressed and most put together guy at his office and he has a fantastic hair style and cut. He has embraced the timeless 40s aligned back hair with a part on the side and a bit of height in front and I thought I&#x27;d have him try out this kit to see if he prefferred it over that nasty gel that costs a fortune and has a ton of chemicals and perfumes in it. I thought it would go with his style he likes....this kit did the trick,  he is hooked on lathering up a brush and loves the feel and smell of soap. He is thinking straight razors. Could be next. He is really happy with the soap that came with the kit and I got him some fancy soap in addition...he doesn&#x27;t like one over the other so he&#x27;ll likely get the cheape soap when he needs another. He has no complaints with the equipment...keep in mind he has nothing to compare it with other than his hands and gel...but he isn&#x27;t really particular and he is really rough on his stuff so I don&#x27;t think ill shell out a bunch on nicer stuff any time soon. This kit was a great buy for us...I think any guy who shaves should give it a try.</li>
    <li> the soap and the brush, and the cup is worth the money 5 stars are not enough a great set to have with an old time razor, cant beat it</li>
    <li> no nonsense no frills, just what I wanted. A decent affordable shave kit! I am loving it! Should never have quit using the old double edge razor in the first place.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these shave sets for my son and I. It was our first try at &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; shaving with a safety razor. After one month I can report that this product along with the safety razor (we purchased from Amazon also), I am hooked. I have had the best shaves of my life, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to be a started set and better brushes and soaps are supposed to make the shaving experience even better?  I can&#x27;t wait to find out how!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set and again, has hooked me on classic shaving.</li>
    <li> I was all excited to try this because I use Nivea. It hardly any lather and I had to shave really fast because of it drying so fast. I have razor burn really bad so I through it out.</li>
    <li> I know there&#x60;s a few &amp;#34;shaving snobs&amp;#34; out there, but I ain&#x60;t hating. We spend a lot of time shaving, why not make it a pleasant experience. I find using this set and a good safety razor makes shaving much more enjoyable. It&#x60;s fun rocking it old school and using a brush is very relaxing and enjoyable. I doubt that I&#x60;ll dash out and buy a high end set but when Santa comes to town I wouldn&#x60;t squawk if anice badger hair brush was under the tree with my name on it. Get it, well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Great beginner&#x27;s set, the soap is nice, the bristle stiff, all of which makes shaving simple. No stand for the brush, so get one or make one yourself.</li>
    <li> The bowl is a joy. The bowl alone is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is average, nothing special but nothing bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush sheds constantly, won&#x27;t hold lather well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than some garbage plastic job, but it&lt;br /&gt;sheds 3-4 hairs every shave. They dull the razor, or&lt;br /&gt;clog it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL WORTH IT FOR THE AMAZING BOWL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl. Perfect size, great finish, great color.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a wonderful ringing noise as you thrash the&lt;br /&gt;brush back and forth on the soap. Like chimes,&lt;br /&gt;it is part of my morning ritual.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to others.  It shows you don&#x27;t have to pay a lot of money for a good shave.  The kit is great.  Get a good razor to go with it.</li>
    <li> Brush is terrible.  Soap is Ok.  Bowl is the only thing I&#x27;m still using...  And it&#x27;s a bowl - it&#x27;s pretty hard to screw that up.  Frankly I would NEVER buy this again.  Brush is made of cheap plastic and wire like bristles...</li>
    <li> This shave kit is great, seen others go for 50. The value of it pays for it self since can gels or foams cost about the same. The bowl is nice, soap is good, so what the brush isn&#x27;t top notch but it&#x27;s cheap enough to buy another set in a few months.</li>
    <li> this was my first brush and bowl the bowl is nice and the brush works well and the shave soap gives a nice lather put i use proraso products</li>
    <li> My husband has been using a long time and loves it.</li>
    <li> The dish is nice and the soap.But the brush&#x27;s comes off on your face not to nice when you are trying to shave.I would not buy it again due to the cheap brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this set two weeks ago as my first foray into brush shaving with a safety razor. I have to say, this kit actually served as a really good introduction into the art that is old school shaving. I don&#x27;t have much facial hair, so I&#x27;ve actually only done about four or five shaves with it, but I can already tell that I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for something with a little more quality. Still, I&#x27;ll happily recommend this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weak point is most definitely the brush. It&#x27;s boar hair, which is lower quality than badger hair (or so I&#x27;m told) and tends to not lather very well or very quickly. Additionally, hairs are still coming out occasionally, which is somewhat bothersome, but what can you expect from a $10 set?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself seems to be of pretty good quality, and I can already tell it&#x27;ll last me quite a while, even if I&#x27;m not using it in the most efficient way. If I have a gripe about it, it&#x27;s that it seems to dry my face a bit, but it&#x27;s not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is quite simple, and I find nothing wrong with that. It&#x27;s got a good weight to it, which makes it feel sturdy, but it&#x27;s not so heavy that it&#x27;s a bear. It fits nicely into my hand, which makes it easy in which to build a lather. And, you know what? It&#x27;s a bowl. There&#x27;s really nothing to complain about with a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d certainly point new wet shavers to this set, but only to get you interested and see if you like this style of shaving. Once you decide you do, as I have, you&#x27;ll probably want to look for something a bit better.</li>
    <li> Can buy at Walmart for slightly cheaper and wasn&#x27;t happy with the quality of the soap and brush.  The brush lost a lot of bristles with every use.</li>
    <li> For the price yo get a quality wet shave kit without the premium price. Definitely worth the money paid for it.</li>
    <li> Great kit. You get what you pay for though. Would have gotten 5 stars if the bristles in the brush didn&#x27;t come out so often. Every time I use this brush to lather at least two or three of the bristles come loose and stick all over my face. But the soap works well and the bowl is decent quality. All and all it does the job and is a good kit to start out with.</li>
    <li> Alex hit this right on the money with his review.  This is basically all you need to start shaving or \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; whatever the heck that is supposed to mean.  This is the way your dad did it and his dad before him since probably the romans or greeks or something.  You can avoid constantly buying cans and getting little rust rings on your sink counter.  I think it does a better job than the canned stuff anyway and for less dough.  The brush is boar, it&#x27;s nice and stiff and manly and whips up the lather good and quick unlike the often scary expensive badger brushes that feel like a limp artist&#x27;s detail brush and take 10 minutes to get a good lather.  The soap is one of the best I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s available separately, in fact you can buy all this stuff at Walgreens, Walmart, Rite-aid, or wherever.  It&#x27;s my go-to shaving soap, I&#x27;ve bought others and they&#x27;ve been sitting around turning to crust for years now.  I hope Van Der Hagen stays in business for a long time!  The bowl is also the perfect size and matches the brush, what more can you ask for honestly?  I wish Van Der Hagen or Gillette or somebody would make a good inexpensive double-edge razor similar to this set.</li>
    <li> The soap works well and the bowl is very nice. Only minor complaint is the boar brush is a little prickly compared to a badger brush and the plastic handle just really cheapens the look of it, so the brush is certainly nothing to show off on your counter. For the price however, it&#x27;s a great starter set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: They give instructions on how to get started, but leave the &amp;#34;how to get the lather you like&amp;#34; up to your experimentation. If you like a thicker lather, shake out the brush well after wetting it. The less water, the thicker the lather. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> great shaveing soap .... gives a good lather brush is cheap  falls apart after a few uses but is good</li>
    <li> man the soap smells so good. i love using it, really works with my skin well. the brush is good also.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  The alcohol and fragrances in canned shaving cream/gel tends to dry out and irritate my skin, and I hate the ecological impact of throwing away empty shaving cream cans.  This shave set addresses both of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic bowl seems to be very good quality.  The brush handle is made of a heavy duty plastic and the bristles are real boar hair.  Well made for the price.  The soap produced a rich lather that provided a great shave, and left my face feeling clean and moisturized, with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is a great way to try shaving with soap and a brush for the first time.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Brush was falling apart after second use.</li>
    <li> Bought these with the double edge razor, blades and stand for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day. He loved it all.</li>
    <li> Great for getting newcomers into wet shaving. Soap and bowl are awesome, brush is good enough to last until you find out that you like wet shaving and want to upgrade your equipment. Upgraded to the nicer VDH set, but I still have this as my travel kit and it works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care that the handle is plastic. But it&#x27;s not too much to expect that the hairs stay in the brush, which they don&#x27;t with this product. The entire center of the brush has fallen out. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the glue melts with warm water, but it happens with even lukewarm water or if I am careful to touch the water with only the tips of the brush. The bowl and soap are fine, so if you can find those separately, go for it (the soap, at least, can be purchased separately, I think). But the brush is of poor quality, so I&#x27;d recommend you avoid buying this set.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s a cheap boar brush so what would you expect? An angel&#x27;s hair? I mean it&#x27;s a decent brush. At first you&#x27;ll notice hairs coming off of it, this is called a breaking period. After a while hair falling reduces and it&#x27;ll work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: It&#x27;s a cheap brush, that may be a great start for starters like me &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Lathering wasn&#x27;t good with this brush. It was pushing all the soaps away from my face. I didn&#x27;t even put pressure on the brush itself, but i found out that instead of wetting your face, put a hot/very warm towel over your shaving area for about 30 seconds and then apply usually minimizes the lathering reduction from this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thoughts: I want to try out the silvertip now, but i won&#x27;t be doing so until i get use to the whole safety razor techniques and what not. I WILL NOT STOP USING THE SAFETY RAZOR. SAFETY RAZORS FOR LIFEEEEEEEEEE</li>
    <li> Wet the brush well with hot water, put a little water in the cup with the soap. lather it up  and spread it on your face. Let it stand for about a minute or so to soften your face and beard that has been washed with a hot wash cloth. Shave away and then wash your face with the rinsed out hot wash cloth. Nothing to it. Very inexpensive way to soap up for a good shave. No can to dispose of either. Liked it a lot. Recommend it to anyone who shaves their face. Splash on a little witch hazel after and you feel good about life. Incidently, I bought my brush, soap and bowl at Walmart for $8.52 plus tax (6.53%). Target has the more expensive Van der hagen soap and brush set with the fancy little cup with the nub handle that sticks out. I like the less expensive cup because I can put into a water tight plastic container for taking on trips with me. Great shaving soap to say the least. Just brush it on and let it stand for a moment before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Pag</li>
    <li> I got both of my set in on time and they are perfect! exactly what i ordered! Perfect gifts for the men in your life</li>
    <li> Works fine although it doesn&#x27;t lather up quite as much as I would prefer. The brush also works fine although it has lost a few bristles, I suppose thats normal though. Overall i&#x27;m happy and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The brush isn&#x27;t high quality, but it does its job well for the price.  A few bristles have fallen out during use, but it lathers well.  Great product if you are just trying out this method of lathering with a bar of soap, as I am.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set..my son wanted this for Christmas.  I was pleased with packaging and how the quick arrival.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I remembered to add this in on another purchase.  It&#x27;s great and I love using it.  No more cans of shaving cream for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I was happy with how it worked into my shave routine. If your looking to get into straight razor shaving or safety razor shaving this is recommended. If you want to have an enjoyable shave I would suggest trying a single blade shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these to give out as gifts for Christmas, so they served that purpose fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to remember one thing; this is a basic beginners set, so don&#x27;t expect anything too special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll preface this review with the fact that I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving for several years, and am used to nicer things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The cost is obviously why you are here, and you do get a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The soap is acceptable, and usable. More on this later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The brush isn&#x27;t too bad, and will break-in with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The size of the bowl is about right for lathering the soap that it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The quality of the brush handle is... junk. The seam is obvious and it looks cheap. It will work though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The soap leaves some to be desired, specifically float and glide. I&#x27;d suggest upgrading to Proraso creams or glycerine soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bowl doesn&#x27;t work too well for soaps that lather really well, it&#x27;s a bit small for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I would buy these as gifts again, and possibly as a cheap travel set for myself, but most wet-shavers will get the urge to upgrade quickly.</li>
    <li> Brush feels kind of hard, it looks very cheap, and loosed 10+ hairs in the first use, I have to see how it will be next time I shave...I haven&#x27;t used the soap  it as yet. The bowl was the best thing, but I don&#x27;t think it could excuse the price...</li>
    <li> The bowl and brush are good, but the shave soap sucks. Cant get a good lather with it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> my husband was spending a small fortune on Gillette crap. I bought him this set and it changed his shaving life. He loves shaving now.</li>
    <li> The brush isn&#x27;t the best quality (I see hairs coming off each time I use it) and the soap is okay but for 9 bucks this is an excellent starter kit. The kit does the job decently well. Even if you just wanted the bowl you&#x27;d pay about the same amount so might as well get this kit. I&#x27;ll probably invest in a better brush and soap down the road but for now this is more than adequate.</li>
    <li> Great set, great price.</li>
    <li> This is my very first set up of this kind. Not bad and cheap, the shaving cream isn&#x27;t very think and doesn&#x27;t really work for my face but I wasn&#x27;t really buying it for the shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Soap didn&#x27;t last long at all, VDH makes a decent unscented soap that I found at my local grocery store, and that one is faring much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl doesn&#x27;t have a handle, so that is disappointing, but it works and sits flat. Size is fine and doesn&#x27;t look stupid in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush is just fine. Doesn&#x27;t come with a holder, so mine has been drying bristles-up, which is bad, but I shake as much water out as I can, and it has been holding up for a couple of months just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, in a pinch, or for someone new to wet shaving, I would recommend this set. Once the soap runs out, you find good soap to put in the bowl. Once the brush is destroyed from drying upside down, you replace with another cheap brush with a stand. Once the second soap runs out, get a decent mug if you want a handle, or if you&#x27;ve gotten used to this, then whatever, it&#x27;s a ceramic bowl, not much to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not great as a gift, not much luxury here, but as a necessary hygiene product, it is just fine.</li>
    <li> this is my first ever shave set.  i like how my razor cleans up alot easier now.  There is a weird odor with i believe to be coming from the soap, but all in all, it was a good buy and i would definitely but this again.</li>
    <li> Great set and great price for top quality.</li>
    <li> I ran out of the soap and the brush got trashed because it is trash, but I still use and really like the dish this thing came with. And I bought this thing like four years ago.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it, says the &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin like other shaving creams. 4 stars because the bristles on the brush do tend to fall out.</li>
    <li> Good set.  Other than not being able to choose color of bowl, the quality of the set is very good.</li>
    <li> Anyone who shaves can use this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen is a great product and the bowl is good.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not for face lathering</li>
    <li> When I first started experimenting with the wonderful world of safety razors (now moving to straight razors), shaving soap and brushes, this is what I started with. It&#x27;s great! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. I leave the soap in the ceramic bowl and use the brush to lather it up before applying to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s 3 stars and not 5: The brush doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve purchased two brushes from this brand and both of them have lasted a couple of months. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal for other brands, but I doubt it. I am investing in a better quality brush, but I still use this ceramic bowl and soap. The soap lasts a LONG time and it&#x27;s really cheap. If you&#x27;re getting into the traditional shaving method, I&#x27;d recommend this as an economical starter option.</li>
    <li> This is the first set of items I used when trying wet shaving.  I have since purchased a badger hair brush and Proraso shave cream and find both of them much better than what comes in this set.  The soap in this set may not have enough glycerin in it to do the job.  I tried a few other soaps and found them to be better but still prefer the Proraso cream.</li>
    <li> I gave this set 4 stars because it is quite nice for the money, however if you&#x27;re a little clumsy - like me - you might drop it in the sink and break it, like I did. I ordered a stainless steel bowl to replace it, I might dent that one but I won&#x27;t break it!</li>
    <li> This shaving set is obviously designed for first time wet shavers to get their feet wet (bad pun intended) at a cheap price. Being a first timer, I fell to the appeal of it as well. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not bad at all. It gives you a nice little bowl, a bar of soap, and a boar&#x27;s hair brush all for the cheap price of ten bucks. It&#x27;s a great idea to have all these items packaged together so first-timers don&#x27;t get overwhelmed at having to purchase everything separately. But if you just take a step back, you might see that it&#x27;s no big deal to get these three items separately, and in fact it might be in your own benefit to do so. On the other hand, you might enjoy the learning experience you get from this package. I&#x27;ll share my critiques of each item and what I learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the bowl: It&#x27;s a great bowl, but I find it a little small and sometimes lather can start foaming out of it during your mixing, no biggy. The thing I like most about this bowl is that it has a nice contrasting color to shave cream. I actually found it hard to keep track of all my created lather when I tried making it in a white bowl, but I have no trouble at all with this bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the boar&#x27;s hair brush: Ohhh, you&#x27;ll hear the \\&quot;pros\\&quot; always hating on boar&#x27;s hair brushes and saying badger hair brushes are better. I actually completely agree with them; I find a badger hair brush to be much better suited to creating and applying lather. However, I still had a lot of fun comparing the two in my shaves and learning for myself the actual differences between them. It&#x27;s not like a boar&#x27;s hair brush is useless, you can definitely still make lather with it. But if you&#x27;re a no-nonsense kind of guy and don&#x27;t want to experiment, I strongly urge you to not buy this set. You will definitely replace this brush with a badger hair brush and you&#x27;ll feel like you wasted your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) the soap: It&#x27;s fine. You can purchase it on its own for like 2 bucks on amazon. A good idea is to remove the puck, place it in the bowl, and then microwave in spurts of ten seconds until it melts. Now let it reharden and it will be formed to the bottom of the bowl making lather creation easier (microwave melting works fine with this type of soap, but it doesnt work for certain other types so be careful). If you&#x27;re like most people, you&#x27;ll find that lather making from a soap takes more time and is harder than creating lather from a shaving cream. If you don&#x27;t want to deal with the hardships of turning soap into lather but you still want to wet-shave, you&#x27;re probably better off buying a cream. I find it a fun skill to practice and master so I&#x27;m happy with the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: For someone who literally wants to get it right the first time with cheap but quality products, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this set. You really are better off getting the cheap tweezerman $10 badger hair brush, getting a cheap bowl/mug from wherever, and just buying this soap separately. However, for someone who is interested in learning and doesn&#x27;t mind trying out a boar&#x27;s hair first, then I whole-heartedly recommend this set. I don&#x27;t see boar&#x27;s hair brushes sold individually on amazon, and they&#x27;re like 10 bucks at stores, so this set really is a great deal. In addition to it, I still recommend you buy the tweezerman badger hair brush. You&#x27;ll have a much better understanding of the comparison between a badger hair and a boar hair brush if you try both out for yourself, and at twenty bucks (10 for this set and 10 for the additional badger hair brush) it&#x27;s a great affordable way to get into the world of wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Awesome Soap and bowl, the brush is on the lower end of quality but this was my first attempt at wet shaving so this was a great deal for just trying out, the handle of the brush did not fit well in the Mission Style Wood Shave Stand for Razor and Brush - Walnut Finish but you couldnt beat the price, i have passed the brush onto my lil brother for him to try but i am still ejoying the wonderful soap and bowl... great starter but if you enjoy the wet shave you&#x27;ll soon move onto a pure badger hair brush</li>
    <li> I was frustrated with the cost of canned shaving creams and the inexpensive ones did not do a good job at all. In fact, for over a year I was using hair conditioner for beard shaving because it did a much better job for much less money than any of the expensive canned creams (yes, hair conditioner makes a great shaving cream for your face). I made an impulse purchase when I saw this at Wal-mart, although I really liked the shave I got using hair conditioner, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell and it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling clean.    If you are not a shaving snob and just want a better shave than you get with canned shaving creams at a lot less cost then give this a try. I did and I am now hooked on soap and brush shaving.    Pro: It is inexpensive. It gives me a better shave than I have gotten with any canned cream. Saves me a heck of a lot of money on shaving cream. The bowl holds the soap so well that it doesn&#x27;t move around when building a lather. I really like the size of the bowl. It fits great in my big hands, I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5\\&quot;. Smells good and leaves my skin feeling soft yet clean. Brush bristles are firm enough to produce a good lather but not foamy like canned creams.    Con: I shave in the shower and since the bowl doesn&#x27;t have a lid, I have to keep the bowl on a shelve outside the shower but within reach while I&#x27;m in the shower.    Neither pros or cons: The handle of the brush is plastic. I don&#x27;t care that it is plastic because I care more about \\&quot;expensive to quality of shave\\&quot; ratio but if you are a shaving snob and want to waste you money on a wooden handle when a plastic one works great (even better than wood if you shower shave) then go else where. There is no brush holder but you don&#x27;t need one since it stands upright on the handle.    I start by running the brush under the shower then start to build the lather in the bowl but finish lathering on my face. I&#x27;ve watched videos on YouTube that show how to lather (like this one [...] ) but I think the guy in the video is nuts because I don&#x27;t need to push the brush that hard on my face or bowl as to dis-form the brush to get a good lather but then I prefer lather to foam so in my opinion the guy in the video over lathers and produces way too much foam. Foam does nothing to increase the quality of your shave. The oils in the soap help the blade glide over your face and the brush helps lift up the hairs. Producing a lot of foam is just a waste of time and will cause your brush to wear out quicker.</li>
    <li> Nice for the price. It&#x27;s my first shave set and it works wonderfully. The soap smells good and makes good lather for a good shave.</li>
    <li> I received this shave set today. The SHIPPING was FAST! I used the shaving soap, brush, and bowl. I am PLEASED with the results. I like the scent of the shave soap. I am VERY happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> We bought these as part of groomsmen gifts at our wedding, along with some vintage safety razors. The brush is not very soft and it will be replaced in the long term. The soap smells awesome.  A nice addition to this set would be a stand for the brush and razor.</li>
    <li> This is definity a cheap beginner set.  It works ok.  I really wish that the shaving soap worked better but that might just be user error. It is hard to make it thicker and creamer no matter how much soap I use and how little the water I use.  I think I am going to save the brush and bowl and get some shaving paste.  The brush is pretty nice.</li>
    <li> Despite the mixed reviews I thought this set was worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap - this shave soap is above average in quality. The cake is nearly double the thickness of what you get from Williams and lasts an extremely long time. With the right technique the lather is good, though a bit thin, and does not appear to dry out the face. 7 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl -  nicer than what I was expecting, this bowl is heavy and well glazed. It&#x27;s a great size for building up lather and while some have discounted it do to its lack of a handle or its depth I really like it. 9 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush - a very basic brush which is of decent value to get you to your next brush; I&#x27;d give it an approximate life of 6 months to a year depending on technique and care. Note that Van Der Hagen makes two types of boar brushes, the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; boar brush (blue handle) is what comes with this set and is the cheaper of the two. The nicer one is sold individually and is the \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; boar brush (white handle). The deluxe actually lasts substantially longer and, with proper care, will last for years in my opinion. You can find this brush here on Amazon, Walmart or CVS. It&#x27;s around 7 to 8 bucks. 4 out of 10 (blue handle) 6 out of 10 (white handle).</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re wanting to get into Wet Shaving i don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this set. It&#x27;s not high end, it&#x27;s not the best money can buy, but it also doesn&#x27;t break the bank. The bowl is perfect. It&#x27;s simple, and it gets the job done. It could&#x27;ve used a handle of some sort, and maybe a little wider, but it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not of the highest quality, but if you&#x27;re worried you might not permanently change your shaving technique, it&#x27;s a good enough initial investment to test out the pros/cons of wet shaving. On first use maybe about a dozen hairs fell off, but since then, maybe 3 have fallen in the last 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap does not really have a scent, but it makes a great later. I find that the lather on this soap is better than that of Arko soap, although it does not provide the same soothing/menthol-ish sensation on your skin. Like the rest of this set, it&#x27;s good, especially for the price, but it&#x27;s not amazing.</li>
    <li> This is great if you never used one before.  You have everything you need and if you want to upgrade to the more expensive kits or build your own.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This little set is very nice for the price. It is a great starter kit for anyone that needs the essentials to shave. It is packaged nicely and appears to be made of quality material. For the price it cannot be beat! I bought it combined with the shaving gift set with SmartHome Razor set http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RY5ZR4I?redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1.</li>
    <li> This is a good start or travel kit.  The soap is surprisingly very nice and produces a great lather.  I melted the soap into the bowl and produce the lather with the soap inside the bowl.  The brush is solid but the handle for me is a bit to chubby.  I purchased a second set along with a Edwin Jagger razor to give as a gift to a family member.  I will continue to purchase the Van Der Hagen soap and the bowl is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I like the soap and the brush, but the bowl has a small crack in it from when it was made because it has been glazed over but a perfect size.</li>
    <li> Brush worked fine but broke away from handle after about 90 days use. I quess 90 days use for under $10 is to be expected</li>
    <li> Perhaps the best way to put this is that I will never again, unless I have to, purchase canned shaving cream. This stuff... just rocks!</li>
    <li> Decent kit. Not too much too say. The brush is plastic so a bit disappointed with that but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Brush is nice quality, feels great on the face, bowl is steady even when wet, and the soap is good smelling and non irritating. Also this one cake has lasted over 2 months since I started shaving (daily) with no measurable decline.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for my husband - he never used it, silly man, so in the spirit of &#x27;waste not, want not&#x27;, I gave it a try!  Five years or more and I have never looked back.  The brush and soap give a thick, creamy lather, and leave my legs and lady bits as smooth as silk.  Fewer nicks, never an ingrown hair and skin so soft and smooth that it literally shimmers!  I have since replaced the husband, but I am still using the same brush and bowl daily!  I have given kits to my daughters and close friends, and they all agree this is an elegant and indulgent way to handle the necessary evil of shaving!</li>
    <li> comes with every basic thing you need.  the soap has a nice, light scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  bought this for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he loves it</li>
    <li> amazing price... fast delivery ....  the product is excellent quality .  I  love it since I have problems shaving, this product will be great ...</li>
    <li> this works great, this is a great started to shaving like my grandfather did.  I am realizing that shaving is more than running a blade across my fave.  Get started and enjoy a good clean shave.</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of this soap, it&#x27;s smooth and just right in thickness. Leaves my face smooth after a shave and is worth getting if your looking for a great shave. Only thing is the bristles tend to come off the brush but is worth the price and you get more than what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to begin shaving with a safety razor. I would highly recommend spending a little extra for a better set. The bristles began to fall out of the brush every time I lathered up and the brush soon broke in half. Soap was mediocre.</li>
    <li> I bought this set when i started with a safety razor and its a great set for beginners, the soap  works great for lather and after some practice you get the hang of it. I give this only 4 stars because the bowl is a bit to small when you what to lather up and because the brush is a bit stiff. I would recommend  this set if you are looking to start using a safety razor or a strait edge, or just want to try to make your own lather when you are shaving. I would also recommend to buy a badger brush if you like to use this.</li>
    <li> The perfect shave kit for a new shaver. I have purchased more expensive shave kits in the past and the real different is the quality of fur used in the brush. But $15 for a shave kit is a great price to get a new shaver interested (my 16 year old nephew) in shaving. He loves it.</li>
    <li> If you are the guy that is just getting into wet shaving and wanna dabble a bit before spending more $$, or a guy that likes basic no frill stuff, then this is for you!  I switched to a double edge wet system and I have used this set daily for about six months and it has held up very well. Kinda funny, we get into wet shaving to save $ and then spend lots of $$$ on custom items.  I have some exotically scented soaps my wife got me, and I do use them and each has its own merits. Everyone ends up liking their own particular style of razor, blades, brush, and soap. My point for this product review is that this basic set works very well, has great value and does the job. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again, and really, no need to up grade.  I&#x27;m not a shave snob!</li>
    <li> Good quality product for the price. Easy to use. It beats shaving cream for closer shave. I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> This is a good starter kit for those new to brush shaving. Not top notch, but certainly worth the $.</li>
    <li> Came with soap and bowl, no brush was included. The soap is alright, but not as good as others out there.</li>
    <li> The bowl and the brush feel comfortable in my hands, as in they&#x27;re not too big and can store enough soap for a whole shave. However, the soap doesn&#x27;t seem to produce enough foam. You need to work it up a lot before you get to see enough of it.</li>
    <li> This product came as described. I bought it for my son he is getting into wet shaving. the soap and the  bowl are great ( love this soap and use it myself awesome lather), the brush is good for a cheaper one. It works good but some of the bristles come out more than a quality brush would. But excellent if you are just getting started. Very good price to see if this is the way you want to go before you step up and buy more quality brush.</li>
    <li> Old school is the way to go for a good shave.  It&#x27;s taken me 20 years to figure that out, but a brush and lather with warm water actually gives your follicles a chance to soften before applying your choice of razor.  I&#x27;m not giving this a five since the bowl (ceramic) broke withing a week of getting this, but the soap has been giving me one good shave after another for over 6 mos!</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brush continued to fall off, and when I contacted Van der Hagen they never responded to my email....</li>
    <li> Bowl broke in shipping but I super glued it and have been using it for six months now. Even used wood scraps to build myseld a nice little brush stand. take care of it</li>
    <li> My husband is 34 years old and has never had a better shave in his life! His facial hair grows very very fast and very thick but this does the job phenomenally! Bought a little $8 shaving kit as well and it works great with his straight edge razor.</li>
    <li> Overall I am very pleased with this set. It&#x27;s a great introduction to shaving with soap and brush. Both the brush and bowl are made of sturdy plastic. After a couple uses the soap sits firmly in the bottom of the bowl and doesn&#x27;t fish around. The bristles on the brush are comfortable and clean easily with a quick rinse. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try out using a brush for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, after a good 7 months of use, my brush did break: the bristles and their base came detached from the handle. I may have dropped it on a hard floor at one point, so I&#x27;m not sure I can blame the manufacturer. The break was clean, and after a little bit of superglue it seems to be as good as new.</li>
    <li> Good beginning set. The brush is pretty decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I like this set alot, and talk about CHEAP price. The soap is not overly scented, which is great for my skin. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This set works great. The brush has been good so far and the soap looks like it&#x27;s going to last forever. I&#x27;m glad I bought this set over the more expensive options I viewed.</li>
    <li> Great shave set for a first timer. My husband has used his for over a month and still loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a good starter set. Gives you the brush and bowl plus some shaving soap. At first a little hard getting it to lather up, the bowl is a bit small for whipping it up and takes some practice. The shaving soap is just OK for the sample but I&#x27;m looking for a more lathering and one with more of a moisturizer in it for my preference .&lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s just what it is a good starter kit.</li>
    <li> If you already wet shave and have a decent brush, a stand to hang it from to dry, and a good soap that you use, I would definitely buy this to get the ceramic bowl it comes with. It is the perfect size for melting a puck of glycerin soap into, like Colonel Conks.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, beginners may want to look elsewhere. The boar brush is of very low quality, and mine in particular sheds a LOT of hair. I wouldn&#x27;t count on this set because the shedding would make it annoying to shave with. Also this set doesn&#x27;t come with a stand to hang your brush up to dry. The same brand has a higher quality set for like 30 bucks (25 at Walmart). the brush is much nicer (badger hair), the soap is better and smells very good, and it comes with a stand for your brush/razor. It also comes with a cool mug, but I like the bowl of this set better (why I got one). I would highly recommend that beginners get that set, as it is good enough to really set your wet shaving experience off right (look for the orange set).</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Should have done this years ago!  I am a woman and use it for my legs.</li>
    <li> This shaving kit was a good buy for me.  I&#x27;m just learning how to straight blade shave and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and this fit the bill.  The brush is not all that great it did start to lose some of the hair on the first use.  What do you expect at this price.  The bowl is ok and works,  and really you can use any kind of mug and it will do the job.  The soap is not bad either but I have no other soap to compare it to but it seemed to work for me. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to learn how to straight blade shave to start off and see if you would even continue to straight blade shave since it does take time to learn how to do it.  I gave it a 4 star rating for the purpose of it being a learning tool at a cheap price.</li>
    <li> great start kit for shaving. Loved the mug, the soap is much better for face the brush is average but the price for all three what can i say...</li>
    <li> This really can&#x27;t be beat for the price.  I&#x27;ve been using the soap for nearly 6 months and it&#x27;s still nearly full.  The bowl is a good solid ceramic bowl. The brush is of lesser quality, but it&#x27;s worked fine for me.  I figured I&#x27;d use it until it wore out and then upgrade the brush. It is boars hair, which is more coarse than badgers hair, but unless you know the difference it won&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I do recommend this for anyone starting out and just want to test out the DE razor scene. I have purchased this for myself, and i enjoy the soap and the bowl. The brush works just fine, but mine is shedding every time I use it. I have purchased a brush holder which helps in drying the brush between uses so that it stops shedding. The brush is a Boar&#x27;s Hair, which is just fine. I have been told by others that Badger is better and so I am considering trading to one of those. I have recommended this kit to anyone that asks about DE shaving and will be giving them out to friends as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the price to substance ratio of this shave set and actively encourage you to try it.</li>
    <li> Very nice, as expected !</li>
    <li> I purchased this set from my local Wal-Mart almost two years ago.  To be honest, it was an impulse purchase, being that it was the first time I had seen such products locally.  The lack of propellant chemicals and a can to throw away later prompted the purchase.  To be honest, I haven&#x27;t looked back to the can!  Two pucks of soap have lasted a LONG time (granted, I don&#x27;t always shave daily).  This is, simply put, one of those products that is friendly to both the planet and your wallet!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the process of upgrading--wet shaving with a double-edged safety razor seems like a logical next step.  I intend to order some of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; soap along with the new razor.  I also intend to upgrade the brush and mug. The brush is boar hair with a plastic handle, and sheds a little bit.  But I would still recommend this product to anybody that wants to try shaving with a brush and soap on a budget.</li>
    <li> It looks fine, and I really like the shape of the ceramic bowl, but there&#x27;s one really silly thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They pack the brush, with a hard handle, and the ceramic bowl, together in a box with no padding whatsoever between them.&lt;br /&gt;As you can guess, the bowl arrived broken.&lt;br /&gt;I;m going to give it another shot, but If it&#x27;s packed the same, I may be returning it again and just heading to the store.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it. nice brush and bowl. love the soap smell, however it does not produce a lot of lather not as much as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Its cheap but works very well bowl it good soap is good brush WILL lose hair at first and is plastic and it will smell a little but all in all can&#x27;t beat the price 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> No problems with the brush here.  The cup is tiny, so I use one of those massive 3 serving coffee mugs and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The 2 complaints I have is that the bristles in the brush came off alot on my face hopefully this will lessen over time. And the box was really banged up and everything was almost falling out of it. But everything was there and wasnt broke.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used shaving soap before, be advised that it will last a LOOOONG time. I eventually gave it away to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the bowl is supposed to do, but I use it to clean my razor and to get the small amount of water I need to combine with the soap to make lathery shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not exceptional shaving cream, but it is the most economical, pretty similar to barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does the job. Some people have complained about it, I don&#x27;t have any problem with it. It lost a couple bristles, they didn&#x27;t hold their shape perfectly, but it does what it needs to, so that&#x27;s all I really care about.</li>
    <li> Bought this for bowl and brush only. I use proraso shave soap. But much to my surprise I&#x27;ve come to like this soap as well if not better. I just went to wally world and got some glycerine for $3. A few drops does wonders with this soap. I&#x27;m very pleased with the whole set. Only complaint is this brush won&#x27;t stop shedding.</li>
    <li> I am a newbie to wet shaving with a DE safety razor and wanted to get the full experience while not spending hundreds of dollars.  While I am sure there are better brushes and better shaving soaps, the combination of the bowl, brush and soap for the price cannot be beat.  If you want to try wet shaving, this kit is a great way to start.</li>
    <li> The brushes fall out when you use it. There isn&#x27;t any thing to say except it isn&#x27;t a very good product.</li>
    <li> Wish the cup was a bit wider, could get a bit more lather that way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done wet shaving. I was concerned that the brush would be itchy or poke me, since I have sensitive skin. When I got it I just ran some conditioner through it and it was fine. The puck it came with is pretty nice too and left my neck feeling better than any expensive can ever did. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> The shaving bowl is just the right size to hold in my palm while I word up a great lather.  The boar brush was a little stiff at first, but after a week it softened up and now it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Soap foams up easy and good. Cup is good. Brush is good.</li>
    <li> The only thing I ended up using was the brush. Cheap cheap cheap. If you have coarse whiskers forgetabout it.</li>
    <li> The brush is cheap and does do a bit of shedding but it does the job well and it eventually stops losing so many hairs. The soap and bowl are great! I melted the soap into the bowl and face lather. This is ideal for someone wanting to try wet shaving.</li>
    <li> The bowl is a sturdy ceramic and fits nicely in your hand. The brush is nice. The handle is plastic, but, solid and heavier, not thin and hollow. The soap smells nice. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat this set.</li>
    <li> The shave kit may be cheap but it&#x27;s well worth the value. It&#x27;s actually cool making your own shaving cream</li>
    <li> I got this as a first set to try out straight razor shaving. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. Considering the cost being under $10 dollars, I feel it exceeded my expectations. The brush is sturdy and does it&#x27;s job well, my only complaint is that it loses quite a few bristles during use. However, I feel that is partially because of how new it is to me, and it seems to be decreasing with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel this is a good way to go to get started, before moving on to bigger and better things. If you are considering making a switch to straight razors, this is a good tester kit, then if you like it you can begin upgrading.</li>
    <li> Nice set for the price! Bush is very stiff, and long lasting. Would reccomend to a friend in nice of a good but reasonaly price set</li>
    <li> If you are worth a few dozen million, then do go ahead and buy that $200.00 set.  If you are like me, however, and you want quality but at a decent price, then here we are.  This is an excellent shave set.  Of course, one could argue that an old coffee cup from the thrift store works just as well as the shaving soap bowl.  That being said, the key to the set is, of course, is the brush.  This brush--in spite of the remarkable price--is just fine.  Great, in fact.  Some of the shaving forums go on about the different type of boar bristles available, and how this type or that type starts at $150.00, etc., but that is all nonsense.  The boar&#x27;s bristles in this brush are great, and the handle, while not made of a rare African hardwood, is just fine.  The soap included in this set is very nice, as well.  And, make no mistake, this stuff beats the heck out of that canned shaving cream all day long.  Some believe that this method is better than using the canned shaving cream for environmental reasons...you know, &amp;#34;saving Mother Earth,&amp;#34;  and all of that.  Well, that&#x27;s really nice, I guess.  For my money, good old &amp;#34;Mother Earth&amp;#34; will keep rolling along nicely with or without shaving cream cans (but, we won&#x27;t get into politics here LOL).  The plain fact is that this traditional method is better because it is better.  So, save your money and consider this great set at an unbelievable price, and forget the $200.00 sets.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT SIMPLY TO USE.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby and it&#x27;s a very cute set. Can&#x27;t talk about the soap but it comes with a very cute little bowl. Brush on the other hand felt very dry and scratchy - at least to me. Not sure if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be but I personally would never use a harch brush like this on my face. In the end you get what you pay for I am just hoping that hubby likes it when I give it to him</li>
    <li> Premise: I started the world of shaving a whole year ago just before my senior year of college.  I shaved daily, but skipped a month or two because of travel.  I have a med to strong beard grown.  Only about 10 mins tops for shaving available each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Kit for the most part was an awesome addition to my ensemble for two reasons.  1) The brush was been a faithful companion from the first day.  2) the price was really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving style is simple: I soak the brush while I shower.  After I step out, I then lather the brush in shaving soap for about 2-3 minutes (for a thick lather) and then I shave.  After the shave I wash the brush and hang it upside down on a (hanger made) brush holder.  One year later it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit stiffer than a badger (I believe) but honestly with a good lather it is quite soft (manly soft lol) on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bowl broke within 5 months of ownership lol, but a trip to the Good will found its 59 cent cousin and the partnership has been going strong.  Really you are purchasing this kit for the brush.....everything else is the icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> I needed a brush so I bought this set and im ok with it. its actually a pretty good deal for the price of it. the soap sucks but I got a fair shaving brush and shave soap bowl. I would recommend this product just for those aspects of it</li>
    <li> This is my first time using shaving soap. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t try it years ago. Much better than shaving creme in a can. I have been using this for weeks, and love it. The bowl and brush are really nice. This is a great product for those who use like shaving soap as opposed to shaving creme from a can.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl , Brush) and it works great with the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail. My husband just switched to a safety razor.  At first he wasn&#x27;t sure if he liked it.  He had been using a Braun for so many years.  That was fine until he turned 38.  His hair became very coarse.  My husband would shave at 7am and by noon he would have a shadow.  Now with this shave set and razor he is still pretty smooth at 9pm. The razor is nearly perfect and he has adjusted well to it.  Super clean shave.  Apply no additional pressure to avoid accidental cuts.  Nice and heavy.  Handle is a nice length too.  Super shiny chrome.  Highly recommend both for a gift set.</li>
    <li> A decent starter set. Not a fancy, expensive set-up. The brush does wear out and the soap is just about as plain and manly as it gets.</li>
    <li> Excellent item for a companion unit to my new Double Edge razor. The included soap product appears to be an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with my straight razor so I can get a proper shave with it.  I&#x27;m pretty sure there are better/more expensive products out there.  But if you&#x27;re a beginner to straight shaving (as I am), this product is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out of the soap, I will purchase an other from Amazon and keep the bowl and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a great size (not too big) and the brush shed a few hairs on the first use, but that is expected.  I will probably upgrade to a badger brush in the future, but for now, this works fine.</li>
    <li> great product for a beginner. brush is well made but not top of the line. soap is great and really feels good on sensitive skin. the bowl is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Pros: Cheap! Very cheap to start off with a full shaving set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bowl is very noisy with the included brush. Don&#x27;t expect to be able to make a great lather with the included brush while being quiet. I also did not care for the boar&#x27;s hair brush, but I&#x27;ll chalk that up to personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The shave soap (IMO) smells great, and not overly powerful or weak. I ended up replacing the brush because I just personally couldn&#x27;t make a good lather with it, though I know many can without issues. I bought a badger brush and still use this set with it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Overall, the shave kit&#x27;s not a bad value.  Nice brush.  Bowl&#x27;s okay.  Soap lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THE SOAP STINKS LIKE A HOOKER&#x27;S CHEAP PERFUME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously:  Note to manufacturer:  That is NOT what men want to smell when they&#x27;re shaving.  Or ever, for that matter.  Unscented would be okay.  Or a touch of vanilla or cinnamon or lemon or lime.  But this stuff STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be replacing the soap cake at the first opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, a good product.</li>
    <li> this kit is the best choice for a beginner in wet shave, has a great price and the products have good quality, the brush it&#x27;s a little heavy but just to feel that you&#x27;re holding something, the soap smells nice and soft, it&#x27;s not dificult to make it lather and the bowl works good but maybe you&#x27;ll like to use a bigger one</li>
    <li> Yes Good Worth the Money! Good starting brush for the price it is. I do think the bowl is pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> He seems to like it. Product come just as shown in the picture (bowl, soap, and brush). It smells good too. He hasn&#x27;t used it yet so I can&#x27;t really say more than that, but it looks great!</li>
    <li> just my opinion. But seems to be more trouble than its worth and I get better from a can of barbasol shaving cream.</li>
    <li> First time shaving without shaving cream and using shaving soap was a very nice surprise. This gives a much closer shave using less than the cream did and it smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> If your switching from shaves gels to shave soaps this $8.99 kit is a great starter pack.  Being a novice myself I found this set easy and fun to use; it comes with a Boar&#x27;s hair brush (I know badger is the preferred but boar works perfectly fine), a ceramic bowl (I expected plastic so this was a nice surprise) and one soap (lathers decently.)  Considering the cheapest boar&#x27;s hair shaving brush on amazon is currently $5.06 and you can buy the soap for $1.79/soap (if you buy 12 at a time) I&#x27;d say this set is a fair price.  Bottom line: Buy it if your just starting out with shave soaps.</li>
    <li> The kit is great to see if you will like this type of shaving, and the price is perfect.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, and the soap feels good to put on with the brush. Pretty basic set, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this set and i wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Bought it as a gift and so far there hasn&#x27;t been a complaint from my friend. The box however, did arrived with a small 3cm cut across it&#x27;s face. Other than that, who can complain about this set for its affordable price?</li>
    <li> The brush and cup are nice quality and the soap is good for the price, I plan to use it all the time since the smell is very low, I would highly recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase...not so happy about having to come up with a limit of words that I have to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the brush and bowl--I really liked them.  The look great together and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;m tossing the soap (or giving it to somebody) because I am going to make my own shaving soap and put it directly into the bowl before gifting it to my son.</li>
    <li> When I received this item it was missing the brush. In the description when I purchased it and on the box it said it was suppose to come with the brush. When the item arrived the brush was not in the box. I went to Amazon to contact the seller, and there was not an option to contact the seller. I therefore, I had to buy another brush. It is very disappointing as this was a gift.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that making the switch from disposable multi-blade razors to the double-edged safety razor was one of the smartest decisions I&#x27;ve made as a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first shave set I purchased to go along with my double edged safety razor and my review is from said perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap and brush are both perfectly fine, don&#x27;t let the other reviews convince you otherwise.  Sure the brush is not the softest, most luxurious available, but it creates a lather effectively...so it does its job.  If you&#x27;re a seasoned veteran in the world of shaving and want to have the most expensive brush available, obviously you won&#x27;t be buying your brush from a set.  For the average user, though, this kit provides everything that is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-No frills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product! A+</li>
    <li> I got this today from a local grocery store for 9.99, they only had a highfalutin 28.88 dollar one a walmart that came with a stand for the brush/ safety razor and a mug and different soap. I took it out of the box tried to put the bowl on a filled counter, the bowl fell off 36 inches maybe and it didn&#x27;t break. I wouldn&#x27;t advise it, but I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t break. I got a nice thin lather with the soap and brush, and it&#x27;s better than Barbosol. I saw a video on youtube that got a really thick lather, but I didn&#x27;t try for that. I got the feel of dryness when it came off, but now that my face is dry all the way it feels nice and smooth and not unmoisturized dry like dry skin feeling and I didn&#x27;t but lotion after, so I&#x27;m happy. Maybe, I&#x27;ll to this if there are issues.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my husband.  Product was exactly as described.  Very pleased with this purchase and can&#x27;t wait to give it at christmas.</li>
    <li> Just found that a set like this was perfect for me! All-in-one! You cannot buy any kind of shaving soaps in Thailand - this fact was the main reason!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. shave soap is very gentle on skin. tip: brush needs to be stored bristles down for proper drying. This was a suprise gift for my husband that he enjoys.</li>
    <li> Nice set to start with. Both the bowl and brush are nice. The soap is alright. Could always use it up and get a scented bar.</li>
    <li> I bought this with my first DE razor so that I could try using a bowl and brush without being out a ton of money if I didn&#x27;t like it. Keep in mind that I have no experience with any other brushes so although this is probably a cheap brush, it is just my starting point. The brush does leave some hairs (1 or 2) when I use it with my shave soap but the brush works well for me. The shave soap I just replaced with a better soap and kept the original for a &amp;#34;just in case I run out,&amp;#34; moment. I would recommend this as a starter kit with your DE razor to see if you wanna spend the money on some higher quality products.</li>
    <li> Love the old time shaving fun! Works great with hot foam around the face. My face is smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality set, but im still using the brush and bowl today, nice if you want to try using a double edged safety razor, still works great using a regular safety razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set because I switched back from an electric shaver after a few years because I was tired of expensive replacement blades and the internal battery died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set has reintroduced me to the joy of wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a nice little bowl.  It fits in my hand nicely and the high wall keeps most of the lather in the bowl without creeping out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a really solid brush.  I soak mine in hot water for a few minutes while i get everything ready and it feel great and works up a nice lather.  It has dropped a few bristles since I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks but nothing really noticeable. I wish the handle was shorter but that&#x27;s just my preference.  The handle is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is ok.  I had a hard time getting a rich lather out of it in the bowl.  I had much better luck working it up in my hand.  I soak the soap, still in the plastic container, in hot water until is a little mushy and pliable. Then i load the brush up by messing it around in the soap a while.  If you get it hot and wet it makes a surprisingly good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have been five stars if it were not for dropping a few hairs from the brush and the time it takes the soap to soak.</li>
    <li> It was everything I hoped it would be and more . It has every thing anyone needs to get the job done right.</li>
    <li> I will be home in 9:00</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ITEM!  NEVER USE CAN SHAVE CREAM AT HOME AGAIN..GOOD LATHER, CONVENIENT SIZE-FITS IN A DRAWER IN THE BATHROOM BY THE SINK. SMELLS GREAT..CANT WAIT TO TRY OTHER SOAPS! HIGHLY RECOMMEND PRODUCT AND SELLER!</li>
    <li> Good, inexpensive starter kit for the new wet shaver.  The soap seems a little hard and takes a lot of practice to get a proper lather.  The brush sheds a little, but not too bad after the first few shaves.</li>
    <li> HAVEN,T USED ONE OF THESE FOR YEARS. FORGOT HOW GOOD IT WAS TO  GET A GOOD LATHER. WOULD BUY AGAIN, BUT THIS WILL LAST FOR YEARS.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  The first one arrived broken.  Received another one and it was in great shape.  My husband loved it.  We&#x27;re getting back to basics and were very surprised to find one of these shaving bowls.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaving brush, bowl, and soap set for the price.  I would recommend this for someone who wants to use a shaving brush and soap combo but doesn&#x27;t want to spring for the more expensive brushes especially of you&#x27;re just starting to experiment with wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend so he could try a straight razor.  Its a neat little set, only problem is the bowl was broken when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Gives me a good enough lather to get a good shave in.  The bowl seems fine and the puck sits well in there.  The puck will seem to last forever.  Probably 12 months for me at 1-2 shaves per week.  The brush is probably the only small issue as I have pulled two bristles off my face under the lather.  Is that the end of the world, Absolutely not but will probably need to upgrade/replace that someday.  I would highly recommend as a cheap newbie set to see if you want to get into SR shaving, then just upgrade the brush later on once your a pro</li>
    <li> My brother loves old fashioned barber shops and shaves and anything that makes him feel more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. I ordered a single blade razor for him for Christmas but felt that wasn&#x27;t enough so wanted to complete the set for him. Along with a leather sharpening belt and a display stand for the razor and brush, this Shave Set by Van Der Hagen goes perfectly with it. It came in a timely manner and definitely on time for the Holidays!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t compare the quality of the soap and brush to individual items which cost more than this entire set.  I bought this for my husband who was switching from a Mach 3 to a Merkur.  This was good enough for him to get an idea of whether or not he wanted to stick with it.  He has used it for about five months, shaving only once every ~3 days, and he almost needs a new brush.  There&#x27;s still plenty of soap, however.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for people not sure if they want to dive into shaving with a safety razor. The shave soap lathers up nicely, the bowl is good to begin with, and the brush rocks as long as you take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have is my brush fell off of the handle about 3 days ago (December 10th). I&#x27;ve had the brush since February 20th. I would have maybe 1 hair come loose every 3 shaves. For this price though, you can&#x27;t beat it. I know that I like shaving with my safety razor, and it&#x27;s time to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> its a wonderful product my face felt wonderful during and after my shave the brush feels great and really massages your face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a soap bowl and brush.  That&#x27;s what I wanted.  However, it tells you how to use the product.  For years I have always thought you ran hot water into the bowl.  I have learned that you wet the brush and then swirl it on the soap.  The wetter the brush, the more the lather.  The soap should last longer too.  Thank you..</li>
    <li> The shave set was purchased as an introduction to DE shaving. It is the quality that you would expect at this price level. The brush sheds quite a bit, even after using for a month. The soap is pleasant and the bowl is, well, a bowl. Will replace the brush when it wears out with something of higher quality.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than a month now. Only irritant is that almost everyday one or two hair of the brush falls off. Other than that.. it does the work.</li>
    <li> good price for everything; brush is not badger, but i can use it for travel kit...would be 5 stars if a simple badger brush were included.</li>
    <li> Wonderful basic set for a man who is just starting out using a brush and soap. He&#x27;s been using it for 3 months now and has had no problems. He loves it. I cannot speak for the soap, because I make my husband&#x27;s soap--he ususes this kit for the brush and the bowl, which is the perfect size for my round soaps.</li>
    <li> happy with this purchase, price was right.</li>
    <li> The items are as described. They arrived on time. The bowl was a perfect size (not too big to hold while lathering up. The soap has a nice fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price. I use this bowl and brush 3-5 times a week and it performs as expected. It took a while to come but just as advertised. If u r looking for something fast buy it locally. If u can wait a while this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Obviously this is not for old school die-hard wet shaving enthusiasts yet still easily beats using canned shaving foam/gel.     The dish is exactly as it appears, decent looking but nothing too exciting.     The brush is a low grade boar hair brush that is unlikely to last more than a few months. I&#x27;ve used mine about 6 weeks and it is shot which is what I was looking for when I decided  to write this review. The brush should be hanged upside down(bristles down) to allow for proper drying and prolong it&#x27;s life. I did not do so and merely turned it up on it&#x27;s end when done shaving, consequently the hairs have prematurely worn.    Personally I like the soap, it has a very mild yet pleasant odor and contains Aloe and Shea Butter. My skin is moderately dry and this helps lubricate for a comfortable shave while moistening my  face simultaneously.    This shave set is nothing that will last years but is ideal to get a sense of if you wish to pursue wet shaving/using a brush and soap in the future. It does not lather nearly as well as a quality brush but is sufficient for a comfortable and close shave. The soap will likely last you 3-6 months so coupled with the bowl it is worth the price. You can find double edged razor blades for a safety razor in local stores for less than $2.00/10 blades. These blades offer a much closer shave than any cartridge I have used and are significantly less costly. I would encourage all men to at least try it so you too can rid yourself of the burden of a lifetime of expensive razor/cartridge replacements. Actually this is a brilliant marketing idea for a company who sells higher grade safety razors/straight razors/shaving soaps/bowls/shave kits as it is enough to experience it at a low cost.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about a month (using it 2-3 times per week), then the glue that held the bristles in place failed causing chunks of the hairs to fall out of the handle. Not worth the aggravation. Going to pay double for a better quality brush.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!  The brush feels good on the skin, the soap lathers well and smells nice without being perfumy.  The bowl is the perfect size, large enough to stay put on the counter and small enough to fit in the hand.  I&#x27;ve tried both ways and both work.  I use mine with my Parker Razors, nice smooth shave and I&#x27;m not throwing away a can or using any propellant.    Wish it came in choice of color.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my skeptical husband.  Well, he should listen to his wife more often because he LOVES it.  The soap is wonderful, and he has sensitive skin. He even stated that I&#x27;d better not steal his soap to use for my legs!  The brush is holding together just fine and it has been used for more than three months now.  I don&#x27;t know what other people are doing to the brush to make it fall apart, but it only gets used for a few moments every day.  The bowl works perfectly.  I think I will buy one for my \\&quot;green\\&quot; son-in-law who is jealousy eying the set.  Here is a case where going green is cheaper and BETTER!  Update:  After using this set for a year and a half, it is still going strong.  My husband just opened his second bar of soap and the brush...yes the cheapo boar bristle brush...is still working just fine.  My son and my son-in-law are now converted to this method of shaving, and their sets are also holding up with no problems.  Makes a GREAT gift!</li>
    <li> As a relatively new straight razor shaver, I may not have a lot to compare this set to, but let me tell you my thoughts.  I have uber sensitive skin and I was a little hesitant when my wife picked this *very* inexpensive set up for me.  It works fantastic!  Looks to be decent construction.  The brush works well and is not at all scratchy or anything.  The soap has a very clean smell - not stinky or flowery fragrant and lathers great.  The lather easily lasts throughout the shave.  What I can really tell you is that when I run out of soap or if I break something in the set.  I am getting more of this.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> a great intro to wet shaving. The soap has a nice mild scent and provides a good lather. The brush held more water than I expected which makes for a better lather. All in all a good value</li>
    <li> I really just bought these items because I wanted the bowl. The soap has good lather and smells good. The brush is o.k. but I&#x27;ve noticed that on the first shave the bristles started falling out. In all its a decent starter set, for not a lot of money, if your interested in shaving old school style.</li>
    <li> I hate the multi-blade razors in the big stores.  Besides being way over priced, they are less comfortable.  I am never going back to multi-blade razors again.</li>
    <li> Will get the job done. Great starter set for the price. Don&#x27;t think it can be beat for the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this set by mistake. I wanted to by another set by Van Der Hagen where the bowl has a small handle  or grip. Having said that the bowl is ok ( although a handle would be good). The brush works well and the soap was not to my liking ( doesn&#x27;t lubricate enough)</li>
    <li> This really a great kit to start with or as part of  a Dopp kit for travel. The brush is very good, It softens up with a hot soak but remains firm enough to massage your face and beard.  I like boar bristle better than  my badger brush personally (notwithstanding popular opinion). The soap has a  mild but pleasant scent and melts easily into the cup.  The cup is a charmer, small enough to pack and large enough to whip up a good lather.  Actually I wish they sold the cups separately because I would like to have another, but considering the price, I can just buy another kit.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great. Great set. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times and it does the job but I still prefer the can stuff.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical buying this one after reading a lot of reviews from unhappy customers. I set my brush in warm water for 5 mins prior to shaving and that seemed to have a profound effect on the quality and amount of lather. also i wash the brush thoroughly and let it dry upside down. so far i like it. come on, a brush and a bowl for that price? you can beat it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!! It gives him soft skin afterward!!</li>
    <li> For the price this is an awesome set, I&#x27;ve only used it about 4 times but all seems well regarding overall quality.  The brush seems fine but time will tell, I know some users have had issues with brissels falling out but I have had no such problem yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets and gifted them.</li>
    <li> You will not find a set better at $10, so some credit should be given where credit is due. Just be aware that the brush may fall apart after a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m making this review after over 3-4 years of use. The brush head fell off since it&#x27;s only glued on. I attempted to epoxy it back on, and then driving a nail through both brush head and handle, and then epoxying it back on which helped for a while but it eventually fell apart again. I&#x27;m not complaining too much because it did give me many years of service. If you&#x27;re unsure of using a brush and bowl to start shaving then this is a decent starter set. If the brush fall apart on you like it did for me at the very least you get to use the soap and the bowl you can probably use forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are in it for the long haul go ahead and buy a Tweezerman brush and Tabac shaving soap. I love these two items. The soap is adequate, but really there&#x27;s no turning back once you&#x27;ve tried other shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t expect that much at this price point. The tweezerman brush alone cost as much as this set, and Tabac shaving soap cost twice that, albeit it&#x27;s at a much larger quantity, but you&#x27;ll be able to get a good lather very quickly with very little soap with these two items.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift to go with a straight razor. He loved it! It was as advertised and sent promptly!</li>
    <li> This set is a reasonable set of kit to begin wet shaving.  Brush does a decent job of building lather.  Bowl is quite nice it fits in the palm of the hand quite well.  Soap is just OK.  I am beginning to experiment with a few brands and include creams as well as soaps.  Currently like the proraso white but plan to try kiss my face and a couple others.</li>
    <li> Great starter set. I have converted a few of my friends to the wet shaving recently. I always tell them to order this kit or pick it up at walmart. The soap works great, not the greatest smelling one but works well. The brush is the perfect size for me. It looses a hair or two per shave. But I still like it better then two of the more expensive brushes I have bought since.</li>
    <li> I have learned to shave with this mug and brush and a double edged razor. The entire experience is pleasurable, economical, environmentally friendly, and I get a better shave. No small part is the convenience of re-lathering to shave more closely. The brush and mug far surpass aerosol cans of dubious content.</li>
    <li> Really good starter set; especially for the price. I have been using it for about a month now on a weekly basis and really like it.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted from this shave kit. thanl you so much for selling them. my barber to be was very happy.</li>
    <li> Gee its freaking soap in a cup with a brush. Oh great stuff I will buy more to put under the sink. NO just kidding. can&#x27;t find the stuff in any local stores so I buy it on the net</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, works as expected.</li>
    <li> I got this kit for my boyfriend. He has VERY sensitive skin and this, in combination with a safety razor, are the smoothest shave he&#x27;s ever had. No more irritation and for such a good price! I like that he can get refills at Walmart since he isn&#x27;t likely to order online. Overall, he&#x27;s a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great for your first brush and bowl. A decent soap. It&#x27;s not spectacular, but it&#x27;s a good soap to get used to shaving with a soap and not a foam from a can. And for almost $9.00, you get a decent kit. The bowl is average sized, enough to start out with. The brush isn&#x27;t bad, a great brush to learn how to make a lather with. Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> The bristles fall apart slowly..</li>
    <li> very good deal. been using mine for months now. no problems with the brush. just rinse it out and its good for the next day.</li>
    <li> I was raised using shaving cream from a can... I found that I didn&#x27;t like the way my face felt using the cream from a can. I quite for several years using anything but water. I had a friend tell me that I would love the way of how my face wouold feel after a shave if I was using the shaving soap and Van Der Hagen is an excellent soap. I Love how smooth my face feels while shaving and after I am done shaving... I would recommend this product as an every day way to shave..</li>
    <li> Just ok. The brush not of that good quality. But love the bowl.For the price its ok.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re interested in getting this product, then it is the product for you.  It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re hoping for.  The bowl is well made, the shaving soap puck is good, and the brush is a great starter brush.  It&#x27;s boar hair, not badger, but boar hair has a following and it is plenty good for a first brush.  I still can&#x27;t believe that they can make all this for under $9.  They sell this kit at Walmart if you want to take a look at it.</li>
    <li> I bought this approximately one year ago with a safety razor and blades.  I absolutely love the move to the safety razor- the shave is wonderful once you get used to it, and the cost per blade is under 10 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my understanding that it&#x27;s best to move to a brush if you use a safety razor.  After a year of use, I can say that the brush makes no difference at all.  High quality gel works far better than the old school brush and soap (I use Gilette gel sold in 4 packs at Costco).  Shaving immediately after a shower (or during if you&#x27;re skilled) makes the biggest difference of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this product:&lt;br /&gt;-The SOAP smells like my grandfather&#x27;s basement, and my girlfriend hates the scent it leaves on my face.&lt;br /&gt;-The BRUSH looses bristles after the first few uses, and the bristles get stuck on your face.&lt;br /&gt;-The BOWL is nothing extraordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy high quality gel.  Old school razors are great and cheap.  Old school lather is unneeded and overrated.</li>
    <li> This is a basic shaving set, nothing fancy just what is needed, which is exactly my style.  I recently started looking into upgrading my shaving routine and swapping out the foam-in-a-can stuff I&#x27;ve been using for years for something nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have to say I wish I&#x27;d switched sooner, the brush is soft and lathers up very well, the bowl is ceramic but seems sturdy and the shaving soap has a good scent to it and provided me with a great shave.  Overall I&#x27;d recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their shave routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I might purchase a nicer set and keep this one as a back-up for travel but for the foreseeable future it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for myself and ended up giving it as a present.&lt;br /&gt;Though the receiver was pretty happy with it, I was personally disappointed with the brush and soap. The soap spreads well and evenly across the face, but leaves the face feeling dry and less ready to shave. (Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t bode well with my skin type.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little green bowl is actually pretty neat to foam up the soap. However I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a set like this, got it for him for Christmas and he really likes it!  Thank you for offering this item!</li>
    <li> This brush has lasted me nearly a year now and doesn&#x27;t show any signs of needing replaced.  The soap dish looks great and works very well.  The soap worked well enough, but I prefer a different soap that comes in it&#x27;s own container so if you want to use this soap dish then it requires you to have a loose piece of soap.  But it still looks great :)</li>
    <li> You are actually getting what you are paying for. The brush is rough. The soap is... soap. The lather dish is a dish. Spend the extra dough and get something of real quality.</li>
    <li> A really beat kit and loved the brush and soap. My hubby never used anything like this always the canned foam. He like it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Liked the bowl nice and stout. Soap is ok.  Brush loses hairs like crazy.  Hopefully the hair loss stops in time.  Will keep you posted</li>
    <li> Yes, you can get better quality. As is always the case. But this set, for the price, is a great way to get into wet shaving and to make shaving a more pleasurable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a bowl. Nothing really to review. It doesn&#x27;t blow up when you touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a little hard right out of the box, and needs to be soaked in warm soapy water and you need to inspect for loose bristles. I worked up a good soapy lather on mine and then let mine soak in hot water for ten minutes. Then let it dry out. After that I pulled out any loose bristles, which I found about ten or so. The next day I used it for a shave after the same routine. I have fairly sensitive skin and the brush, when well lathered did a good job of applying without irritating. Not the softest thing ever but none of these brushes are in my experience. They have to be firm to work up a lather. Over all good job if you don&#x27;t mind losing a bristle on your face every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap. It did lather up well and smells really good. Got a good shave with it. The only thing for me is that my skin felt very dry after. Not sure if that&#x27;s a personal thing or if it&#x27;s just not good quality. I won&#x27;t be finishing off the soap, and will be trying out others due to this. Have shaved a few times with it and my face feels much better after with other shave products. Even with other products I still use the brush and bowl, which work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion. If money is of no object, and you are really into shaving, get better gear. Get a good quality brush and a really quality soap. If you are low on cash and just want to try out the experience of wet shaving, then give this a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started shaving with a straight edge razor. Before I used this kit, I wanted to use up some of the can shaving cream I had. I&#x27;ve found the soap in this kit works much better. I don&#x27;t know if there is a conditioner in it or what. The blade slides across your skin much smother and and no burn. I also like the idea of no more can going to the land fill.</li>
    <li> for those of us who use a mug and brush this a nice little set&lt;br /&gt;and should serve you well</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the brush seems to lose a couple bristles each time I use it after about a month worth of use.  The soap and bowl are wonderful and even the shedding isn&#x27;t that much of a problem for the brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several cheap brush and bowl sets in the past and this one seems to be of a little higher quality. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that the boar hairs fall out of the brush handle, and that did happen at first but 4 or 5 shaves in it has stopped shedding. The brush is fairly soft and holds a good amount of water. The soap is actually very nice with a mild nice smell and leathers nicely. The bowl is fairly heavy and of good quality. With the price it is a 5 star product! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This shave set does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. You certainly can spend more on a shave set. But do you really need to?</li>
    <li> I just started manual shaving and needed shaving soap, a shaving brush, and a bowl. The brush is well constructed, even if it does have a plastic handle (what else would you expect at this price?) The bowl is...well...a bowl. Good size for its purpose. And, the soap has worked well so far, but, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. Great set to start with.</li>
    <li> If you want to get into wet shaving this is a great way to start out. It comes with everything you need, soap, brush and a nice little soap bowl. The soap smells great and will leave your face soft. The brush may feel a little rough at first but it softens after a good washing with the included soap. The brush handle is made of plastic so for those of you that can only touch gold you may want to stay away or you will melt and die as some other reviewer said. For those that don&#x27;t have a problem with a little black plastic handle on the brush i highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The boar brush in this kit is basically like a broom.  It takes longer to make lather, doesn&#x27;t hold as much water, and then tears up my face to the point that I can have moderate \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; just by working the soap on with the brush and then washing it off without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the bowl&#x27;s decent and the soap is decent.  You can do it with a $1 mug but I find having a decent shave bowl makes things more pleasant.  There&#x27;s better soap, like Saint Charle&#x27;s Shave, but VDH isn&#x27;t exactly bad; soap is a pretty personal preference anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I&#x27;d recommend with this is to spend the $12 for a Tweezerman brush and abandon that boar brush.  Unless your skin is as sensitive as a brick, scrubbing your face with what amounts to a stiff toothbrush is going to hurt.  It&#x27;s like having a sandpaper, cotton, or silk handkerchief; you definitely want cotton, unless you&#x27;re going to throw the $100 for a 10 inch square of silk (and the $120 for a Shavemac brush, which I personally would but not as my first brush).</li>
    <li> I think this shave set will make a GREAT addition to your shaving routine. For yourself or as a gift, you couldn&#x27;t go wrong either way. If you&#x27;ve just discovered the old/new world of wet-shaving or you&#x27;re an old hand at it, this 3 piece set WILL find some good use.    The brush is your typical 100% natural boar brush. It&#x27;s inexpensive and does the job without frills. It might not soak up as much water or feel better on your face than a badger brush but it does what it was intended to do. When you absolutely can&#x27;t have anything synthetic touching your face, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that it even comes with that wonderful wet animal smell in the beginning. A few hairs will fall out, the handle is plastic and if you drop it or lose it....who cares!?    I have found the Van der Hagen soap provides a better and closer shave than some Italian imports. I can best describe the smell of this soap as having a very slight baby powder fragrance. The smell quickly dissipates and it is not overpowering. This soap lathers up better than my $9.00 Omega Menthol and Glycerin soap. It&#x27;s also slicker and doesn&#x27;t dry out as quick. For guys with sensitive skin, if you haven&#x27;t tried VDH soap, give your wallet and face a break by trying this stuff.     The ceramic bowl looks nice and appears well made. Based on the picture here, I was expecting the brush and bowl to be black but the dark color is actually navy blue. Still it looks very good. I no longer see this set sold locally. If you purchase through here, you should feel confident knowing that it should arrive in perfect condition as it was WELL packed with bubble wrap.    For only a little money, you can get a nice bowl that will last forever, an excellent soap everyone should try and a good brush. If you absolutely have to have a badger hair brush to shave, this brush makes a great utility brush as well...think computer keyboard and computer tower, car console etc...</li>
    <li> I would rate this higher if it wasn&#x27;t for the bowl. The first time I used it I was going to set it down on the counter and when I was about 2 inches away it slipped. I wouldn&#x27;t expect much damage from such a short distance to fall but the thing nearly cracked in half.    The brush itself is good and the soap is also fine. If you have a replacement you can use for the bowl then this will get the job done.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Item arrived as advertised. Does not lather that well. Bristles fall out of the shaving brush. OK product.</li>
    <li> The brush is very hard, it pokes your skin. The soap is very weak and does not provide a rich lather. My hand soap works better.  But comes with  a very nice bowl!</li>
    <li> I got this starter kit when I bought my first safety razor to begin on my trip through wet shaving.  I have had it for at least three months, and I can say that this has been a great starter kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Has everything that you need besides the safety razor and replacement blades.  Comes with it&#x27;s own bowl, shave soap, and brush.  The soap is nice and mild, and reminds me of a barber shop.  The bowl is perfectly sized to fit in my hand.  The brush, despite having a plastic handle, still has plenty stiff bristles, which is the way I like my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bowl, despite the finish, can still be slippery in a wet hand.  Would have liked for the finish to be a bit tackier or have a handle.  The brush still sheds, despite months of use, and the plastic handle feels flimsy and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:  So far I believe that the kit has been a great introduction to wet shaving.  However, I would recommend that when you receive the kit, before you use the brush, that you soak it a bit in hot water to soften it up a little bit.  Then, you should probably melt the soap into the bowl, since otherwise it will slip and slide around when trying to use it with the brush.  Just keep an eye on it when you do, since it will bubble.  When the time comes for me to buy new soap, I will be buying a new brush as well.  Not because it is necessary, but because I am tired of the shedding.  Also, I recommend that first time wet shavers you go to youtube and look up the user mantic59.  He has an excellent series on the basics of wet shaving and how to get started.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if I wanted to get into DE shaving. Good cheap set that has most of what you need (I paired it with [[ASIN:B0050HO9MI Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle]] and [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] to start as cheaply as I could.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting different soap so I barely used what came with it but it worked fine when I used it. The brush however was losing hair from the first time I used it and is being replaced already after about 2 months of daily use. This isn&#x27;t so bad as I just wanted to see if I liked shaving this way and I do so I&#x27;m already upgrading both the brush and razor. I&#x27;ll keep using the bowl however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to someone who wants to see if DE or straight razor shaving is for them.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I bought a single blade double sided razor.  The razor and single blade were thrown in the trash after I used them one time but I kept using the shave set with my 5 blade razor it smells and works great and it is lasting a very long time so I am saving money to pay for the expensive 5 blade razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent beginner set.</li>
    <li> Great Book, Good Shape...</li>
    <li> This is a Very nice starter set for those getting into wet shaving, the brush did &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; a bit the first couple uses but that has settled down with use.  I would recommend to anyone getting started, I have been using this set for a few months now and really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> slower than cream in a can but feels good brushing it on.</li>
    <li> Good bowl and soap. The brush is meh. But fantastic starting out kit</li>
    <li> You get a pretty neat brush, a piece o&#x27; soap, and a little soup bowl you can use or throw out.  Anyway it&#x27;s cheaper than the other brushes and works great.  Mine didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great value. The brush is boar, yet after a few uses it softens up nicely. The soap is satisfactory with a very light scent. It makes a good lather and is much better than goop in a can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to wet shaving, give this product a try. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> My son received this for Christmas.  He said it was &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.  New generation.  New word... I think it means mediocre.</li>
    <li> Great buy fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have never used shave soap before and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. It makes for a very smooth shave even after a weeks growth.</li>
    <li> *I have only been shaving with a safety razor for 3 weeks*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said, this seems like a really great set. I wanted to get something cheap just in case I hated shaving the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way. This set is great for me (I&#x27;m a girl that uses this to shave my legs and underarms). The brush I a little bit rough but I actually like that because he seems to help exfoliate my legs, then the soap is very moisturizing. I am finding that I don&#x27;t need lotion nearly as much as I did before! All in all this is a great set. I will buy a refill of the soap and eventually I might invest in a badger brush over a boars brush just to see if I like the difference or not.</li>
    <li> I gave this product four stars because of the value, you can&#x27;t buy a brush, ceramic bowl and soap any cheaper.  The bowl is heavier and better than I expected, which was for it to be a hard plastic; the soap bar has a nice scent, but not over powering in fragrance.  The brush is okay, it holds a minimal amount of lather, has a somewhat wild scent, and leaves bristles when used the first few times.  Buy this set if you want to try making your own shaving lather and not spend a lot of money in the effort.</li>
    <li> It feels so nice to massage the soap onto your face in a nice lather. It feels like it&#x27;s revitalizing your skin. The really nice part is that the soap isn&#x27;t all watery; it foams up really well. I just made my own stand for the brush out of an extra wire hanger I had (felt good to use something that was just laying around).</li>
    <li> this set cost me $9 total including shipping. so i didn&#x27;t have high expectations. after looking online i saw that the soap that come with it goes for about $3.5 and bowls around $8 up. by the way the also sell the soap and bowl set with out a brush for ten bucks. a dollar more then this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yea i read the review that said the brush that come with it tends to fall apart a few weeks to months. so bought the set with the intentions that if i enjoyed this type of shaving i would upgrade to a better brush and if i didn&#x27;t i would only lose $9. i used the set for two week and enjoyed it enough to invest a whole $20 on a nicer brush and am very satisfied. although i do have to wonder. i&#x27;ve been reading on wet shaving forums that losing a few hairs in the beginning is common and that if you break in the brush properly before hand after the first week or two you shouldn&#x27;t lose any more or very few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/s/ref&#x3D;nb_sb_noss?url&#x3D;search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords&#x3D;Semogue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wonder if people are breaking in properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really like the bowl, it is a simple one with out a handle that fits nicely into the palm of my hand and into the medicine cabinet after use. if it had a handle like is common then it wouldn&#x27;t fit into the cabinet. it is very thick porcelain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really like the soap but don&#x27;t have any experience to compare it to. so plan on using different soaps to find which one i like best.</li>
    <li> Great product , I think the brush is feels very good , the soap is gentle the bowl is cool ,, nice job. Great price</li>
    <li> Nothing at all wrong with this product. As expected, the brush lost a few hairs after the 1st couple uses but it seems to have settled. I like the smell of the soap and the bowl is perfectly fine. If you aren&#x27;t getting a thick lather, just add a little more water. The boar hair works fine on my beard.</li>
    <li> very economical, nice close shave. very good purchase. better than creams. easier to use than i expected too. good product</li>
    <li> Everything I was expecting. I am completely satisfied. Great value. I highly recommend it and would also recommend as a gift.</li>
    <li> this is THE first kit you should buy. the price is great and the quality you get is perfect. the brush is soft and feels nice and works well, the bowl is of good quality, and while the soap leaves something to desire as far as lubricating the face, it has a nice scent. buy it for your first kit for sure.</li>
    <li> WellI started out knowing nothing of the DE shaving world. My friends told me order an inexpensive set (razor + acc) and go from there. I decided to splurge on a $30-40 razor and use this inexpensive shave set with it. This was a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave set comes with a very nice bowl, soap, and boar hair brush. The brush is great and not too soft like some cheaper brushes. The soap is basic but has a clean fresh scent that my wife loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overally this set is a substantial value and is great for those new to the DE world!</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased a straight razor.  While I didn&#x27;t need the bowl, I did need another brush &amp; another bar of Shaving soap.  I had seen this set at the CVS at the corner by my home &amp; figured, what the hell let me get it.  And you know.....I don&#x27;t regret it one bit!  The small bowl is almost perfect (it could be a bit deeper/taller) but it allows me to lather the shaving soap better &amp; also allows me to get the lather in my brush better.  The boar bristle brush is much better than the synthetic bristle brush that I was using (I still want to get the badger brush, but you know, the boar&#x27;s bristle brush is pretty good.).  And the Van Der Hagen Shaving soap is a great improvement over what I was using.&lt;br /&gt;  So do yourself a favor &amp; get this set&lt;br /&gt;************************************************UPDATE**********************************&lt;br /&gt;  As of today (9/21/2014), several of my friends &amp; coworkers have become interested in shaving with a Shave Soap &amp; Shave Brush like I have been doing for the past several months.  In the past two months, I have purchased 5 of these sets for 3 friends &amp; 2 Co-Workers.  And they ALL LOVE them!  One of my co-worker&#x27;s wives loves what it has done for him so much, she had him ask me if there were Shave Soap Pucks for women (Which there are, Van Der Hagen makes a duel Shave Soap Puck/Shower Soap for women)!&lt;br /&gt;  So if you are sitting on the fence on wheather this is something you should do.......Get this Shave Set from Van der Hagen &amp; give it a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for starting to use real razors. The soap is good and the brush is fine. I wish the bowl was bigger but it still works fine. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I found this on the related items tab when i bought my straight edge. i&#x27;ve been shaving with a disposable single blade for over a year and now i&#x27;m venturing out to the solid shave soap now. it is a pretty heavy, ceramic bowl. didn&#x27;t break without any extra packaging, and i am overseas at an APO so it was handled a little extra more than usual mail. the brush feels good after a good wash with hot water. i let it sit in some hot water for a little bit just to soften up the bristles as i imagined it was a cheap plastic. it is actually a synthetic hair brush which makes me think of the three stooges when i lather up. a few stray fibers fell out on my first try but its good now. the soap is pleasant without any pungent odor and moisturizes as well. thickness of the lather is based on how much water you add so its all a matter of preference. all in all, a good set to start out with that is affordable.</li>
    <li> This kit does exactly what it is supposed to do.  The bowl is (obviously) the right size for the soap.  The brush needed to be broken-in, and lost a few bristles the first few times I used it, but works very well, now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.  The soap lathers well, has a pleasant scent, and seems to have an excellent moisturizing effect that helps to prevent razor burn and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  This is a great starter set.</li>
    <li> The brush is 100% boar-hair, and really massages the extra-soft soap into the beard. Makes for a very enjoyable shave, regardless of razor. Plus it&#x27;s more fun than using a can of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> The set is as described. The only reproach I could do is that some hairs of the brush sometimes come off  but I guess it would do the same with a more expansive product.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect shaving set to get started on wet shaving or just regular shaving. The soap is really good and it last 10 times more then the shaving cans. the brush is ok  is not the best but for the prize is well worth it. As long as you take care of it, it should last fro a couple of months just make sure to hang it so it can dry properly. For me the bowl is the best part i don&#x27;t use it to make a lather i just leave the soap their. I prefer to make the lather straight in my face when I shave. I have make a really good lather with the bowl but for me is a little annoying since the bowl is pretty small.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend already had a straight razor and a few other classic shaving tools except for a bowl and brush. He loves it and says it works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in April 2012. This was my first purchase of a shaving brush. September 2013 the bristles fell out of the brush. Not really complaining, you get what you pay for. I would simply say that if you shave every day and need a brush to last longer than 18 months you might consider getting a little nicer brush. For the first year this brush worked as well as a shaving brush can. In retrospect I really didn&#x27;t want to order a new brush each year and most folks want a longer lasting brush. So, buyer be ware.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the job ! I bought this as a present for a friend&#x27;s son and he absolutely adores it. The perfect result.</li>
    <li> I like this set, but do not love it. Great for a starter set. The soap is great, only one I have used so far and love it. The brush on it&#x27;s own is wonderful. Only a few bristles have fallen out and that was in the beginning. It feels good on my face. The bowl is more of a cup, which makes It is a little small for the job. Overall I am happy with the purchase, but will be looking for something better soon.</li>
    <li> Brush is something that you need to be aware&lt;br /&gt;While applying soap there was a lot of hair falling of from the brush , to be perfectly honest more of the brush was on my face than the facial hair I intended to shave .</li>
    <li> Nice starter set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar hair brush is pretty nice, the soap smells very masculine, the bowl is a bowl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to soak your brush in hot water.  Watch plenty of youtube vids on how to shave with a DE razor.</li>
    <li> I give this product a try and found that the lather works better for me then shaving cream.  Product arrive quickly and with no issues.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for anyone starting out with straight razor shaving, without setting you back too far. I highly recommend this set for novices and pros alike.</li>
    <li> Under $9 shipped for my shave soap, brush and bowl to mix?  I doubt you can find a better deal out there.  I have used this four times already and have no complaints.  This is a very good beginners wet shaving product, or for those on a budget.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The brush lost some hairs as I was using it. Might want to buy a better brush.</li>
    <li> Great start if you are getting into straight razor shaving. The soap is way smoother and gives you a nice shave. I also use it to shave my head. Works great!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this set. Lathers very well and nice looking set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for about a week and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. The brush seems to lose a bristle or two each shave, but I&#x27;m not that worried with it. If I keep at this, I&#x27;ll probably step up to a nice brush long before this one would deteriorate.     I don&#x27;t follow the directions on the box, but instead use some tips I read online...  I grabbed an old coffee mug and dropped the soap in there and kept the bowl just for lather building. Run HOT water into the bowl/brush to get it all warm, add enough hot water to the soap to just cover the indented area. Squeeze out the brush and begin working it into the soap and get it really loaded up- takes me 30secs or so of plunging/swirling it on the soap. Then I empty the hot water from my bowl and begin working up a lather in it, adding just a trickle of hot water to it as needed (you&#x27;ll have to experiment to see what works here). Once you get it how you want it- it takes me up to a minute to get a nice lather- apply it to your face using up/down strokes.    Anyway, the set seems like a good value for the money- don&#x27;t hesitate to try it for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased from Rite-Aid my very own Van Der Hagen Shave Set today and could not wait to use it. WOW! I hate to say it but that boar brush felt better than my Art Of Shaving Pure Badger brush. It was strong and made a great lather with the soap it can with. Not to thick, but just the right amount on my face. The brush really made my face come alive with every swirl. And then I painted my face with the lether after that. The shave was done with my Parker 22R Butterfly Safety De razor and man did I get a close, clean shave that left my face feeling smooth, clean and refreshed. I don&#x27;t beleive you have to spend a lot on getting something good. I like to try out new and inexpensive products and more times than few, they are better. I lost a few hairs from the brush, but so did my pure badger. But a ceramic hand dipped bowl, soap and brush for $9.99, come on...you can&#x27;t beat that. This will remain in my wet shaving line up collection as a weekly product alone with my Taylor Of Old Bond Street cream, Art Of Shaving Cream, Williams Mug Soap and Col. Conk soap. I look at it like this, if the shoe fits, wear it. Once you go outside and people see the finished product(Your face) they won&#x27;t know you used a $2.00 soap or a $5.00 brush. It&#x27;s your own little secert.</li>
    <li> This was the first shave soap I ever used! It&#x27;s cheap and works great! This set gets you well on your way to a better shave!   The soap works well in hard water, something a lot of brands can&#x27;t say! Also, it&#x27;s easily my #1 scent! Smells wonderful!   The brush is pretty cheap and only lasted a month or so, but worked well.  For the price, order this kit and stop wasting time and money on canned cream!</li>
    <li> Very good shaving set for the price!  My other half loves it!  Brush is boar bristle with a very heavy plastic handle, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, while being durable.  The bowl is sized just right with masculine colors, and the soap smells great and lathers well.</li>
    <li> While not the best out there, they do the job very well, soap seems to work well, brush looks a little cheap, it works just fine. I planned on swapping out soap for local organic goats milk soap from down the street but will just wait until this one is used up.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and certainly not expensive..he loves it.  He says: the soap has an invigorating but not overpowering scent.  A great lather which he can control by the amount of water he puts on the soap.  He can have a nice thick lather that doesn&#x27;t run.  The tools included in this set are kind of works of art.  Beautifully made soap dish that feels like it was made to fit his hand and the handle on the boars hair brush, that same comfort.  A great product with an old school feel</li>
    <li> If you are first making your foray into Safety Razor shaving, this kit is a good starting purchase if you&#x27;re still uneasy about the whole thing. (You won&#x27;t be once you try it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes the soap, brush, and bowl. The bowl&#x27;s nice and sturdy, the soap smells clean, plain and simple. The brush takes some working for the bristles to get nice and soft. Keep in mind though, that brush breaks around the year mark. But until then, it&#x27;s smooth like a ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great buy for ten bucks, and once you start, you&#x27;re hooked. Once you&#x27;re hooked, this kit should be just about done, anyhow. So it&#x27;s a great starter for you or a friend.</li>
    <li> I guess this is a descent set nothing to compare it to. Does what it is supposed to. Makes a lather on your face cheaply. Esquire magazine won&#x27;t be in my bathroom vanity any time soon so I&#x27;m not worried about a $50 brush and a $25 coffee mug!</li>
    <li> The brush in this set is huge!!! Love that!  It&#x27;s a gift, so it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.  I opened it and it appears to be a great set!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this soap doesn&#x27;t lather very well for a good shaving experience. The brush and cup are good. I was looking for something to make a return to single edge shaving a better experience.</li>
    <li> Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST FOR THE MONEY, IT ALSO MAKE FOR A GREAT GIFT FOR MALE OR FEMALE.</li>
    <li> The brush is not as good as expected, since it is loosing hair. The bowl is good, but the soap is not the quality I expected. The price is good, but do not expect top quality.</li>
    <li> The boar brush is excellent for preparing the skin to shave</li>
    <li> Bowl and soap are great, the brush however started loosing it&#x27;s bristles after about a year of use. For the price it&#x27;s great, I just would have preferred a longer lasting brush.</li>
    <li> This is a good, inexpensive set.  I buy one a year.  The brush starts to lose bristles after a year, but at this price point I think that shouldn&#x27;t be a shock.  Probably a good investment to get a new one every year anyhow, I imagine a brush much older than that would be kinda funky.</li>
    <li> I think the brush was poor quality and the soap was whatever. The only good thing in this set is the bowl.</li>
    <li> GAVE AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT TO MY 83 YEAR OLD UNCLE.  SOAP SMELLS GOOD, BOWL SEEMS NICE AND STURDY. HAVE NOT HAD THE CHANCE TO SEE HOW THE BRUSH HOLD UP OR HOW LONG IT WILL LAST BUT OVER ALL SEEMS TO BE A GOOD STURDY PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> This set will not satisfy those who have made shaving into a religious ritual.  For those looking for a basic set that works well, and won&#x27;t make you sell a child, this set works nicely.  Brush (like all I have used) will shed a little at first.  With proper use and storage, this will stop shortly.  Cup has no handle, so this is good/bad.  Stores easier, but has less to hang on to.  I use this set in the shower.</li>
    <li> Got what I ordered. Soap is nice and mild and brush does the job and has not lost more then a few loose hairs from the factory. Good set</li>
    <li> My dear friends husband wanted to shave like they did in the old days so his birthday was coming up and my husband and I bought this with the razor for a smooth shave. He has passed away today but I will always remember how smooth his cheeks were to kiss.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much due to the price, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this bad.  I used this product twice, and both times I had to stop during use and switch to other products to finish the job.  The brush was constantly losing bristles during each use.  I was expecting to lose some, but the amount became ridiculous and it was immediately apparent.  The shaving soap was worthless as it dried on my skin almost immediately.  The product actually deserves a star due to the included bowl, which is fine.</li>
    <li> IT is fun to use, to bad the bristles are very to stiff and fall out at an alarming rate.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving with this set and an Edwin Jagger DE89LBL.  The bowl is nice, the soap is nice and brush is ok... it&#x27;s not too rough on your face.  With all of that being said, the brush is a lot more effective at creating a lather with soaps as opposed to creams.  Very easy to make a thick and very nice lather with soaps, but it takes quite a bit of time to get that same thick lather with shaving creams.  I&#x27;ve tried to use it with Proraso shaving cream, Taylor of Old Bond Street, Art of Shaving shaving cream and it just takes forever to get a thick lather.  I would recommend this set if you plan on staying with soaps, but if you wanna go with shaving creams, badger is the way to go.</li>
    <li> (this Scott not Christine) I was new to traditional shaving when I bought this and it&#x27;s a nice set.  The brush is not real soft but it does the job and with some practice I learned how to make up a nice lather with this set.  The bowl is a little small for me and I don&#x27;t use it much any more. The scent of the soap is not very strong at all and it just has a kind of fresh soapy smell. All in all the set is good and does the job it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
    <li> Soap is slick and smells nice without the juvenile overwhelming smells out there these days. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores either. The brush is soft, I don&#x27;t care what those whiny people say about it.</li>
    <li> The brush is only ok, but the rest of the product (bowl, soap) are great.</li>
    <li> This is an awful Brush !!! it keeps shedding and I&#x27;ve used it for months !! So I bought a Jagger, no shedding !!</li>
    <li> This shave set provides and comfortable shave. Easy to use and the brush provided is a great accesory when leathering.</li>
    <li> I love the old fashion brush and soap and this was perfect. Only problem was the bowl is glass and I tend to drop it when my hands are soapy. Better if it was hard plastic.</li>
    <li> 2 months later it&#x27;s still working well. The brush works well and has broken in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lost 2-3 hairs for the first 10 or so shaves, but it loses one hair very seldomly since (every 5 shaves or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap works well and is easy to lather and the mug is a good size.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal! The bowl is great!  The soap lathers thick.  The brush is nice and soft but separated from the handle after about 3 months of use.  It is still a great deal and cheap enough to replace every 4 months!</li>
    <li> I still use the bowl . The handle of the brush came off after a few months of use, and it tends to loose bristles with every use.</li>
    <li> Great brush and the soap is a great moisturizer</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  Don&#x27;t know if this is normal, but a few of the hairs came out of the brush.  Hopefully, this will stop.</li>
    <li> The brush is great!  Replace my old one and didn&#x27;t realize how worn it was!  The shaving bowl was an added bonus!!!</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I both love this. I love the smell &amp; he loves the whole thing. He is so happy with his shaving set. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I tried to buy this and i couldn&#x27;t because something called add on item. This is all i wanted but couldn&#x27;t buy it because its less than 25 bucks. So i found it at the Walgreen&#x27;s down the street for a dollar more than the price here.. To Amazon..This is really stupid on your part. Other than that great item and Amazon lost a loyal customer for being stupid.</li>
    <li> My son wanted one of these as his dad had one when he was small and he said that it made his face soft so he wanted one!!</li>
    <li> This was surprisingly a quality product. Everything included was nice. I purchased this as a gift for a 1st time wetshaver and they have told me the soap makes a nice lather, the bowl is a good size and the brush is enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews on this product complaining about the plastic handle, the boars hair brush, and the bowl not having a handle. I was looking for a cheap set to travel with and there were enough positive reviews that I gave this one a shot. The plastic brush handle did not bother me in the least, in fact the actual brush has a lot more heft and is sturdier than it appears in the images. With proper care it should last you a long time. As for Boars hair vs. Badger hair, The boars hair feels just fine on my face and I didn&#x27;t see that it hampers my ability to make a nice lather either. So if Boars hair makes the product more affordable then that is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I used a bowl without a \\&quot;mug\\&quot; like handle, but after using it I think I actually prefer it to using a handle. I am a pretty ham handed guy so I get a more stable grip holding the bottom of the bowl than I do daintily holding by a handle. I can be a little more aggressive in working up a lather with this bowl without worrying about losing my grip and having both bowl and lather flying across my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is a great value for the price and I would have given it 5 stars except I didn&#x27;t care too much for the soap. It lathered up just fine, but I didn&#x27;t care too much for the scent and was not as pleasant to shave with as some of the others I&#x27;ve tried, but that just a preference. If this is your first set and have nothing else to compare it to, this soap may be just fine.</li>
    <li> The brush lost more than a few bristles, but for the price - and my experience level; this item was a good match.</li>
    <li> This looks great in our shaving area in our bathroom. It&#x27;s a great lather, The more you use it, the foamier and creamier it gets. Thank You. It was a part of my Husband&#x27;s Christmas Gift. We kept to the shaving theme.</li>
    <li> I switched to this from canned foam. The only con is that this definitely takes longer. If you are new to wet shaving, I strongly recommend this set to see if it is your bag, rather than dumping a lot of money in and finding out it is not for you. This set contains everything you need but a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does the job. I have noticed no unusual amount of shedding. (of course it does shed, but that is normal - to an extent). It is my first brush, so I cannot compare, but It feels fine on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is great. I think it alone is worth the purchase price (since this set costs less than most bowls.) It looks good, and I have noticed no flaws in it (bubbles, cracks or such). It stays warm long enough for me to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap give a nice thick foam. My skin has felt better without the harsh chemicals from the can. The smell of the soap is not to my taste, but that is just an opinion, and it works great for shaving.</li>
    <li> I only used this 3 times so far and during each shave 3-4 bristles fall out each time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as there are bristles left...</li>
    <li> I bought this because for the price, this is the cheapest shaving bowl on amazon.  Also good to have a backup brush to extend the life of your main brush.</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive kit, and for the money you can&#x27;t beat it. I read one review that said the brush fell apart after using for 90 days. Maybe so, but I view it is an inexpensive starter kit to find out if I wish to continue the old school way of shaving. Even if the brush falls apart after 90 days, you still have the soap and the bowl in the kit…..and I must say the bowl is quite nice!!! I used the soap, and even though you may prefer buying a higher quality soap in the future, this soap works pretty well. The soap is barely scented so you should not have a problem with not liking the scent. For under $10 I think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This set has everything yo need to get started.  Easy to get the hang of, and I look forward to using it often.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I got back into DE shaving and recently for two people who I bought DE shavers for as a gift. The mug is large and deep and the soap smells good. The brush is perfect for a beginner set, and with proper care, I can see lasting for a long time. The brush is a bit rough at first, but does get a little softer once broken in. I now use a softer, more expensive brush, but I use the one that came with this kit for road trips and when traveling, just in case I lose it or forget it. The only downside to this kit is that it tends to want the brush coated really well with soap before you can really get a great lather going, however, when switching to more expensive cream soaps, the technique you build with this kit makes the cream soaps much, much, much easier in building lather. For the unbeatable price, I recommend this kit as an excellent beginner kit or a great kit to carry on the road.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  best shave in the world!  I would love it if they separated the soap out so you can buy it separately.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what I was looking for. I use to use my late fathers straight razor when I started out shaving and buying cheap BIC throw away razors was a waste of money and never really shaved close enough. Now I have a complete set to last forever.</li>
    <li> They brush and soap are great, but the bowl came in cracked. Not a big deal, since I was really just getting it for the brush and soap anyways.</li>
    <li> great price good service</li>
    <li> Ecologically sound&lt;br /&gt;All the pieces, do what they are supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;1/5 of what the major department stores want for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Eco friendly, well constructed and cheaper than the Department store, whats there not to like?  A no brainer, buy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaveing  set would buy again.</li>
    <li> Just a bowl with soap. Not very lathery though.</li>
    <li> Effective starter set at a bargain price and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping only took a bout 3 days standard shipping. The soap smells really good and makes a decent lather. First time I used it a lot of the bush hairs came off the brush. But other then that the brush is very soft and for the price its a great first time kit.</li>
    <li> They look nice!  I bought a few of these as Christmas gifts, so I&#x27;m not sure how well they work.  One of my bowls came broken but amazon got a new one to me very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Just as I imagined it to be.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt; I love the smell&lt;br /&gt; The brush is well made and hand crafted&lt;br /&gt; The bowl is pretty decent size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; The froth is difficult to create with this soap for some reason, perhaps as time passes I&#x27;ll get better so I didn&#x27;t adjust my rating for this.&lt;br /&gt;  Nothing was wrapped in the box, and boar bristles were rampant. This didn&#x27;t effect the overall quality of the set so I didn&#x27;t deduct for it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would love to have another go with this soap but I may have to look elsewhere before coming back, the lather isn&#x27;t impressive to me. I also feel as though the soap dries pretty quickly so the lubricating effect isn&#x27;t very long lasting, my skin does feel moisturized after shaving so that&#x27;s a bonus and worthy to keep this rated high.</li>
    <li> The set is awesome. The bowl is nicer than I thought it would be giving the price but its a great set!</li>
    <li> Nice set - everything seems quality - however, mixing bowl, for me, would be better with some kind of handle or rough surface around top. Can slip out of wet hands easily  -  but, I guess that that&#x27;s minor.</li>
    <li> II purchased this along with a safety razor. Both items cost under $20. With that, I expected poor quality stuff. However, to my surprise, this kit is amazing. The soap smells great. The brush has lost maybe 7 bristles. And the bowl is nice.&lt;br /&gt;overall, I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
    <li> This was the first set I tried when I got into brush shaving, and I still think it&#x27;s great. Seriously, you could just stick with this set and not upgrade to all the expensive brands. I love the soap especially, and the bowl is the perfect size (I find the &amp;#34;mugs&amp;#34; too big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the brush. I mean, it&#x27;s a fine brush and feels good on my face. But it doesn&#x27;t come with a holder, which ideally you&#x27;d want. It&#x27;s also a little on the wide side, and I found out later that it won&#x27;t fit into some brush holders (even the plastic one that comes in the VDH Luxury Set).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note: I love the color of the bowl, although the outside is actually a really dark blue and not black. If that kind of thing matters to you, it&#x27;s something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those minor things aside, this is a great, inexpensive way to start brush shaving.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the scent of the shave soap and having a bowl to place it in.  However, I really did not like the brush.  I don&#x27;t like swine in general so rubbing coarse, boar-tainted hair on my face during the initial two weeks was really a treat.  However, the smell does go away, but so do the bristles eventually.  I recommend only because of the price and for guys that want to try out this method of shaving without dropping decent cash.</li>
    <li> I guess you can&#x27;t get really warm lather but this is pretty good.  I use it after a shower and use the hot water from the shower to make the lather.  The water/lather cools fast so it is lukewarm by the time it gets to my face.  Still, it is better than cold.  I like it.  I vaguely remember hotter lather at a barber shop but am not complaining about this set.</li>
    <li> Last Father&#x27;s Day I got my dad a vintage Gillette Super Speed as a memento.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this set at the supermarket as a last second addition just in case he wanted to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have a Van Der Hagen Luxury brush made of badger hair and borrowed this brush for a week to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;Short story, Im glad he just kept the razor for show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this brush every chance.&lt;br /&gt;I washed it with shampoo to break it in, soaked it in hot water for 5min before use, and worked it in the bowl for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to work up a lather, but it was weak.&lt;br /&gt;The soap stayed in the brush and was difficult to put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Once it was on my face, it dissipated quickly and wasn&#x27;t very slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a comparison, I used the van der hagen badger brush and was able to quickly work up a much thicker, slicker, easier to apply lather after simply running hot water over the brush instead of soaking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I giving the set 3 stars because the bowl and the soap are well worth $10.&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a very mild pleasant scent and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is ceramic, fits nicely in your non dominate hand, and holds heat well.</li>
    <li> I like the fill of the set . It is old fashion but that is what appeals to me .</li>
    <li> I love my soap,cup and brush set. I am particularly please with the way the order was filled.  The neat packaging and price of this item is what attracted me to do business with this company. Really recommend them to anyone,</li>
    <li> Great set.  One review mentioned you could buy this item at Walmart.  While this is true, it is $24.95.  Much cheaper on Amazon.  Nothing fancy, just works.  I am new to straight razor shaving, but felt that I got a better shave with this soap as compared to name brand shaving gel.</li>
    <li> Nice set. Works as intended.</li>
    <li> i love this set its cheap the soap is nice and morsterizes my skin less razor burn the brush feels nice and works great with the soap the boel is cool bought this because its cheap great value for your money</li>
    <li> Boar bristle brush is very coarse and the hair fell out on the first use. I threw the brush away. Bowl - good design, shape and size. Soap is just okay as it is not very rich or creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product even at an add on price.</li>
    <li> Got this as an add on item for my dad, and he loves it. The set really does help lift the hair to prep for shaving.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect set for someone interested in traditional wet shaving.  If you are just looking to try it out without investing a lot of money into a fancy brush and expensive soaps and/or creams, this set is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl, in all honesty, is really nice--the colors are great, the size is perfect, and it is of high quality.  The brush isn&#x27;t all that bad either.  Yes, it is boar&#x27;s hair, but it does a fine job and I personally don&#x27;t find it to be all that rough.  The soap is adequate--nothing special, but it gets the job done.  The scent is nice, it lathers perfectly well, and it give a nice shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stick with wet shaving you will most likely upgrade your equipment down the line, but this is a great starting point.</li>
    <li> Its kinda cool.  I like how in the morning, after I get out the shower, I run the brush under the hot water and get the lather going, and when I apply it all over my head and face, its all warm, like in an old school barber shop!  Gives a good shave!</li>
    <li> The brush seams a little cheaply made but is soft enough and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with bristles falling out so it works for me.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell of the soap so I only used it twice, but it is pretty nice and the lather and shave were good. The bowl is a bowl; there&#x27;s nothing really to say about it. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it ever since.  It&#x27;s the most bang for the buck when you want to test the waters of using soap and a safety razor.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.      One recommendation would be to not use the razor blade included, take the time and go to the nearest drug store or order a different set of blades from Amazon.  I found this blade to be less than sharp.      Overall, I recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and this is a nice set without busting my wallet. The soap smells nice, the bowl is useful, and the brush does it&#x27;s job.  I definitely need more practice, but this set will help me gain the needed technique.</li>
    <li> Comes with shave soap, badgger brush and small bowl, works good shave soap is basic nothing special, the badger hair brush works good but leaves stray hairs from time to time and you notice this long thick hair when you shave. other wise good stuff.</li>
    <li> I cannot be a insightfuls or humorous as some other posters, but I will give an honest review of this set. I purchased this set as my first venture into a wet shave setup.     It is what it is for the $10 I paid for it.   The bowl is great, nice and small enough to fit easily in my medicine cabinet. 5 stars    The VDH soap is wonderful, great lather and very comfortable shave with both a DS razor or Fusion. 4 stars    The boars hair brush was TERRIBLE, at least mine was. I expected it to shed SOMEWHAT during the first few weeks I used it but the shedding did not stop ! I was pulling boar bristles of my face continuously with each shave. For this I give the brush ONE STAR.     Enter Vanderhagen Enterprises who was fantastic and stepped up to the plate. I sent an email to their customer service department. I received a prompt response asking for my name and address so they could send me either a refund OR their better badger brush. I asked for the brush which I received. Although it is not part of this review, the badger brush is significantly better than the boar brush; and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> I know there are fancier bowls, brushes, soaps, but why waste your money on them? The brush is boar bristle, so not as high quality as badger, but it works perfectly well. The bowl is just right for putting soap in. I mean, you&#x27;re using it to make a lather, not eat out of. Great set, great price.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought for my husband. I broke the first dish by dropping it! Oops! My husband loves the soap and soap dish. He swears the shaving bar soap gives him a better lather, and nicer shave. The brush leaves something to be desired. The brush isn&#x27;t as soft and doesn&#x27;t lather as well as a more \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; shave brush. I purchased my husband a Tweezerman brush instead.</li>
    <li> If like me you&#x27;re looking to try out wet shaving without spending too much money, this is the kit for you.    The brush: At the time I bought this, by brother bought a $10 wooden handled boar hair brush at the store. The Van Der Hagen has a plastic handle, but more bristles. My brother&#x27;s brush has lost half its bristles in three months, whereas my Van Der Hagen brush barely sheds at all. It&#x27;s not a badger hair brush, but it still whips up a decent lather.    The bowl: A coffee mug would work, but the shaving soap fits perfectly, and the bowl fits well in the medicine cabinet.    The soap: It is the only shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is better than any canned shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried. It lathers great, but you need practice to do it right. Although some have complained about the smell, I find it mildly pleasant. I really can&#x27;t see what the problem is. The soap also washes off the face very easily, even with cold water.    If you&#x27;re just trying out wet shaving for as low a price as possible to see if you like it, I recommend this kit, plus the Feather Popular safety razor, which shaves great. Together they only set you back about $30.</li>
    <li> Much better shave than using any shave cream I have tried. I feel like I am getting a better, smoother shave with less irritation. I saw Walmart sells the replacement soap cakes (same brand) as well for less than $2 so I can easily get more when needed.</li>
    <li> for the price, it&#x27;s excellent. the bowl looks and feels nice, and the shaving soap has a pleasant yet nondescript smell, and lathers nicely. The only place where you see the cost coming into it is the brush. The handle is cheap plastic with visible mold lines, and every so often bristles come off it and stick to your face. it works to spread the soap though, so you get exactly what you pay for. excellent starter set so you know what you&#x27;re looking for when you upgrade.</li>
    <li> Luckily for me, I have mostly men on my Christmas list; this year, I went with a &amp;#34;Steinbeck&amp;#34; theme-this kit, safety razors, a pen and a small journal. The Manly-man set. Most of the men I gave this to, loved it!</li>
    <li> I am new to shaving with a safety razor.  I picked this set up as a change to my other soap and brush, figuring that the absolute worst case scenario is this becomes my travel soap/bowl/brush.  I think the soap has a clean soap smell (it is unscented), the brush works fine. The set created a nice lather that lasted 3 passes plus touch up. I had some nicks and cuts, but I do not know yet if that was from my technique, due to an old blade In the razor (third shave on this blade), due to a crappy blade in the razor (Derby blades do not have a reputation for excellence), or because the lather did not protect my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based upon some forums and YouTube videos, one would think a boar brush is slightly less painful than sandpaper. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. This brush felt nice on my face. The stiffness of the bristles helped pick up soap off of the soap puck that was included in the set. I am not sure if my badger brush would have done any better.</li>
    <li> Just used my shaving set for the first time.  The brush lathers well and the soap is better than any gel you would get from the store!</li>
    <li> Provides lubrication for my face (ha ha) when shaving. -1 star for the hair or 2 that falls out each time i shave.</li>
    <li> I like the kit my only complaint is that the brush bristles keep shedding i assume its because it is new?</li>
    <li> this s a really perfect set if you are just starting to shave with a razor. very much worth is for first timers</li>
    <li> I was surprized when people told me it came with a plastic bowl but when i received it the bowl was actaully was like a coffee cup material.</li>
    <li> I bought this after wanting to switch to a straight razor.  I&#x27;d never shaved without a cartridge before and was a little nervous.  This worked fine.  Though its a slightly different technique than normal, now that I&#x27;m used to it I can look forward to shaving for pennies for the rest of my shaving days!  Lathering with a brush and soap is a much better feel than normal shave gel.  Not to mention you&#x27;re avoiding all of the chemicals in the gel, too!  The brush seems a little on the cheap side as the bristles fall out on occasion.  But, for the money you can&#x27;t beat it especially if you&#x27;re looking to make the switch like I did.</li>
    <li> The bowl is really nice, like the style, the soap is actually a great lathering soap, and the plastic handle on the burhs bothers me not.  It will lose bristles pretty aggressively the first 10-20 times you use it, but eventually they stop falling out.</li>
    <li> Just as described.&lt;br /&gt;From Mexico</li>
    <li> This set is a great starter kit for anyone who is thinking about trying to shave with a double edge razor or a straight edge razor.  I for one use both everytime I shave and love it.</li>
    <li> the brush is not that good took it out and about 100 hairs fell out and would not stop the bowl is really small it looks very deceiving in the pic the soap is  not that bad.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the quality of this set, given how inexpensive it was. There are lots of shaving snobs out there, many of whom would turn their nose up at this item. I am very pleased with the quality of the soap block -- it lathers up beautifully and provides a much better shave than regular shaving cream. It&#x27;s very low odor and not laden with artificial scent. The bowl is heavy and feels durable. The brush is supple and applies the lather beautifully. I am a novice and don&#x27;t know what to expect with brush shedding, but after a few weeks of use, the brush does leave behind a few hairs during every application of lather. Not a deal breaker, but the reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars. If all brushes do this, then my fault for not knowing that yet. Overall, an awesome buy for the money. If you haven&#x27;t tried a more traditional shaving kit yet, I&#x27;d strongly suggest it.</li>
    <li> Well, I got this shave set because I&#x27;m just starting wet shaving and needed a cheap shave set that got decent reviews. I was kind of iffy on this one because a lot of people gave it reviews saying it was useless and you should avoid it, so I was prepared for disappointment. After using it my self, I was very satisfied with it. The brush isn&#x27;t the best in the world, but it isn&#x27;t terrible like others exaggerate. I thought it was quite smooth and with some practice it can be a really useful shave set.</li>
    <li> I gave it a four star because my husband used it and he said he had to get off more of the hairs from the Shaving brush then with his own hair which he had a lot hair to shave off!  The bowl is nice and my husband loved the shave cream bar, but we ended up having to buy him a more expensive brush because of how cheaply made that thing is!</li>
    <li> Ended up getting a different brush as the brissels fall out everytime I used it.  It&#x27;s at least good for starting out.</li>
    <li> No nonsense kit right here. No frills about it. It works, it gets the job done, and gives a good shave at that. I use it like a real man, with a dovo straight razor, and it has produced quite satisfactory results. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. The coloration of the bowl is not quite what I desired, but I have an older wooden lather mug which has been in the family for several generations and I use that instead. Most importantly, this kit is cheap and works well enough. Still have any questions? Then you should go and waste money on some useless expensive thing. Cheers</li>
    <li> I brought this for my boyfriend and he loves it..He said it makes his beard a lot smoother and he gets a closer shave.... Thank you so much</li>
    <li> This set was a great intro to using a brush with soap. The bowl will last a long time. It&#x27;s attractive, deep and easy to use without making a mess.   The soap is great quality and it&#x27;s not perfumed.I like unscented products and this soap does not bother me.  The bowl and soap are of good quality and I have saved a great deal of money not buying shaving cream !  A bar of shave soap for me lasts a pretty long time. I use just enough water to make the lather foam. Too much and it&#x27;s not as rich.   I believe the brush exfoliates my skin well in preparation for shaving so the razor does not get caught on a stray dead skin cells. I like shaving prep with this brush but it has not been durable.   Granted I have not been prissy with it.  I make new lather on the remnants of yesterday&#x27;s which might not be the best idea. It is probably bad to leave the brush in the bowl on top of the wet soap instead of drying it out. Maybe that is why it&#x27;s gradually falling apart? The boar bristles are held together by a block of resin and that is set in the plastic handle. It fell out of the handle after a few months and I like using it so much that I have used the bristles in the block of resin without the handle for a few months more, but now the bristles are shedding. They shed a bit in the beginning and once and a while but now they shed every time i shave so it&#x27;s time to get a new one.    I am going to try a nicer brush in hope that they are more rugged and maybe I will research if I   did something wrong. This is the second boars bristle brush from CVS that has fallen apart so that is why I am on Amazon. I hope I find something that will last 3+ years without extra steps. Is this overly exuberant middle aged optimism? Maybe.   If the Badger Hair brushes are not any more durable I&#x27;ll probably go back to using one of these since it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Great for beginners...After a couple of use .. you should upgrade to a more quality kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit becasue I wanted an all-in-one set and did not want to buy all pieces separately, and the price was right.  I may upgrade later, but I see no reason at this point.  I would have loved a white or espresso colored bowl rather than a black/green one, but it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush.  It looses a hair or two every now and then, but not to be considered a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is nice.  It is small and fits in the medicine cabinet well.  I use it for soaking the brush in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is OK, it smells good and it works reasonably well, but, after I compared it to Proraso Sensitive Skin Shaving Soap, I prefer Proraso.</li>
    <li> Cheap way to start a new hobby.</li>
    <li> The brush has held up pretty well to occasional shaving over the past few months. The bowl is pretty good looking and the soap produces a nice lather that smells good.</li>
    <li> Looses some bristles at first and was concerned that it would &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; in a few weeks, but it stopped shedding and has worked fine.  Gives a nice lather and is a very comfortable addition to the shaving routine.</li>
    <li> Good for noobs to wetshaving!</li>
    <li> The men in my life adore these.</li>
    <li> You get much more than you pay. Every brush has its own characteristics, you have to start using it gently. Once you do that, you don&#x27;t risk to damage your brush &amp; shaving becomes a joyful rutine in your life... Strongly recommend specially for the beginners, but I&#x27;m quite happy with it as a 40 yrs. old guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl size &amp; color is very nice, the soap seems like it will last forever!</li>
    <li> The bowl and the soap are nice.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now, and hairs have fallen out of the brush both times.</li>
    <li> I bought this set from Amazon it is good quality and at a good price. Standard shipping it only took 4 days. I bougth it as a gift for my dad but I will order one for myself</li>
    <li> It is a great way to get started with minimal commitment. The bristles come out with more frequency than I would like.</li>
    <li> works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I already have a shaving brush, but when I ran out of soap, I thought I&#x27;d give this a go, based upon the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what kind of brush I have, as it was a gift.  But when I un-boxed this premium shave set, and felt the brush that came with it, I had the impression that it was made out of plastic. When I put it against my face (I did not wet it), it actually hurt. Like it was thousands of stiff fishing strings stabbing my face.  Okay, I did not cry out in pain, but it was not at all like the brush I already have, which feels nice against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this feels better when it is wet. Based on the reviews it obviously works.  But you are not getting anything &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; as the name suggests, at least, not  in terms of the brush.  The bowl is nice, though it does not come with a lid.  And the soap gets the job done, without any strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> Received this fast and as described. This is my first shaving brush and soap kit. I&#x27;ve used it about four times and it has worked great. I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> The brush is complete crap, make sure you get a high quality bagger brush. The bowel is the perfect size for any shave soap. The actually shave soap from the kit is alright, but I&#x27;m having difficulty getting a great lather as other soap products. Maybe I&#x27;m just inexperienced with this soap, but it does the job with a thin lather layer on my face. It smells good and face is left very mildly smooth.</li>
    <li> great feel and i love the green in the bowl, i use my own shaving cream so i havent tried the one it came with, but the brush is awesome</li>
    <li> brush is good, bowl is great. soap does not get that lathery, but it does the job until i can order a different brand of soap.</li>
    <li> Nice, accessory kit..</li>
    <li> A real bargain!  I hadn&#x27;t used a brush and soap for 20 years and was surprised at the cost.  This set costs less than most brushes alone, and the soap is fine.</li>
    <li> the shave cream bowl is great, the brush is terrible, keeps losing bristles when applying shave cream to face.</li>
    <li> i bought this set from Walgreen for $11 used it few times since day one the brush been shedding a lot, i thought it would stop after few uses but didn&#x27;t, my older which i had gotten from over seas lasted 6 years and it&#x27;s still going, thinking this would be a good product which was not decided to replace it. if your looking for long lasting brush look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Good product, great for the price gets the job done. The lather smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> Very good price for good product. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Just got this and shaved for the first time ... What a difference!!! I loved it! So much cheaper and greener than buying shaving cream/gel and it works SO much better!</li>
    <li> If you purchased the safety razor you should purchase this too.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this set.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for years, and for my money, best soap around.  I&#x27;ve tried creams that come out of a tube, like Neutrogena, canned shaving gels and foams, and even Caswell-Massey almond cream out of a jar, with a touch of benzocaine to slightly numb the skin.  And none of them even come close to the Van De Hagen soaps.  My brush is holding up wonderfully, the bowl/mug is..well...it&#x27;s a bowl.  But it is the soap that you&#x27;re going to rave about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set aside a small pitcher of water and microwave it for about one and a half minutes to get the water just hot enough for a nice, warm rich lather.  I wash my face with a good soap and rinse with lots of hot water, and then whip up a rich later with the Van Der Hagen soap.  I use a Gillette Mach whatever ...I think they&#x27;re up to 116 blades now...one with the little AAA battery to make it wiggle and shake alike an electric toothbrush.  And with the skin softeners in the soap, best shave in the US.  Even the local barber can&#x27;t touch it.  If you already love your brush and mug, go for the soap.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001A3FLF0 Van Der Hagen Select Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]]</li>
    <li> The hairs from the brush come off, and is a little harder than I thought</li>
    <li> oooooooooooh so nice ... Blessings + thx 3 the seller</li>
    <li> since even purchase the article I have,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and never cause me allergies,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the article is very good and i recommended this for all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got it quickly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local Meijer store primarily for the brush while waiting for the silvertip badger brush that I ordered to arrive. Kinda hard to find these type of supplies at the local store anymore.The soap and bowl was just a bonus since I had shave creme already and a simple coffee mug would do just fine for making shave creme. But on to the review. I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a week now and I find it to work just fine. It has shed a few hairs but nothing like some other reviews have posted. So I guess that the quality is going to vary. I suppose I&#x27;m not picky but a handle is a handle. As long as i can grip it and it doesn&#x27;t bite me it&#x27;s ok. The bowl is nice but I have found at least for me that holding it in the palm of my hand or on the counter while mixing shave creme is somewhat difficult without a handle. So the 1 star deduction is for no handle on the bowl. I&#x27;m sure for others it&#x27;s no big deal. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t not buy it because of this. I use the bowl to soak my brush in hot water prior to shaving. The soap works well also. doesn&#x27;t lather up as nice as I had expected but has a subtle smell that is nice but not over powering. so for anyone starting into wet shaving but is on a budget I would definitely recommend this. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go along with my new merkur safety razor. The brush is just ok. I&#x27;m planning on buying a higher quality brush in the near future. But the bowl is nice and I will definitely keep with whatever brush I end up getting. As for the soap, I think it works great as well. I know its not the best out, but it gets the job done well and is a heat value. I have been using for a couple weeks, and approx 15-20 hairs have fallen out of the brush. But that was somewhat suspected. I would highly recommend the product as a whole. But I would also suggest getting a higher quality brush.</li>
    <li> This shaving kit was very cheap and not worth the money. The brush leaves hair on my face every time. The bowl broke within 2 days and the soap is no better than hand soap. It dried my face out very quickly.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. I would recommend it (especially for a travel kit).</li>
    <li> Simply put, for a man there is no luxury that can be better had at this price point than this.  Try shaving with a brush one time like me and forget about razorburn while you enjoy an old-time barbershop shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set works wonders and is much less the cost of the fancy sets you&#x27;ll see in specialty retailers.  As a big fan and new convert, there is simply no excuse to be a man and NOT use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest shopping on the price a bit first though, as this seems to be one of the few things Amazon doesn&#x27;t seem to be competitive in its prices with.</li>
    <li> I liked the bowl and the brush, but for some reason the soap is not what I expected. I feel like it lacks moisturizers. I was able to made a nice lather, but not a great option. I will keep looking for another soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the \\&quot;wet-shaving\\&quot; scene. I didn&#x27;t want to drop a lot into something I might not like. I knew I could handle the shaving part, but I was unsure if I wanted to actually build my own lather or use the foam in a can. I picked this up for $10, and considering a decent non-plastic bowl will run you $5, I feel it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;It took me about three times using it to really get the hang of building the lather. It&#x27;s just something you have to get a feel for and no amount of reading will make it easier. You get the hang of how much water the brush needs, how much soap to build on the bristles, how much pressure to place on the brush, the angle to hold the brush, and the speed to whip. Considering the soap will last forever and it&#x27;s cheap to replace I would recommend practice building lather a few times till you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the brush soak in hot water for 5 min, shake off the excess water, dip the end in warm water, swirl on the soap, and build lather in my bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;The soap that&#x27;s included works well. It lathers up fine and has an ok smell. It just smells like..well soap to be honest. It smells like something I would wash my hands with. This is actually fine for me as I like fresh/clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant after my purchase as I had read that boar hair was horrible and this brush would be useless. I seem to have no problems building lather, so if this is what a \\&quot;useless, poor lather\\&quot; is like I would really hate to see \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; lather as mine came out as thick as any can cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;The bowl feels like it&#x27;s a good solid product. Perfect size for lather building in my opinion. I used a coffee mug to throw my soap in instead of leaving it in the plastic package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;For $10 I think this was a good buy. If you&#x27;re starting wet-shaving I would recommend this product. There is no point in spending a nice bit of money on more expensive products to find out wet-shaving or lather building aren&#x27;t for you. You might end up loving the wet-shave, but decide to just use the canned cream/gel (which still work fine).</li>
    <li> Handle of brush is cheesy paddock with a sharp seam. Bowl is very nice and the bristles are okay. Maybe okay for a travel kit if you pop it in a pouch.  You wouldn&#x27;t cry if you left it in a hotel room by mistake.</li>
    <li> lathers nicely and i like the smooth and refreshing smell of the soap.  brush is very smooth and easy to apply the soap.</li>
    <li> as I remembered when I was a child</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubs, and he&#x27;s been a fan so far. The bowl, brush &amp; soap bar are all really nice.</li>
    <li> Good Shave Set works great on face soften hairs and makes good lather for a great shave , hairs on brush could be a little softer .</li>
    <li> the price and quality of the wilkinson razor blades is excellent. the van der hagen shave set is ok the brush leaves a lot to be desired and I am not thrilled by the soap it does not lather the way I would prefer. I will not purchase their soap again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my brother for his birthday, he really likes the shave set. The shave set looks just like what the picture shows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price you pay. I was expecting to pay more.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this item. I have been using this brush for over 8 months and it is still going strong. The soap is a lovely scent with quality and lather comparable to any high end brand. The soap dish is understated and looks great on my counter. This could be three times the price and I would still buy it.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome.  Reminded me of my dad&#x27;s when I was little.  My husband will love it!!</li>
    <li> the soap isn&#x27;t very good quality, the bristles are falling out and the bowl looks like something i would find at the dollar store......other than that, its great !!! :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my nineteenth birthday and now I use this about everyday. This shave soap lathers incredibly well and the bowl is very nice. The boar brush is actually quite nice and although many will tell you it is nothing like a badger, many members of a certain shaving forum have stated that after the bristles soften the difference is barely there, if at all. It has become an extremely soft and comfortable brush, and just feels nice to use. It is also extremely fun knowing I am doing something that my grandfathers did. It takes a little bit of time to lather up, but unless a minute or two is too long for you it&#x27;s completely worth it. The soap also smells quite nice, although it took me some time to get used to. I often add Barbasol Arctic Chill (for the menthol) and the Sensitive Skin formula (for the ingredients) and I find the lather is just as good. I highly recommend this product, and better yet, it can be found at pretty much any drugstore or Wal-Mart!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Bowl is sturdy and I think it looks quite nice... I mean who the hell cares about what a bowl looks like dude?&lt;br /&gt;Brush is good, not great. It&#x27;s a cheap brush okay, don&#x27;t treat it like a 100 one, you&#x27;ll end up crushing the thing.&lt;br /&gt;Soap is okay. Smells okay. It&#x27;s okay, okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The bowl, from my experience, becomes next to absolutely useless. Not the fault of the bowl (who blames bowls?) but because the soap comes in a handy little plastic &#x27;bowl&#x27; thing. You wet the bar of soap, spin the brush around, and you have lather.... why did we need a bowl again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is cheap. Strands will come off and piss you off in the middle of your shave. At this moment you will SHOUT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS, FROTHING FROM THE MOUTH as you go to write your amazon review BUT WAIT... you can pick the strands off your face and continue to shave.. you big baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not premium. It&#x27;s not amazing. It does NOT suck.&lt;br /&gt;Oh boo hoo, you&#x27;ve bought a cheap shaving set now all your friends will laugh at you, and all those dweebs on the shaving forums will laugh at your unwillingness to throw down serious cash for a titanium straight razor with diamonds and soap made from the congealed mists of Mount Olympus itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO. This shaving set WORKS. It&#x27;s spartan, it&#x27;s cheap, but it WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> My first cake of soap lasted about six months. That is far longer than any shave cream or soap I&#x27;ve used. My second cake will exceed the first one. The bowl and brush are nice. I&#x27;ve now used the brush daily for nearly a year and it&#x27;s still working great. Given the cost of some brushes, this one is a bargain, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I like this much better than the shaving cream I used to use on my husband. I swear it makes his skin softer. He&#x27;s bedridden and using the shaving cream got all over him no matter what I did to stop it. Now I just put it where I want it, and boom, no more foam all over the place. After using it a few times I notice his skin felt softer, and I&#x27;m really pleased with how wonderful it is to use something that actually works well. The brush is soft, but firm enough to go where you want it, and the bowl doesn&#x27;t take up a huge space either. The soap is doing something good, cause he gets a much better shave now, and part of that is from this product, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I decided to start shaving every day because of my job.  I ended-up with severe razor burn and a huge rash.  I tried switching between Schick, Gillette, and Dorco, but I didn&#x27;t find any real difference.  After doing some research, I found that the real problem was likely the shaving cream I was using.  I found this kit at the grocery store. Since I started using it, the razor burn has been reduced by 90%.  The aftershave lotion I bought takes care of the last 10%.  Shaving is almost fun.  It&#x27;s a Boar&#x27;s hair brush instead of Badger.  Who cares??  Swirling a brush around a bar of soap to make thick bubbles is not rocket science.  I haven&#x27;t had any Boar&#x27;s hair injuries as far as I know.  Perhaps a badger hair brush would be better, but I haven&#x27;t found a reason to complain about this one yet.  The bowl is pretty useless.  The brush actually does a great job of building a lather on its own, despite being boar&#x27;s hair.  Maybe I&#x27;ll wash the bowl out and use it for Cheerios in the morning.  The soap is AWESOME!  It gives me a good lather and leaves my face silky smooth without making me smell like Old Spice aftershave.  It basically leaves me burn-free.  Bottom line -- This is a great shave set for people who want something different. In my opinion, the upscale &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; sets are highly overrated.  You&#x27;re going to come out with a hairless face either way.  I haven&#x27;t had a single co-worker laugh at me because I use Boar instead of Badger. Even if I told them, they wouldn&#x27;t care.  Believe me, it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than the blue goo I used to slather on my face.  Update to my previous post:  The plug on the shaving brush fell out after using it for three months.  The soap and the bowl is really good, but the soap is $1.67 and well...it&#x27;s just a stupid bowl.  All in all it&#x27;s really a cheap set.  If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving,  I would skip this and spring for a good badger brush and some good soap or cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a gift for my husband. I just wanted a cheap kit for him so he could see if he liked using a badger brush instead of canned shaving cream, and I was happy with this purchase. The brush lost some hairs but I mean, you get what you pay for, it&#x27;s still going strong after about 2 months and he uses it almost daily. I REALLY like this soap, it smells wonderful. Very light, fresh and clean. It doesn&#x27;t lather like I expected but it does the job (maybe we&#x27;re doing it wrong, like I said, we&#x27;re noobs). I accidentally broke the bowl, which is depressing because the bowl was actually really great. I&#x27;ll probably buy a different, higher quality badger brush when this one craps out, but it was a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> I like the soap and bowl but the brush is lacking. But, I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> You need to keep in mind that this is pretty much an economy shaving set. The soap and mug are okay though I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare to. The brush is pretty stiff and I don&#x27;t think it is probably as good as the old badger hair one I bought 20 years ago. That said, the set does its job and I am perfectly happy with the quality for the buck.</li>
    <li> The brush and the bowl are great. The shaving cream is ok but not the best. Could just be my skin being sensitive but it was a little rough of a shave with it.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  The lather is perfect, the soap is comfortable, the cup is good.  If you are considering taking the plunge into shaving with straight razor, I highly recommend starting with this.  Its a good place to get your feet wet without spending too much money.  I promise you will be impressed!</li>
    <li> This is a great starter set for straight edge shaving.  Very nice soap dish, quality brush, and okay soap.  If you want to do an upgrade, buy some aloe soap to replace the soap in the kit.  I didn&#x27;t find this necessary, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like this starter set. great bowl. and good starter boar brush. I don&#x27;t care for the soap but it will do for now till I get something else.</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone starting out wet shaving.  It took me a few tries to work up a nice lather with the soap, but once I figured that out it&#x27;s been great.  And what a price!</li>
    <li> Overall all it&#x27;ll do. By mistake I ordered 2 sets and will use the next bar of shave soap. Luckily I ordered the 100% Pure Badger Shaving brush (but haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it) because the brush that comes with the kit badly sheds bristles. The shave soap has no scent but the bowl is of decent weight. I figure I can get a lot of use of the bowl. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase it again but like I said in my opening statement. It&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> The brush was horrible as so many bristles fall out with each use, it makes shaving more difficult than needed.</li>
    <li> exactly what it should be.</li>
    <li> This product is fine for the price, but don&#x27;t believe that the brush will be soft on your face compared to a Badger brush. The different in feeling to your face is very noticable and it does not lather as good as a inexpensive badger brush.</li>
    <li> No complaints from my boyfriend yet!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift item.  Functional with all you need to shave, and looks attractive in the bathroom.  Soap does an excellent job for shaving. Bowl could be a wee-bit larger, but works well.</li>
    <li> It has been nice to get a really god shave again! I decided to start using a 40+ year old double edge razor again that my dad gave me many moons ago. I had forgotten how superior a quality single edge blade is to all these fancy and expensive multi-blade razors in use nowadays. The soap smells great, lasts forever and the cup and brush are perfect! I actually enjoy shaving now! No kidding!</li>
    <li> After trying electric razors for a couple of years to try to combat the rising cost of replacement blades, I gave up, I just didn&#x27;t like it, and electrics gave me worse razor burn than a dull disposable blade. I decided to try to make the switch to wet shaving with a double edged safety razor, and picked this up as a cheap starting point to go with a more expensive, higher quality razor. The soap is ok, the brush lost some bristles the first few times, but that&#x27;s to be expected, and the soap bowl is perfectly usable. I can see myself eventually replacing the brush, and buying better soap when this runs out, but for starters, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to shave her legs and I use it too. It works up a great lather and moisturizes the skin. Not one hair has fallen out of our brush, I was a little worried because of some of the other reviews.</li>
    <li> Really like the soap but the brush is a bit stiff. Overall good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Just bought one of these kits from Wally World about a week ago and am so far loving it! It feels good when applying the soap with the brush. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than shaving cream and gives you the old school barber shop feeling. I won&#x27;t ever go back to cream in a can!</li>
    <li> My son used this and loved using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend as a present this holiday.  It was to replace his existing shaving brush and his broken shaving bowl of the same brand.  The shaving bowl arrived broken in many different pieces.  The shaving brush was all badly damaged from rubbing against the broken shaving bowl pieces.  Very disappointing.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  He had this same kit, and the bowl broke, and the shaving brush hairs were falling out and getting all over the soap too.</li>
    <li> What more can you say when you see this set in your bathroom every morning being used my your husband. As nostalgic as it is pretty, lathers up wonderfully and offers the base for a nice, clean, fresh face! Ahhhh!</li>
    <li> It was a nice experiment, but I like modern shaving cream better.  But old style safety razors are the way to go, its superior and much cheaper than modern razors.</li>
    <li> I would have rated it higher but it was a gift for my boyfriend and he said the brush fell apart the first time he used it.</li>
    <li> This is my first wet shaving kit. I have to say I really like it. It was cheap, smells nice and while the brush isn&#x27;t as fancy as others... its a brush. It brushes soap on. I like it, I&#x27;m going to keep an eye out on future sets when my brush goes.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a surprise gift for my husband who had wanted to try this type of shaving for the first time. He really likes it and has ordered more when this was used up.</li>
    <li> nice lather hard to get top off.</li>
    <li> A gift for my husband, he loves it!</li>
    <li> I got this when I started DE shaving, and it helped me see what I wanted in my next kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH: Not bad at all for a starter brush. It&#x27;s boar bristle which I don&#x27;t mind. It can make and apply a good lather for sure. I&#x27;m still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOWL: Small and slippery. I immediately replaced this with a sturdy mug, because I dropped this almost every day. When it gets wet and soapy, it slips from my hands like a greased watermelon seed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOAP: Very ok. Not good, not bad, just middle of the road soap. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good, and it takes some work to make a lather from it. I have since experimented with other soaps and found some I like much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Good for the price, and if you are not 100% sold on more advanced shaving techniques and the time they take. It&#x27;s a safe jump. But right off the bat, read up on it more, spend a little bit more and get a sturdy kit that you can use forever.</li>
    <li> wastage of money the bristles from the brush started coming out from first day by end of the week I had to buy another brush. Don&#x27;t spend money on this product.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. perfect for starters but might want better quality later on..</li>
    <li> I had my concerns after seeing a pic of the brush with the bristles pulled out from the handle. It was probably a goof. My brush is pretty good. The bowl is far beyond the quality I expected. It looks like a soup bowl from an expensive ceramic dining set.</li>
    <li> The items arrived in a timely manner and as described on the site.  I am very pleased with these items!!  The shave brush is soft yet firm for good lather and the soap is lightly scented and clean smelling.  It also makes for a closer and much more comfortable shave!  I recommend this method of shaving foam as it is extremely more comfortable than \\&quot;Canned\\&quot;, shave gels or foam and allows for a cleaner and more comfortably closer shave.</li>
    <li> Nice set and is a great gift for the novice to see if they like this type of shaving or not. Would work great to take on the go when traveling. I did not read dimensions of product but it was smaller then what i expected however it was worth what i paid so i am not disappointed. IF my Hubby enjoys this i will update with a better brush and eventually invest in a top of the line set. THIS  is a great starter set though and i am even thinking about buying a few more and throwing them in as stocking stuffers for my teen boy&#x27;s for X-mas. (Oh yay, Like they DON&#x27;T spend enough time primping in the bathroom already! Pretty soon I&#x27;LL NEVER be able to get in there!) All in All, No complaints!</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first try at shaving with a brush and soap.  As soon as I started whisking the wet brush on the soap, 6-8 bristles came out.  As I applied the soap to my face, another 8-10 fell out.  I&#x27;ve only used the set once so I can&#x27;t say for sure if the whole brush will fall apart soon, but I am concerned.    On the flip side, the soap and dish work well and I did get a fantastic shave.  That&#x27;s the reason for 2 stars.    9/14/2011 Update: After the first 5 shaves, the bristles stopped falling out.  Seems to work well now and I think I might invest in a nicer brush at some point.  For now, this set is fine for me.</li>
    <li> This shave set is perfect for the beginner or experience wet shaver.Nice soap and bowl great brush.A good place to start, all you will need is good razor.Buy a well made vintage Gillette safety razor.</li>
    <li> You really get what you pay for; I have owned one for almost a year and at 9 months, some of the bristles started coming off. Bottom line this is a starter set but once you get it, it is something you will have to upgrade within months.</li>
    <li> I ordered this around the same time I bought a straight razor but it arrived before the razor did. I used this kit instead of my old can of shaving cream with my regular old razor and I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave. When I got the straight razor my shave was smoother than before! It was unbelievably smooth! It&#x27;s both aesthetically pleasing and the lather is thin enough that your razor doesn&#x27;t just graze the tip of your hairs and thick enough that it just glides over your skin instead of digging into your roots. I like the kit while I&#x27;m shaving and my girlfriend loves the end result. I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> The shaving soap last a lot longer than a can of shaving cream. The lather is good and much less thick than cream so you can see what youre doing. Keeps my legs softer than the cream that dries them out after use.</li>
    <li> This set keeps things neat and tidy. It is  easy to use, with a nice palm sized bowl.  The soap smells great and it is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Bought this set from wal mart for the price amazon is listing it for.  Great little set, I am new to safety razors and I am pleased at how this works, I tried the shaving soap, but prefer co bigelow shaving cream. I only used this a few times but the brush and bowl are great, the brush is sturdy and works great.</li>
    <li> I received this item for christmas and I can&#x27;t believe the value it represents! You get a nice boar hair brush, a hand dipped ceramic bowl and the excellent Van Der Hagen shaving soap! Traditional shaving soap is so much better than shaving foam! it gives you a smoother shave with less irritation. This is the traditional way to shave and no bad thing! Sure it takes a little more time but it&#x27;s worth it! As men sometimes we forget to pamper ourselves and this premium shave set let&#x27;s you do just that!Find the time to truly treat yourself to a quality shaving experience. I recommend using this set with a quality safety razor such as the[[ASIN:B004W4PR44 Pilot \\&quot;Endeavor\\&quot; Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor + 10 Free Feather Hi-Stainless Blades]]to get best results with this set you need a quality razor like this and the price is very reasonable as in terms of quality it is on par with more expensive razors such as Merkur or Edwin Jagger.Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Very nice soap, my brush has lost some bristles nothing I didn&#x27;t expect. The soap lathers nicely and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. The bowl is a little small but does work well.</li>
    <li> This is a decent set for the price. The soap is ok, and while the brush is not as nice as a pure badger brush, the results are about the same.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first set, and it works well for the price; the brush (while not perfect) is serviceable enough, and the soap has a rather nice scent which does not linger long. The bowl, however, is admirable. After having replaced both brush and soap, I have still kept the bowl, and use it daily.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re interested in trying your hand at wet shaving this set is perfect. I switched from using cartridge razors to safety razors about a year ago and still use this set. It isn&#x27;t the best out there, but the soap is nice, the Boar hair brush is still holding up nicely and the ceramic shaving cup is a the perfect size to rest on the counter. With a little research into wet shaving you can make this kit go a long way.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expected! Excited to give this as a gift! I know that my boyfriend is going to enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Overall it was fast service and the products were in perfect condition. Only probem is that the brush was not in the box. so I&#x27;d like that sent if possible</li>
    <li> I bought this and started with the puck and moved on to better soap right away, theres nothing wrong with the puck but I just wanted to try something else. this is a good kit from what other reviewers say that the brush falls apart easy not true. JUST DRY THR BRUSH after each use. I store the shaver and the brush in the dry cup after use. Make sure you get all the water out of the brush after each use and you will be fine</li>
    <li> I recently change to a more conventional way of shaving.  This kit provides the foam and lubrication for my straight razor to do the job.  I love it..</li>
    <li> this product not very good quality. The bowl works a suds work but the brush will not last. I have used the brush twice and it leaves so many bristles on my face I haven&#x27;t used it again. Just a very cheap product $wise and quality-wise.</li>
    <li> My review will never be as popular as \\&quot;don&#x27;t be a snob\\&quot;, so I&#x27;ll be brief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good kit for a beginner, but you should really check your local stores first. Amazon has this kit for ~$15 now and it is $9 at my local wal-mart. Best of luck!</li>
    <li> I am shocked how much better this product is than shaving cream in a can.  I have a tough beard and this product makes a new disposable razor shave as close as a barber using a straight razor.  I have been verbally recommending this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift. He loved it. There were no problems. I have to write eight more words here.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brush and foamy soap</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for months and.. no problems. The brush has held up well, the bowl still looks new, and I&#x27;ve already used up the soap which is comparable in quality to the Colonel Conk&#x27;s soap I tried afterwards. I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> good enough for nearly anyone, was my first set, and is now my travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;soap is pretty good as well, and for the price its a wonderful introduction to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> This product is nice to start with. The soap is good. The bowl is as advertised. The brush sucks. The hairs constantly fall out until the brush is no longer useable.  I&#x27;m shopping for a new brush now to replace the one that came with this set.</li>
    <li> I started to get into wet shaving in order to reduce the acne I was getting from shaving. It definitely helped in that regard, although I&#x27;m still not quite sure how it helps. The kit is a great introduction at a great price, and while I intend on upgrading at some point, its a great first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, as other have said, is made of boar hair. This is fine, but badger hair is preferable and seen more commonly on higher end brushes. The hairs are still falling out (probably 3 per shave) but I anticipate that as I continue using it, that will stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells nice and creates a nice lather. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a bowl.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped on schedule.  it was what I expected.  it provides an option to good shaving.  I like to switch once in a while.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter system for shaving with a brush.  Yeah, yeah, badger brushes are a little bit softer, but at 1/4 the price I can&#x27;t complain. This boar brush is good quality and feels great on the face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order this product unless u are absolutely sure that you want it. I tried to cancel the order immediately after purchase and was not allowed too. It did arrive on time and was properly wrapped.</li>
    <li> Used every day. I hate the &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; shaving systems from the likes of Gillette, Bic, etc. The sheer expense is ridiculous, roughly $25 for a pack of 8 razors that don&#x27;t stay sharp with my facial hair after 2-3 uses is way too much. Since switching I&#x27;ve saved over $200 in the last year alone. The soap in this set is very smooth and allows for a even closer shave with less irratation than conventional canned gels, and the brush is fantastic. For an entry level setup this is a fantastic way to get into the safety razors shave system. Very easy way to feel a little &amp;#34;taken care of&amp;#34; or even mildly &amp;#34;pampered&amp;#34; each morning.</li>
    <li> Bought this with my new safety razor since it was cheaper and i didn&#x27;t want to splurge just yet if I wasn&#x27;t sure i would wanna continue using a safety razor. This makes a great lather and I like the feel of the brush.</li>
    <li> I like useing Van Der Hagen soap. It doesnt dry out your face and using a straight razor I never got razer burn unlike with more than one blade razors that are a wate of money. But anyway the the brush does work pretty good. And the bowl is great also. To get the soap in the bowl is simply lather the soap in the package and let it set for a few. And the take the soap out and press it gently in the bowl. Dont try to smash the soap lol. With the bottom of the wet it will stick in the bowl like glue and will not move untill its gone.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit almost two years ago when I switched to shaving with a safety razor. It was cheap and came with everything I needed so I figured why not.    The brush is definitely on the cheaper side and if you can afford a better one, I recommend it. The soap does exactly what it is supposed to, smells good and creates a nice lather. The bowl is probably my favorite part. I had another one for the soap so I used this bowl to lather it up. It is perfect size to fit in your hand comfortably and retains heat nicely. It is a little small for larger brushes but will still get the job down.    I would recommend this to anyone who is starting out or wants a cheap way to get a nice puck of soap and good lathering bowl.</li>
    <li> Great quality lil kit. Was part of my sons first shaving kit. So far he likes it.</li>
    <li> Great gift for men.  My husband was excited to receive it.  The soap doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin, the brush exfoliates well. and the set looks nice enough to sit out on your bathroom sink/counter area.</li>
    <li> Bought this set when I first started traditional (Wet) shaving.  Great value and great way to get your feet wet without breaking the bank.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great shaving set. The bowl is nice and fits the soap perfectly. The soap itself is surprisingly good, it doesn&#x27;t lather too much (though that could be my fault) but it leaves your skin really soft. The brush is a bit cheap though, it has a plastic handle and a few of the hairs have fallen out within about 3 uses. But overall I would recommend this as a first time shave set.</li>
    <li> Very good works as it should</li>
    <li> Again, a case of getting what you pay for.  The soap doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but that could be anything from the water to the quality of the soap.  Then again, at least three or four hairs from the brush seem to come off every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try using something like this after years of just using soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes shaving a little more of a ritual in the morning...takes a little longer etc but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a slightly better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is OK although some of he bristles have come out and are bent over etc.&lt;br /&gt;Nice little bowl and I like the soap...not too fragrant and certainly not at all irritating (I have&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin)</li>
    <li> Great product. I got this to use with my first straight razor and to help with ingrown hairs and I have to say that I have been using this for about a month and I haven&#x27;t had a ingrown hair at all it is awesome the only problem is that some of the hairs fall out but that is to be expected</li>
    <li> This item has performed well for me. It does loose a bristle or two, but for the price, who cares!</li>
    <li> The bristles come off the brush a little when using but not excessively. The whole set was worth the price though!</li>
    <li> My husband was delighted to receive this set. He used it as soon as it arrived and said that it helped make shaving easier and he stated he had a smoother and closer shave with this soap vs shaving cream. Would buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a cheap starter set for wet shaving.  The brush sheds a little at first, but its decent for loading up a good lather.  Soap puck lathers up nicely, and I like that it comes in a re-sealable plastic container. Bowl is a good size.  Nice starter set, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and works well for beginners</li>
    <li> This is a great little shave set I wanted to get one when I ordered my razor but they were out at the time. I was at wal-mart the other day and they have this exact same product for about $1 cheaper plus no S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> So, I added this to an order to get free shipping. I had no real expectation for it going in, and while it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me it is still a decent set for a good price. In my opinion, the weakest link in this set is the brush. It is stiff and sheds a lot. I immediately went back to the brush I had been using. While I don&#x27;t care for how the soap smells, it makes a nice lather and you get a cool bowl to put it in. This would probably be good for travel, or if you are starting out and want everything up front. Watch some videos on how to lather a soap puck and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with this set. Would I buy another one? Probably not, but I also don&#x27;t regret giving this a chance.</li>
    <li> $9 for the whole set seemed like a decent spending decision. I have used all items once and am happy with the kit so far. The bowl for the shaving soap cake is made of porcelain (China) so if you have a tile floor or steel-enamel tub be careful: It&#x27;s going to shatter if you drop it. Brush seems OK so far. Made of boar bristle and not the more common (and expensive) badger bristle. Soap seems OK and lathered up well enough for me.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this kit and says, &#x27;&#x27; This is how real men shave.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great beginner shave set</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son.  I use the same set except I have a different shaving cup.  Hopefully I have set him on a course to save thousands over a lifetime by using this setup instead of buying gel&#x27;s and foams in a can.  Plus, I like this stuff better than foam from the can.  Its not as messy and it&#x27;s warm if you use hot water on the brush.  I turn on the hot to brush my teeth and it is all ready by the time I&#x27;m done brushing, the rinsing out of my mouth is a little warm but I could have prefilled my bathroom cup before the water got hot.</li>
    <li> Decent starter set. Like other comments you can find it for the same price or cheaper at Walmart. The brush is OK, a little stiff but it&#x27;s a boar&#x27;s hair brush on the cheaper side. The dish and soap are both nice in the set. If your unsure about starting to wet shave like this, I think it&#x27;s a good investment to try out with. I did, I enjoy this set and will continue to use it until I upgrade.</li>
    <li> This is the exact shave set I see on the shelves of CVS and Walgreens.  I purchased this as a gift for someone who wanted to try &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; brush shaving.  The first shipment arrived with the bowl broken and had to be replaced.  The replacement set I received was fine.  For the price, and for someone who just wants to take the brush shaving soap ritual out for a test drive this set is a good choice.  For someone who is going to use shaving soap on a daily basis I suggest they consider going with a shaving mug with a handle.  This set has a bowl, and the bowl is typically held in one hand while lathering with the other.  Soap is slippery by design, so it doesn&#x27;t take much of an imagination to see how this no handle bowl could slip out of a hand and break on the vanity or bathroom floor.  After all, there&#x27;s a reason shampoo bottles are no longer glass and glass bottles aren&#x27;t allowed poolside.</li>
    <li> I like it just like the one I used as a young man.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this small shaving set, for once I ordered something he liked.</li>
    <li> This was bought with my first straight razor and I like it.  I can&#x27;t compare against other Soaps , as this is my first, but this gives me a nice smooth shave so no complaints.</li>
    <li> The soap lathers fairly well and for the price the brush gets the job done. I&#x27;ve seen shaving bowls that cost more than this kit.</li>
    <li> I have had this kit now for about a year, and still use it to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave every day, or even every other day, however I needed to curb how much I spent on shaving supplies. This kit is a great start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with this kit, I purchased 100 blades, and a double edged razor. (I have yet to this day needed to purchase more shaving products, except for soap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush in the kit works very well, and now that it is broken in, no longer loses hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl has held up to the test of time, and a few drops. It is also the correct size to fit into your hand. Made of ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is bad. It does the job, however it is not the best smelling, and doesn&#x27;t foam up like other shaving soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I would purchase this again, twice over, for myself or gifts for anyone interested in wet shaving!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well as a combo.&lt;br /&gt;Might be cheaper at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;Brush is ok, kinda cheap but it works.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is the best part of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up pretty good.</li>
    <li> This was bout as part of a gift package for my teenager.  The quality of the soup was very good.  Unfortunately the brush head detached from the handle within 2 months after receiving the set.  While the bristkles stayed together, the ability of the shaving brush to do its job was understandably compromised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this on Amazon. When I was a teenager this is what I used and my father used. I&#x27;m happy I found this set. Price good. Recommend to anyone that wants to go back in time and get a real great shave.</li>
    <li> I really like the bowl, and probably would have paid the price just for that. Soap is OK. Brush sheds like it&#x27;s wintertime. Eventually, a higher-level brush will be needed, but it works and is OK for now. In all, worth the price. I wish Amazon would knock it off with these \\&quot;add-on items.\\&quot; Annoying ALL the time to see the one I would have purchased requiring a $25 purchase to be bought at all. Offer a regular price and an add-on bargain price if you want, but offer the choice.</li>
    <li> I bought this becuase I decided not to support the manufacturing and distrobution of shaving cream cans. I went to soap for environmental reasons. I also did it for sentimental reasons, remembering my grandfather&#x27;s shaving kit. I love the soap, I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll go with a different brush, but I really like this way of lathering my face. This is a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Decent kit for a beginner. Ive used this style for ages, basically I wanted the bowl and I needed more soap and a new brush anyway, so this was the way to go. Used a small coffee mug until now, it worked fine, just wanted to elevate the atmosphere of my shaves. Been using a Merkur double edge, barber handle razor for several years. I just upgraded to my first Straight edge, combined, this all make a wonderful shaving experience!</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this; very happy with it.  Excellent quality and great value.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase another set; Great Kit!</li>
    <li> This is a very good set for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is of perfect size for the soap which comes with it or most other round shaving soaps.&lt;br /&gt;The soap can provide a rich lather with about 15-20 rotation of the brush, and it smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the brush is 100% boar as the box indicates.  It looks like some of the bristles in the center are synthetic (nylon).  The few bristles which fell out from the center of the brush didn&#x27;t look like natural hair, and they looked more like nylon.&lt;br /&gt;During the first use, it lost about 15 bristles.  I don&#x27;t know how it is going to hold over time.  It is a larger brush and it is stiff as most boar and synthetics are.  I do prefer stiffer brushes, and badger brushes are too soft for me.  So, I do like this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Handel is 52mm (2in), and bristle part from base to tip is &#x3D; 53mm (2-1/8in) long.</li>
    <li> Brush is stiff worked good on the soap. Bowl worked ok. The problem I have is the sodium laurel&lt;br /&gt;sulfate.missed that when I ordered,  causes skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Dad love his gift and uses it with this new razor. Said the cup needs a handle though to work better</li>
    <li> This offer that I found on Amazon as a &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; offer is very attractive.  Just the brush by it self costs more than I paid for the set.  The fragrance of the soap is pleasant and the soap does not move about in the dish.</li>
    <li> For $8 you can&#x27;t beat it, that&#x27;s cheap even for a start up kit.  I like the soap and the bowl works well.  After a few months I bought a new brush, but that was the plan all along.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending this to anyone who is thinking about starting to wet shave, or looking for a practical gift for someone who does.</li>
    <li> Went back to the basics after decades and had forgotten how very calming the sensation of a shaving brush on one&#x27;s face feels. My only issue was the initial shedding of brush hair, but I guess that will stop with time. Good kit for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty small but appropriate size for the price.It has a strange mild scent and he has since moved on to other more soothing shave soaps. Great for a start up set.</li>
    <li> awesome product for beginner DE razor wet shavers i highly recommended it  ( i have a very thick beard and sensitive skin) i thought i was in heaven after shaving with these products. if this becomes a ritual for your daily live i recommend more expensive soaps and brushes it does make a difference i was skeptical but after trying them out i was a believer lol</li>
    <li> I think this is a good starter set.The bristles from the brush come loose easily but after a few uses that seems to stop. Over all descent starter set and I would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> The soap smells really good, the bowl looks really nice and gets the job done, but the brush is not very good at all and it smells like wild animal</li>
    <li> The bristles along with the glue that holds the bristles together come out of the plastic holder.  I tried reglueing it but it did not last.  Afer a while the glue started to discintigade and the whole mess just  came apart, making the brush completly useless.</li>
    <li> Great product. nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> The brush is the only draw back. It sheds alot. I don&#x27;t expect it too last too long. The soap is real nice. Smells good and lathers very well.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it is excellent for its purpose; to get you STARTED with wet shaving. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the brush as a quality shave brush but it will get the job done until you decide if you enjoy wet shaving enough to invest some money in it. I bought it at Walmart to try out the whole wet shaving thing and I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the soap is actually pretty decent. You can get a great lather with it and I would put it up there with just about any glycerin shave soaps. The bowl is great, a bit narrow for my taste but it does it&#x27;s job and looks pretty great while doing it. The brush is somewhat coarse and it loses a hair or 2 every use but what do you expect for an 8 dollar Walmart Special?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is NOT the best bowl, brush, and soap you can find but it IS the best starter kit for someone curious about wet shaving or even someone who wants to experience it but can&#x27;t afford to invest in it as a hobby. I see no problem with someone using this kit until the brush wears out, you&#x27;ll get a great lather from it.</li>
    <li> I get severe razor burn with traditional razors and &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; shaving cream. I recently purchased this soap with a straight razor, and get ZERO razorburn. Idont think I could ever go back to a traditional razor and shaving cream. This soap feels great and has a good scent. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the Shave Set and $30.00 was taken out of my account.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me.  I was just starting to get into wet shaving so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  This was the cheapest way to get started.  I would have loved it if it had a brush stand/holder for a little more money but this met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Price is very fair.  Add a little Eucalyptus oil and this foam is perfect.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this set when I started wet shaving. It&#x27;s a great way to get started with all the components it brings. The soap is really nice, and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Good purchase for the money. A good satisfying shave if you are looking for something different then disposable or multi blade razors.</li>
    <li> I recently started wet shaving with a safety razor.  I started off using the same routine as I did with my old Gillette Mach 3.  I was very happy with the results as it looks like I will finally be rid of razor burn for good.  Simply moving to the safety razor fixed that.  Anyway, back to the review of VDH kit.  I was originally going to spend $20 to $40 on a badger brush and some very reputable shaving soap or cream.  However, I decided to try this kit first.  Since I keep reading that badger is so much better than boar bristle, I wanted to experience boar bristle myself so if I ever go to badger, I can form my own opinion.  This kit comes with a 100% boar bristle brush.  I brought it home, took the brush out and let it soak in hot water for a while.  Then I washed the brush with dish soap (Dawn) and let it soak in that for a while, then rinsed clean.  I then did two practice rounds of working up a lather using the soap, bowl and brush since I had never done it before.  This stuff really lathered up great (I got my technique from badgerandblade.com).  The next day I used it for the first time with my shave.  After lathering it up, the brush had enough lather for 3 passes (lathering my face each time) with plenty left if I wanted to do another pass.  The soap really provides a good lubrication and the smell is faint.  I use a cold splash of water on my face after the shave, followed by some Neutrogena Mens Post Shave Lotion.  Nice shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I recently started shaving with a double edge razor.  If you are under a budget then this product is worth purchasing.  You can buy this at RiteAid and I have seen it at Brookshires grocrey store also for $10.  I bought this product for the brush.  It is functional and lathers well.  It is not as good as my Omega Badger Hair brush, but for the price it works fine.  I have not tried the soap yet, I currently use C.O. Bigelow shaving cream and have been using it for years, it is awesome.  I would recommend this product if your are new to wet shaving or on a budget.  For about $25 you can get a nice badger brush that will last years.</li>
    <li> Love the set - Old style for an old man</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it. Very stylish looking set for a good price. Did have some bristles come out during use of brush.</li>
    <li> Entry kit (along with an Edwin Jagger E89BL) to DE shaving.  The brush is surprisingly comfortable and after three shaves, I have no stray hairs shedding.  The soap lathers like a dream and is doesn&#x27;t have a heavy odor, so my cologne doesn&#x27;t have to compete.  I melted the soap in the bowl, which is a perfect size and have a wider, less deep bowl for lathering.  Great entry level setup.  I feel I&#x27;ll be using this for a time before thinking about upgrading.</li>
    <li> Why pay a crazy amount for a brush when you can get this for way less? It puts the soap on your face!</li>
    <li> Good quality and good price</li>
    <li> Buy this set only if you are nostalgic for having a lot of shaving junk sitting out on the shelf.</li>
    <li> This product was a nice choice for a first experience using a brush and bowl. I haven&#x27;t tried the soap bar yet, the first time will be today; because I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint shave gel which works excellent. I had to learn to use these 2 together to make enough foam; experiment, if you will? Firstly, I would squeeze about a teaspoon or less of Dr. Bronners&#x27; gel into the bowl. Then, I would run really hot water on the brush, shake excess water out, then stir both clockwise and ccw, use a twisting motion, then something like a jackhammer...more than enough shave foam made. I noticed 0 out of 1 thought this review was helpful....well; la dee da! Perhaps I focused too much on how I&#x27;m using the product rather than the quality or features of it. Anyways, it&#x27;s not rocket science...it&#x27;s a brush; a bowl and a bar of shaving soap. Been using for a few months and I think it&#x27;s great, the brush is holding up well and the soap isn&#x27;t too bad. Peace out bro.</li>
    <li> Great product. I had never used one of these to shave with, now I&#x27;m wishing I would have bought one along time ago.</li>
    <li> 2 stars for the brush that was good but suddenly ruined after 2 months of occasional use. 4 stars for the bowl and soap, both are good.</li>
    <li> The soap and bowl are good but the brush is not very good at all. The bristles fall out very easily and it feels very cheap. If you are just starting out I guess this is a good way to see if you like using a brush and soap for shaving. But for long term use I recommend something else.</li>
    <li> Nothing negative to say about this...does what it&#x27;s supposed to and is a good &#x27;starter&#x27; set.</li>
    <li> The kit works alright.  I still haven&#x27;t gotten good enough at making the soap work as well as a can of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Begun using this shave soap to learn to sud into shaving cream; it works pretty well.  The bowl is light and inexpensive... in fact, one short drop created a crack.  The brush is certainly not beaver hair that I&#x27;ve borrowed before.  It is okay, but expect to replace after you get a feel for it</li>
    <li> Great for a beginner.  The soap lathers well and smells nicely.  The bowl is sufficient though not top of the line.  It&#x27;s dimensions are about perfect for me.  The brush is not as nice though.  It&#x27;s handle is a little light for my liking and the brush sheds it&#x27;s bristles faster than a pet in the spring.  This &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; slows eventually as the brush (which is a little oversized to begin with) becomes more manageable, though it never really stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having never shaved like this before I found that it was perfect for a starter set and I&#x27;ll be giving a few away as Christmas presents this year.  I probably will &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to a fancier brush before too long but that&#x27;s only now that I know what I want from a shaving set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast (2 days at standard shipping).</li>
    <li> This was part of a Christmas gift for my husband, when it arrived the box was literally ripped across the front of the box. The brush it came with was covered in dust, as well as the bowl. The soap comes in a plastic container that snaps shut. There was nothing wrong with the actual product apart from the dust, so I cleaned up the items, and bought a small bag with a zipper to keep everything together. I liked the feel of the bristles and the bowl. So really I am not that picky about the box. Just a bit disappointing. Oh well.</li>
    <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t beaver hair, but they work alright for a cheap replacement. The soap is long-lasting and the cup is great.</li>
    <li> Good smelling non-irritating soap, nice bowl, OK brush. I bought it for the brush and bowl, &#x27;cause they were cheap, and I use Mama Bear&#x27;s unscented soap most of the time. But I was surprised at the quality of the soap that came with this budget shaving setup, and would happily use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has lost a few bristles since I got it, but is still going strong - whips any soap into a nice thick froth.</li>
    <li> this is great, it saves money, and works great, feels better tan shaving cream, and you can use any soap you like, I will be using this untill I can no longer shave</li>
    <li> The bowl is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap, despite its \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; properties, does not moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is absolutely terrible! Every time I use it multiple bristles fall out and get stuck to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly advise against buying this product.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery. Comes as shown in the picture with all the contents. Everything is in good quality and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT&#x27;S NEVER HAPPY. WELL THIS IS ONE THAT WILL SHUT HIM UP THIS YEAR, TAKE A CHANCE SHARE IT. I KNOW YOU DON&#x27;T WANT TO BUT HECK PASS ON THAT TIME TRAVEL SENSATION IS NICE.</li>
    <li> this box included really nice brush, sturdy easy to hold bowl, and soap. The soap to my husbands surprise was really nice it didn&#x27;t dry his skin out but also didnn&#x27;t make it oily feeling. GREAT PURCHASE I got one for hubby and one for friend.</li>
    <li> Not a bad starter set but I would recommend go for 100% badger hair brush and quality soap. This brush isn&#x27;t very soft and doesn&#x27;t lather like my roommates badger hair one does. Soap isn&#x27;t that great either, spend a few more bucks and get a better quality set.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my father. Very impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;No better deal for the price. Great product</li>
    <li> Soap and mug is very good but the brush strands come out when shaving. For the money you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> For those of you who have been shaving with a double edge \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; for years and bought this because it was one hell of a deal... you should have known better. Is this a top of the line set? No, but for the cheap price it shouldn&#x27;t be. This set is great for beginners. I own this set myself and still use all but the soap everytime I shave. It work just fine. Don&#x27;t be a snob! Here is what is included:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving soap: works fine, just not my style.&lt;br /&gt;-BOAR hair brush: notice I said boar, not badger. It is not as soft, and does shed a bit. Bottom line is it still lathers up good and applies the lather.&lt;br /&gt;-Shave Bowl: Made of ceramic, works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated before this is a beginners kit, it is a great cheap kit for figuring stuff out, and getting your routine down. I still use the brush and bowl. I do not use the soap as it dries our my skin. I use Proraso Shave Cream instead (its amazing!) Someday I may upgrade to a badger brush, but this one still works good. At the end of the day with this kit I can build a lather, apply the lather, and get a close shave... what else is there?!? Here are some TIPS to prolong your kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Do not stand your brush on end using the handle while letting it dry! This will allow water to seep into the handle thus shortening the life span of the bristles. Invest in a holder to allow your brush to dry bristles down. This is the number one mistake made my new shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) If the soap does not work for you, try PRORASO Shave Cream (Menthol). It costs about $10-15 per 5.2 oz tube, but all you need is a dime sized drop in your bowl and you can lather up that face all morning long! A tube will last me all year long! It lathers up well with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) When done shaving, rinse your brush, and squeeze all the extra water out from the brush! Again, dry in a stand with bristles down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Enjoy your shave! In my opinion there is no better way to start my day than with a goodclean close shave.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set, especially considering the price point. Would definitely purchase again. The brush may seem like it could be smoother and nicer but Im not complaining for $10. Probably will buy a nicer brush in the future now that I know I will be sticking with this style of shaving. All in all, a good trial set if you are just looking for something to try out.</li>
    <li> Got my dad back in to the safety razor shaving from his youth. This was an ok substitute to get him started and on to bigger and better. The brush loses quite a bit of hair, and isn&#x27;t that great. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be for the price, so it was expected.</li>
    <li> I loved the review about saying to not be a snob. I feel totally agree with that. The kit is everything you need for a fraction of what you usually would pay, isn&#x27;t the best quality but does the job well. The first uses of the brush will leave some hair so I recommend to try to clean it before, it feels good not having any other experience with another brush I would say that it does what it needs to do. I like the soap, smells great and as it seems it will last for months. The bowl... well it is a bowl not sure if having a metallic one would make a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would say is that the packaging is quite fragile so not my case but surely the bowl is easily to be broken if not delivered nor packaged with care.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving. Brush feels nice on the face. Soap works great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for shave set  and I found this one . I hadn&#x27;t enough money to buy high quality brush , and shaving soap , so this would be great choice . , but don&#x27;t expect something great . It&#x27;s just fair price fair quality</li>
    <li> This is a good, basic starter set for someone switching away from canned shaving cream. Nothing fancy, but decent quality. Only one minor fault, and that is the narrow part of the brush handle is too wide to fit any standard razor/brush rack.</li>
    <li> brush hair falls out quickly and cup not very big also can break if dropped in shower which then becomes dangerous soap okay just depends on what you like to use</li>
    <li> purchased this twice so far.  good brush.  great shave soap! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This kit started me on my quest for the perfect shave.  The soap surprisingly is much better than other discount soaps.  Qualities of the soap that I find important are in this price range there are few soaps that lubricate as well as this, and work into a rich lather as well either.  I am not a lover of the scent but I don&#x27;t hate it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have badger brushes and this boars brush and I can honestly say that Boars brush offers a different shaving property than badger.  Boars brush you soak before you shave as the hair of a boar is similar to human hair... It absorbs water.  Lathers differently than my badger brush with more water in the brush.  Boars bristles are bit more stiff than badger but whether one is better than the other is purely speculative.  I have heard that there are hybrid brushes that use the properties of both and some people like.  Perhaps that will be next on my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl is decent no frills bowl.  I do not lather in a bowl anyway and prefer to lather in my hand, but honestly usually I just froth up the lather directly on my face.  I do not like looks of the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for a decent soap, a decent brush one can tolerate the ugly bowl :)</li>
    <li> Only use the brush.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my boyfriend. The box was kind of small, which through me off but when I opened i was pleased with the size of the cup and the brush. I haven&#x27;t given it to my boyfriend yet but I am sure he will like it. ...and for the price it was worth it. I was originally going to buy the deluxe version of this but I happy I went with this version.</li>
    <li> Oh I still have this set. I bought it a very long time ago, the brush is still good, it produces a nice frothy lather and the end result looks like a freaking masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the little bowl and if you can find the soap it comes with, it smells so good. I highly HIGHLY recommend this product to add to your collection of shaving items. It&#x27;s still my one fave go to Shave set.</li>
    <li> Love this shave set! Better and last longer than cans, smells great! beats the smell of fragrance and butane from foam cans!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart and the very first go, the brush began shedding bristles.  It is very cheap and that&#x27;s about it.  The shaving soap doesn&#x27;t lather up very well either.  You can do better with a foam in a can shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and hated shaving until I got this. I also started using a safety razor when I got this but shaved a few days with a Mach 3 and this was better then before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like this soap and am trying to find something similar with a little more scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have two complaints about the brush, mine has lost quite a few bristles, though it is still very much usable. The other is that the top (bottom if you stand it on end) doesn&#x27;t fit in most of the stands that I&#x27;ve seen, though they will hold it at the base of the handle where it meets the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, and a great way to try out brush and soap shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go with some other items as a groomsmen gift. Item was nice, wish it came in some other color than green. Seems to be a very basic, inexpensive starter kit.</li>
    <li> The brush is perfect. The bowl is sturdy and attractive. You do not need to spend $50 or more for a good shaving set.</li>
    <li> I grew up watching my dad shave with a badger hair brush and shave soap, and teaching my brothers the same. when I moved in with my fiance I was surprised he didn&#x27;t so I got him this set with a safety razor for Christmas, he loves it, the bowl is about the best part of this set, it about the perfect size, at least for my SO it is, the brush I have seen better and will eventually surprise him with a higher quality one, the soap is about so so, I&#x27;ve seen better I&#x27;ve see worse. but all in all it&#x27;s a good  starting point.</li>
    <li> the brush was weak, unreliable and slightly coarse. i recommend badger bristled shaving brushes. soap bowl fit nicely in palm.</li>
    <li> Still having trouble breaking in, maybe due to hard water . Considering miking some filtered water see how well lathers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband along with the Long Handle Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor &amp; 5 Shark Super Chrome Blades. He loves it.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome for someone that is just starting to build their shaving kit. For the price it cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I picked this set up at Walmart for around 8 bucks when it was on sale. I have been wet shaving with this brush and soap for about 2 months and think it is a great way to get started in wet shaving, see how you like it and as funds come in, you can replace the components with nicer quality pieces if you want. I started with this kit and the last of my gillette fusion razor cartridges and it gives a good shave. When the supplied soap puck was worked down to a sliver, i replaced it with Colonal Conk Bay Rum soap and noticed a huge difference in the amount of lather the brush built up. I have also replaced my gillete fusion with a highly rated double edged safety razor, and believe that the qualiity of the shave is about the same as the fusion, but cost of razors is so cheap that the cost of the safety razor and 5 blades was less than two four cartridge replacement packs of the gillete fusion. I currently have a Tweezerman Badger hair brush on order and hope to get a better shave, though i will be keeping the Van Der Hagen boars hair brush around just in case.</li>
    <li> I am very very please with this. Brush,soap and bowl are just the right size. The soap lathers well, softens beard and lubricates the skin for a nick and razor burn free shave.&lt;br /&gt;I use a straight razor and I can say that when used with this kit ,leaves my face feeling very good(little to no face irritant) after the shave .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT disappointed and will most definitely purchase the soap refill</li>
    <li> The package is as promised. But brush hair fall too much, more than expected. And actually shaving not comfortable esp. When a hair does under the blade.</li>
    <li> It was fine for a few months, bu then the bristles started coming loose from the middle. They come out in bunches every few days. I am now left with about 50% of the original bristles, forming a ring with an empty center.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles from such a cheap kit.  Basically, the mug is a mug and it works....I still use it.  The soap had an unpleasant synthetic kind of smell.  I realize this is completely subjective, but I couldnt use the soap.  The brush...eh, it works, but loses at least a dozen bristles with evey use.  The bristles stick to your face with the soap, and if using a straight razor, can make things difficult.  After 3 tries I just used my hands until a my badger brush showed up.&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line, cheap, but largely un-useable.  Yes its only $10, so long as you dont mind throwing away $10.</li>
    <li> I mostly like this set but annoyingly after nearly a dozen shaves it stills seems like 5-10 brush hairs come off on my face, which I find moderately annoying. Outside of that, everything else is just fine with it. The soap works well and smells fine, the physical feel of the brush is nice, and the bowl works exactly how you would expect it to.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. The bowl and brush were bigger than I thought, which was great - especially for the price. Such a steal. I paired this with the $20 Parker Straight Razor for my boyfriend for Christmas. Hopefully he approves!</li>
    <li> Starting out with using a safety razor, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on supplies so I decided to try this set out. The dish and soap are wonderful, the brush has a tendency to shed, and am constantly pulling the bristles out of the soap. I ended up putting a little bit of water in the dish and soap and putting it in the microwave to melt it into the dish. It prevents the soap from just spinning in the dish when making lather. I only took one star off for the brush because I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from the set based on pricing, and the soap is a great product.</li>
    <li> The soap smells bad (just use a $1 bar of glycerin soap instead).  The brush is awful..the bristles fall out like crazy.  The bowl...well it&#x27;s been dropped twice in my shower and hasn&#x27;t broke, I guess I&#x27;ll give it two stars:).</li>
    <li> My husband liked this and uses it almost daily.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this product.  I bought this with the Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol.  He always wanted a product just like the barbers use and here it is.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat the price. the brush sheds a bit when it&#x27;s first used. I haven&#x27;t had a problem since that first time. the bowl is great quality. I took someone&#x27;s advice and microwaved the soap while it sat in the bowl, then let it cool. the soap molded to the bowl perfectly and is now easier to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a gift and My friend uses it Every day.  Joe W.</li>
    <li> Probably a little smaller than I was anticipating but otherwisw a great product that works as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Soap! Does wonders, Doesn&#x27;t foam too much, but what it gives you is enough to do a nice close shave&lt;br /&gt;The Bowl is solid quality, does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad (ish): The brush seams to dry in clumps, and a few hairs fall out every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great for $10. Brushes generally cost $20-30 normally, so I&#x27;m not complaining. If I had the chance i&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> The boar-bristle brush hard-wearing, but doesn&#x27;t really give you a good lather. I got the best results as follows: Wash your face with warm (not hot) water and leave it wet. If you have hard water, soak the brush with cold/room temperature water and set the bristles to drip into the sink. If you have soft/distilled water, you can use warm/hot water more effectively. rather than cutting pieces of the soap into the dish like most tutorials will tell you, take the brick of soap out of the plastic and put it in the mug it will stick in place after a few uses. After ~ 30 seconds, or the brush stops dripping, swirl the tips (ONLY the tips) of the bristles on the surface of the soap until they are coated with soap. Then, swirl the brush on your wet skin where it will lather, and use the brush to spread the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap included with the kit has this weird fat smell that I never liked, but it is very moisturizing. Muhle makes a soap with a scent that I like much better.</li>
    <li> Great price for the set. Bowl fits nicely in hand. The bowl is ceramic.</li>
    <li> A great set. The bowl and the brush are surprisingly high quality for the price. The soap itself is nice too. Not much else to say really.</li>
    <li> Very nice to get started with; I&#x27;m please with how smooth of a shave I get with this set.</li>
    <li> awesome material to make material. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Brush smells bad and lots of bristle loss each time I have used the brush. I do really like the cup -- good size, nice look and feel to it. I also like that it has no handle, which always seemed silly to me for shaving cups / bowls to have handles like a coffee mug. Probably would not buy again due to the brush, but if the cup broke, I might be tempted to buy another and throw out the brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my new straight edge that I got recently. There&#x27;s just something amazing from using soap and a brush instead of  using goop in a can. It left my face smooth and soft, not irritated like every shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. The brush itself, made of Boar, is sturdy feeling,  despite losing a bristle or two already (probably because I pulled on them.) All in all this stuff works, gives an amazing lather, and leaves your face feeling amazing. 5/5</li>
    <li> does the job, nothing special. came on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> No rich lather for soap. Brush quality poor.</li>
    <li> Works well arrived on time</li>
    <li> Thus was a price too good to pass up, special sale of 7$ I think so I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;It us getting harder to find a good shave soap, so if it comes in  a set I usually purchase the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and meets my needs.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use the razor without it. I like the quality of this product. and also the price. I don&#x27;t think you could beat it.</li>
    <li> Brush works, i got a little stand for it so the glue dosnt get dissolved. Bowl is heavy and sturdy ceramic. The soap is barely scented which is good for a  starter. no complaints, really</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a bit over a month now. Here&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush sheds. I thought after reading many reviews for this kit and for other, better brushes that the shedding would eventually stop. Still to this day, some 10-15 shaves later, it&#x27;s still shedding between 2-5 hairs a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers alright and is okay, but after one use I decided to put it on the shelf as a backup and use my Col. Conk&#x27;s Bay Rum shaving soap instead. It smelled better and had great reviews. I bought it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dish is perfect sized for both the shaving soap that came with the kit and the Bay Rum one I also purchased at the same time. I guess it&#x27;s a fairly universal size. Nothing good nor bad to say about it really. I&#x27;ll be upgrading to a wooden dish soon, but that&#x27;s just to match the stand I bought and the brush I am about to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works but it&#x27;s nothing fancy. Slowly, you&#x27;ll likely find yourself upgrading these items one by one until these are just sitting on your shelf as a back-up kit. Great way to start off if you&#x27;re unsure about wet shaving though, as this kit is much much cheaper than many semi-decent brushes on the market alone. Heck, just my wooden stand cost over double what I paid for the kit! If I did this again, I might have bought their &amp;#34;premium kit&amp;#34; though as it looks to be a bit higher quality than this is.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a first kit for moving to wet shaving. I can see upgrading bits in the future (badger brush instead of boar, different soap, etc). But as an initial foray into wet shaving, this is a great place to start</li>
    <li> I have been disappointed in the brush as it continues to lose hairs even after two months of use.  The brush is also fairly stiff.  For the price this set works, but there is better available.  I will be looking for a different brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this set.  The soap has lasted me 6 months and only costs $1 to replace.  My only complaint is the brush.  The head has come out of the handle once.  I was able to easily fix it with just a hot glue gun and it has lasted nearly a year now.  I have no experience with other soaps or creams other than the typical aerosol shave creams.  This is by far better than any of those.  Had it not been for the brush, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> cheap brush cheap soap. unhappy with the quality. soap was not smooth as the normal ones that i use. the brush is now a travel brush as i won&#x27;t care if i leave it in the hotel by mistake</li>
    <li> big time garbage never buy.</li>
    <li> Shaving with soap and a brush is coming back, as many men are finding it offers a better shave over gel or canned foam.  It also offers better value - I first began using soap and a brush when I was in a tight financial bind, and you can find a number of inexpensive products such as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brush - It&#x27;s boar, not plastic or badger hair.  This means it is better able to handle the punishment of a new user, but it still needs to be allowed to dry out.  I am using this to build up the habits needed to use a badger brush now that I can afford one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soap - VDH soap is reliable and foams up nicely after some rubbing with the brush.  Nothing fancy, but a good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bowl - It&#x27;s a ceramic bowl.  It does the job just fine, even if you decide to use a cream instead of the soap.  Avoids accidentally using the shave bowl for cereal.</li>
    <li> this is great. when i ran out of the shaving soap i bought another soap for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is still holding together after 2 years.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy or special here but for the price its pretty much what I expected. The first one I ordered came damaged but I sent it back and they replaced it immediately so no complaints.</li>
    <li> It lathers well with a little work. I really don&#x27;t care for the smell. I think it is a good value even though the brush looses a bristle ever now and then.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent starter set for a newbie.  The soap is okay, doesn&#x27;t lather all that great - but got this mainly for the brush and bowl.  The brush is good, but after a year of use it is starting to lose some bristles, but still lathers soap nicely.  The bowl is nice, a good place to put the soap - seems to be heavy bowl that will last many years.  After 1 year it still looks new.</li>
    <li> I gave as gift the art of shaving is being spread no more throwaway plastic razors so much cheaper than disposable</li>
    <li> For the money it&#x27;s fine...About average actually compared to some of the real pro stuff,but again for the money not bad,,,Soap can be obtained easily in a Walmart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a $10 shaving kit.  Yes, that hairs do fall out of the brush.  The soap it comes with is not the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  But as a starter kit, I recommend it.  I&#x27;ve since upgraded everything.  But it&#x27;s a nice kit to see if it&#x27;s something you are interested in doing.</li>
    <li> This thing absolutely sucks. The soap doesn&#x27;t give a good lather at all and the brush just loses bristles like crazy. Definitely a case of getting what you pay for. Just throw your money in the trash, or buy something that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> bowl feels solid yet light, soap is foamy and provides a smooth shave but the brush seems to have a hair-loss issue it&#x27;s not a serious issue but it happens more often than i&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a friend just getting into shave soap and brushes.  He really liked it, now if i can get him on the straight razor bandwagon....</li>
    <li> Simple but nice glide to many razor. It is nice to use. Bowl was nicer then expected as well as brush. Only complaint probably the smell of the shaving soap was not as pleasant as i would have liked.</li>
    <li> The brush is of low quality.  The soap is very light, doesn&#x27;t have that barber foam you expect.  If you bought this kit individually with better products, it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit 5 months ago and I am still in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never liked the idea of paying so much for the shaving gels in a can that you go through so fast.  With this I am still on my first bar of soap shaving 2-3 times a week and have barely made a dent.  Originally I bought an extra bar not knowing how long/how fast I would go through them but I am set for a VERY long time with just the two bars.  On a side note my wife loves the smell after I shave and the only other product I use is a splash of witch hazel to close the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the brush side yes I do get an occasional bristle coming off the brush but that is expected with any brush.  I love the feel of lathering up and could never think of going back to the gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shaving soap I have tried a few different razors and I have gotten the best results from a single blade.  I don&#x27;t have the old school double edge razor yet, but I&#x27;m talking about the very cheap single blade razors you get 12 for 5 bucks.  I have tried this with a Gillette 4 blade and it was just painful.  The Gillette just rips out the hair, but even with the cheap drug store single blade razor I get a very close shave and a very enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an excellent product starting me on my life to great shaving.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to order this because I read some reviews saying the brush shed and fell apart. I have been using this for 6 weeks now and I love it. I think the trick to keeping the brush intact is hanging it and letting it dry after use instead of leaving it sit in the mug. I also bought a stand for hanging the brush and my razor and this seems to work fine. I will get an occasional bristle come out when lathering but very few and not often. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent, reasonably priced brush and mug set.</li>
    <li> Glad Amazon had this shaving set! Great for the price!</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected for the money but my husband was happy with it and I guess that is what counts for me.</li>
    <li> Great price and good stuff. I&#x27;m new to straight razoring and this soap is great on my face.less eritation on my skin and smells good. Good price and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very nicely made quality is perfect for the price and then some the soap that came with it has lasted me two months and still going the cup has been dropped a few times and hasn&#x27;t broken so kid tested and I suggest you wash the brush and give the brush a gentle tug to get loose bristles off the brush if not they end up on your face but over all very very nice I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d buy again but I don&#x27;t see myself needing another any time soon cause everything is if good quality</li>
    <li> NICE, EXCELENT AND BEAUTY</li>
    <li> I bought this set to try my hand at lathering with a brush and soap to see if I would take to it without investing a lot of money.  I&#x27;m loving it so far.  I had the hang of lathering pretty well by the second time, and the problems I had the first time may be because I didn&#x27;t wash the brush as well as the directions intended me to.  I&#x27;m going to move on to other soaps, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to this brush and bowl for a bit and will easily make it worth the low price of the item.</li>
    <li> the soap latheted well would recommend for any man using straight razo the kidsr my husband really  the kids kit and would recommend</li>
    <li> Got this in December for my boyfriend and he is just now running out of the soap stuff.</li>
    <li> Good kit, but the box was not packed well and the bowl was broken. It&#x27;s just a hassle to return a small item like this.</li>
    <li> Nice brush and dish, I gave it as a gift, he thought it was great ! I will order more for others</li>
    <li> brush losses allot of bristles</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this kit at a walmart because I needed shaving soap and don&#x27;t like the canned goop, I had and used the bowl for months it&#x27;s a great little bowl for this type of shaving and you can also venture to the kitchen section of any walmart or target and get another bowl the same size in an assortment of colors for $1 the bowl is the best value of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap I give 4 stars, the type of water you have will vary your lather I was driving OTR at the time and the lather varied&lt;br /&gt;but with good water you&#x27;ll get an amazing lather and feels good as you&#x27;re shaving with no noticeable scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush forget about it, it was like using a cheap paintbrush it shed all over my face leaving bristles that I couldn&#x27;t see until they got caught up in my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try this type of shaving out this is a great kit, you can always upgrade to a better brush which can be found in the makeup section go for the bamboo kabuki by eco tools, then there&#x27;s many varieties and places to get soaps from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and happy shaving.</li>
    <li> I would have liked to try this product, but until the people who package these items learn that things in the mail get banged around in more than one direction, you will never get to use the ceramic bowl that comes with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I gave them two chances to get it right, no go. While the return was processed without problems, I would not waste my time buying this again.</li>
    <li> I got into this type of shaving because my girlfriend got me an expensive straight razor from the art of shaving as well as a kit from there (oil,soap,aftershave,badger brush) last christmas. The stuff is great but super expensive. When I saw this kit at rite aid for under 10 bucks I had to try it. I have been using the bowl and soap since (not the brush, I prefer the badger brush). The bowl is simple and a perfect size to cup in your hand, paired with the soap is excellent match! Make sure that when you buy refill soap you get the DELUXE, I made the mistake of getting a similar soap (white color) that is NOT the same. I considered taking a star away because I don&#x27;t like the brush it comes with very much but at under 10 bucks the bowl and soap are worth it and I would recomend getting it anyway!</li>
    <li> Decent starter set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is good quality for the price and the bowl is decent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a different type of soap so the Van Der Hagen was just a bit to thin for my tastes.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this at Amazon.com because it is cheaper here. This is my first time using a shaving set. I watched a couple of youtube videos on how to do it and it is really easy. The soap lathers up real nice and smells good. The bowl, well is a small bowl and nice colors. The brush feels real nice on the face but fibers come out of it time to time. I might invest in a nicer brush. My understanding is the soap for lathering can last 4 months or more. This is a more expensive way to shave rather than using canned shaving cream but this method is fun and rewarding.</li>
    <li> Nice brush and good soap for a light lather, definitely lacks a little in the  scent department.</li>
    <li> I originally saw a youtube video on how to shave with a set like this and happened to find this in Fred Meyers. It was pricier than what Amazon has but I&#x27;m happy to say well worth the price. This has gotten me confident that I want to continue shaving this way instead of with my electric razor. I ordered more soap to last me another year or so and will start researching on a real razor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Small price to pay to try something new and its fun!</li>
    <li> I like the brush from this set,I don&#x27;t use the soap or the bowl, still good quality.</li>
    <li> 100000000000 times better than any disposable razon shave. Buy this cheap little set.</li>
    <li> It was everything I hoped for and the service was awesome</li>
    <li> The brush is good, not top of the line  but it does the job.  The soap lasted me a while and has a good scent.</li>
    <li> This set has worked well for me as my first brush and bowl. The brush has a plastic handle, with real boar hair and makes a good lather. If I brush a little too vigorously, i&#x27;ll get a hair that falls out every so often. Would be a lot better if this came with a stand to hold the brush and a razor, though.</li>
    <li> I think you can hardly beat the price for this set. As others pointed out, the soap and the bowl are very nice, and both will most definitely outlast the brush. I&#x27;m only rating it a 4 star because the brush has lost hair at every use. Anyways, it&#x27;s a great starting or travel shaving set.</li>
    <li> bought this about a year ago.  I rate it pretty well at 4 stars simply because of the price and what you get.  the ceramic mug is nice and looks good on the bathroom counter, the soap smells nice and lathers good.  The only reason I dropped a star is the brush does lose some bristles like others noted.  I ca nt complain, its shed a few the first several shaves and has stopped.  It never lost enough for the brush to look different or lose effectiveness.  Folks here wonder what to do with the wet brush when done shaving, I simply drop it back in the mug with the wet soap and the soap and brush are dry by the time I shave again.</li>
    <li> my husband liked this set very much</li>
    <li> Its a cheap shave set. The bowl feels a little small, the brush is not the highest quality, but I didn&#x27;t expect any more for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, for lack of a better word, is junk. Impossible to lather the soap with.  Bristles fall out after immediate use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells very nice, but doesn&#x27;t lather all that easily. (even with a better brush, and certainly not in the accompanying bowl)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a bowl. However, it is pretty small in diameter.  So, lathering in the bowl is pretty much pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, there is nothing premium about this set.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my son. He absolutely loves it. Wants to order another one for next 1 he bus.</li>
    <li> If you are just starting out, this is a perfect kit, the soap isn&#x27;t bad, nothing particularly special, but definitely not bad. the bowl is.... a bowl. so... not a lot can go wrong there... since... its a bowl. the brush is boars hair, a boar is a pig. pigs, can smell unpleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t hold heat as well as badger, however, a good silvertip badger brush can run $60+. the brush has a good spine (stiffness) and creates very good lather, when using the soap its best to pre warm the bowl with water as hot as you can stand, then drain and hit it with fresh hot water after it warms up, then drain and get at it with the brush, heat a water are the main ingredient of lather, don&#x27;t ram the brush into your skin. light circular and sweeping motions is all you need. when done, rinse thoroughly with cold water, then either hang it upside down, or do what i do and use the old lady&#x27;s hair dryer to completely dry it out. i bought this kit a month ago and use the brush every. single. day. yes, it did shed at first, all brushes do. if you care for it properly it will stop for the most part, a hair or two every now and then is totally normal, and even if this brush only lasts a month or two and you get a good feel for it, buy a better one. its $9, not a lot can go wrong. you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Bowl - OK&lt;br /&gt;Soap - OK&lt;br /&gt;Brush - not so good.&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, it&#x27;s still shedding hairs, which always seem to end up in my mouth or caught in the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I guess eventually the shedding will stop... or I will be left with a brushless handle but I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this product and will now have to purchase another brush from a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> First time &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaver so no basis for comparison. Bought this alternatively from piecing together mid-high end brush/soap/bowl. Pleasantly light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger long (which I prefer) and IMHO doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; AT ALL, just more of a clean soapy smell. I also like the boars hair brush, but I&#x27;ve never used a badger haired brush to compare. After some trial and error with the lathering process, I&#x27;ve found a solid system for this product that works for me: Soak the brush in the bowl with hot tap water. Also add enough hot water to cover the top of the soap cake...this will allow for quicker brush loading. Do all of this before showering if possible or at least 3 minutes prior to lathering. Dump bowl water and shake out brush 1-2 times, so just a small amount of water stays in the brush. Brush load at least 30-45+ seconds and lather in the bowl 1-2 minutes, adding a few drops of water AS NEEDED. Remember, you want a THICK and SILKY lather. Too much water will make it flat and loose. Happy shaving mates :)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Met all my expectations and makes a wonderful Christmas gift for the men who use razors.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Another great starter item for people just getting going with safety razor shaving.  I picked this up because of the price and great reviews.  Was just starting out, and wasn&#x27;t ready to commit to a nicer brush or more expensive soap.  I&#x27;ve since moved on to badger brush from Art of Shaving and the Proraso&#x27;s Sensitive soap, but still use the brush/soap from this kit when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the soap from this set better than the Art of Shaving soap I tried.  It&#x27;s generally thinner and smoother, and doesn&#x27;t cause much (if any) build up on the razor.  The smell is clean and ever-so-slight, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brush, I definitely noticed a difference when I switched to Badger, but this is a mighty fine brush to start with, and more than gets the job done both in terms of exfoliating and creating a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use a bowl when I shave (just lather against the cup of soap) but I will say it&#x27;s a pretty nice, durable ceramic bowl...not something I expect would break easily.</li>
    <li> I found the product in store for a little less. It got the job done I am just more of a shave jell/Cream guy, personal preference.</li>
    <li> What can I say, the soap,bowl and brush works well ..........need I say more.........6 more words required.......now 3,2,1,LOL now 1.....BINGO</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave.  I think it&#x27;s more about the prep than about the razor..  This set works GREAT and is of excellent quality !!</li>
    <li> Great buy for all three items in the kit.  Already bought 12 pack of soap bars.</li>
    <li> It is a bowl that holds soap and liquid and a brush that makes a lather.  recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. It is small and perfect for a starter kit. The soap has a soft fragrance and boar brush is a little rough but it did its job and the shave was amazing according to the person gifted. The bowl is easy to handle and fits in his palm perfectly. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> As described and on time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, the brush is huge!, and the soap lasts for about 25 shaves</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my (Stephen, not Jen) first foray into DE shaving. The soap and bowl are great. The brush sheds 1-2 hairs every time you use it, occasionally in clumps. Still, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now; the middle hairs have all fallen out, but for the price, this is pretty unbeatable.</li>
    <li> This was a Xmas Gift for my son and he like it very much.. I like the price !!!</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Fast delivery, easy on the pocket book.</li>
    <li> love the bowl and brush. soap was a disappointment. happy overall.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  My husband has wanted this for years.</li>
    <li> I have found that the soap makes my skin very soft, and the smell brings back memories as a kid in the barber shop, I would recommend to anyone wanting a great shave, I have very thick hair, and have never had a problem shaving after the purchase of Van Der Hagen!</li>
    <li> This set is great. I bought this because I wanted a bowl, but it was cheaper to buy this whole set than to get a bowl by itself...ironic. The soap only needs a little water to lather up well, and is a larger chunk than a lot of other soaps out there. The bowl is heavy and fits in the hand well. The brush is great for the price. Awesome!</li>
    <li> A real nice set for the price! Very satisfied . But wished the soap lathered up easier for my taste.</li>
    <li> I decided to try wet shaving.  I don&#x27;t know about using a double-edge razor yet, as those have not come, but when this arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it with my Gilette Fusion.  I used to use a brush and Gillette soap years ago, so I expected to be happier with it than shaving cream.  Frankly, the brush is good, the &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; is fine (I used to use a coffee mug, who cares about the bowl), but the soap is just wonderful.  It lathers beautifully, and the razor almost glides over it, even with a full week&#x27;s beard.  I spent less than $10 on a warehouse deal for this, and I&#x27;d be happy if I&#x27;d spent $30.</li>
    <li> The brush works really well.. I like the little cup.. and the soap feels really good. it all works great guys... Thank You Amazon..</li>
    <li> HARD to find combo at a great price. This one is well made and not priced as an antique.Good value for a great productThis one is well made and not priced as an antique.Good value for a great product</li>
    <li> If you want a travel set or are new to DE shaving, this is a nice starting set.  The boar&#x27;s hair brush, soap and cup get the job done at a VERY reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Best value on the market. All included and the shave is soothing and good.</li>
    <li> Being new to wet shaving, I saw this set as an inexpensive way to get started.  The brush is actually pretty nice.  It is nothing fancy, but it is a good sized knot, and it feels good on the face.  The bowl is a great size as well, and feels good in the hand.  I like the soap.  It lathers pretty well, and has a nice scent.  I&#x27;ve since discovered Proraso soaps, and prefer them to the Van Der Hagen, but all in all, this really is a nice value for the money.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting to get into wet shaving.  You might move on to more expensive products later, but this kit is a great place to start.</li>
    <li> Nice starter set!  The boar brush softens nicely over time and I prefer the &amp;#34;springiness&amp;#34; of a boar hair brush to a badger brush. Brush has not broken down or become threadbare after a year of use, but I do always hang it up bristles-down after use. (I glued a string loop to the top of the handle so I can leave it hanging on a hook in my shower.)  The bowl is just the right size for lathering a small cake of soap. The soap itself smells and feels great and produces a thick lather as long as your brush is not too wet. I purchased a second kit to travel with and I was surprised how much I liked the vdh soap after using Williams mug soap for 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> The set is nice to have for the first timer trying out de shaving (DE-double edge).&lt;br /&gt;For the money, it should have more stars, but compared to other shave brushes, it could have less. Factor the cost and the product and it gets 3 stars. If you Don&#x27;t mind spending $25 or more? Go with badger.</li>
    <li> Ordered this set along with a DE safety razor to get into DE razor shaving. I always used to use a catridge razor and some shaving gel for my face. The bowl is a good quality ceramic and holds the soap nicely. Soap works well, takes a little bit of time to build up a lather. The brush has been pretty good so far. Some of the bristles have come off, but it seems to have stopped &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;. Highly recommended and fun to use.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this a shot for shaving.  The brush is simply terrible.  I wouldn&#x27;t both buying it if I was looking again.  Will probably throw it out.  The soap and dish are fine though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I liked this kit till I didn&#x27;t bring it on a vacation... I figured I would just bring my razor and some canned gel and use my hand to apply, it felt like i was ripping my skin off. When i use this brush and soap I always get a smooth shave.  I use this with a Merkur and Astra blades. Been using it a couple months and all is still good. The brush gets a good lather and the soap is nice. The bowl is a bowl...</li>
    <li> Use it with the double edge razor I bought from Amazon.  Going back to double edge razor using  the Van Der Hagen shave set feels good and refreshing.  The brush is very nice and the soap has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good starter set.  Really like the scent, so much so that I sometimes just use it for a face soap when not shaving.  I get a very good shave, and enjoy using the products, so I&#x27;ll continue using it, but I get a slightly better shave from aerosol Aveeno foam, which lubricates better and still provides a good glide after multiple passes.  The VDH tends to dry too quickly on my beard and must be rewet or re-brushed to finish my shaves.  I tried using more water and also shave oil, but no difference.  The brush is fine, not sure what to expect.  It lathers quickly enough and applies okay.  Not sure why they didn&#x27;t include a stand.  Seems like you wouldn&#x27;t want it drip-drying upside down, but assume it must be just fine to do so.  Given the quite reasonable price, it is almost a 5 star.  One tip, the VDH site has a video on how to use it.</li>
    <li> The brush is stiff and works well in getting your whiskers up.  The soap creates a lather but not like the lather gotten form a can of shaving cream.  Just as well, a good shave only requires a nice layer of soap and not a pile of shaving cream 3 inches thick. The soap has no fragrance that I can detect.  Leave the skin soft to the touch.  Overall, a great set that completes the set of safety razor, brush, soap and bowl.  I will never go back to canned shaving cream. Great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who has just recently started shaving with the old fashion, single razor blade type razor.  He decided to go full on and use a shaving brush and soap like his dad used to use.  He is happy with the whole thing with the exception of the soap itself.  There&#x27;s nothing at all wrong with it, he just felt it dried his skin a little more than he was used to.  He ended up purchasing another soap bar but is still very pleased with the other products, the brush and bowl, etc.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an old time bathroom look. And all the pieces look good with my straight razor. All I need now is a razor strop.</li>
    <li> My first set so I have nothing to compare it to. Managed to keep me from cutting my face into shreds.</li>
    <li> This kit was a great deal for a new DE shaver. Wife loves the smell of the soap and I like the lather. The brush and bowl work well also. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> this kit is a nice start to safety razor shaving.  its not expensive or a &amp;#34;professional kit&amp;#34; but it is a good place to start if your new to safety razor shaving.</li>
    <li> if you want to try the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34; this is a good starter. as any one knows a better (not best ) brush costs ten times as much as this set.</li>
    <li> The soap is better than most I&#x27;ve tried and the price is right! I love it. My 13 year old son has begun using it, and we both prefer it to canned cream.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really complain for the price. I&#x27;d been shaving with gel or foam for a while and I knew THERE HAD TO BE ANOTHER WAY. The brush isn&#x27;t really the best quality at all, but again, the price. It&#x27;s a great value and might change your shaving routine for the better, as it did for me</li>
    <li> Nothing super high end here but they get the job done right.  Brush works pretty legit.  Soap is good, just be careful not to add too much water.  I personally haven&#x27;t used anything more high-end than this set, but I have hard time it can get much better than this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for first time user. Some shedding but not so much to cause concern. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Good brush, good bowel - OK soap.  I like the set and would only recommend trying the Williams soap when the Van Der Hagen is gone.  Hard to get this type of a set for a better price.</li>
    <li> I am a rather new proponent to wet-shaving. I have used a few shaving soaps, creams, brushes, DE safety razors, and blades. I purchased this product on a Navy base for $9.99 and it is a nice little startup arrangement for any new proponent to wet-shaving. I chose this review because for the price you cannot get all three of these items cheaper individually. It comes with a bowl, a boar hair brush, and a puck of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -THE BRUSH: remember, I am new to wet shaving so I haven&#x27;t used the best but in my opinion, the brush does an excellent job of creating lather from the puck of soap. At first, the brush comes out of the box with a slight odor (I&#x27;m assuming boar) but is easily removed by the third mixture of lather. The bristles appear to be made from what is claimed, boar hair and they are somewhat stiff at first which is better for lathering soaps compared to creams. Plastic handle, feels nice and heavy in your hand, it is a dark nay blue handle. I have large hands and the brush handle fits well in my hands so that my fingers don’t touch the rim of the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -THE BOWL: In my opinion, the bowl is a little small for my comfort and experience thus far. I found it difficult to whip the lather like I usually do with my larger mugs and bowls. Having said that, it does the job of a bowl for mixing lather. It retains heat okay and compliments the brush it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -THE SOAP: this soap was very easy to make lather from. It comes inside a small plastic container with a very tight fitting lid so after use you can close it and store it. The fragrance is very mild for a man, nothing like sandalwood or proraso shave soap. It isn&#x27;t a lasting fragrance so it is easily washed away. It is actually a pinkish color compared to the picture.</li>
    <li> This product is much better than your standard canned shaving cream or gel. It is easy to use and comfortable on your face. I can see upgrading to a different brush when the one in this set wears out. Everything I have read says the badger hair brushes are better than boars hair, which this set had. Ultimately, I have no complaints about this set.</li>
    <li> you can get it at the grocery store for $8 the bowl is decent, the brush does not last long, and the soap is incredible. i am considering buying the same company&#x27;s luxury shave set ( the orange box)</li>
    <li> Found this basic shave set.  I have used the soap included in this set previously when traveling and carrying on my luggage.  I like the scent and the lather creates a good lubricant for shaving.  This set added a bowl and brush.  Wanted to change up my shaving regimen and bring a little old-school flair without spending lots of money and this is a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit came quickly - thanks Amazon!  Bowl is nice, not fancy, which works for me.  Brush has plastic handle and boar hair.  Supposedly nicer shaving brushes will have wood or exotic material handle and badger hair.  The boar hair works and the plastic handle feels fine in my hand.  Holds sufficient moisture to create a decent lather, which is the point of the brush.  It also feels OK on my face.  Feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating a bit and lifting the beard hair, again as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered a double-sided safety razor but that is coming from overseas, so the full shaving experience will have to wait.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m enjoying my new shave kit that didn&#x27;t cost me a fortune and a half.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a couple of times because it was the only saving kit available in local shops.  The bowl is poorly designed since is allows the soap no place to affix itself to the bottom and thus turns most times when you try to work up a lather.  The brush is substandard and falls apart within about one year.  I repaired the first one, and it  disintegrated totally a few months later.  I already repaired the second one, and it is still holding up two months later.  Truly, the brushes are poorly constructed.  the shaving soap itself is okay.</li>
    <li> Great lather! I would buy again</li>
    <li> I got this kit to dip my toe into brush shaving.  Here&#x27;s how I would sum up this kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is not good.  The bristles fall off every time I shave.  I have already replaced the brush after only 10-15 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;- The soap is okay but not great.  It lathers decently.  There is no aroma.&lt;br /&gt;- The bowl is the best part of the kit.  Its a nice size and looks good on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Overall all this is a great starter kit for any gent looking to get a set at a cheap price.  The soap lathers fairly good and has a good smell to it.  The brush is stiff at the beginning and will do a fairly good job.  Give it at least two weeks of consistent use to break in the brush and you will see and feel a difference.  Overall i would recommend this shave set any gent starting with DE razors.</li>
    <li> For men sick of the chemical tang to shaving cream and the discomfort and cost of disposable blades, the Van Der Hagen shave set makes an excellent introduction to shaving the old-fashioned wet lather method our fathers and grandfathers preferred. While technological improvements sometimes save time and effort, shaving is one arena where older is better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three piece set includes a handsome green-glazed bowl, a puck of shaving soap, and a boar-hair brush with a solid plastic handle. Add one razor with good cartridges and you are set to go. Even disposable razors can be used, though the effect may not be as ideal. The complete kit is its main selling point, and at this low price, it makes an outstanding gift for someone considering making the transition. It can also make a good back-up or travel set, particularly for students living in dorms or a businessman who wants to leave his more expensive alternatives at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend replacing the shaving soap with [[ASIN:B004XC75D6 Colonel Conk Glycerin Shave Soap Bay Rum (106g)]], which boasts a much better lather, fresher fragrance, and longer lasting soap. I was not impressed by the Van der Hagen option. The puck whips up a reasonable lather and the smell isn&#x27;t bad, but bay rum wins hands down for me any day. My fiance&#x27;s skin felt much softer and the shave looked easier. But to each, their own, and a man can never have too much shaving soap as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar brush is considered a step below badger hair by connoisseurs, but for a foray into wet shaving, it works perfectly well. Most important is a shaving stand to allow the brush to dry between uses after being properly rinsed and cleaned. This kit does not include a stand, but excellent chrome options are available that fit just fine. The plastic handle is durable and comfortable for use, and resists cracking, scratches, and occasional nicks. After two years of use, my brother&#x27;s brush looked pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set couldn&#x27;t be better priced to get started and allows the timely replacement of components once personal preferences are discovered. The results of a good shave speak for themselves, and the Van der Hagen set will help you achieve that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set couldn&#x27;t be better priced to get started and allows the timely replacement of components once personal preferences are discovered. The results of a good shave speak for themselves, and the Van der Hagen set will help you achieve that.</li>
    <li> After reading the article titled &#x27;How to Shave Like Your Grandpa&#x27; on The Art of Manliness, I happened across this set while at Walmart one afternoon. I figured for $8 I didn&#x27;t have much to lose, and I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the bristles on this brush aren&#x27;t as soft as a true badger brush are, they get the job done just fine.  I love the soap, and it&#x27;s lasted me almost a full 8 or 9 months worth of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint is the dish isn&#x27;t really travel-friendly, and there isn&#x27;t a stand for the brush included. Not a huge deal, again considering what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pair this set with some blades from the DollarShaveClub, and you&#x27;ve got yourself a nice little kit!</li>
    <li> Recently I was given my Grandfather&#x27;s shaving brush from my Dad.  I&#x27;m a head shaver, haven&#x27;t had a clean shaven face since junior high, so receiving this brush was a great surprise.  I didn&#x27;t want to just jump into using it given it&#x27;s history in my family so I found this kit at Wal-Mart for about $9.  Talk about surprised!  The brush included is great, boar&#x27;s hair &amp; works great, the soap is even better, has that great \\&quot;old time\\&quot; smell, some will know what I mean there.  The bowl is a bowl, looks nice &amp; does its job.  Probably my ONLY negative about this kit is I wish it would have included a stand to hold everything (or maybe just the brush) other than that you just can&#x27;t beat it.  I plan on using my Grandfather&#x27;s brush starting in the new year &amp; dropping the included brush down to my travel bag.  Now to find a travel soap container &amp; I&#x27;ll be set!  If you&#x27;re just getting into \\&quot;old school\\&quot; shaving or looking for a nice inexpensive gift for someone I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed at all with this, whether you buy it here or at another store.</li>
    <li> At least I can shave like a man!  Take a trip back in time to when shaving was a relaxing personal indulgence.  For the price the bowl and the soap translate to good bang for the buck.  The brush is not real badger hair which is a good thing because that would make it a $70 brush.  Occasionally a fiber strand from the brush will come off, but no big deal.  The brush is also good for applying hot water to your whiskers to soften them up! Highly recommend this shaving set!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve just purchased your first DE or straight razor, this is a nice started kit.  The brush bristles are great for boar, the bowl is simple but looks good and serves its purpose, and the soap smells better and has a thicker lather than a few of the more expensive bars.&lt;br /&gt;That said,  a cheap badger brush, like the $13 Escali not only looks worlds better than the plastic unit in this set, but also feels much better on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Good introduction to old-fashioned shaving, but maybe not the most bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> This unit that I received looks as cheap as it is. The brush has that just plastic molded look to it as If I just pulled it off a Chinese plastic model parts group. To be honest I haven&#x27;t had time to use it, but I&#x27;m a little shaky on that one. I bent the bristles back and forth to simulate use and hair started falling off. It eventually stopped with lots of it still in tact. The soap has no fragrance but lathers up pretty good. i would not order another one when it needs to be replaced/</li>
    <li> The soap and bowl are good but the brush is junk. I&#x27;ve seen the set without the brush for $5 in some stores. Go for the inexpensive tweezerman brush and hang it to dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I started shaving with a straight razor. The lather is good and the bowl is the perfect size, but, the brush is a little too stiff and over time bristles start to fall out. It&#x27;s been a year now and there&#x27;s still plenty so they fall out slow, but it can be annoyng when shaving.</li>
    <li> I recently became interested in traditional wet shaving when I realized how much money I could save.  I&#x27;ve been using cartridge razors for years, most recently using the Gillette Fusion razors, and I&#x27;ve never been terribly happy with them.  I hate shaving.  I have to do it for work, but I have very coarse facial hair, and it grows close to my face.  This has made it difficult for me to get a good shave, and I ended up using the most expensive razors I could find in hopes of improving the experience.  The problem is how much they cost.  When I did the math on wet shaving versus cartridge razors, I discovered that I could buy everything I needed to start out plus enough double edged razors to shave for three years for the price of two months shaving with the Fusions.  At that much of a savings, I figured I could deal with an inferior shave if I could save that much money.  Oh, little did I know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I chose this kit to start with for one reason, it was cheap.  I did read some good reviews on it, but I had no illusions of this being the best brush ever made.  But for soap, a bowl and a brush, you can&#x27;t beat it if you&#x27;re just starting off wanting to try wet shaving.  The brush does lose the odd bristle from time to time, but it&#x27;s a $4 brush...so not a big suprise here.  Just pay attention and don&#x27;t try to shave over one.  The bowl and the soap work great, and much to my delight, not only is this a cheaper shave, it&#x27;s also much better!  I don&#x27;t hate shaving anymore.  It&#x27;s not fun, but it&#x27;s no longer something I dread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So if you&#x27;re interested in wet shaving, but don&#x27;t want to sink a ton of money in initially, try this kit out.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did, and you can always upgrade later if you want.</li>
    <li> As the title says its been over a year actually and I finally threw out the bowl and brush cause the brush starting losing bristles from the get go and the soap was tossed at the one month point cause of mildew growing on it.</li>
    <li> The included soap irritated my skin and the brush was clumped with glue when I got it. I replaced the brush with a better one, tossed the soap, and kept the little bowl. If you have sensitive skin, beware. The word &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; has a loose interpretation here.</li>
    <li> This product is great so far. I had never used soap like this before for shaving but it looks like i will not be going back to the old shaving cream any time soon.</li>
    <li> For the amount of money, this is pretty great. The husband really likes it. The soap doesn&#x27;t foam up much (about as much as if you washed your hands) but it gets the job done and is good for someone venturing out into the world of &amp;#34;advanced shaving&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had this shave set for a little over a year, and I&#x27;m still using it to this day. I did not have any problems with the shave brush except for a few hairs falling of but nothing major, the bowl.. Well its a bowl, nothing special. The soap works well on me and the smell isn&#x27;t strong. I gave this 5 stars because the brush had lasted me a whole year without any problems.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s cheap. I won&#x27;t down-rate it too harshly. A 3 is appropriate. It&#x27;s mediocre; not good, nor terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is boar hair. You want a badger hair brush. But the price makes this OK. You can&#x27;t buy a cheap item &amp; expect it to function like a Rolls-Royce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush provides a better lather than using your hands.. However the hair falls off pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave soap sucks. I can get a better lather with a bar of Ivory. I quit using the shave soap with this thing, threw it away, &amp; starter using a can of Gillette shaving cream instead with the brush &amp; bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is good.. How can you mess up on that though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very impressed. If you want to spend the same amount of money &amp; get better results, you&#x27;re better off buying an ashtray for a shave bowl &amp; a brush w/ some shave soap.</li>
    <li> I got this first and don&#x27;t use any of it. I use proraso shaving cream, tweezerman badger brush, and a large mug I already had at home.  The brush is stiff and has a hard time retaining water and getting a good lather.  It&#x27;s serviceable, but a $9 something tweezerman badger brush makes a lot more sense and a big difference.  The mug is too small and spills lather over the edge.  A mug or bowl you have at home works a lot better.  The soap is decent, I might try it again, the fact that it&#x27;s so cheap turns me off of it.  You can buy the same soap for $1 pluses shipping, or in larger packs here on amazon.  So for the same price get a badger brush and soap and use a mug or bowl you already have. Or spend more and get a nicer soap or brush, but the tweezerman one seems very nice and is the cheapest badger brush I&#x27;ve seen.  I also got a cheap metal stand to preserve my brush. I use a Parker shavette and feather blades so far are my favorite (out of shark, Astra, and feather) I have other kinds of blades but the feathers are amazingly good. They go against the grain without pulling and are far and away the easiest on my skin. Contrary to some people saying they&#x27;re harsh on the skin.  There are so many shaving options, and there are many people on forums who spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on equipment. There are better products than the van der Hagen set for the same price. (minus the useless bowl)</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my son, who was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Good product first time ever used</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just doing something wrong but I can&#x27;t get the foam to be thick enough and it dries out if I take too long to reach that part of my face.</li>
    <li> Overall, not a bad product for straight shaving beginners. The best part of this package is the bowl, which I like very much. The brush is so-so. The biggest problem with this set is that I found it at Wal-Mart for $9.</li>
    <li> This was my intro to SE shaving starter set, so some of my initial issues were more learning curve related than product quality related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOAP: Initially I had some lather generation issues, but after breaking in the brush and working my technique, the soap worked great. I&#x27;ve also been using Proraso (green) soap. Proraso lathers up easier and stays longer, plus has that cooling menthol effect. The VDH soap is a little bit more liquidy, will dry a bit faster, and has a lighter scent. There&#x27;s plenty of glycerin and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my face at all. Upon recommendation I melted the bar in the bowl (50 seconds in the microwave) and it has worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH: My first and only brush so far. After initially having a difficult time, I have broken it in and now have no difficulty generating a good lather. I have had maybe 20 hairs fall out over time, but again, for the price it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOWL: I think the bowl is a little too deep for the width. I had to keep my circles tight and constantly gather the suds creeping up to the lip. As stated above I melted the soap into the bowl and enjoyed that. For other soaps I&#x27;ve come to use a small ceramic cereal bowl instead of the VDH green bowl.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Quite a nice start for newbies.  Looks good on the shelf.  Would recommend for people starting out.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed as the set came with the bowl/cup broken into several pieces.  Kept the brush to clean my rifle and my husband will use the soap.</li>
    <li> Great product, works very good with no issue</li>
    <li> Got this for my elderly uncle and he loved it!!!</li>
    <li> The shaving soap is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush loses a couple of hair every time. The bowl is bit too deep. You are better off just ordering the soap separately.</li>
    <li> was a gift for my son, he loved it.</li>
    <li> the brush not is good</li>
    <li> This shaving kit is great.  The shaving mug holds the heat so the shaving cream is warm when shaving. The plastic handle on the shaving brush is plastic.  No varnish to wear off.  The brush is made of boar bristles.  To me, this is soft enough to shave with. It does loose a few bristles, but after a few weeks, no more bristles fall out.  This is expected and should not alarm. The shaving soap is of high quality. The price is right too.  Don&#x27;t be too critical of this shave set.  For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Perfect starter set.  Soap lathers fast and has a great smell.  Would recommed for first timers either straight razor or double edge.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this set!  It smells fresh and he loves how the soap lathers up.  He also likes the high quality of the brush and sturdy, well made bowl. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> You may be able to find locally. Several stores around here have this in stock. I STILL buy the soap because I like it so much, even though the brush has fallen apart (it lasted almost a year of DAILY use). Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice enry level set.  I got it to start off, but plan on upgrading in the future.  The bowl is a nice size, and the soap is good.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> Its great. The soap smells very nice, and the brush quickly makes a nice rich lather. The bowl is two toned as indicated on the box.</li>
    <li> I really like the soap in this kit.  It is mild and lathers well.  The boar brush is a decent little brush.</li>
    <li> For the price you pay for this set, it is quite nice. Without breaking the bank I wanted a starter mug/soap and brush set and at around $10 this set fit that bill perfectly. The soap creates a nice lather which allows for a nice smooth shave with a straight razor. If you are migrating from using canned shaving cream you will notice that you don&#x27;t need a thick layer of lather to get a nice smooth shave with soap. You can make the lather as think as you want as you add more water to your brush but as the instructions on the box will tell you you don&#x27;t need to get a thick layer of lather to get a good shave, as a customer who has tried this I can validate this. Don&#x27;t expect the brush to last you a lifetime as the price is low, its lifespan too will be low.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL GIFT TO GIVE TO THE MAN IN YOUR LIFE AND TO OTHERS.  MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS GIFTSO MUCH AND SAYS THAT NOW IS SO MUCH EASIER AND FASTER FOR HIM TO SHAVE.</li>
    <li> I love the soap and it lathers up real good, but the other stuff is just to get you by until you get better stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit to see if you wish to shave with this style of lather.  If you decide to continue, I would recommend getting a better brush. That said, I have had no issues with this one, but I will invest in a better one when this one does become wore out.</li>
    <li> Great value for the beginner safety razor user. I made the change from conventional razors to safety razors and Ive got to tell you its been one of the best decisions OF MY LIFE. The shave is so much more smooth and the equipment is a lot cheaper in the long run. The quality of the kit is good, definitely worth the price and I think the brush is nice. If you need a wood or fancy handle, look elsewhere but this perfectly suits my needs.</li>
    <li> shaving brush is a little tight</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shave set a little longer than a Month.  The set includes 1 boar hair Brush, a puck of premium shave soap, and a ceramic bowl.  It is a great value. At the time it was sold as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item.  I got it pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap:&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up very nice. You can use the soap in it&#x27;s original plastic package and close it up again when finished. or you can take it completely out of the original packaging and microwave the soap in the bowl melting it for about 20 - 25 sec.  When it cools the soap forms to the bowl.  I like to use the microwave method because it is easy to use and it is easier to clean up unused lather by rinsing it out when I&#x27;m done.  For me I simply lather up a brush full about 20 sec.  Then I use the loaded brush to produce a richer lather as I apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowl:&lt;br /&gt;The two tone green ceramic bowl is small, but adequate.  It fits nicely inside my medicine cabinet, on the shelf.  I like things to be neat and tidy, so I prefer to stow my shave supplies on a shelf in the medicine cabinet; but, it is also nice enough to leave out next to a brush stand if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush:&lt;br /&gt;It is boars hair.  My brush was loosing it&#x27;s hair initially; but I think there is a &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34; period.  Some hairs still fall out occasionally even after 1 month; but it isn&#x27;t horrible.  I did email Van Der Hagen about the problem a week ago and I got no response from them whatsoever.  Maybe customer service was having high volume levels and my message got ignored by mistake.  The issue with the brush is not a horrible problem.  I didn&#x27;t expect a high quality brush anyway.  It does the job and I do like using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> good starter set decent brush I am currently new to wet shaving but this set got me going right away.</li>
    <li> The soap is soap. I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is, while not extremely aesthetically pleasing, a bowl. That holds soap. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;The brush sheds like a dog in heat in the summer sun. Worth the money to simply buy a badger brush for more cost and then get some soap at a drug store, and hey, hit a thrift shop ceramic section for a cool bowl/mug. You&#x27;d be surprised what cool things you&#x27;ll find. If you spend money on the set, you&#x27;ll still need to buy a brush in the near future. Just buy a decent brush now. The soap has a pleasant smell, and suds well, the bowl holds the soap.</li>
    <li> Not as nice of a brush as i expected. Everytime i use it, bristles fall out. The cup is basically useless as u can just use the soap container to make the lather.</li>
    <li> I love it this is my secend and I use it with my wet rechargable shaver</li>
    <li> For one low price, this came with everything I needed, to lather up for a shave.</li>
    <li> Just the ticket for someone starting out on the wet shaving experience.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband, he shaves his head and beard and it&#x27;s perfect. the soap last a really long time.</li>
    <li> Works great. Razor blades are much cheaper for this</li>
    <li> this is a nice set especially the bowl for the soap the brush is also well made and the size is just right for a medium to large hand this was worth the low cost through amazon</li>
    <li> Looks like the stuff my dad had, soap lathers up nice, seems to be lasting a really long time.  saving a ton of money on blades but also some lesser bucks on shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Good overall but the brush loses a lot of bristles.</li>
    <li> This is really great. The soap has a nice smell and melts nicely in the cup after microwave for about 15 to 20 seconds. Will strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> The cup thast the soap goes in has no lid,the soap dries fast if you leave it uncovered,and the brush looses bristles a lot,they must not be in the handle very good</li>
    <li> First kit for my 23 year old grandson who wanted to look like grandpa when shaving. He loves it. thanks</li>
    <li> My husband real likes this product. He has sensitive skin and he loves the way it feels after he shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at the local H-E-B grocery store, and found the brush far too stiff and not so great at whipping up a good lather.  One of the inexpensive Omega boar bristle brushes available here on Amazon is much better.  The soap is one of the best I&#x27;ve found - it lathers well, provides good lubrication, and stays moist longer than some others.  Great product.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the brush were better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband but he never ended up using it so I did. I thought it was okay. I had a hard time getting a really good lather going but I used it on my legs which is a much larger surface than a man shaving his beard. I read reviews about the bristles in the brush falling out but I didn&#x27;t see even one come out of mine. The soap smelled nice and I think it&#x27;s a cute little set.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband, he has always had shaving irritation but with this it was a smooth shave and he loved it!</li>
    <li> This is a good deal for those getting into straight razor shaving, or anyone who wants to start using a brush and shaving soap in their shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a nice and made of ceramic, not much else needed to be said about that. The soap is nice and only costs about $3 at Walgreen. It does dry out my skin a little bit during the shave which fix by re-wetting my face and lathering it up again. I can&#x27;t comment to much on the soap as it is the only soap that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product since November 2012 and the bristles stay in the brush without any issues. Occasionally I will have 1 or 2 bristles stuck on my face after lathering however this is to be expected with any brush. I grasp the bristles at the base of the handle when lathing, rinse my brush after every use, and hang it up to dry with the bristles facing down when I&#x27;m done shaving and after 2 months its in very good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lathering process is enjoyable and the bristles aren&#x27;t very hard and prickly however you can feel the tips of the bristles on your face as you lather up, but it is a $12 shaving set and you can&#x27;t expect it to be the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a very nice shaving set at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> The brush is good but the hair is falling out. the soap lathers well but you don&#x27;t need to lather further with the bowl, just load the brush and lather the face.</li>
    <li> My boyfriends&#x27; thoughts on this product:&lt;br /&gt;I am very new to brush shaving.  I started shaving my head years ago since it helped a skin condition on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve always been looking for the smoothest shave with the least amount of irritation.  I&#x27;ve tried various shaving creams in a can as well as olive oil and natural soaps.  I thought they mostly worked well but that since I was shaving my scalp, it was only normal that it would be more irritating.  It would sometimes sting pretty good when rinsing due to nicks and/or cuts.  I did not look forward to shaving at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I decided to research on some of the forums and one topic that kept coming up for a better shave is the use of a shaving brush.  I always thought brushes were more of a gimmick from a bygone era and that the creams in a can were, well, more advanced given their popularity.  Based on what I read, I decided that the VDH set was worth trying out.  I could not be happier with the results.  It took only a couple of tries to learn how to whip up a good lather.  I tried it in the shower, and I have never had a smoother, easier shave.  I actually look forward to shaving!  The brush lathers up well and massages it nicely over the whiskers.  The bowl is a perfect size and has good weight to it.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the shave soap, so much so that I went to the VDH website to see what other types they carry.  I plan to try their unscented luxury and glycerin shave soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this set is considered entry level set but I am extremely happy with it.  It amazes me that most shave creams found in stores are of the canned variety when something so much better exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am slightly concerned about is that the brush is losing a few hairs here and there even though I am very gentle with it.  Apparently some loss is normal as part of the break in process.  I am very glad to be introduced to this more traditional road to a much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks VDH!</li>
    <li> Have used this product many times and have found that anything having the Van Der Hagen name is going to be a good product. Love It.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. If you are just getting into the old school shaving field, it is a good start. But you WILL end up upgrading to a different brush and soap anyways. This soap is a little hard to get whipped up as a beginner. I think it is easier to use a cream. Personally, I bought this and then immediately bought some Old Spice cream from eBay and the Tweezerman&#x27;s brush here on Amazon for a few bucks more. Save your money and buy more quality items first. This brush is a little rough and could be much softer and the cream is much easier to get whipped up, especially as a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]</li>
    <li> The brush is pretty sub par, the soap is pretty hard to get a good lather off of, and the bowl is too small. But for the price? Of course I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> You may not have the memories of your dad or uncles using a shaving soap set and watching them skill-fully shave with a straight blade or DE Razor like I did, but it&#x27;s no reason why you can&#x27;t do it for your own children....... it will be a comforting and everlasting image you give your family.  Not only will you enjoy this action, but it is an art to shave this way......a time of bonding not only with your face but also with your family regardless of age, gender and planet of origin.  By the way this product is great and price wise a great value.</li>
    <li> My husband says the bristles are great for getting a great lather</li>
    <li> I believe I received my monies worth,  I have a handicapped son and wanted a better method for when I shave Him.  It fulfilled our needs.</li>
    <li> Bought this as part of a complete package to start my new journey of using a straight razor moving forward. For the price who is going to complain? It worked great with the Kreigar blade. Will probably order again.</li>
    <li> I got the set because it seemed like a bargain. However, there are some issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is kinda small and very slippery when wet and soapy. I stopped using it almost immediately and got a large, round coffe mug from the goodwill for 25 cents. It&#x27;s easier to hold and is better for lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works fine! But the plastic handle is not nearly as nice as a wooden one. I like boar brushes but you can start seeing badger brushes for only a few dollars more. It&#x27;s is usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells nice, it&#x27;s a bit mild. Nothing too special, but it&#x27;s in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So this is a cheap way to get into wet shaving, but I could recommend getting a brush and soap separately and finding a suitable mug locally. You might spend a little more (but not much) and get bett items.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves a good barber shop shave so I thought he&#x27;d enjoy using this. But he hasn&#x27;t tried it yet which makes me think I should have gone with a shaving cream heater. He was surprised though and that&#x27;s the motivation for the gift.</li>
    <li> It does its job.  The brush, alone, is far more expensive than this set at our local supermarket.</li>
    <li> i would guess in 1850 this was probably a nice product. i think its the same product they used in lonsome dove</li>
    <li> Nice little kit for the money</li>
    <li> This is a good value set. The brush isnt the best but it gets the job done. The soap smells good and the bowl is a bowl.</li>
    <li> this has been working fine for me but the brush seems to shed a few &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;; perhaps that happens with most but i was surprised to see it start from the begning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i shave every day and don&#x27;t have relatively facial hair so i don&#x27;t tend to need it as much</li>
    <li> This shave set I gave 3 stars, mainly because of the lack of lather from the soap.  The Bowl and brush are good quality and looks good in the bathroom.  The soap lacks that lather up feel and look, will try some other soap and see what it does.</li>
    <li> the Brush and the cup are excellent.The shaving cream does not seem to make alot of lather.I think its me because i&#x27;m very new to this type of shaving.The directions are very hard to read because of the supper small print.If any body has any section on making my experience better with this product please chime me</li>
    <li> I bought it because im new to the safety razor world of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers up fast enough for me to be happy,The soap&lt;br /&gt;smells nice.The brush works,Beside a few hairs pulling out of it already&lt;br /&gt;im happy with how it works and feels.The bowl is ceramic and looks&lt;br /&gt;fantastic. Id give it a 4 star because of the brush,But for the price its&lt;br /&gt;hard to beat. Price for performance this kit is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Id buy it again in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and two grandsons. Reminds me of my granddads.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, works great.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering 3 more for my son and son in laws.&lt;br /&gt;Have to be careful not to drop it, it will break.</li>
    <li> Some soaps seem not to later up very well, but this soap is great. Goes on the skin very well and does a good job. Why pay more?</li>
    <li> Great for the beginner shaver, The price was &amp;#34;ADD ON&amp;#34; which makes it even better I bought two for friends who just went back to wet shaving. Try it you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I am sticking with my can of barbasol and disposable razor but don&#x27;t feel like I wasted any money trying this out as it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> simply the best bang for your buck, i dont need anything extra ordinary it does what it needs to for 8$ cant find ay problem with that. pleased to make this purchase again</li>
    <li> For $10 you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;ve been using this set for about six months now. The brush is still holding steady, and the soap lasted me at least three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best value by far.</li>
    <li> OK so this was my first shaving brush, soap and bowl ever.  I enjoyed shaving my face much more with this rather than shaving cream and disposable razors (I bought the [[ASIN:B0017QSZY4 Parker 22R - Long Handle Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor &amp; 10 Shark Super Chrome Blades]]).  I can definitely feel the difference.  My skin was much more smoother and much less irritated after shaving my face with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap doesn&#x27;t smell like an expensive fancy cologne but it does have a manly scent to it.  However, my soap developed this thick substance at the bottom (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the fat), lost some of it&#x27;s color and nearly all of its scent so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl can be somewhat difficult to hold when your hands are wet since it has no handle and is very slippery when your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great and while it may not be as comfortable as a badger brush it gets the job more than fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem was that the brush started losing its hairs, I don&#x27;t mean just one or two, I&#x27;m talking chunks of hair started falling off to the point where only the edge of the rim has brush hairs and now it&#x27;s pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because although it&#x27;s now useless it&#x27;s still much, much more inexpensive than other kits and if it wasn&#x27;t for this I probably would&#x27;ve never known how much better it is to shave with a shaving kit rather than cheap plastic disposable razors and cheap shaving foam.  Definitely worth it specially if you&#x27;re unsure about shaving kits and wish to try one out.</li>
    <li> The soap:  Pretty good at doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do- protect the face while shaving. In that respect it works very well.  It smells ok.  Not great but ok.  Most shaving soap scents fade quick anyways or are covered up by aftershave or cologne so who cares?  There are other soaps in the $5 to $10 dollar range that are a little easier to lather but not so as to make a huge difference.  The other fancy name brand soaps might smell better or lather a little easier but this is just the quintessential, bottom line, does-what-its-supposed-to-do soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush:  Don&#x27;t let the fact that it&#x27;s made of boar bristle fool you.  Badger costs more but most experienced wet shavers agree that boar bristle is the preferred brush for shaving soaps.  If you use shaving cream, well, that&#x27;s another story I&#x27;d guess but boar and hard milled soaps go hand in hand.  However, this particular brush isn&#x27;t the best boar brush there is.  The major set back for this brush is that it sheds.  I know that most boar brushes do, even the high quality ones will shed a little the first few shaves  but this one sheds four or five hairs each shave (yes, I dry it upside down when I&#x27;m done).  It doesn&#x27;t affect my shave but it&#x27;s just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Not a bad kit at all don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I can recommend it with a clean conscience.  Shaving snobs will scoff but this kit does the job, no more no less.  If you wanna indulge and submerse yourself in a daily chore like shaving then I guess the sky&#x27;s the limit.  Shaver&#x27;s Den ( I know there&#x27;s controversy surrounding them) or Mama Bear will sell a great soap for $5 to $10 bucks and an Omega brush can cost as little as $9 bucks.  Will your shave be THAT much better?  Naw.  Will the EXPERIENCE of shaving be better?  Sure, I guess.  You decide what&#x27;s most important.  Ultimately it&#x27;s just shaving, right?</li>
    <li> this is a nice starter set. the bowl fits the hand nicely. soaps ok not great. and brush will do the job. but its on the low end. boar brush is a stiff brush. i bought better. but use this as a talc brush. like I said its a nice starter set.</li>
    <li> First of all, I bought this item at local ...mart store for $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, and I mean no disrespect to those who left favorable reviews, I strongly believe that if one is looking to start a new fancy, one wishes this fancy to be at a higher level.  Simply put, THERE&#x27;S NO \\&quot;BEGINNERS&#x27; SET/KIT\\&quot; WHEN IT COMES TO SHAVING.  I am a MAN and I NEED a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRUSH:&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that the bristles come off the brush.  I first thought it was supposed to happen on first wash of brush (prior to usage), but after a few shavings the bristles continue to come off.  It is quite disgusting having the feel that I have pig&#x27;s hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOWL:&lt;br /&gt;This one is rather nice.  Ceramic and of decent size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SOAP:&lt;br /&gt;Does foam up to a good lather.  Has a nice scent and lasts quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVEROLL:&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to any one.  If you are, perhaps, looking to &#x27;assemble&#x27; your own kit (buy all pieces separately) to save money, then do so.  I have seen the brush, here on Amazon, sell anywhere from $20-$50.  I am considering one in the $20&#x27;s ratio.  The soaps seem to be cheaper, but I will do my research prior to adventure into this new lifestyle.</li>
    <li> When you get tired out multiple blade razors try a safety razor. This premium shave set is a brush,a bowl, and a shave soap cake it compliments the shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Nice set and for only $8.99 it&#x27;s a no brainer.  I used it to bump up another order and get free shipping, so very cost effective.  I have a can of gel which I find awkward to use.  Now I just keep this shave set handy and it gets the job done.  It&#x27;s not recommended to leave it in the upright position to dry after use (not good for life of brush).  Since it does not come with a stand, I simply stuck a velcro square on the top of the handle and attach it under a shelf in my medicine cabinet so it drys brush down, very handy.</li>
    <li> Bush  falls apart and you can buy the set in a basic grocery store for cheaper</li>
    <li> For $8 this is either really good for a travel kit, or a nice starter for a teen.  Well, I am going to do the later and give it to my daughters BF.  Going to get him into the art of wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  The brush decent, albeit a bit stiff.  But for a beginner it will do the trick.  Soap smelled okay, nothing fancy, but again why break the bank when learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cup, it was worth the price of admission.  Good size, nice look and a really nice weight and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t score this a 5 star, just because it is not premium quality, but really I will give it a 4.5.</li>
    <li> good quility and value</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not worth it. Not even at $8.99. Not even for a first time &amp;#34;I&#x27;m just going to try this whole wet shave thing&amp;#34;. Buy yourself a cheap soup mug, any other brush, and a decent soap/cream.&lt;br /&gt;I hate the smell of the soap. The lather barely thickens.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is stiff, smells bad, and has an incredibly cheap plastic handle. The knot separated from the handle in almost no time.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is nice, but there is nothing special about it. You&#x27;d be happier saving the money and buying a cheap soup mug from wally world or goodwill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price point, this is an okay product, but I feel you&#x27;d be happier spending the money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> this surprise me it&#x27;s well made happy as can be with this set.</li>
    <li> 👍I love it! Great for sensitive skin and for women!</li>
    <li> The soap smells great, the brush it&#x27;s just ok,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the cream, but the rest of it is really nice.</li>
    <li> This is a good starter set for people new to shaving with a safety razor. Great price for a mug and soap and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is OK quality, and sometimes sheds more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> The bowl was broken (okay it probably would have been fine had it not shattered in transit), the soap smelled terrible, and the brush shedded all over.  Not worth even the low price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set for the price. And the soap is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Recently I made the decision to try double edge shaving because the cost of the Gillette Fusion blades I have been using is outrageous. Not knowing if I would like using a double edge razor I did not want to spend a lot of money initially to get into it. After looking at many of the items related to double edge shaving offered on Amazon I decided on this set for several reasons. First, price...for less than $10 I got three of the five items needed to get started. Second, the reviews. Most of them were 4-5 star which is usually a good sign. Third, I did some research on Van Der Hagan and again for the most part read positive reviews of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this set along with a Lord L6 razor and several different brands of razor blades for over a month and am extremely happy with my purchase. The brush is boars hair and does a good job of creating lather from the shaving soap. The shaving soap bowl has a good finish on it and cleans up very easily. I have sensitive skin and the shaving soap that came with this is their deluxe hypo allergenic soap which is nice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have anything to compare against as this is my first foray into using a brush, bowl and soap but based on actual results I am happy. At some point I may buy a badger hair brush and different soap but for now this suits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this set to anyone just getting into double edge shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Suggestions: I purchased an 8 ounce bottle of Glycerin from Wal Mart for around $4 and a can of Barbasol Arctic Chill with Menthol. I let water sit on top of the soap to soften it up a little while I am soaking the boars brush in hot water. I then dump the excess water off the top of the soap and add 5-6 drops of glycerin (which helps in moisturizing my face) and then whip up the lather with the boars brush after shaking out excess water. I do this every day. Just to change things up so they do not get boring, once a week I add a squirt of the Barbasol arctic chill after I have worked up the lather with the shaving soap so I get the cooling feeling and smell of the menthol.rt of the Barbasol arctic chill after I have worked up the lather with the shaving soap so I get the cooling feeling and smell of the menthol.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave set for the money.  Where else are you going to get a brush, soap and bowl for $10?  I love the smell of this soap, although it could lather up a little more, it does the job.  The brush has worked well for me, I treat it gently and it treats me right; it hasn&#x27;t broke and it doesn&#x27;t lose too many bristles.  The mug isn&#x27;t my favorite color, but it&#x27;s just the right size to fit in the palm of my hand, just high enough to not let foam spill out and at the same time not too deep that it&#x27;s a hassle.</li>
    <li> The brush sheds bristles non-stop. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the best brush, considering the price, but it is really not usable. You can get a much better brush for just a few dollars more.</li>
    <li> I like the soap and bowl.  It&#x27;s very nice the way it lathers and smells great.  The bowl is just the right size to hold the hockey puck style soap in place.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the brush started losing bristles after the third use (even after swiping it a few times to knock them lose before using it).  It&#x27;s a great set, especially as a graduation or groomsman&#x27;s gift.</li>
    <li> It is what it is. For the money, it&#x27;s a great deal. You get a nice bowl, a decent soap and a brush that will do the job for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush for about a week and decided it needed an upgrade and I&#x27;m glad I bought it, but that in no way makes me feel bad about buying this set with the included brush. It was a great way to find out if this type of shaving appealed to me without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> You pay for what you get! If your trying this out for your first time and you dont want to invest. Dont get this! the Soap sucks and the brush is even worse. Go get your fishing pole and cut the strings into a hundred pieces and shave with it!</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit for someone getting into old-school shaving.  The included brush and bowl are a much higher quality that you might expect, and the scent of the included soap is also very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Soap works great and smells great, brush is very good and bowl looks really nice</li>
    <li> well im a barber and was looking for a shaving bursh set so was looking around for a good price found this one, must say its great nd even better for the price</li>
    <li> Nice set.  The bowl and soap is good.  The brush works for a while, but not built well.  Will need a new brush within a year, falls apart a little at a time.</li>
    <li> If you are just starting out shaving with a safety razor, I would recommend this. It is cheap and gets the job done. The more expensive ones are probably better, but this is a good starting point to see if you like it. Great product.</li>
    <li> honestly its soap in a bowl. I would have left it at that but Amazon insists that I use 25 words in my review. I use it every day and enjoy my shave. Makes me feel like im a gangster!</li>
    <li> I still use the brush and it has lost very little hair and is a pleasure to use. It softened up after about five uses and is nice and holds the soap well.  I use it nearly every day.  My skin is not nearly as dry as the when I use the can foam and the soap rinses clean and leaves the skin soft. Cup is easy to hold and feels great.</li>
    <li> This is a great shave kit. Its currently my favorite. The small bowl holds heat well so the lather doesnt get cold quickly, and the brush has firm bristles that lather soap VERY well.</li>
    <li> The soap works well in the bowl . However the shaving brush is far too stiff for my use. I prefer a brush that has a finer feel . Nevertheless you get what you pay for and I suppose I should have expected a brush that lacked the quality of my Abercrombie and Fitch of many years.</li>
    <li> pretty crap but functional bowl, brush for the money. the soap is pretty useless. a good way to try out wet shaving but unless you switch back to can shaving you will be upgrading much sooner than you think so in a way its a total waste of money. tho i could see purchasing as a starter kit i did, i just wish i had bought a better brush and a nonbreakable bowl instead. i used the soap twice then bought williams soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and cheap but the brush losing bristles since the first day.</li>
    <li> Great introduction to DE shaving, while not the best of any piece I often will suggest this set to someone curious in wet shaving. As a huge DE advocate I highly suggest to drop the cartridge and try a DE with a set like this.</li>
    <li> At least 4-5 hairs come out of the brush on each use.  Many more on the first several uses.  It does not have anough lathering action to do anything with the supplied soap.&lt;br /&gt;AND the bristles are actually painted to look like badger hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> To start, the bowl alone is worth the money.  Second, I am still happy I finally have a safety razor, a Merkur 180.  The soap for this smells really good BUT maybe I&#x27;m just a noobie, I have this soap and RS Shave Cream in a tube, an amazing combination for lather.  The brush, well, not impressed.  The bristels do come out.  Make sure you soak your brush in very warm water before you use the soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap, very decent brush and ok bowl for the price.&lt;br /&gt;This compare vary favorably again much more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is the first one I used in a very very long time and I am sure&lt;br /&gt;a much more expensive one would hold better its shape. But it does the work.</li>
    <li> like the soap and the bowl, but the brush....not so much.  Falls apart too easy.  I just use it for decoration.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush fall out, and kind of smell like wet wool, leaving your face smell like wet wool when done.  The bowl works great.  Overall, the product does the job, and is cheap, which is why I bought it, but might do a little more research on a nice brush next time around.</li>
    <li> All was fine until the brush fell out of the handle after about 50 uses. It was easy to see why. The adhesive holding the brush into the handle had a huge void in it. Not exactly &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not really upset about it or anything, the set was priced to move and I appreciate that. But I don&#x27;t see that it deserves anymore than two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have certainly saved some money by shaving the old fashioned way. Now to find a quality brush....</li>
    <li> This is my first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shave set with a brush and everything. The brush is nice and soft, but firm enough to lather up the soap. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good, but reasonably priced shave set!</li>
    <li> I shaved with Gillette gel shaving cream for years and it always left my skin very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;If the gel shaving cream irritates your skin, THIS is the solution. Metaphorically, gel shaving cream makes the razor feel like sandpaper (even with a new blade), but the soap in this kit makes the blade feel more like rubbing a worn piece of denim, not dramatically smoother, but notably smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to get this set because it allows you to see if this shaving method is better for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap and bowl (especially the bowl) is of great quality. The brush, however, isn&#x27;t the best quality which is expected because most brushes are at least $30. After well over twenty uses, bristles are still falling out here and there, which can get annoying. Maybe after longer they&#x27;ll stop falling out. Regardless of this minor flaw, for this price, you get a tremendous value.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d strongly recommend this to anyone who is not satisfied with chemical shaving cream that causes irritation.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter set for anyone looking to check out wet shaving. I actually prefer the soap that comes with this set against some other pricier stuff and continue to buy it to this day. The brush and bowl aren&#x27;t anything special, but functional. Perfect set to see why wet shaving is making a come back.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time and it really is a different experience from regular shaving cream. Some of the bristles will fall out on first use but thats understandable. Will update later on if it degrades.</li>
    <li> My husband always wanted to lather up with soap and a brush. He loves this kit! Brush is good quality, the bowl is heavy enough and attractive, and the soap is gentle enough for his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great beginner set. It allowed me to see how all of this works, but without piecing together a semi-expensive gamble on shaving supplies based on Amazon reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to figure out how to get a good lather with the brush because I was scared I would press too hard and ruin the brush. You do have to apply the pressure to get the correct lather with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also recommend buying the clubman after shave lotion with this set. Helps with bumps and smells so nice.</li>
    <li> This set is a very good starter set and for the price, I don&#x27;t think you could do much better.  The brush is adequate for face-shaving, but didn&#x27;t hold up too well when shaving my head. The bowl is nice, but a little small. The shave soap is just as good as many others I have tried. In conclusion, this set introduced me to wet-shaving and was great for figuring out if it was something I wanted to continue doing and invest some money into.</li>
    <li> Soap is ok, basic brush...  good started kit.  over all it&#x27;s not bad to get started with</li>
    <li> Awesome starter shaving set for wet shaving but product arrived not in best conditions. but kit worked very great. Go ahead and buy.</li>
    <li> Cheap brush, watch the bristles to fall out for awhile. Once the shedding of a couple dozen bristles is done it works fine.</li>
    <li> It seems like an adequate shave set. The brush I have is a little bit of a shedder, and I personally don&#x27;t like the smell of the soap although I&#x27;m not knocking the product for that. The lather I was able to produce seemed on the thin side but that could be my fault. All in all a great intro set for the price, but I would probably recommend a beginner to pick out some cheapie shave cream and a low price badger brush and use your own bowl/mug if you&#x27;ve got the time to do a little research.</li>
    <li> Very nice addition to the sink, looks vintage. Soap is good so far, brush is well made, and the dish is a heavy little dish. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this set! The soap makes a very thin lather which is perfect for shaving and never clogs the sink!</li>
    <li> .Was exactly as described  and made my Dad happy on Christmas day he long the nostalgia of it. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I agree with Alex, this set is the best you can get for the buck...also, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Don&#x27;t listen to the snobs.  If you want to pay more to do the same thing, then go ahead because it&#x27;s just a waste of money that could be invested elsewhere. :)</li>
    <li> cheap quality, but a cheap price</li>
    <li> Given as gifts to son, son-in-law when they expressed interest in changing shaving methods. Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints! Have heard requests for more soap, so guess they enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving set at WalMart.  Try as I might I could not get a good lather using the brush.  Also, the hairs were constantly falling out and sticking to my face.  I replaced it with a Tweezerman badger hair brush and the difference is incredible.  The Tweezerman whips up a perfect lather in just a few seconds.  The only reason for two stars instead of one is because I like the bowl.  The soap is OK, but I prefer Col. Conk.</li>
    <li> Nice shave set.  The only thing that i would like better was if there were a lid for the bowl.</li>
    <li> The brush is garbage, kept shedding hairs until I started using a different brush.  The soap is ok, and the bowl is ok.  Great starter kit, I think I just got a bum brush</li>
    <li> So you&#x27;ve decided to try shaving with a safety razor. Don&#x27;t cheap out with this set. I did, and my introduction to \\&quot;real shaving\\&quot; was a false start. You&#x27;ll get off to a much more enjoyable start if you invest in a badger brush. The brush in this set is boar, and I really struggled to work up a good lather with it. Plus, it lost bristles every time I used it. The bowl is too small to get things whipped up. The soap in the kit is OK, not great. I switched to an oversized coffee cup and a badger brush, and I was in business!&lt;br /&gt;I really love my new shaving regimen! But I&#x27;ve learned, like with most things, having the right tools makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out shaving with a brush. I&#x27;d never done it before and wanted to see if I liked the experience or if it was too much trouble. The product isn&#x27;t anything to write home about.. the hair falls out off the brush at a rapid rate and I think if this continues I&#x27;ll have to throw it away in a few months. Which will be just fine because I see myself moving to a better set. So it&#x27;s a great  set to buy if you want to try out brush shaving, before moving to a better set.</li>
    <li> The soap isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff ever, but it lathers well and smells manly, the brush and cup have weight and are of good quality. This is a great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Great Quality....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a plastic handle, but overall, especially given the price, better than what you would expect. I have very coarse facial hair, and I am not very gentle with it, and I can say I maybe at most, have seen 1 hair fall out. Which is probably more normal than bad quality or anything. Feels great to use, and really helps stimulate the beard hair, making it easier to shave off without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is great. Great construction, awesome green and matte black finish. Looks very attractive and masculine, yet attractive enough to leave out for all to see in any sort of bathroom. Soap fits in it perfect, and plenty of room for lather. Bowl is a home run in this kit. You will never need another mug or bowl, even if you upgrade the brush or soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers and shaves well. It is however the only weak link I can even begin to find in this kit. Only because it does not have much of a smell. Which is completely personal preference. I love the old fashion smells, but if you dont, then you will love this soap. I added some bay rum soap I picked up on vacation and the kits perfect now! Once again, soap works perfectly, but does not have a scent.... at least not one I smell enough to determine what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the only people I really see not liking this kit are purists or shaving fanatics that desire some sort of top tier experience or product appearance. However.... if that&#x27;s you then you probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this anyhow. For anyone else, if you are just starting to collect shaving items, you simply want to shave better than modern ways, or whatever it may be...there&#x27;s literally no reason not to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some people say things about quality of the items construction or products used to make them...I just don&#x27;t see that. I like nice things, and this is more than good enough.You can get nicer items, but for who this would appeal to, its amazing.</li>
    <li> Yea, Yea. I read the don&#x27;t be a snob post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, if you are just getting into wet shaving. This product is ok and a good place to start. But if you have been around for a while and have used any other actual quality products you will know that there is a substantial difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.. Once you actually get a good brush, bowl, and soap. you will understand that this product is only worth the price you paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not as soft as many others and sheds, A LOT. You don&#x27;t have to spend 200 bucks on a high end badger brush to get a quality brush. There are good brushes out there for 20 or 30 bucks. I don&#x27;t want to have to purchase a new brush every year or every other year. But I will pay 30 or 40 bucks for a decent brush that I can pass down to my son when he is ready to start shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is small, plastic, and the finish will wear off quickly. Depending on the quality and amount of lather you desire to make it may or may not work for you. It&#x27;s small, plastic, and exactly what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I just picked up a black ceramic bowl from Wal-Mart for 2 bucks that works much better and will actually last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is ok but not great. I have tried many soaps and creams. This soap works if you just need to slap on something to shave with. But if you want a soap with a good lather then you need to find a different soap.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a cheap soap to just get this job done then you have found your soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all products, just because you are willing to use a cheap product to get the job done does not mean its a great product. it just means it works.&lt;br /&gt;So does that mean because it works it should deserve a great review. Hell no! It means that there are other products out there that work better. Yes that means you actually have to pay more for them. Ooo, did I say that? Yes, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an entry level kit, A CHEAP entry level kit. Onethat wont leave your pockets empty should you decide you don&#x27;t like wet shaving. But..&lt;br /&gt;If you stick with wet shaving you should at least take the time to try other products out there. There are great products out there that don&#x27;t cost hundreds of dollars. I picked up my first double edge razor on eBay for 20 bucks. A 1972 Gillette Supper speed. It still works great and it&#x27;s a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally this complany sells a Luxury shave set listed at 40 bucks. It is a much better quality than the 8 dollar version.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re getting pretty much exactly what is described, nothing more, nothing less. That said, this isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means. The price is pretty representative of the quality. The soap itself is great. The bowl is a little larger than I expected, which I guess isn&#x27;t a bad thing. My main complaint is the brush. It&#x27;s more like a cheap paint brush than a &amp;#34;Premium Brush&amp;#34;. Overall, not too bad. It&#x27;s a great starter set, but I&#x27;ll be upgrading when the rest of the bristles work their way out of the brush.</li>
    <li> This was something that I have needed for a long&lt;br /&gt;while, because I could not use regular shaving materials because&lt;br /&gt;of the many allergens that caused problems when I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B</li>
    <li> it seemed like a good deal for the price, but the brush bristles fell out during each shave.  I tossed it after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the soap yet, but the bowl is excellent. The brush loses a bristle or two per shave, but that&#x27;s to be expected for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> One soap will last too long to realize, it feels like forever.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl will last the rest of your life, obviously, and the brush will last years and years. This is the second set I&#x27;ve ever bought, because I accidentally dropped the bowl and broke it.</li>
    <li> I have seen Shave Sets all the way up to $200!  This set has the same things; Ceramic Bowl, Boars Hair Brush and Lather Soap and it only cost $8.99!!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not sure if I like the soap yet.  It is not lathering like I thought it should.  This could be because I may be doing it wrong?  Anyway it is a great product!</li>
    <li> Its a beginers set. Not too bad.</li>
    <li> good value, good brush</li>
    <li> Nice set. Bristles on brush are not real soft just OK - soap is not real foamy. Overall for price not bad.</li>
    <li> been using the soap,brush, and bowl for almost a year now, still in excellent condition, this is a helluva deal.</li>
    <li> Good set to buy for beginners. If you&#x27;re on a budget, then the price is obviously going to lure you in, but it&#x27;s also suitable for those who&#x27;ve been geeking up on shaving and want to know how \\&quot;lower end\\&quot; products perform. Most of the previous reviews (both positive and negative) are quite accurate.    The brush works fine, but it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing in the world and it&#x27;s going to gradually shed -- not the kind of thing I planned on using forever. The soap is decent. I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but it certainly made me feel protected and slick. Only complaint is that it does leave you feeling a bit dry and in need of some lotion.    I&#x27;m happy I bought it, and now I know what a boar brush and a cheap puck feels like. They&#x27;re not shaving Mecca, but they&#x27;re good enough products to live in a travel kit or amongst backup supplies once I have the budget for a badger brush and some higher quality soap/cream.    UPDATE:    The brush still occasionally sheds, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it has softened up a good bit after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Strictly speaking, I didn&#x27;t buy this set. I bought the brush as a replacement for one I&#x27;d had for twenty years. I&#x27;ve had it about three years, and it is doing fine. It makes great lather, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart, and ... what else do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap I picked up later after Wal-Mart started carrying it. I had been using various high-quality hotel soaps that I picked up on business trips. They work fairly well, far better than the Williams soap I had tried before. The VdH proved to be great soap. Rick lather, excellent lubrication, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, a big problem here in the high desert areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I picked the brush and soap up separately, I can&#x27;t say anything about the bowl. It&#x27;s a bowl. I use an old plastic coffee mug. Plastic so it won&#x27;t shatter if I drop it in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: 5 stars for value-for-price, and 5 stars because it works as well as anything else you can get.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars, because to a normal consumer this set fits my needs well. Compared to other, &amp;#34;top-of-the-line,&amp;#34; brushes and deluxe shave-sets, it might not be comparable, but I don&#x27;t know. All I do know is, as a plain consumer, this product fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I wrote this expecting snobbery from safety-shaving aficionados, but I digress.</li>
    <li> I just started safety razor shaving a month ago and got this item because it was recommended on several DE shaving lists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works ok.  The brush is fine and the soap works.  But there are so many other soaps out there (as others have invariably mentioned; Omega, Prosaro come to mind), near this price point, I suggest people spend a little more.  Since getting a bowl of Omega, I haven&#x27;t touched the Van Der Hagen soap (I still use the brush).</li>
    <li> I bought this set to compliment the Diamond Edge Classic Safety Razor that I purchased for my husband last year.  He is very happy with it and will reorder the soap when he needs it.</li>
    <li> Just buy the soap here and get the set elsewhere. The soap is a good buy. But the add-on garbage makes you have to spend $25 over and above the add-on price to get the shave set. They are forcing bloat buying. The add-on price doesn&#x27;t count toward the $25 purchase. If it did it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad deal. You could buy the soap for $21 add the set for $10 and there you have it. But no it requires a purchase over and above..Go to Walmart or Walgreens and get it for 8.99- 10.99 or less instead of $15 here, that&#x27;s if you can find something you need that&#x27;s only the difference in what you are being restricted too.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but good quality, I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and so far I love it! It&#x27;s great not having to use the aerosol shave gel/cream, the soap works so much better. It&#x27;s a better lubricant than the aerosol and goes on much thinner, so if you&#x27;re trying to shave around a beard or goatee, it allows you to see much better what you&#x27;re doing! I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to save some money, save the environmental waste and save your face!</li>
    <li> As Described will buy from again A+</li>
    <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t enjoy about this product is the fact, that hair will come off the brush, even if your gentle in the manner that you use it, but it does work quite well. I&#x27;m just afraid I&#x27;ll have to buy another one in a few months.</li>
    <li> Not great, brush leaves a little to be desired, but for the price the soap and bowl are worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I got my Husband the razor from the past. He loves this. It is soap, and not the stuff in the can. It last longer, and cost much less</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant because of the price and a few bad reviews. I start with 4 stars because the first time I recieved the products the bowl was smashed. Called amazon and got full refund very quickly and ordered another. Customer service was GREAT AND ALWAYS IS!!  Back to the product this is a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> This product has a great shave bowl and soap, but the brush is not that great. If your looking for a great shave brush at a good price check out whippeddog.com. They have a silvertip badger that is great. The Boar brush in this set is very stiff</li>
    <li> The bowl and the brush are good. The soap feels abit dry though specially when you are applying it and it starts to dry up. Then when to slide the razor across it it gets stuck because of the soap, it feels like you&#x27;re going to cut yourself</li>
    <li> For $10, you can really ask for a better bowl, soap, and brush kit. The price is just not comparable to anything else you can get- most brushes cost upwards of two times the price of this entire kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the soap is the standard shaving soap found at most grocery stores- it works well, and you can get a pretty good cream with a little work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is the reason the kit gets 4 stars and not 5. It leaves little hairs all over your face and in the sink when you rinse it. Not the highest quality. But decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is... a bowl. 5 Stars on being a bowl.</li>
    <li> The brush is a bit course and loses some of its fibers regularly.  It is not bad to start out with if you are want to try the mug and brush but I will very likely be upgrading to something a bit higher quality.  All in all, it does its job and the soap works just fine.</li>
    <li> Nothing inherently wrong with this set, but after a few months the only thing I&#x27;m still using is the bowl. The soap is passable, but the brush didn&#x27;t hold up very well. Not a huge issue, just keep in mind you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> so authentic looking very nice</li>
    <li> Although I have not used the soap as of yet, the bowl and brush are durable and nice complement to my bathroom accessories</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shave set.  Didn&#x27;t like the razor I got, but loves this.</li>
    <li> Its a nice starter set. 5 stars for what it is. Its nothing magical though, but at the price its decent. I would really recommend something better though starting out.</li>
    <li> nice little shave set. I bought this for my first attempt at using a brush and soap and it was an excellent introduction kit, I have since replaced the brush and the soap but still use the bowl to this day.</li>
    <li> Everything as described.</li>
    <li> Contents looked dirty, like they were smeared with something.  Brush handle looks very cheap.  Otherwise, met expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these for gifts. Disappointed many bristles fall out with each shave.</li>
    <li> Fills the bill perfectly, the soap is excellent and the brush seems to be holding up.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit to start with if you are thinking about giving wet shaving a shot. It is pretty inexpensive and it does what it&#x27;s made to do pretty well for the cost. Of course you aren&#x27;t going to get a Lamborghini on a minivan budget, so let&#x27;s not get dramatic about how poor this product is compared to the top-of-the-line pieces. No, this product isn&#x27;t THE BEST. It is, however, a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap - its not a bad soap. It lathers up fine and smells nice. It also fits in the soap dish well and doesn&#x27;t wiggle around while making a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap dish - not a bad spot to put your soap. There really isn&#x27;t much more to say since that&#x27;s all it does. Its a ceramic bowl that holds the soap, and it does a pretty good job at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave brush - this is the only reason I gave it a 4/5 star review. The shave brush does what it&#x27;s made for and makes a pretty decent lather. The only bad/annoying things are the bristles are a bit stiff and they often come out of the handle. That&#x27;s it. Yes, the handle is plastic but I don&#x27;t care - that&#x27;s a lamborghinis and minivans issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a nice, wood handle, 100% mink brush for four times the cost of this entire kit, or a bowl that has a handle, or soap that makes you look younger - don&#x27;t buy this kit. However, if you want to give wet shaving a shot and you&#x27;ve got $8 to spare - go for it. What will it hurt?</li>
    <li> Nice kit. Simple and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff, and it smells good, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says that it makes things move smoothly and that it helps him get a closer shave than when he doesn&#x27;t use it. He goes and buys the soap when he runs out of it, and he always gets this brand. He says that he highly recommends this shave set, specifically this brand, though!</li>
    <li> Ordered for Father for birthday.  He liked it.</li>
    <li> This is the first shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned so I really have nothing to compare to but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vendor: Arrived on time, undamaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice ceramic bowl, attractive.  I would prefer the type with the little round knob on it (but it doesn&#x27;t come in an inexpensive set like this).  Brush has plastic handle, but doesn&#x27;t look bad.  Loses a hair or two every time I use it (I don&#x27;t know if that is typical for more expensive brushes) but this has not been a nuisance.  Soap is mildly scented and not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as an entry level set.  In time I may buy a more expensive brush but this one is working well for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Cons as long as you keep in mind that this an inexpensive, entry level set.</li>
    <li> This does everything I expected it to and the soap helps me get the closest shave Ive ever had. the brush has a plastic handle and the hairs seem to fall out just a bit but thats what you get for the price (compare to much much more expensive brushes) great product and I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me for my birthday and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it. I was tired of paying $18-20 for a three pack of shaving cartridges but hated using the cheap disposable razors. This set, along with a safety razor and some double edged blades, has totally changed my attitude about shaving. The brush isn&#x27;t rough on my skin and honestly it&#x27;s kind of fun to use it. The soap is great too and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. My wife loves it! I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to a mach 3. The one downside, in my opinion, is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand for the brush so you really have to be careful to dry it off if you want the bristles to last.</li>
    <li> After receiving this product, which was all that I expected, I found it several dollars cheaper at a local pharmacy...</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and although it is the cheaper option he loves it and says the only complaint is that sometimes hair falls out of the brush, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s going to happen with any brush.</li>
    <li> Soap does not have enough moisturizer for the shave.  You get razor burn.</li>
    <li> This is OK, kinda small and the brush is stiff, but it gets the job done. I wish I had bought one with a deeper mug and a softer brush but this is OK for the price.</li>
    <li> Great deal. A few stray hairs fall out of the brush every now and then. The soap smells inoffensive and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is fairly sensitive)</li>
    <li> Good introduction kit, nice gift too. All with an above average quality, nothing like a silvertip brush etc, just begginers kit or for people who dont plan on investing in this as a hobby. It gives you all tools for a good shave (minus razor).</li>
    <li> Great kit, yes it has a plastic handle brush, yes it&#x27;s basic and to learn to wet shave it&#x27;s a great starting place.</li>
    <li> I have given this four stars instead of five, because it doesn&#x27;t win much on style points, but it does get the job done and is great for the beginner such as I.  I can&#x27;t really make comparisons as this is the first brush, bowl and soap experience.  the first shave left a lot of badger hair on my face, but that has settled down some.  I don&#x27;t know if that is expected from a new brush, but it seems like most of those loose hairs have found their way out of the brush.  I good kit to start with for the beginner as it is both functional and cheap.</li>
    <li> The brush and bowl are nice. The soap is not.</li>
    <li> Meh. Decent for startup, but the soap smells crappy and dries out your skin. Buy this kit along with different soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it sat on the shelf at my house for 8-10 months before I ever opened it.  I only opened it after leaving my usual shaving cream in the hotel while out of town, and was left with no other option.  This product contributes to the best shaving experience I have had thus far in my life.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.  Also, I have sensitive skin, and this product has not affected me negatively whatsoever.  The brush is of good quality, and the cup is perfect for making a rich lather prior to application.</li>
    <li> Hey this actually works pretty good for the $8 I paid.  I&#x27;m not into buying all sorts of fancy wet shaving accessories.  This fit my budget of: Cheap.  So I bought it.  The soap actually works well, but it doesn&#x27;t smell that great.  It smells like a bar of hotel soap.  I actually have switched to using Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shave Cream, after using about half of the included soap puck.  The TOBS cream smells better and and seems to make a slicker lather. I am still using the Van Der Hagen boar brush and the bowl, however.  I have not experience the high rate of hair loss in the brush others have described but ever 2 or 3 shaves it loses a hair or two.  The bowl is nothing fancy but it does its job.  I lather my TOBS shave cream in it.</li>
    <li> Great price on this but the quality is oak</li>
    <li> Review by wife: I bought this for my husband as a gift to go along with the new safety razor I bought him. First off let me say, for the price you cannot go wrong. The set is great. The soap that came with it smells really good. I did put the soap into the cup that comes with the set into the microwave for 10 - 15 seconds, so the soap would stop moving around. The brush is not bad at all. After reading so many reviews about how bad  the brush was, it left me a little worried. Goes to show the old saying is right: everyone has an opinion.... Well I am sure you know how the saying ends. Nothing is wrong with the set. I would and will be buying it again. The cup fits really well in my husbands hand. The soap is great. The brush, the bristles DO NOT fall out like crazy. So hopefully this helps. Next time I purchase this shaving set , I will be buying it with confidence knowing that it is a wonderful set and the price is just the icing on the cake of greatness.</li>
    <li> Do not listen to anyone who says this is even descent. This is the worst shaving brush ever, unless you like cheap boar hair on your face. The bowl is ok, and the soap barely run of the mill. This was my 1st wet shaving set and is not a good intro set, if anything, it may turn you off. Just spend a few extra dollars and get something that will not shed on your face and is not made in china.</li>
    <li> This comes with all the implements that you need to shave in the old traditional (wet) shave way.  A shallow bowl can hold the soap, including the cake that is included.  A shaving brush is great for whipping up a lather and then dispensing it on the face.  Combine this with a traditional double edge blade shaver and chrome stand and you have a set-up for life, with just an occasional replacement of the shaving soap and the double edged blades.  This is the best shave you can get outside the barbershop.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out of the brush more than they stay in the brush.</li>
    <li> Great and affordable set.</li>
    <li> Kinda what you&#x27;d expect for the price.  The bristles come out of the brush.  The bowl is nice though.</li>
    <li> Great value for a shaving set. Nice brush and soap, bowl. I bought 5 total and 3 had to be replaced because of damage in shipping. The manufacturer needs some packing in between the brush and the bowl in the box. Otherwise they are very nice to use shaving.</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome. I suggest it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Very nice set. The brush loses a few whiskers when you first use it, but then it&#x27;s a breeze to use. My preferred method is to put the soap in the bowl with a bit of water at the bottom so that the soap sticks once dry. To use, I swirl the damp (not sopping wet) brush over the soap for 10-15 seconds, then build up the lather on my face. The soap lathers easily and has a pleasantly mild scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the soap puck and smaller mug. I do enjoy the soap smell and it does a good job lubricating. The brush is not the highest quality but for the price it is a good set.</li>
    <li> I used this kit to get myself and two friends started with wet shaving. Though I&#x27;ve since moved on to higher quality (and more expensive) brushes and soaps, this is a great way to get started without committing a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value. The soap is actually pretty high quality, with a thick lather and a mild smell. The brush is not the best quality, but it&#x27;s pretty great as far as cheap, synthetic brushes go. I have dropped the bowl many, many times in the tub and it still hasn&#x27;t broken. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a nice simple set and it does not take up much room on the counter.  The brush is a good quality and the cup does well.  What I can tell you is that one cake of soap will outlast a can of shaving cream hands down.  1 cake is probably even to 4 or 5 cans of cream and can really save you money.  If your not used to shaving this way, give it a try.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> The bowl is a bowl…CHECK!&lt;br /&gt;The shave soap is soapy…CHECK!&lt;br /&gt;The boar brush hasn&#x27;t fallen apart…CHECK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this set has been great, thus far. I had previously purchased a brush from a &amp;#34;beauty supply&amp;#34; store, same place I typically get my &#x27;stache wax, and it had no spine and started shedding profusely. Enter the VDH Premium shave set. The bowl sits nicely in my bear paw of a hand, no issues there. The soap feels nicer than any of that canned crap ever did. The brush is stiff enough to make a good lather, but still bends nicely when applying to the face. I would recommend this set to anyone wanting to shave like their grandpa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***DISCLAIMER*** I am fairly new to the wet shave world, but as a 30 year old who has thrown countless dollars on both disposable crap razors and &amp;#34;shave tech&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I needed a new brush as my old one finally wore out.  I had been using this shaving soap, so I thought I would buy the soap and brush combination.  Well, I still like the soap, but the brush separated from the handle after 10 uses.  The price might be good, but I think that 10 uses is far too few.  My recommendation is to buy the soap and get the brush elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great set! I would recommend this for any beginner at DE. The shave soap is nice and the bowl and the brush work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Decent quality for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Large handle on the brush, doesn&#x27;t fit my stand correctly&lt;br /&gt;-Can buy it at Walmart for cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush is a little soft, so I am not sure if it exfoliates or not.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son. It is OK as a starter kit - the price can&#x27;t be beaten. But, I am pretty sure once he gets comfortable with wetshaving he will likely be replacing the bowl. It is just feels too small especially for the brush size. The soap included in the kit produces weak lather. At first I thought it might be the boar hair brush but when he used my [[ASIN:B001L2U61E Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.)]] the lather was noticeably richer. If I were to do it all over again I would not be drawn in by the low price and would look for something of a little better quality.</li>
    <li> Nice low priced kit,works well ,any one looking to get into wet shaving at reasonable price will be pleased,brush looses some of it,s stiffness after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment, Well packaged, and exactly what I wanted.  Needed it for Christmas present and it arrived in plenty of time.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;mug&amp;#34; is simply much much too small, and too tall!  You can&#x27;t work up a lather without having the handle of the brush clanging against the bowl, it&#x27;s much too small, and the soap that comes with it is worthless.  The brush is okay, I guess, but I don&#x27;t have a better one to compare it to and it does lose some hairs.  You&#x27;re probably better off getting a brush separately and buying a good shaving soap that comes in a puck like tin</li>
    <li> A few bristles come off and onto my face every time I use the brush during a wet shave. I have started to notice that the center of the brush is starting to thin out, making the edges of the brush look thick. I picked this exact kit up at my local Walgreens for $9.95 + tax and It&#x27;s been serving me just fine for over 4 months now, as of this writing. 7/10</li>
    <li> This makes the perfect partner to the razor gift.  Nice little kit.  He enjoys the memories of how he used to do it years ago - and it helps give a great close shave.  Kind to his skin.</li>
    <li> The bowl and soap are a good quality but the brush didn&#x27;t last long. I think that is partially due to the fact that there is no stand for the brush and you have to set it on its end. After about 3 months the glue had started to break down from the moisture and the bristles started to fall out. By 6 months, a large clump from the middle of the brush had completely fallen out.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and the set was great</li>
    <li> I got into wet shaving but I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money in case I didn&#x27;t like it.  This kit is the perfect solution for anybody who wants to delve into wet shaving.  The kit comes with three items, so I&#x27;ll say something about each one, after using it for two weeks:&lt;br /&gt;- the bowl: cute little ceramic bowl, nothing fancy but it does the job; it could have a handle, but it&#x27;s not terrible without it&lt;br /&gt;- the soap: fits in the bowl leaving enough space to work up a lather with the brush, a little runny lather at first, but it gets stiffer for the second and third lather (I do WTG, XTG and ATG); maybe I&#x27;m using too much water to whip up the first lather.  The smell is ok, not amazing, not terrible, my wife seems to like it.&lt;br /&gt;- the brush: since I&#x27;m rather new at this, I don&#x27;t know how to rate a brush other than the fact that it does the job; it hasn&#x27;t shed terribly, a hair here and there; yes the handle is plastic, but you&#x27;re paying US$10.00 for a set, so it&#x27;s understandable and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very good purchase; I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is an OK set for starting out, the soap is a little drying though. So you need a good aftershave that has a cream texture</li>
    <li> had a great shave but brush is already losing bristles with first use. bowl  is nice and soap lathered nicely.</li>
    <li> Nice lather. Nice scent. Nice shave.</li>
    <li> Great set to get started. Would be nice if it also came with some instructions on shaving with this kind of set for first time users.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the smoothness from this combo to get a close shave. The soap even moisturizers his skin a bit, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Everything was pretty much as I expected.  If I had a gripe, it was that the soap took a little longer to make a lather than what I thought, but I&#x27;m just an impatient person.</li>
    <li> I got this as an add on along with a new straight razor for $7.99.  These are quality items, all of them-not top of the line, but very good-you won&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend is happy with it..</li>
    <li> I got this for my man he loves the soap gives a good latter and priced good . Gives him a good smooth shave .&lt;br /&gt;And he smells great for you.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, bowl holds the soap, soap lathers, and brush applies said soap.  Not the highest quality, but it was quite enjoyable to use.  The bowl is the highest quality part of the set.  If you are looking for a basic set, like to start out, go get this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> great deal,brush helps with all the bumps so it is great stuff.eight more words required to submit o m g</li>
    <li> So, first time with straight razors, and I thought that this would be the perfect match with the other straightrazor I bought. Works really well, high quality, and reallly fun to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this set with my new edwin jagger razor and its pretty good stuff and you can get the soap refills at the 2 national pharmacies for 4.95 a cake.Not too much smell but good lubricity,no nicks,cuts or blood in my first 3 uses.</li>
    <li> The bristles from the brush come out and it doesn&#x27;t even feel good. I would rather lather my face with my hand. The only thing I use is the bowl...</li>
    <li> This is a great little set for the price tag. None of the three items is anything spectacular, but all three are a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scuttle is a simple round bottomed ceramic bowl. What makes it special is what it is NOT. It is not too big, too small, or square bottomed. I only wish it had a lid. I found that the puck could be pretty effectively stuck to the bottom of the bowl by simply wetting it once the first time it was unwrapped and letting it dry in the bowl. Since using up the soap that came with this set, I&#x27;ve switched to a smaller ceramic cup I had lying around to hold my puck more securely. This bowl still gets used as part of my daily shaving routine, however. I fill it with hot water to soak my brush and razor while I wet my face and apply pre-shave. Then I empty the hot water, fill my brush with soap, and lather in the bowl while it is still warm. Makes the first pass of shaving cream extra nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is basic shave soap. Smell is decent, lather is decent. It is a good starting point, but most men will want to seek out something a bit more distinctive. Different or more/less scent, different ingredients, whatever your preference. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some other pucks out there, so no worries about being stuck with it. It only lasted me a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is probably the best part of this set. It takes a fair amount of use before it really starts to perform, so don&#x27;t be disappointed by the first use. It didn&#x27;t really break in until after the soap that came with this set was long gone. After a few months of steady use it is soft, but not too soft. It holds a substantial amount of lather, and both scrubs and applies lather well. For an inexpensive brush, the knot size is quite large. It still sheds the occasional hair, but it is a cheap brush and I&#x27;m not picky. I have a few brushes in my collection now. This is probably the cheapest one, but still sees regular rotation. For best results, let it soak in warm water for little while.</li>
    <li> I like the cream itself but the bowl is a bit too small to mix up a good sized batch of shaving cream. The brush is Boar hair instead of badger so it doesn&#x27;t hold the moisture in as much. I find I have to re wet it a little bit on my second pass of shaving but its no big deal. I would recommend buying a badger brush and a larger bowl. Still a decent product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for his birthday. He has yet to use it. But he does like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this not expecting much, but I&#x27;m surprised at how good a value this package really is. Included is a boar hair shaving brush, a puck of Van Der Hagen Deluxe shaving soap, and a bowl to house the soap. The brush is the make-or-break item for this kit, and after a few shaves I&#x27;m fairly happy with it. It shed terribly on my first few shaves and still loses hairs here and there, but the brush gets the job done and it&#x27;s hard for me to complain considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap and bowl are both quality products. The bowl is just the right size; it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space yet there&#x27;s plenty of room to work up your lather. The soap is nice as well, it has a nice, gentle scent and easily produces a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good buy.</li>
    <li> A nice lather bowl, and soap. But the brush (boar I think) is like a lather vaccum, even with a high quality cream. You would be better served to part together a set with a good bager brush.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend orded this with his razor, strop, and oxide. He liked it, he wishes that the bowl was a little bit bigger.</li>
