      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It also gives my hair more body</li>
      <li>Try it , you&#x27;ll love it too.  </li>
      <li>so just make sure you do your hair, wash your hands</li>
      <li>You should buy this product if you never touch your hair and love getting your clothes, your faucet and your doorknob stained a fecal brown.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>She said Rita Hazan Root Concealer is way better and let me make an exchange.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>you do use it, be sure to hold the spray a good 12 inches from your hair so it doesn&#x27;t look like spray-painted \\&quot;blobs\\&quot; and you get a more even (natural) color distribution.</li>
      <li>Old version was great, I used the &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; shade for 10 yrs -</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
      <li>The aerosol sprayer malfunctions and &amp;#34;drips&amp;#34; instead of spraying a fine mist.  </li>
      <li>I have light to medium brown hair.  </li>
      <li>If you are a light to medium brown, this color is great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you want the original formula, search for a salon that still has it in stock.</li>
      <li>Great way to cover my grey roots!  </li>
      <li>Which makes it a bit more economical than it appears at first glance.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to spray in your hair at an angle not straight back with your part to get the best coverage.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonderful product I&#x27;ve been using for at least 15 years.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is \\&quot;spray in\\&quot; as opposed to the powder that you put on a brush -- makes it a much neater</li>
      <li>Luckily Sephora let me return one can, girl said &amp;</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s WELL worth</li>
      <li>plain baby powder is more effective, although then I would need to spray with this to make the color right again.</li>
      <li>Why did they mess with such a great product?!</li>
      <li>This product covers the grey perfectly (sprays on dark and blends in with rubbing and brushing) and adds body as well.  </li>
      <li>This new formula says &amp;#34;A bit of Blondish,&amp;#34; rather than the original which was &amp;#34;Blondish.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s jarring at first</li>
      <li>You are better off buying Psssst at your local discount or drug store.  </li>
      <li>, THEN do your makeup (or do your makeup first, whatever works).</li>
      <li>It also left a lot of static in the treated area.  </li>
      <li>A few inches from your hair is good.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair product I have ever used - I have thin hair that does NOTHING without this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve reviewed the white B&amp;b hair powder, and I love the blondish powder just as much.</li>
      <li>I loved my current cut too much to go in just yet for my next color-</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair with absolutely no body.  </li>
      <li>To stretch the time between shampoos I had been using Psssst dry shampoo on my bangs that worked really well but read such good reviews about this product I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty sweat proof too as long as it&#x27;s lightly covered on your head.  </li>
      <li>Much residue remained and the treated area felt gummy to the touch.  </li>
      <li>use very sparingly, close to the scalp, and blend with fingertips.  </li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied with this product.  </li>
      <li>I got out as much product as I could with the brush and went on with the day.  </li>
      <li>However, I really don&#x27;t like what it does to your pillow case -- leaves a skanky dirty-looking residue on it that makes it looks like you haven&#x27;t washed the linens in months.  </li>
      <li>The powder would clump up and not cover much of an area.  </li>
      <li>this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than Pssst or other aerosol hair powders...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and given my previous noted hair type</li>
      <li>When my roots are seeing grey between colorings, just a spray of this down my part and I am good to go.</li>
      <li>Also, small, quick pushes so it covers light instead of clumps.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>#34;we&#x27;ve been having a lot of complaints about the new version.&amp;#34;  They no longer recommend B&amp;B hair powder.  </li>
      <li>new B&amp;B hair powder is completely transparent.  </li>
      <li>I will say that I use clip in extensions from time to time - and the blondish hair powder helps blend in the extension colors with my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I can skip a wash and still look professional.</li>
      <li>This new formula is sheer, does not cover roots well.</li>
      <li>I teach hot yoga and have never had it run down my forehead.  </li>
      <li>Just ONE spray of this product in the area where you have new ROOTS growing and \\&quot;Pouf\\&quot; the grey seam is gone !!!  </li>

<li> My hair is very thin on top and this adds volume and covers my bald spots.  </li>
<li> it seamlessly covered roots &amp; bald spots due to thinning hair.  </li>
<li> It works better than this does and much less residue left behind.</li>
<li> I have long medium blonde hair that tends to be quite oily especially at the bangs.</li>
<li> the minor hassle of hand-washing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not wild about the way my hair feels with this stuff on (sticky)</li>
<li> The Hair Power Bumble and Bumble help me cover the grey hair for awhile before I could color my roots.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other hair products that claim to do the same, but there is no comparison.  </li>
<li> Shampoo?**&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel it is really a dry shampoo-</li>
<li> Otherwise, get the Drybar dry shampoo.</li>
<li> Once it dried, I could not get it all brushed out.  </li>
<li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> Just be careful, will stain your cloths.</li>
<li> I used only a small amount of the product.  </li>
<li> I bought this and arrived half empty, tried to used it</li>
<li> I have tried the advice from other reviewers to apply sparingly, but always this sticky stuff make my hair look dull and flat.</li>
<li> It turned the areas I treated dark brown.  </li>
<li> It was a mess.  </li>
<li> FYI - you&#x27;ll get a little film of brown powder on your fingers if you style with them after applying.</li>
<li> I bought one in a compact and disliked it.  </li>
<li> Bumble &amp; Bumble reformulated their hair powders in early 2014 making them virtually useless.</li>
<li> New version (&amp;#34;Blondish&amp;#34;) is TERRIBLE, does NOT cover roots or mask thinning areas.</li>
<li> When I cleansed the area the cleansing cloth turned black!  </li>
<li> Probably not a good product for people with very dry hair.</li>
<li> Flat, thin, very hard to get a grip on without a texturizing product.</li>
<li> It seems expensive but saves money in the long run.  </li>
<li> It is nearly impossible to apply it only to the roots in the bang area.  </li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m surprised, but I still find that really disgusting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very fine hair with absolutely no body.  This product covers the grey perfectly (sprays on dark and blends in with rubbing and brushing) and adds body as well.  Its great.</li>
    <li> Great for cover up in between color appts - wouldnt be without it</li>
    <li> I have light to medium brown hair.  Matches well.  This is great for a quick fix to those ever-showing grays.  I use this in between my hair colors.  Just be careful, will stain your cloths.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied with this product.  The aerosol sprayer malfunctions and &amp;#34;drips&amp;#34; instead of spraying a fine mist.  I intend to return it but just have not taken the time to ask for a refund.  It was rather pricey, so was particularly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bumble &amp; Bumble reformulated their hair powders in early 2014 making them virtually useless. Old version was great, I used the &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; shade for 10 yrs - it seamlessly covered roots &amp; bald spots due to thinning hair.  One can lasted 6+ months. New version (&amp;#34;Blondish&amp;#34;) is TERRIBLE, does NOT cover roots or mask thinning areas. I also tried the &amp;#34;Brown&amp;#34; shade, same problem. The product is worse than a cheap can of Batiste Hint of Color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new B&amp;B hair powder is completely transparent.  And now I&#x27;m out $80. Why did they mess with such a great product?! Luckily Sephora let me return one can, girl said &amp;#34;we&#x27;ve been having a lot of complaints about the new version.&amp;#34;  They no longer recommend B&amp;B hair powder.  She said Rita Hazan Root Concealer is way better and let me make an exchange.  Also just bought Gray Away Root Concealer to test as well from Bed,Bath/Beyond.</li>
    <li> When my roots are seeing grey between colorings, just a spray of this down my part and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product yet, but I received it in a timely order and it arrived in good shape. I&#x27;m sure it will be great.</li>
    <li> The Hair Power Bumble and Bumble help me cover the grey hair for awhile before I could color my roots. It is easy to use and when apply correctly it is very effective.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does help you \\&quot;extend your style\\&quot; between washings.  I&#x27;m not wild about the way my hair feels with this stuff on (sticky) but I suppose that is the cost of not washing my hair every day.    However, I really don&#x27;t like what it does to your pillow case -- leaves a skanky dirty-looking residue on it that makes it looks like you haven&#x27;t washed the linens in months.  This is basically a non-permanent hair dye so I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m surprised, but I still find that really disgusting.</li>
    <li> I like the texture this gives to my hair. I can skip a wash and still look professional. It is darker than blonde.  And, yes, it will turn your skin brown. So don&#x27;t spray it on your skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than Pssst or other aerosol hair powders...save your cash</li>
    <li> I have used several kinds of hair powder for my gray roots.  This is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I bought one in a compact and disliked it.  The powder would clump up and not cover much of an area.  It was a mess.  i tried another spray but it wouldn&#x27;t cover the gray without spraying several times.  It seems expensive but saves money in the long run.  I can go longer without having my hair colored and highlighted.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product to me as an alternative to shampooing every day.  I love the fact that it is \\&quot;spray in\\&quot; as opposed to the powder that you put on a brush -- makes it a much neater process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you do use it, be sure to hold the spray a good 12 inches from your hair so it doesn&#x27;t look like spray-painted \\&quot;blobs\\&quot; and you get a more even (natural) color distribution.</li>
    <li> I bought this and arrived half empty, tried to used it and it leaked all over. Ended up staining my clothes and floor. An absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years.  It is extremely effective and easy to use to touchup between colorings and to cover up thinning spots.  I keep 2 cans at all times.  I do not ever want to run out of this stuff.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to get you thru the days or weeks until you can go to your beauty salon for color. Just ONE spray of this product in the area where you have new ROOTS growing and \\&quot;Pouf\\&quot; the grey seam is gone !!!  I take it with me for travel or just for home for those days that I need a \\&quot;touch -Up \\&quot; and can&#x27;t get to the salon.  Try it , you&#x27;ll love it too.  Delivery was just on time as I needed it immediately.  I would buy again and have !!</li>
    <li> I have long medium blonde hair that tends to be quite oily especially at the bangs. To stretch the time between shampoos I had been using Psssst dry shampoo on my bangs that worked really well but read such good reviews about this product I thought I would give it a try.  BIG mistake.  I used only a small amount of the product.  Once it dried, I could not get it all brushed out.  It turned the areas I treated dark brown.  It is nearly impossible to apply it only to the roots in the bang area.  I got out as much product as I could with the brush and went on with the day.  Much residue remained and the treated area felt gummy to the touch.  It also left a lot of static in the treated area.  By the end of the day the brown residue had flaked off onto my forehead.  When I cleansed the area the cleansing cloth turned black!  I&#x27;m not at all happy with this product.  In addition, it is way over-priced.  You are better off buying Psssst at your local discount or drug store.  It works better than this does and much less residue left behind.</li>
    <li> You should buy this product if you never touch your hair and love getting your clothes, your faucet and your doorknob stained a fecal brown. Otherwise, get the Drybar dry shampoo. It actually stays in your hair and is $20 cheaper.</li>
    <li> I use this hair powder everytime I wash my hair. It covers my scalp where my hair has thinned. It also gives my hair more body so I give it 5 stars!  It is a wonderful product I&#x27;ve been using for at least 15 years.</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the one-star reviews. I have tried the advice from other reviewers to apply sparingly, but always this sticky stuff make my hair look dull and flat. It&#x27;s horrible! I like finley hair powder.</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble Hair Powder is awesome.  My hair is very thin on top and this adds volume and covers my bald spots.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I&#x27;ve used other hair products that claim to do the same, but there is no comparison.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I loved my current cut too much to go in just yet for my next color- this allows me to choose one time to redo color and cut!  Which makes it a bit more economical than it appears at first glance.  If you are a light to medium brown, this color is great.&lt;br /&gt;**Dry Shampoo?**&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel it is really a dry shampoo- plain baby powder is more effective, although then I would need to spray with this to make the color right again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Be sure to spray in your hair at an angle not straight back with your part to get the best coverage.  Also, small, quick pushes so it covers light instead of clumps.  If the bottle is too close to your head it will run, just like spray paint.  A few inches from your hair is good.  If you have hair loss, this is the best product ever.  It is pretty sweat proof too as long as it&#x27;s lightly covered on your head.  I teach hot yoga and have never had it run down my forehead.  It is expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Bumble reformulated the hair powders. This new formula is sheer, does not cover roots well. I&#x27;ve been using Blondish for about ten years. I loved it. If you want the original formula, search for a salon that still has it in stock. This new formula says &amp;#34;A bit of Blondish,&amp;#34; rather than the original which was &amp;#34;Blondish.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great way to cover my grey roots!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It adds volume, improves my hairline and allows my somewhat thin, oily hair to go two days between shampoos.  Advice:  use very sparingly, close to the scalp, and blend with fingertips.  Probably not a good product for people with very dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful way to extend the time between hair colorings. Especially when traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed the white B&amp;b hair powder, and I love the blondish powder just as much. This is by far the best hair product I have ever used - I have thin hair that does NOTHING without this stuff. Flat, thin, very hard to get a grip on without a texturizing product. I love this stuff and given my previous noted hair type I will say that I use clip in extensions from time to time - and the blondish hair powder helps blend in the extension colors with my natural hair. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! FYI - you&#x27;ll get a little film of brown powder on your fingers if you style with them after applying. It&#x27;s jarring at first so just make sure you do your hair, wash your hands, THEN do your makeup (or do your makeup first, whatever works). Anyway, that is the only con of this stuff for me and it&#x27;s WELL worth the minor hassle of hand-washing. Love it!</li>
