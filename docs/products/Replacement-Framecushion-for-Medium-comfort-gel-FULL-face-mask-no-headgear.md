      <li>While it took forever for this to arrive, I am mostly please with it.</li>
      <li>it the top portion (the forehead piece) is wayyyyyyyyy to flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed wearing it versus the nose-only CPAP mask.  </li>
      <li>Well seems to be OK</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is safe or a unit that should be for sale.</li>
      <li>It was a quick delivery and came inside a nice Respironics bag.</li>
      <li>One of the most comfortable cpap masks I have worn...</li>
      <li>it is easy to change positions in bed without it start leaking.  </li>
      <li>Easily to put on and put off.</li>
      <li>This is more like what you would see being used in a hospital for patients that need full respiratory assistance (mouth and nose)</li>
      <li>Works just fine.</li>
      <li>Great second one I ordered.</li>
      <li>The bridge adjustment is cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>This mask is comfortable if it is adjusted correctly.  </li>
      <li>Reduce sound.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made too.</li>
      <li>The face piece is comfortable except for where it sits under the mouth.</li>
      <li>This does not have a snug fit.</li>
      <li>it seems to move with you comfortably</li>
      <li>Be sure to get the right size</li>
      <li>I was super excited to see a new mask out there ,so I ordered it to try it out ,looked liked</li>
      <li>Mask isn&#x27;t a true medium.</li>
      <li>Fits perfect no leaks very comfortable don&#x27;t waste your time with others I&#x27;ve tried them all this one is hands down the best dont have to wear ear plugs anymore from the noise from the other ones</li>
      <li>It got to the point I was super gluing his masks and sewing his headgear  </li>
      <li>It was real reasonable price, when I purchased it.</li>
      <li>This thing is comfortable but I would really do some research before you buy this.</li>
      <li>it is very large.</li>
      <li>I decided to try a full mask after hearing from others how much they like theirs.  </li>
      <li>This particular full mask had overall outstanding reviews</li>
      <li>I received it today and put it together and at first glance i knew it wasn&#x27;t going to work</li>
      <li>I opened the new headgear and this full mask and started strapping it together.  </li>
      <li>:  Since I&#x27;ve used a nasal mask for so many years, I am not accustomed to having my warm and moist, exhaled breath momentarily condensing on my lips and mouth and then quickly dried up on the very next inhale.  </li>
      <li>I just wish I would have paid closer attention because I needed a large instead.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping A</li>
      <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
      <li>I am very concerned that the frame is engraved with &amp;#34;not for home use&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Very efficient.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>After several attempts to try and make it fit.</li>
      <li>No matter how much I adjust the headgear, I can&#x27;t seem to have this mask not dig into the bridge of my nose.  </li>
      <li>overall thought it was more comfortable than the nose-only CPAP mask where so often it feels like you&#x27;re threading the needle to ensure it doesn&#x27;t slip or move, doesn&#x27;t get down into your mouth and doesn&#x27;t otherwise gape or develop gaps that lose air pressure.  </li>
      <li>It was far cheaper to buy this mask here than it was with my insurance to buy it from my Dr.  Thanks!</li>
      <li>Of course, when it quickly dries, it also cools your lips and mouth at the same time.  </li>
      <li>he was so happy to see a new mask and headgear that wasn&#x27;t sky high expensive</li>
      <li>and I have been on a mission to find decent priced masks and head gear to replace his old ones and every time I thought I did</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not entirely sure whether it&#x27;s appropriate for people with sleep apnea or not.  </li>
      <li>It was the same exact mask that came with my CPap machine.</li>
      <li>Same brand different mask medium is fine this one is much smaller.</li>
      <li>I was a bit surprised when I got it that it covered not just my nose but mouth as well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Without question, the quality of this mask and the fit is above average, but considering the above-mentioned cons</li>
      <li>I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t more comfortable.</li>

<li> I was going to purchase again, but it&#x27;s a little too high now.</li>
<li> just to get them to last as long as I could.</li>
<li> , i would only recommend this mask to someone who cannot handle a nasal mask due to air blowing out of their mouth.  </li>
<li> but I would suggest buying a larger size if you are not familiar with this product.</li>
<li> I am going back to ResMed-it hurts my nose too, but at least it doesn&#x27;t constantly leak.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the medium is not the same size as my other medium mask.</li>
<li> My other mask was alot lighter than this one.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> I make due with it</li>
<li> and  mine actually came with headgear, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was an accident or not.</li>
<li> Heavy and cumbersome.</li>
<li> would you make a product that would be paper thin at a critical area where theres lots of pressure ?</li>
<li> I was looking for a replacement for my ResMed mask I usually wear, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one.</li>
<li> it sadly was money wasted as I can&#x27;t abide by the pain on the bridge of my nose.</li>
<li> My biggest complaint here was the terrible pressure it put on the bridge of my nose leaving a red welt on it.  </li>
<li> An uncomfortable outer cushion.</li>
<li> I still wound up with a painful welt, which was really disappointing as otherwise</li>
<li> For some reason, this mask causes me to be claustrophobic.  </li>
<li> I wake up once or twice an hour in a claustrophobic panic attack where i just want to rip the mask off.  </li>
<li> Uncomfortable!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast Shipping A +++ the mask was in good condition and just like the picture so true to it.</li>
    <li> Awesome. just as advertised will buy from again.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and works great. It has exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> Very efficient. price good. Perfectly adjust to the face. Reduce sound. confortable to adjust. Easily to put on and put off.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest but OK</li>
    <li> Fits perfect no leaks very comfortable don&#x27;t waste your time with others I&#x27;ve tried them all this one is hands down the best dont have to wear ear plugs anymore from the noise from the other ones</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a face mask. This does not have a snug fit. The plastic covering the nose and mouth is to &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34;. Getting a good seal needs many adjustments.</li>
    <li> Although it said it was a medium size mask...it is very large. After several attempts to try and make it fit. I have given up..will keep looking for a mask that properly fits my face.</li>
    <li> Works just fine. I just wish I would have paid closer attention because I needed a large instead. It doesn&#x27;t come with a head strap.</li>
    <li> I have been using a CPAP machine with a Nasal mask for 18 years.  I decided to try a full mask after hearing from others how much they like theirs.  This particular full mask had overall outstanding reviews so i decided this is the one for me.  It only took four days to arrive.  I opened the new headgear and this full mask and started strapping it together.  It took approximately fifteen minutes to fit it properly.  I consider that time well-spent if you want to sleep comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  This mask is comfortable if it is adjusted correctly.  It cradles your face and seals well when air pressure is applied to it.  it is easy to change positions in bed without it start leaking.  it seems to move with you comfortably and you don&#x27;t have to position yourself Just-right so that it doesn&#x27;t leak.  It keeps the air seal very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Since I&#x27;ve used a nasal mask for so many years, I am not accustomed to having my warm and moist, exhaled breath momentarily condensing on my lips and mouth and then quickly dried up on the very next inhale.  Of course, when it quickly dries, it also cools your lips and mouth at the same time.  That Warming -&amp;#62; Wetting -&amp;#62; Cooling -&amp;#62; Drying cycle repeats over and over again with every breath you take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this is probably just me... For some reason, this mask causes me to be claustrophobic.  I wake up once or twice an hour in a claustrophobic panic attack where i just want to rip the mask off.  I simply cannot seem to get over that so I&#x27;m going back to the nasal mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without question, the quality of this mask and the fit is above average, but considering the above-mentioned cons, i would only recommend this mask to someone who cannot handle a nasal mask due to air blowing out of their mouth.  Otherwise, stick with a nasal mask.</li>
    <li> It is good once you get used to the weight.  My other mask was alot lighter than this one.</li>
    <li> Uncomfortable!!! Mask isn&#x27;t a true medium. Same brand different mask medium is fine this one is much smaller. Hits middle of my nose and my teeth. Cheaply made too. Feels like the nose adjustment will break any time.</li>
    <li> Excellent piece of equipment. My only complaint is that the medium is not the same size as my other medium mask. I make due with it but I would suggest buying a larger size if you are not familiar with this product.</li>
    <li> My husband has had a cpap machine for the last 7 years and I have been on a mission to find decent priced masks and head gear to replace his old ones and every time I thought I did it was a bust they were either used (ewww) or were over the top expensive. It got to the point I was super gluing his masks and sewing his headgear  just to get them to last as long as I could. There was some kind of hiccup with our insurance so they refused to replace his parts like they were supposed to. THANK YOU SO MUCH you are life savers he was so happy to see a new mask and headgear that wasn&#x27;t sky high expensive I could literally see the relief go through his shoulders. Fit perfectly and he&#x27;s breathing easier again an so am I :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order the correct mask but this is a good quality mask</li>
    <li> Works great for a much cheaper price!</li>
    <li> No matter how much I adjust the headgear, I can&#x27;t seem to have this mask not dig into the bridge of my nose.  I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t more comfortable.</li>
    <li> An uncomfortable outer cushion. Outer seal pinches and cuts into your cheek. No amount of adjusting seems to help. I am very concerned that the frame is engraved with &amp;#34;not for home use&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know if this is safe or a unit that should be for sale.</li>
    <li> Heavy and cumbersome.</li>
    <li> Helped me a lot.  It was far cheaper to buy this mask here than it was with my insurance to buy it from my Dr.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Well seems to be OK and  mine actually came with headgear, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was an accident or not. This thing is comfortable but I would really do some research before you buy this. Good product for the money tho</li>
    <li> The bridge adjustment is cheaply made.  Other than that it&#x27;s a good product.  Be sure to get the right size or you&#x27;ll have difficulty getting it to seal.</li>
    <li> It was the same exact mask that came with my CPap machine. It was a quick delivery and came inside a nice Respironics bag. It was real reasonable price, when I purchased it. I was going to purchase again, but it&#x27;s a little too high now.</li>
    <li> While it took forever for this to arrive, I am mostly please with it. The head strap is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. The face piece is comfortable except for where it sits under the mouth.</li>
    <li> When it came time to get a replacement CPAP mask I came across this thinking it was fairly similar to the one I was currently using, which covers my nose, but not my mouth.  I was a bit surprised when I got it that it covered not just my nose but mouth as well.  This is more like what you would see being used in a hospital for patients that need full respiratory assistance (mouth and nose) so I&#x27;m not entirely sure whether it&#x27;s appropriate for people with sleep apnea or not.  I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a go and to be honest I really enjoyed wearing it versus the nose-only CPAP mask.  It struck me that I was getting the air I needed and overall thought it was more comfortable than the nose-only CPAP mask where so often it feels like you&#x27;re threading the needle to ensure it doesn&#x27;t slip or move, doesn&#x27;t get down into your mouth and doesn&#x27;t otherwise gape or develop gaps that lose air pressure.  My biggest complaint here was the terrible pressure it put on the bridge of my nose leaving a red welt on it.  No matter how I tried to adjust it I still wound up with a painful welt, which was really disappointing as otherwise, I loved the full mask.  While an interesting diversion and idea it sadly was money wasted as I can&#x27;t abide by the pain on the bridge of my nose.</li>
    <li> Great mask, just like what we would have purchased at the doctor, but for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> One of the most comfortable cpap masks I have worn...</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my ResMed mask I usually wear, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one. I don&#x27;t like it. I can&#x27;t get it to quit leaking no matter how I adjust my straps. And even with gel inserts, it still hurts the bridge of my nose. I am going back to ResMed-it hurts my nose too, but at least it doesn&#x27;t constantly leak. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> WILL ORDER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE AND I WILL TELL OTHERS ABOUT IT TO SO THEY CAN ORDER THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Great second one I ordered. The forehead piece broke but after a year or more that&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to see a new mask out there ,so I ordered it to try it out ,looked liked it was going to be very comfortable.I received it today and put it together and at first glance i knew it wasn&#x27;t going to work out.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem it the top portion (the forehead piece) is wayyyyyyyyy to flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Why would you make a product that would be paper thin at a critical area where theres lots of pressure ? It kept popping off which would not last a night ! The gel insert felt kinda nice but I didn&#x27;t have enough time to try it out.</li>
