<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it did anything to be honest. I used it every morning for a while and never saw any gunk that everyone was talking about. Maybe it was just me though, not sure. It seems like a gimmick to me, and now I have the same type of thing on the back of the toothbrushes that I get  so it really makes these useless.</li>
    <li> Cant go a day without the orabursh tongue cleaner!!!! Makes you feel so fresh!</li>
    <li> It really works well to clean the tongue!! Does the work its suppose to do!! BUY IT!! Love the concept of spooning!! LOL</li>
    <li> These clean well, but they are a bit big for my normal-sized mouth and I have to be a bit more careful not to gag than I did with the Gum brand cleaners I used before. It&#x27;s not so much of a problem that I won&#x27;t go ahead and use these up, but afterwards I&#x27;ll probably switch back to the Gum ones, which require a bit more scrubbing but don&#x27;t require quite as much caution.</li>
    <li> All the grime you can&#x27;t see will be visible and removed with this amazing product! I swear by it! Bought it in bulk and gave them to the family... love it!!!</li>
    <li> The product is really good, loved it and it&#x27;s helping me a lot. Easy to use and really cheap, I recommend.</li>
    <li> Wife is super happy!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tongue cleaner I&#x27;ve used. Great design makes it very comfortable and efficient.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really good tongue scrapers.  This is a newer design from the previous version and works great.  Great fresh mouth feeling in the morning and has removed all signs of bad breath.</li>
    <li> My son saw this product on youtube and suggested I purchase it.  I am concerned about oral hygiene and have purchased several different kinds of tongue scrapers over the years.  When I saw the different price options offered for this product on Amazon, I decided to do a little more online research before I placed an order.  I was really surprised by the \\&quot;scam\\&quot; claims regarding this product.  It&#x27;s just a tongue scraper??  I think some of the claims are about how it has been marketed.  Considering I&#x27;ve never seen a commercial for it nor did I watch the youtube video my son saw, I&#x27;m really not concerned about that part of it.  I did read some reviewers statements that their orabrushes came without the scraper part.  Not sure if they just didn&#x27;t realize the scraper is just a small piece of plastic at the tip of the product.  The real \\&quot;worker bee\\&quot; part of this product is the bristle part.  Either way, my son and I both love ours.  The package instructs you to brush (not too hard) back and forth on the tongue surface and then use the scraper to \\&quot;scrape up\\&quot; what you&#x27;ve loosened with the bristles before rinsing.  My mouth feels much fresher after using this compared to my previous scrapers.  I definitely plan to repurchase when necessary.</li>
    <li> I never realized how much plaque was on my tongue until using this. Also it immediately got rid of bad breath.</li>
    <li> This is awesome for those who has bad breathe</li>
    <li> I like these tongue cleaners better than others that I&#x27;ve tried. Scraper is wide and quickly and easily cleans the tongue, and the bristles help as well. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/16/2017 - The new order I just received has a scraper that is even BETTER than the last order. The scraping part is sharper (not at all dangerously) that is MUCH more effective at scraping the crap off your tongue.......Highly recommended product!!!</li>
    <li> In my opinion the best tongue scraper in the market. Highly effective but gentle at the same time. You won&#x27;t believe what your tongue is covered with until using this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this tongue brush. This is my 3rd one. It does the cleaning and keep my mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> This is no comparison to the previous version. Not at all effective due to an additional protective edge which does not allow the bristles to effectively do the job!</li>
    <li> for grandkids for christmas</li>
    <li> Love this brush ...gets all the gunk off</li>
    <li> I think they kinda look like the monsters from that Tom Cruise war of the worlds deal. My favorite thing is French bread, no question. I could eat it for breakfast, I could eat it for lunch, I could eat it for dinner. My second favorite thing is sleeping. If I could eat French bread while I was sleeping, I would, and then that would be my favorite thing. My tongue has never gotten so many compliments as it has since I began using this product which came in a box which looked like it contained hanes white v necked undershirts (medium), but did&#x27;nt.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the YouTube Video. Tongue scrapers and those useless wannabee tongue scrapers on the back of toothbrushes don&#x27;t even compare. This IS the product to use. I&#x27;ve used this since I got it 1/22/13 and it has performed exceptionally wells. I find that my breath stays fresher for longer and I have a clean feeling in my mouth. I can also taste food slightly better after using the Orabrush. The bristles feel very soft and are very comforting on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what it does in a nutshell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Gets rid of the nastiness on your tongue&lt;br /&gt;2. Cures morning breath&lt;br /&gt;3. Gives you a cleaner feeling mouth throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;4 Aids your dental routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you use it twice a day, once in the morning and before you go to bed. There&#x27;s no minty flavor on it, so it makes it easy to use before bed.</li>
    <li> Holy smokes. So, at first when I started off cleaning my tongue, I used a toothbrush + paste just like any other person. I upgraded from that to a plastic scraper, then from that to a metallic scraper (Dr. Tung&#x27;s, which I USED to think was the best possible option). Now I am convinced that the Orabrush is the best possible option when it comes to tongue cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Dr. Tung&#x27;s metal scraper, I was NOT getting the best possible clean given what was out on the market. I&#x27;m still going to leave my review on Amazon as a *5-star product, however, because at the time, and congruent with my use for six months, it was decent. I&#x27;d downgrade it to about a 2.5 or 3-star rating today, though, since compared to the Orabrush it is less cost-efficient - being overly priced &amp; somewhat tacky in design in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Orabrush deserves 5-stars b/c it is EASY to use: quick, efficient, and solid. No cuts yet (something that happened with other brands I have used). 30-60 seconds of tongue scraping + a quick mouth rinse that focuses on the tongue &#x3D; best possible tongue clean you can enjoy in the modern day. Maybe something better will come out, but until then I&#x27;m going to stick with Orabrush.</li>
    <li> A must for your daily routine. Effective</li>
    <li> Good for a clean tongue. Gotta keep it clean, you know.... 8^)</li>
    <li> Really clean deeply your tongue.I love this product!!!Is my 4th order and i introduced this product to my friends who love them too!</li>
    <li> The tongue cleaners I received were the original design, not like shown in the picture, but they got the job done. Not as comfortable as the newer versions.</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used; exceptionally effective without any harsh abrasion</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Exactly as described</li>
    <li> Orabrush makes a great tongue scraper.  It does a great job at cleaning the tongue.  I use it along with flossing, brushing and mouthwash four times a day.</li>
    <li> These are completely worthless.  My toothbrush does a far superior job.  Do not waste your time and money on this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gets the job done. There might be better ones out there then this but i have not looked into it. For now this will do.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush definitely does what it claims and cleans the tongue better than any other item I have ever used. If oral hygiene is important to you, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Orabrushes for the past 3 years and they&#x27;re pretty cool. I lost mine awhile back and just going a week without one i was able to taste all the smelly gunk that i used to scrape off my tongue. It makes a big difference and it definitely lasts longer than the 6 months they tell you on the back. I think it&#x27;s just a marketing trick. Great product, would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Quality product with a good design, but I&#x27;m still undecided on if I notice much difference compared to a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Ora brush works well. Cleans all the gunk off of the tongue. I have used this product for just a couple of months and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had never tried a tongue cleaner before but was so satisfied I haven&#x27;t tried anything else since. These definitely make a difference. Everyone loves fresh breath!</li>
    <li> Love these like you wouldn&#x27;t imagine. The way they loosen up the plaque and then scoop it away leaves your tongue feeling as clean as your teeth do when you brush them. This is actually a reorder seeing as I&#x27;ve realized I can&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> These work really well and just as they are advertised. I would definitely recommend these, especially to anyone with halitosis.</li>
    <li> Great advertising as I thought it would be some magic product that would immediately get rid of all my stinky breath. On the contrary, this actually doesn&#x27;t work as well as my normal pentech tongue scrapper does. I used it a few times and gave up.</li>
    <li> Getting turn down for date? Not getting that promotion at work? People avoiding talking to you like your the black plague? Maybe it&#x27;s not you maybe it&#x27;s your breath! Get the Orabrush, it solved all these issues for me (literally) and it can for you to!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using the Orabrush.  It keeps my tongue and breath feeling fresh for hours.  My &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; is not as strong either. I have used other tongue cleaners on the market, but nothing compares to the Orabrush.  My dentist even complimented how clean my tongue was at my last visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this produce to everyone and I also would suggest using the tongue foam as well.  I have tried other gel products and they do not work as well.  I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t seem to fix the bad breath for good- it does work for hours and makes your mouth feel VERY clean.</li>
    <li> Those who did not use it, won&#x27;t understand how effective this is. The only issue I found about it is - probably it is available only online because I never found it in any stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using scrapers for about 10 years. I wanted to see if these brushes are any good. I want to go back to scrapers as I feel they are much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT see any advantages of using this expensive &#x27;accessory&#x27; over a regular tooth brush. My Colgate toothbrush that has a tongue scrubber at the back does a better job. Even the bristles of a regular toothbrush do a better job than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion DONT buy it, instead buy a scraper.</li>
    <li> Works great. Cleans the tongue and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I now have a clean tongue thanks for Oralbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a great product .cleans the tongue perfectly. my mouth seems so much cleaner and my breath is so much fresher after every use! I have bragged about the orabrush to all my friends and family, it&#x27;s a must have :)</li>
    <li> works well, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as people think. Metal tongue scrapers work better if you know how to use them.</li>
    <li> But, for the price you can get a normal tongue scraper and get very similar results just using your toothbrush and the scraper.  Not a bad product, but certainly not essential.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I hurt my tongue even though I scraped it so gently because it is not so soft. Then after scraping, I find this not so easy to wash because it is like a hairbrush.</li>
    <li> Someone told me this and I saw it was white.  That is bacteria and that is bad breath.  I&#x27;ve been using various brushes for years now but this one is the easiest to use since the bristles are not so rigid like my earlier brush.  You&#x27;ll be surprised how much your breath improves after you see all the muck you take off your tongue.  And besides, it&#x27;s just good hygiene regardless.</li>
    <li> Helps cleaning your mouth</li>
    <li> The tongue cleaner is great at getting the white stuff off your tongue. I use it everyday and it is definitely noticeable. I&#x27;ve given it to family and friends and they all feel in love with it; I am yet to hear a complaint about it. I love it so much, I had to get the multi-pack.</li>
    <li> I saw a youtube commercial and, as per my usual, wrote it off. But I kept wondering. I brush 3 times a day but I&#x27;m just one of those unfortunate stinkers. My boyfriend and I found these and felt, for the price, why the heck not? It&#x27;s no miracle and if you gag easily it still might not help a load, but if you take the time it&#x27;s way better than trying with your regular toothbrush! So if you&#x27;re writing it off as more &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; garbage, it does work! Grab em up!</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from daily tongue buildups after sleeping, I highly recommend the Oraburhs. Orabrush has helped me eliminate that white transparent layer of phlegm on my tongue and kept my mouth fresh. That white layer of phlegm is not only disgusting but it is also one of the main causes of bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across the Orabrush after seeing a youtube ad and I initially thought it was ridiculous;however, with the product costing less than $5.00, I had nothing to lose. The bristle is soft and the product itself is very easy to use. Place the orabrush on the back of your tongue and pull it gently to the tip of your tongue then repeat. You should start seeing an immediate result. After 6 Orabrushes and two years of usage, I can honestly say that it&#x27;s worth the hype and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usability: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Affordability: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again? Definitely</li>
    <li> They are a huge improvement over the first iteration of orabrushes, but they are still just as expensive as they once were. That&#x27;s my only complaint though.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered this product for my dog - they do make one - but the &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; one was sent with no way to return it!  Last time I order this product!&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought I would ;try it - didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m out my money and my confidence in ordering something like this again.</li>
    <li> Its been 6 months since I started using this and its still holding strong. No major signs of bristles bending and it cleans up well after use in hot water so it shows no signs of needing a replacement yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Good quality (better than some others I have tried which broke or wore out)&lt;br /&gt;+Has bristles as well as a scraper, both do good but separate jobs&lt;br /&gt;+light and perfectly shaped&lt;br /&gt;+Bristles aren&#x27;t too hard on the tongue nor so soft that they bend and wear out&lt;br /&gt;-Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t have a surface for applying tongue cleaning toothpaste. Some cleaners I&#x27;ve used had this on the back side. Using the bristles to apply paste causes it to get stuck in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy.</li>
    <li> O.k, so l have been using tongue scrapers for some time now. Generally the plastic ones made by Tongue Cleaner. Although they seem to be a little sturdier than the ones that you can purchase in the stores, l still could never seem to get the white coating off my tongue. Until now. I have never seen any other product like the Orabrush. Sure I&#x27;ve seen tongue cleaners with similar designs, however the bristles on those are the same as on your toothbrush. Based on that fact, all you usually end up doing is brushing the germs around. The Orabrush does not have bristles. The material is something that once you feel it you&#x27;ll know its different .The Tongue Cleaner just scrapes the surface of the tongue, but the Orabrush gets in between the crevices to clean all the stuff that it can&#x27;t reach. Then once you scrape all of that stuff off you will be amazed at what you see in the sink. It&#x27;s unbelievable. The tiny little scraper that&#x27;s on the tip of the Orabrush just does not do the trick. You will need a better scraper than that to remove the goo that the Orabrush brings to the surface. So I still use the Tongue Cleaner in addition to the Orabrush, which seems to give me the powerful double dose of cleaning that I need. Be sure to use enough pressure without causing harm to your tongue. The goo didn&#x27;t appear for me until I brushed my tongue like it owed me money.</li>
    <li> These tongue cleaners deserve more than 5 stars because they do what no other product can do, not even a tooth brush.  They clean your tongue gently, and very far back, without hurting you.  When used with the foam, your mouth feels wonderful.  You certainly don&#x27;t have to worry about your breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended these to several people I work with, but only after I got remarks about how nice my breath was.  I&#x27;d already been using these since they came out but that is a difficult compliment, isn&#x27;t it?  You&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
    <li> This is something that I have never tried before, but thought I would give it a shot. Not sure if there is any long term damage to the tongue, but will see. My mouth just feels cleaner and after eating a meal, and not only brushing your teeth but using this product just makes you feel fresher. Great product and will by again.</li>
    <li> Works but you have to continually do it. I thought it would be a permanent fix for bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;Works well though.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years since I saw it on YouTube. The only problem was that I thought I would be getting the colors on the picture shown, but I got other ones :( I wish there was an option to choose your colors!</li>
    <li> They work well.  I would purchase again.  It does what it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> These are great! They prevent bad breath and so useful for on-the-go!!! Highly recommend this brand and product because it really is the best!</li>
    <li> After use, my mouth feels extremely clean!</li>
    <li> Great tongue cleaners</li>
    <li> In another review I read that these are different than the original, and that turned out to be true; the reviewer was not happy about that. I don&#x27;t agree; I liked the original very much but these are far superior!! Wait until you see the cleansing you get. Also, the pricing for a package of 4 was very good compared to a single.</li>
    <li> This is a super great product and I recommend it to everyone, especially kids. It really works to get rid of the bad stuff on your tongue.  I use mine 3 times a day.  Love it, Love it , Love it.  What more can i say?</li>
    <li> perfect 1st tongue scrapper for my kid</li>
    <li> christmas stuffer for my boys....nothing is better than a fresh breath ;)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tongue cleaners I have ever used. This product actually gets rid of the gross stuff on your tongue. The bristles lifts the junk out of your tongue while the scraper removes it. Every time I use it I can see the junk that is getting rid off on the brush. The only warning I would give people is that it tickles a little when you first use it. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this tongue cleaner, I have always had to deal with the terrible taste in my throat when I wake up or eat something slightly unsavory. However, ever since the Orabrush, I just scrub my tongue with this and BAM nasty feelings in my throat and mouth are gone. Be sure to wet your tongue with water before you use it and make sure you don&#x27;t go too deep, otherwise it might make you gag.</li>
    <li> i never knew how dirty my tongue was till tried orabrush. the stuff i scraped out the first time i used this was not at all ok. it&#x27;s now part of my twice a day oral hygiene routine,my mouth is far cleaner now, and i never have breath issues, or general yucky mouthness. also my husband whom has deadly bad breath is using the orabrush too and now he is always kissable.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner, works great, awesome price. Would buy again if needed. I do miss the old design, I feel it worked a bit better, but this ones do the job as well.</li>
    <li> For 4 months worth of supply in 4 brushes for 12 dollars is not a bad deal. Shipping was prompt with 2 day shipping and item works well. It has been falsely advertised on youtube with the people on it implying usage of this item causes drastic change in feeling, but you can definitely tell the tongue is cleaner. You do not have a weird after taste of food after using it.</li>
    <li> I tried it but had to return it.  I use a simple tongue cleaner and it has worked perfect. Thought this will be better but it is just bad.  The design is poor and it hardly scraps...just spreads it around.</li>
    <li> no need really, just brush tongue with toothbrush when brushing  ?</li>
    <li> have had a simple tongue scraper for years which eliminates 80% of bad breath no doubt. Recently wanted to buy more to keep in my offices, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried these out and I&#x27;ll say they work BETTER than the scraper alone, if only because the brush gets in between the tongue papillae a smidgeon better than scraper alone.</li>
    <li> I do like these, but I am not in love with them.  They do make my tongue feel and look cleaner, but I will probably try a different kind next time.</li>
    <li> I dont know about everyone else but I hate trying to brush off my tongue with my toothbrush and most of the stuff there does not come off. That in mind I picked up a four pack of these for my wife and I and found that they work wonderfully. I use them as instructed but also find it helps right after using mouthwash and it seems to clean my tongue right off. I do know that sometimes it takes more than one run of the Orabrush but it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of tongue cleaner/scraper out there and they are helpful, but this puppy works best for me.  I found in the past that brushing my tongue with my toothbrush does little good and scrapers worked better.  However, after using the Orabrush Tongue Cleaner, I find the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; seem to be the most helpful part of the tongue cleaner.  They are firm, widely spaced semi-rigid rubber/plastic spikes that really get in there and clean the tongue.  I have experimented with my old tongue scraper and the Orabrush Tongue Cleaner by using each at night and really noticing the feeling in my mouth in the morning, and this product makes a noticeable difference.  Using the Orabrush I wake up in the morning with NO, NONE of that morning mouth feeling.  My favorite tongue scraper, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t give the same clean morning breath.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product a few months back and no doubt one of my best purchases.  I am a lifetime user now.  I use to floss, brush teeth, swipe my tongue afew times then out the door, now the tongue brusher is my final step.  I can not believe I went YEARS with this white film still in my mouth causing a smell problem.  just follow direction or video, now my family uses it and I keep one at work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find another product that cleans my tongue so well. Before purchasing this product I usual attempted to brush my tongue with my toothbrush.  The first time I used this I was appalled by all the food particles that came out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to both friends and enemies, because let&#x27;s face it.  When someone has bad breath, everyone loses.</li>
    <li> This cleans your tongue quite well, too well, be careful not to use it too often.</li>
    <li> It works.  Dentist will hate you.</li>
    <li> Fresh breath for HOOOOOOOOOOURS!!!</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one for proper oral hygiene. This product works very well. Dentist recommends but they have a difficult time having patients simply brush their teeth let alone take on this type of hygiene.</li>
    <li> Just use a hard-bristled toothbrush. Waste of money, these don&#x27;t work anywhere as good as they&#x27;re stated.</li>
    <li> haha this works!!!!!! but do not brush too hard!!!! it hurts!!!!! i have this bump on my tongue that looks like a freaking herpes cuz I kept on scrubbing HARDDD&lt;br /&gt;I feel fresh and DEFINITELY more confidence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy this whole pack and use it for urself :)  cuz we are greeeeedy</li>
    <li> usually my breath stinks when i wake up in the morning, but after using the brush at night, i no longer have a stinky breath waking up in the morning!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend and I to use.  Orabrush is supposed to be an excellent brand recommended by dentists.  I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, so I&#x27;ll update review in a few weeks, but the delivery was VERY quick.  I think it got to me in 3 days!  I can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> My family has a problem with bad (worse than usual) breathe. This really takes care of it (and I know b/c I no longer get those discreet &amp;#34;would you like some gum?&amp;#34;-type comments). Use it a few times, and you can see your tongue going from bacteria-ridden white to a clean pink. Heck, use it once and you can see the gunk you&#x27;ve scrapped off on the cleaner. Not painful (unless you scrub too hard). Ordinary tongue-scrappers do not work for me but this one does wonderfully.</li>
    <li> A personal grooming &#x27;must have item&amp;#34;. Like your tooth paste and dental floss it will become part of your routine.</li>
    <li> I have always purchased Dentek tongue cleaners but for some reason retail stores have stopped selling them, I can not even find them on Amazon.  I eventually found the Orabrush tongue cleaners.  I was worried these would not match up to the Dentek ones, boy was I wrong.  The Orabrush tongue cleaners are THE BEST tongue cleaners I have ever used, wow, what a product, I will continue to buy these, amazing!</li>
    <li> So disappointed when I opened the package. This product is actually \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; while they say \\&quot;Origin: USA\\&quot;. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> Orabrush is not a scam. It definitely makes your tongue PINK again and your breath will feel clean. Just watch the YouTube video and do exactly what the people do. It is not a magic wand, so your tongue won&#x27;t be completely clean with just one swipe. It is also gentler than a plane ol&#x27; scraper. I used to use a scraper and it will leave you uncomfortable sometimes.</li>
    <li> First I must say that I was given 1 of these by the company. I promptly bought this package on here because it was so great I wanted to share these with my family. It made my breath smell so much better. Minty fresh. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> even tho, I make sure I wash &amp; smell good before going out  to the store or a dr.s visit, now that I have the Orabrush Tongue cleaner, I feel confident, no odors from coffee or cereal w/ milk. It really does clean the tongue, no running back to brush the teeth again after one more little sip of coffee.. I think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;the best thing, since sliced bread!&amp;#34; If you&#x27;re around my age, you&#x27;ve heard that saying.</li>
    <li> First experience with a tongue cleaner and we&#x27;re pleased.</li>
    <li> The improvements they made are phenomenal.  I love these things.  I will floss, brush, mouthwash then Orabrush and my mouth feels great!</li>
    <li> So simple yet so effective, takes less than a minute to have a defunked tongue ! Do yourself and your lover a favor... get a pack !</li>
    <li> I first bought these when they came out. I saw the videos of how they cleaned the tongue and I was impressed enough to try. Happily, I&#x27;m proud to say they work. They definitely remove a lot of junk from the tongue and help bad breath -- in my experience. Bristles are firm, but soft enough to do a decent cleaning. Better than the back of a toothbrush</li>
    <li> These Orabrush Tongue Cleaners are the best!  I am a smoker and a high coffee drinker.  I use the product three times a day and even my dentist noticed the difference.  I would highly recommend this product.  It also helps in keeping your breath nice and fresh!</li>
    <li> I read how well these worked and was disappointed when I received them. They didn&#x27;t work as advertised. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I used to use a tongue scraper (various kinds) - but it just didn&#x27;t work the same way and get my tongue really clean.  This clearly DOES effect the freshness of your breath.  I&#x27;m rather addicted and frankly it motivates me more to take better care of my teeth overall. I definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10/13  Update -- Two months later I&#x27;m still a happy camper.  I find it takes a few goes to loosen the film on my tongue and several brushes and spits to clean it well - but it absolutely works!  I think perhaps people who don&#x27;t find that it works perhaps aren&#x27;t being patient/thorough enough.  I still think it is a large factor in taking better care overall of my mouth and teeth, I&#x27;ve been recommending this product to friends.  I used to be concerned even right after regular brushing that my breath wasn&#x27;t very fresh and I was an avid mint gum chewer as a result.  Now I chew hardly any gum at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to stock up on more in case they ever stop making this product!!</li>
    <li> My favorite tongue brush cleaner!! And in a 4-pack so you can give them to your family and friends so everyone&#x27;s tongues can be clean!</li>
    <li> It cleans some gunk of your tongue but not all of it. I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! Keeps my breath fresh! It is crazy to see the food/beverage remnants that sit on your tongue after you brush. Eww!</li>
    <li> Some reviewers mentioned these are different than the original, but the pack I received was the same as the ones I had ordered from the Orabrush site. I love these- they help to decrease bad breath and make my mouth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush is amazing! If you really get it I would think about getting the one for 8.99 that come with the mint foam. This is a great product! I would get again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid tongue-brusher for years. It keeps my breath fresher, it helps keep my teeth clean longer between brushings and between teeth cleanings. But for up until recently, I&#x27;ve used the tongue brush by Dr. Tung. It&#x27;s sturdier and the bristles are shorter and firmer. The Tung brush gets the job done with very little effort. The before-after is dramatic. Now when this Orabrush version came out, I gave it a try--it looks zippier and cooler than the Tung brush. And the bristles are longer and sparser. Well, the Oragel brush does not get it done for me. I have to brush and brush and brush and still I am left with a white residue. I&#x27;m zipping right over to order a replacement Tung brush because I know from years of use that it works well and easily. Why mess with what works? Honestly, I don&#x27;t care two hoots what it looks like. I want my fresh breath back!</li>
    <li> They work just like they say they will, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s exactly the same thing as using your toothbrush to brush your tongue.  So they&#x27;re kind of unnecessary.</li>
    <li> most people don&#x27;t realize that halitosis comes from bacteria on the back of your tongue not only your teeth. i love brushing my tongue with the brush and special orabrush foam cleanser that balances the ph level of your mouth. highly recommend this and get the cleaner too it leaves your mouth tingly clean!</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner really does work well. My problem is that it does make me gag. But when I am able to go over enough of my tongue with the little brush, I know it makes a positive difference giving me better breath because it has cleaned stuff from my tongue.</li>
    <li> I love this tongue scraper, Each one can last you 6 months before you have to switch to a new one. The price is reasonable and will buy again when I need one,</li>
    <li> Supposed to clean tongue.  does not feel any cleaner with using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this 4-count pack after seeing so much hype about this product on youtube. Not too impressed. I found that it isn&#x27;t any better than using a stiff firm toothbrush on my tongue, which I had been doing prior to buying the Orabrush. Use your regular toothbrush, people. Or go and buy a stiff toothbrush for cheap at a drugstore, it will do the same for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Been using this for well over 3 years and no complains</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had never cleaned my tongue before &amp; these work very well. I just scrub all of the gunk off my tongue, not too hard though &amp; I can&#x27;t get all the way back otherwise it triggers my gag reflex. But these tongue brushes do get most of the gunk off, it&#x27;s cleaner than it was before I started using this brush. I can replace these every 3-4 months, the same for toothbrushes, so they will probably last me for about a year total before I have to order them again.</li>
    <li> It takes some gettign used too, but if you eat smelly food, smoke the occasional cigar or just hate bad breath, this product is a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out and at first had some difficulty with gaging.  After a few weeks I have no problem and adding this to my teeth brushing has not added any real time.&lt;br /&gt;I use it before going to bed and never wake up with morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product that I wish I had 20 years ago,</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no point in buying this product. You can just use your toothbrush and brush your tongue with that.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought was better, dont know why this one isnt cleaning as good as the first one. Started using steel tongue scrapper.</li>
    <li> I got this at a local store. Tooth brush is a better option than this one as it serves no better than a tooth brush. Save your money and DONT get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant help but wonder if these 5 star reviews are phony. All of them have one line praising this product. Its a terrible product.</li>
    <li> These are great! We bought them as stocking stuffers  for our kids. They all said they had fresher breath after using this regularly.</li>
    <li> Kind of a useless product in my opinion.  I favor using a regular brush and a more rigid style tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> The product does everything they said it world. Follow the knstructions and you will get results. At first I was skeptical. However after scraping the white yuck off my tongue I was awed. You don&#x27;t even realize the build up is there but after you see how pink it makes your tongue you are hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down part is there are three people in my family that use it so when I buy a 4pack I am automatically down to 1. It could also be cheaper. They raised the price a dollar plus since I last bought a pack.</li>
    <li> Yuk, yuk &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; try it ... you&#x27;ll like it.  WE&#x27;VE all been needing this for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve own a Orabrush tongue cleaner even since 2009. I recently ordered new ones and the newer ones don&#x27;t work as well as the old ones right out of the package. There&#x27;s a way to make it work a lot better. The newer ones have wispier ends and while it feels soft on your finger, it doesn&#x27;t do anything on your tongue. What I did was I clipped the tiniest amounts off the wisps and it feels rougher but that&#x27;s what gets everything off your tongue. You&#x27;ll see it on the orabrush instead of it barely getting anything. If you don&#x27;t do this, the orabrush isn&#x27;t going to work very well or if at all. I find it much more effective than a toothbrush. It works very well with this little hack.</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my tongue, the bristles are too smooth and just glide over it. After a few uses and my tongue still covered white I went back to standard brush for my tongue which does a good job, just that it&#x27;s bigger than these things and gags me.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be grossed out, but you will feel SUPER clean when you use the Orabrush Tongue Cleaner after brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure it improves my breath, but I am sure it doesn&#x27;t scrape anything off my tongue.  There isn&#x27;t any debris on the brush and my tongue looks exactly the same before and after.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner are the best, I try other product that are cheaper that I bought from the store and it was messy. Nothing like a clean tongue. ^_^</li>
    <li> This is definitely not a staple... if you want to try it out get it.. It&#x27;s pretty cool.  It actually works.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, very simple to use, cheap and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have some serious breathe problems, I don&#x27;t see a must have need for this.  If your conscious about your breath, get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These things work and I tried the ones for my dog and we could not believe the difference. Our dog has some of the worst breath we&#x27;d ever been around and since he&#x27;s used this brush and the liquid that came with it he has normal breath.  We had tried everything before but this product is amazing and when we ordered them for our dogs we got 2 for human use and they work..amazing tool where if you use it all the time you do wake up in the morning with breath that isn&#x27;t hostile to others.  Tongues can hold an amazing amount of bacteria and that is what causes the bad breath and tooth decay...the tongue spreads it around the mouth.  Use this tool for a week and be ready to see and smell some drastic changes...you might even get that date that has been so elusive before.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using a tongue &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34; for many years.  It always does a great job and I feel much cleaner after using the scraper than with the Orabrush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this picks up as much as it should you really have to scrub a while to get anything out of it.</li>
    <li> At least for me, I could not get my tongue cleaned with this cleaner. The simple tongue cleaners without bristles clean much, much better than this one. This was like a light massage of tongue, the white layer over the tongue did not come out even the slightest bit.</li>
    <li> gentile and effective. Have tried many different cleaners, these are by far the best. Leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I am actually very fond of this tongue brush. I can definitely feel the difference in my mouth! The only problem I have is that sometimes it seems as if this tongue brush is just pushing germs around. I would highly recommend the tongue foam to go along with the brush.</li>
    <li> The TUNG Gel and Orabrush Tongue Cleaner are the real deal. I am very pleased with the outcome of these two products working together. The cleaner does exactly what my toothbrush was not able to do---clean my tongue of the food leftovers that remain. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I have use these tongue cleaners for years. I decided to purchase in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; to use as stocking stuffers. It&#x27;s a weird little gift, but once you start to use these, you will find that your mouth feels much cleaner and you breath stays fresher longer!</li>
    <li> This product i just love, it works fantastic, it really removes that white bacteria on your tongue; no more cotton mouth. And it makes your mouth feel clean and fresh and no bad breath!</li>
    <li> After reading the caption world&#x27;s best tongue cleaner I thought I would give this a try.  I was disappointed.  I feel that it does not scrape off enough bacteria.  I have used regular plastic scrapers for years with better results.  To me, it seems way too soft to do a job that takes off enough bacteria.  It&#x27;s also large and awkward which made it harder to aim the way I wanted it to go.  I see that it has a 4 star rating and I see that as &amp;#34;like what&amp;#34;?  Sorry, just would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it every morning and night and it works perfectly. After brushing my teeth and using mouthwash, some tongue brushing with this leaves my mouth feeling so clean. I don&#x27;t even think about my breath all day. Life saver. Even after a nap or if it&#x27;s late in the day, you can gargle some mouthwash and use the Orabrush and your breath is perfect again. Everyone should use one.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these in a single pack from Walmart and so far i&#x27;m very happy with it. With each use it gets easier and easier to use ! My mouth felt so much better after using this and I couldn&#x27;t believe the stuff it removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather ridged and it takes some time getting used to. I feel the design should probably be like the original design mentioned in a few other reviews and it&#x27;s not perfect which is why I only gave it four stars but it serves its purpose and makes me feel happy and healthier.</li>
    <li> this thing really works.. i bought the four pack for my sister, mom, dad and we all notice a difference. you feel that fresh clean feeling for way longer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these things.  I have used so many different tongue scrapers and I find these work the best for me.  They loosen up everything on the tongue and scrape it all off effortlessly.  I feel my mouth is much cleaner, and my tongue is a brilliant pink.  I bought 2 the first go round but this time I bought 4 so I&#x27;d have replacements.</li>
    <li> What a clean tongue? This is a tooth brush for your tongue! A little more roundness and it works be perfect!</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of these tong scrappers, i stoped for a while and my tong felt very rough and dirty.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband as he has started to scrape his tongue.  He as using a different type of scraper so this one has taken him a bit longer to get use to.  He seems to like this one now.</li>
    <li> These plastic brushes do not fit or conform to your tongue. I tried them a few times and threw them away. The unopened ones were not even worth to be donated.</li>
    <li> I am glad I had found this brush. It has helped with my breath alot. It is sturdy and does an excellent job. I would recommend it to a friend if asked.</li>
    <li> Made an impulsive purchase after watching a youtube video. Im glad I did, this product works. You can actually see the bad breathe on the Orabrush. A++++++</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work.  i liked the oval ones better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handle of tongue scrappers, plastic, metal, and recycled yogurt cups. These ones really work for me.  The bristles are very soft on my tongue and the tip which is harder works good to gather everything. I find a few brushes back and forth very lightly and then one slightly harder one to the tip of the tongue works best for me. That is for me though!</li>
    <li> Very nice deal. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Gentle brush, perfect tongue cleaning!</li>
    <li> Product worked well for my dog.</li>
    <li> Clean your mouths people. You smell bad.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective at removing gunk from your tongue. I have GERD which causes my tongue to get coated yellow upon waking up in the morning. This is very disgusting and I have tried brushing my tongue with a toothbrush but the yellow doesn&#x27;t go away. I saw an ad for this product and decided to try it out. It&#x27;s been great at keep my tongue coat free. It is nice and pink now after using this product for 2 weeks. I brush my tongue every morning with this. It felt a bit strange at the beginning because it brushes pretty deeply but it did not hurt. It was more of a gag reflex from having something close to the back of your mouth. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a coated tongue.</li>
    <li> I went a few months without an Orabrush and never felt like my mouth was as clean as it should be after brushing.  These tools are incredible and the redesign on this model vs the original model makes a great tool even better.  The new version is easy to rinse and seems to clean my tongue better.  Give these a try.  I promise you will wonder how you ever brushed your teeth without one before.</li>
    <li> I love these; however, I&#x27;m concerned about bacteria growing.  I haven&#x27;t seen any information about cleaning, but feel this is very important.</li>
    <li> Great price and love the outcome! The work just as advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to point out that I&#x27;ve been using Orabrush for about a year and a half. I&#x27;ve never had the scraper on previous brushes until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the Orabrush, I&#x27;ve had terrible breath and it took toll on my awkwardness in middle and early high school. i stumbled upon their humorous video that was featured on YouTube and decided to research on it a little but more. I ended up loving how the company started and the quirkiness of their independence from Proctor and Gamble and how an adorable old fellow with an idea is changing the world of halitosis. Really, the company was offering free shipping to try their Orabrush, so I tried it. I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED BUYING THIS PRODUCT. It just simply works. That&#x27;s all. I&#x27;m not too big on their tongue foam, but I must recommend through Word of Mouth and through this review that it&#x27;s an awesome investment. The price is doable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get this for you, someone you care about and a skeptic. Your toothbrush/mouthwash won&#x27;t do what this will do for you.</li>
    <li> I used to brush my tongue with the same tooth brush, but it is been only one day using this tongue cleaner and wow, what a difference, I totally like how my mouth feels now, it is like more fresh, the tooth paste flavor stays in my mouth longer and in general I am totally happy with the purchase. I sure do recommended.</li>
    <li> I hate smiling or sticking my tongue out because it always seems to be covered with this &#x27;white film&#x27; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very attractive at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things, simple as they are, really work to remove that!&lt;br /&gt;I now have a nice red/pink tongue that I&#x27;m proud to stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And actually i&#x27;ve used them in the morning right as I wake up and it helps get rid of the morning breath too.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Orabrush and I actually do notice a difference with my breath when using this everyday. In the start your tongue may bleed but that is expected as your tongue is not used to something rubbing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone and will continue to buy their products.</li>
    <li> Using the tongue brushes definitely makes the mouth at least feel cleaner. I recommend this for anyone who is a cleanliness freak like me.</li>
    <li> Why is it so hard to find tongue cleaners now a days? I love these ones since they&#x27;re not super abrasive yet still get the job done.</li>
    <li> This was so soft and very adorable! I loved it! It was for my future sister in law who is having a baby next month. Perfect because she lives on a farm :)</li>
    <li> It works really well and cleans really well. its soft and isnt too rough. Happy i got it.</li>
    <li> I originally saw the commercials for these on youtube. They work well. Just be careful to not scrape your tongue too hard or you&#x27;ll cut your taste buds. It works well though and you&#x27;ll have noticeably cleaner breath. Not fresh or minty. Just.. not gross and smelly. No smell. There.</li>
    <li> Those tongue cleaners are awesome. I got one for free when they came out and I bought more and more.&lt;br /&gt;The fact they have a little scraper at the end of it makes all the difference. A toothbrush doesn&#x27;t offer you this functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are really efficient and last long if you keep them in good condition.</li>
    <li> The Orabrush tongue cleaner exceeded my expectation. It does scrap/brush most of the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; from my tongue, but not all.  I would like to see a firmer scraper on the opposite end or backside to further removal stuff on the tongue.  This is still a very good product.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner has nothing special about it. The packaging is soooooo freaking hard to open it. They could just packed like toothbrush that easy to open. I&#x27;m not going to buy the brand again.</li>
    <li> It really works! Great for getting a bad taste out of your mouth or just simply cleaning your tongue. I bought this pack for my whole family!</li>
    <li> Disgusting but awesome, haha!</li>
    <li> I have been using one of these for several months now and notice a big improvement on bad breath.  I don&#x27;t even use mouth wash any more.  I brush a couple of times a day or more and floss at least once a day and use this tongue cleaner a couple of times a day and it has mead a great difference.  I am a fan!</li>
    <li> Or is it!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there are different qualities of the Orabrush products! The first one I bought was a single pkg at the grocery store. It was really nice and soft bristled, the brush itself was flexible, and the reverse side had a great rubber tongue cleaner blade that was soft and flexible - there was nothing on the product that hurt my mouth! So, I ordered a 4 pk this time from Amazon, and it was not at all like the first product I ordered - the bristles weren&#x27;t as soft, the brush itself was rigid - not flexible, and there was no tongue cleaner blade made of soft rubber on the reverse, but there was a rigid one on the same side. All in all I had to deduct 2 stars for a disappointing performance and my own disappointment in getting a different product despite the same packaging.</li>
    <li> It does not really feel like it cleans my tongue well. I did not even feel like it got into my tongue to scub it clean</li>
    <li> I love Orabrush tongue cleaners! They are a mainstay to my dental hygiene. Once you get used to the &amp;#34;clean tongue feeling,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll never be able to stop using it. I find it especially useful after eating dairy. If you add milk to your coffee or drink a glass of milk at night often, like I do, this is a must have to get that funky coating out your mouth.  The only store I am able to find these at is WalMart (which I avoid at all costs!) and they generally have very few, if any, in stock.  This version of the tongue scraper is the same one I buy in stores. It is slightly different than the ones I bought several years ago, but I attribute that to a manufacturer&#x27;s change. I received one each of pink, green, blue and black in my pack.</li>
    <li> A significant improvement over the usual tongue scraper and other tools.The proof you can literally see and smell. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I bought these to clean my tongue, but after using them a couple times I reverted back to my toothbrush.  Just use a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> i really like these. I remember when i first bought it in a walmart i had to make this a part of my official oral hygiene tools.lol&lt;br /&gt;However, one day my younger brother came into my room and i never found it again -.- Until i came on here and was so happy to be reunited with it. I feel this product does help and i would recommend it to anyone else! :]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I never used these in the past. Bought a pack for my roommate and was instantly hooked when I tried one out.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes. Are hands down the best at really cleaning tongue. This 4-pack is very economical, too. Can&#x27;t imagine these will ever wear out like a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love these things and I don&#x27;t understand how anybody goes without a good tongue-brush.  The new ones combine the brush with a tongue-scraper which is even better.  I get them for everyone in my family and I always have a spare for travel.</li>
    <li> buy it clean your tongue have better breath</li>
    <li> For me personally the product did not work as expected. When I tried using it, it barely worked. It got only a small bit of the bacteria but don&#x27;t a lot. I have gave this to my relatives to try out and they got the same results. And I have a large amount of bacteria on my tongue so you would expect it to work but for me it didn&#x27;t. I even tried putting large amount of pressure but that ended up messing my tongue as if I was eating sour hard candy, so it ripped my tongue&#x27;s skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture was kinda rough. when I was applying pressure onto it to ripped my tongue&#x27;s skin a bit. The scrapper&#x27;s edges was curved and wasn&#x27;t pleasant on the tongue when moving it back and forth in my mouth. It was also kinda large so my jaw had to open wide and so it hurt my jaw a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help freshen breath.  Seems to pull plaque off the tongue.  Works, but a little disconcerting as far as how to clean it.  We just use water and some tooth paste but we may need to boil it - I would think.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend is obsessed with these</li>
    <li> I love this tongue cleaner.  It is great to have one around.  It really cleans all the white stuff (germs) from your tounge.  Initially, I was reluctant to buy it because I had been using the electronic brush to brush my teeth, and the manual one to brush my tongue.  But I was never able to remove all the germs on my tongue until I got this tongue cleaner.  I would high recommend this to people who want to clean their tongues.</li>
    <li> A must have for fresh breath!</li>
    <li> I purchased individually packaged Orabrushes several months ago and loved them.  So I went back to Amazon to get the 4 pack.  When they arrived, I noticed the design was very different than the first brushes I had purchased.  The new ones are smaller.  They have a different shape.  And worst of all, the scraper is so much smaller and sits lower than the bristles so the bristles interfere with the scraper when trying to scrape the tongue!  This new design does not work well and had I gotten this one first I would have never ordered another.  I will be returning these and be on the lookout for some of the original design if there are any still to be found.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the Orabrush for dogs, however, decided to use the product instead of returning and find that I like it and am satisfied with it and the results from using it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence, don&#x27;t be. This are inexpensive and actually work. They are not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for bad breath. You have to make a conscious effort to have better oral hygiene and all that other stuff to rid yourself of that malady. However these greatly improve breath when used consistently and combined with said conscious effort they really work. They&#x27;re easy, painless and beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars because they do what they say they will and are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Works Great!  Love it</li>
    <li> I love these tongue scrapers, and my local winco has long since stopped carrying these. I find when I use these, my breath stays fresher, longer! You get 4 individually packaged scrapers, all for cheap here. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great for keeping your breath fresh</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my mouth feel so clean!</li>
    <li> Some other reviewers point to the stiffness of the brushes, but this has not been the case for me. The brushes are soft, I am gentle on my tongue when I use them (I mean, not _super_ gentle, just normal-I-like-myself gentle) and they work to get the gunk out of my mouth. Seriously, what am I eating that it just plants itself on my tongue? Maybe that&#x27;s too much info for you, but we can still bond over the interwebs in the fact that you will be tongue gunk-free like me when your brushes arrive.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are both using these now- they&#x27;re really easy to use, and they do seem to work.  We use it before bed, and in the morning we both have better smelling breath then before, even if it&#x27;s been a &amp;#34;garlic&amp;#34; night.</li>
    <li> Really help for what its purpose was, it arrived on time and was really easy to open and to use for a first timer.</li>
    <li> In short, my tongue cleaning regime seems to be having the effect it was supposed to, so if anyone is trying out new ways to manage their breath, give this product + the Orabrush tongue foam a try.  Note: Each cleaner actually lasts a pretty long time, so a pack of four could last one person at least a year.</li>
    <li> I stopped using this product after a few times because I don&#x27;t find it as effective as advertised.  And, I still continue to get the gag reflex each time I use it.</li>
    <li> As always I am loving it!</li>
    <li> I feel bad for people who don&#x27;t know about this product, their mouths must be really gross.  Seriously, your toothbrush sucks for cleaning your tongue, do everyone a favor and buy this for yourself and others.</li>
    <li> Only change I&#x27;d make is to make them a little larger -- though I suppose that could gag many people. My prevously spotty white tongue is now pretty and pink. And my breath is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: my partner is an OT, and she uses them to gently desensitize scar tissue on patients.</li>
    <li> I used it and noticed results immediately.  It does work, but, like with anything, you have to be consistent.  If you stick with it, this tongue cleaner can serve as a beneficiary part to your oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste any money on this. Just use the plain old toothbrush, and it will do a much better job. I am starting to wonder if the reviews on the internet is completely forged and all the negative reviews have been deleted. What a waste!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these brushes! They are much better than a regular toothbrush because they are wide with short bristles that clean my tongue perfectly.</li>
