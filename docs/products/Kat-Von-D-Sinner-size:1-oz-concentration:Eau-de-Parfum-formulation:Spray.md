### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so it&#x27;s best not to spray as you&#x27;re walking out the door.</li>
      <li>Sinner, however, smelled awesome with my skin chemistry.</li>
      <li>Smelly awesome happiness</li>
      <li>I believe it would have been a great addition to my collection.</li>
      <li>This is a great scent.</li>
      <li>Sinner is great</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and my girlfriend loves it!</li>
      <li>Plus, the packaging is really gorgeous.</li>
      <li>So that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>It smells too good to ever get overpowering</li>
      <li>one fabulous point in this perfumes favor though is the absolutely beautiful packaging!</li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Its sexual, alluring and provocative all at once!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this sent!</li>
      <li>This scent is truely amazing.</li>
      <li>I LIKED IT.</li>
      <li>I liked Saint, but it didn&#x27;t quite smell as nice on me.</li>
      <li>Kat&#x27;s signature silver rose pastern make for a nice touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>and I own 20</li>
      <li>After a while, it seems like the scent fades, but many times at the end of the day, even without reapplying all day, my husband comments on how nice I smell.</li>
      <li>Still love though.</li>
      <li>And this is one of my favorite scents for evening.</li>
      <li>However, with the slim shape and well designed top, it is one that you can toss in your bag if you wish to do so, without worry.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more of a winter scent in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Love the perfume didn&#x27;t like that I couldn&#x27;t see the level somewhere on the bottle</li>
      <li>I love warmer perfumes like this.</li>
      <li>Wish Kat didn&#x27;t discontinue because I love saint so much better.</li>
      <li>I love the design of the spray.</li>
      <li>I wish I could find saint that one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance</li>
      <li>I read what was in it and thought it has to be good and man was I right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unique and not overpowering like some perfumes can be.</li>
      <li>The bottle is very unique and the carrier replied to my email instantaneously and refunded this item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect all year long.</li>
      <li>I had gone with Saint seeing as how these are both fabulous scents.</li>
      <li>But this is by no means any fault of the seller and I will buy again if any are still available.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous filigree and super classy design.</li>
      <li>First of all I love Kat Von D.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Anyway, I love the convenience of the rollerball, just slip it into my purse and ready to apply or reapply at any time of the day.</li>
      <li>This is described as a purse spray, but it is a full sized 1 oz perfume.</li>
      <li>so all I can really say is: When I put this on I feel like a sexy beast, baby.</li>
      <li>It is very highly recommended.. GET IT!!</li>
      <li>Glad I got one of the last ones available.</li>
      <li>PERSONALLY THAT I GOT HER A NICE PARFUM CALLED &amp;#34;SINNER&amp;#34</li>
      <li>After much deliberation I decided to buy the roller ball instead of the bottle and that turned out to be a wise decision since I have to constantly reapply this where ever I go.</li>
      <li>My wife loves it as well as the \\&quot;Saint\\&quot; version, although \\&quot;Sinner\\&quot; certainly fits her personality and moods quite a bit better, she goes through about 1 bottle of Sinner every 5-6 months, and the Saint lasts nearly a year.</li>
      <li>And not expensive.</li>
      <li>If Sinner ever get&#x27;s re-blended I&#x27;ll be the first one in line to buy it</li>
      <li>The product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This bottle looked like a much higher quality one in the photo.</li>
      <li>Sinner is a deep, spicy floral that has a very unique intensity to it.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m still loving this purchase for two reasons: this is a spray (atomizer) which I prefer to rollerball and other bottle styles.</li>
      <li>and usually they&#x27;re the first to say anything if I smell good that day.</li>
      <li>I was so excited about finally buying my first perfume from Kat&#x27;s line</li>
      <li>Like a teenage girl in her first romance I tried to desperately fling myself at this scent over and over again, hoping that somehow it would magically give its self a shake and start to love me back by sticking to me and giving me a great smell all day.</li>
      <li>But so many of them involve rose or patchouli, I get bored.</li>
      <li>We both really like it, and I just can&#x27;t be without out.</li>
      <li>I gave Saint to a friend, smells much nicer on her.</li>
      <li>I HOPE MY SON&#x27;S GIRLFRIEND APPRECIATED</li>
      <li>BUT LIKE I SAID I NEVER GOT SO MUCH AS</li>
      <li>This item is not boxed it leaked in the packaging and from what I could tell it was much stronger than \\&quot;Saint\\&quot;, but it was also in abundance.</li>
      <li>Kind of a waste.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t want her to lose her favorite scent, and I don&#x27;t want her to lose her naughty side.</li>
      <li>I actually think it smells better in this bottle than the larger bottle.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Brand new.</li>
      <li>The glass the roller ball came in was stained with a lovely bloody burgundy color that faded away to reveal a surprisingly demure clear tip.</li>
      <li>AS I GAVE IT TO HER FOR CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR, BUT NEVER HEARD SO MUCH AS</li>
      <li>This reminds me of an old lady perfume and it doesnt spray a mist</li>
      <li>This is one of the few perfumes I can actually stand and happen to love it.</li>
      <li>I like it because it isn&#x27;t too overbearing, if anything i would like it to be a little stronger and last longer, but overall this is my favorite fragrance</li>
      <li>At first I thought it might just not be my nose picking it up after the dry down since the wet stage is so intense</li>

<li> it has relatively little staying power.</li>
<li> However the spraying mechanism is a lil off and not great for a mist effect</li>
<li> Sadly this isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>

    <li> I LIKED IT. I HOPE MY SON&#x27;S GIRLFRIEND APPRECIATED IT AS I GAVE IT TO HER FOR CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR, BUT NEVER HEARD SO MUCH AS A THANK YOU. I DIDNT WANT TO READ INTO ANYTHING BUT I WONDERED IF SHE TOOK IT PERSONALLY THAT I GOT HER A NICE PARFUM CALLED &amp;#34;SINNER&amp;#34; WHILE SHE&#x27;S SHACKING UP WITH MY SON? NOT THAT I CARE, BUT LIKE I SAID I NEVER GOT SO MUCH AS A THANK YOU. MY FEELING WAS; ITS THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; styled bottles are now retired. They house the same amount of fragrance that the newer (and much more plain and boring) bottles do. This is described as a purse spray, but it is a full sized 1 oz perfume. However, with the slim shape and well designed top, it is one that you can toss in your bag if you wish to do so, without worry. Gorgeous filigree and super classy design.</li>
    <li> This scent is truely amazing. I bought without even smelling it. I read what was in it and thought it has to be good and man was I right. Its sexual, alluring and provocative all at once! It is very highly recommended.. GET IT!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few perfumes I can actually stand and happen to love it. It smells too good to ever get overpowering and I can put on the smallest amount and still smell it by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Smelly awesome happiness</li>
    <li> I am no perfume expert. I haven&#x27;t worn perfume of any sort in years and years... so all I can really say is: When I put this on I feel like a sexy beast, baby.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about finally buying my first perfume from Kat&#x27;s line and I wish now with all my heart I had gone with Saint seeing as how these are both fabulous scents. Sinner is a deep, spicy floral that has a very unique intensity to it. It should be just your average floral but it&#x27;s not. Theres a lot of heart in this and it definitely shows that someone paid attention to their formulation. However for all it&#x27;s gorgeousness it has relatively little staying power. After much deliberation I decided to buy the roller ball instead of the bottle and that turned out to be a wise decision since I have to constantly reapply this where ever I go. At first I thought it might just not be my nose picking it up after the dry down since the wet stage is so intense but I got zero comments from people at work and usually they&#x27;re the first to say anything if I smell good that day. What a bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one fabulous point in this perfumes favor though is the absolutely beautiful packaging! The glass the roller ball came in was stained with a lovely bloody burgundy color that faded away to reveal a surprisingly demure clear tip. Kat&#x27;s signature silver rose pastern make for a nice touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all Sinner is a perfume I wanted to love so badly. Like a teenage girl in her first romance I tried to desperately fling myself at this scent over and over again, hoping that somehow it would magically give its self a shake and start to love me back by sticking to me and giving me a great smell all day. Sadly this isn&#x27;t going to happen. If Sinner ever get&#x27;s re-blended I&#x27;ll be the first one in line to buy it but until that happens I&#x27;m going to save up my pennies and go back and buy Saint.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame this has been dicontinued. My wife loves it as well as the \\&quot;Saint\\&quot; version, although \\&quot;Sinner\\&quot; certainly fits her personality and moods quite a bit better, she goes through about 1 bottle of Sinner every 5-6 months, and the Saint lasts nearly a year. Although discontinued, you can still find some in stock if you do some searching. I have bought a couple of extra bottles to have as she runs out, I don&#x27;t want her to lose her favorite scent, and I don&#x27;t want her to lose her naughty side.</li>
    <li> Meant to order KVD Saint! This reminds me of an old lady perfume and it doesnt spray a mist it squirts a stream at you!!</li>
    <li> I had bought a rollerball set of Saint and Sinner as I could not find this anywhere to sample in person. I liked Saint, but it didn&#x27;t quite smell as nice on me. Sinner, however, smelled awesome with my skin chemistry. I gave Saint to a friend, smells much nicer on her. Anyway, I love the convenience of the rollerball, just slip it into my purse and ready to apply or reapply at any time of the day. After a while, it seems like the scent fades, but many times at the end of the day, even without reapplying all day, my husband comments on how nice I smell. We both really like it, and I just can&#x27;t be without out. Plus, the packaging is really gorgeous. It&#x27;s edgy and classy at the same time. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance but I have to admit I thought I was ordering saint not sinner. I wish I could find saint that one is my favorite. It&#x27;s perfect all year long. Wish Kat didn&#x27;t discontinue because I love saint so much better. Sinner is great but it&#x27;s more of a winter scent in my opinion. Still love though.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and my girlfriend loves it! I highly recommend this. It&#x27;s very unique and not overpowering like some perfumes can be.</li>
    <li> I love the design of the spray. I actually think it smells better in this bottle than the larger bottle. This is my second time purchasing this spray.</li>
    <li> No longer manufacture.  Glad I got one of the last ones available.</li>
    <li> First of all I love Kat Von D. I wear her makeup daily, so I knew i needed to get her perfume. I LOVE this sent! I like it because it isn&#x27;t too overbearing, if anything i would like it to be a little stronger and last longer, but overall this is my favorite fragrance and I own 20+. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Love the perfume didn&#x27;t like that I couldn&#x27;t see the level somewhere on the bottle</li>
    <li> The only problem is the case, when you bring it through the airport they will break it &amp; it is not refillable, so when it ran out I had to toss it.  Kind of a waste.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I wanted. Brand new. However the spraying mechanism is a lil off and not great for a mist effect so it&#x27;s best not to spray as you&#x27;re walking out the door. But this is by no means any fault of the seller and I will buy again if any are still available.</li>
    <li> This item is not boxed it leaked in the packaging and from what I could tell it was much stronger than \\&quot;Saint\\&quot;, but it was also in abundance. Even still it was not an offensive smell I believe it would have been a great addition to my collection. The bottle is very unique and the carrier replied to my email instantaneously and refunded this item. I rate the service a 4/5 the perfume 4/5 and my experience with the item 1/5. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This bottle looked like a much higher quality one in the photo. It&#x27;s actually quite cheap in reality, and a little clunky, not pleasant to hold. But I&#x27;m still loving this purchase for two reasons: this is a spray (atomizer) which I prefer to rollerball and other bottle styles. So that&#x27;s good. And this is one of my favorite scents for evening. I&#x27;m not a perfume pro, so I may be a little off on the vocab here but to me it smells like blackberry, maybe, with jasmine and wood. I love warmer perfumes like this. But so many of them involve rose or patchouli, I get bored. This is a great scent. And not expensive. Highly recommend.</li>
