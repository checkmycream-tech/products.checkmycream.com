      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>The effect was like I just took the rollers out of my hair--bouncy, shiny, soft, and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I remembered how it had been done the first time and found really good steps from a review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNCMJFPXJRYB/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm  My hair did not fall out.</li>
      <li>The good news with this product, you do not have to used as much sampoo &amp; conditioner.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cool!</li>
      <li>but I saw how easy it was to apply</li>
      <li>This was so easy to use.</li>
      <li>I was on week 5 and it was still fine.  </li>
      <li>Good luck and enjoy your new hair.</li>

      <li>I have stuck with using sodium-chorlide free shampoo.</li>
      <li>People are obviously overall happy with their results.</li>
      <li>The curl holds and looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>I now have smooth shiny wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>if you can&#x27;t make it to a salon this is a great product and delivers the same results.</li>

      <li>And this is coming from a woman who really does not know how to blow dry hair that great!  </li>
      <li>I had my first keratin treatment about a year ago and just love this treatment.  </li>
      <li>But if i flat iron it, it looks nice again!</li>
      <li>my hair isn&#x27;t that super healthy and this is maximum temperature my hot iron heats up to.</li>
      <li>I like the versatility of just air drying/diffusing for looser curls or heat drying for special occasions -</li>
      <li>THis product is absolutely amazing, I have natural curly hair &amp; about 100% frizz.  </li>
      <li>I am Caucasian with curly highlighted blond hair and this treatment helped me have healthy shinny straight hair.</li>

      <li>My hair stays straight and frizz free for months.  </li>
      <li>Highly worth the time and effort.  </li>
      <li>Have fun</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s my take, for what it&#x27;s worth: It is not \\&quot;easy\\&quot; to do yourself, OR on others.</li>
      <li>Highly worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I receive compliments on how shiny, healthy, bouncy, and soft it is.  </li>
      <li>I think dying your hair or perming it is FAR more toxic than this stuff.</li>
      <li>totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I wish i still had some waves left now that wavy hair is so trendy</li>
      <li>also have always used sulfate-free shampoos, and moisturizing conditioners with more natural ingredients/less chemicals.</li>
      <li>but in the end, it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>you use it right</li>
      <li>People are going to do what they do, and hell, if you can&#x27;t afford to have it done at a salon, that&#x27;s that, right?</li>
      <li>if you do it right.  </li>
      <li>The Brazilians have the right formula.</li>
      <li>I would recommend having clips handy to section off area of your hair as you work and make sure you do not do this in a small bathroom.  </li>
      <li>left my hair feeling very healthy and perfectly straight.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions on the back of the bottle, which are very easy to understand.</li>
      <li>the first 3 days of \\&quot;incubation\\&quot; period works fine, as it was super soft and super straight.  </li>
      <li>By the way, her hair looks gorgeous too, although she had less frizz and wave to start off with.</li>
      <li>No matter what I do, it always looks a little frizzy, add rain, humidity, or sweat, forget looking good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was really nervous to use this product. I am the type of person who is sensitive to EVERYTHING, so I really thought, after reading reviews, that this would irritate my skin, my scalp, my nose from \\&quot;fumes\\&quot;, etc. I have long (mid-back) naturally wavy virgin hair. I did this whole process on my own and it took 2 hours. I used the Keratin clarifying shampoo prior and followed the directions on the back of the bottle to a T. I did not like having to wait the alloted 72 hours before washing my hair after the treatment....which was the biggest drawback...but it honestly wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it&#x27;d be. Typically, if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 72 hours, it would be NASTY greasy and driving me nuts. It wasn&#x27;t too bad. I&#x27;m not sure if I attribute that to the three washes prior to the treatment or the Keratin Treatment itself. It was simple to do myself, and I cannot imagine why people would pay the salon $350+ to get it done. It would be even easier if my hair wasn&#x27;t so long. I did experience a little bit of the \\&quot;fumes\\&quot; at one point during the application and another point during the flat-ironing process but it wasn&#x27;t really bad. I had my bathroom window open and when I started to experience the fumes, which was actually quite mild, I just left the room for 1 minute and came back and was fine....totally worth it. I think dying your hair or perming it is FAR more toxic than this stuff. One bottle of the keratin treatment will easily last me 2-3 treatments. My hair feels amazing, is way less frizzy (I wish I did this in the summer!!) and is truly easier to style now. I&#x27;m a believer in this product now, despite my pre-use skepticism. I only wish they would sell the new Express version (wash out in 24 hours, rather than 72) on Amazon as I would buy that one in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Keratin came into light as a treatment for hair recently from Brazil. It is a great treatment if it is done right. Unfortunately this Coppola version is extremely bad for your hair in the long term. Your hair could fall out. irritation and dandruff may develop. besides the effect on smoothing the hair is not that much.  I tried this product. it doesnt work. really bad. my hair is falling out. I would advice against it.  Even if you do this treatment at a salon, it will give you a good hair for a few days but that&#x27;s about it. you will face the scariest consequences (falling hair, dry scalp, itchiness, irritation- that is from this treatment).    The Brazilians have the right formula. Unfortunately this replica was not done right. So my advice is to stay away or go with the brazilian. otherwise you are wasting your money, time and most importantly, HAIR!</li>
    <li> I had this done in a salon first back in January. This lasted for about 3.5 months. I loved my hair! I have Thick hair &amp; unruly curls, so this is that miracle I needed. My hair stays straight when straightened and when styled curly, I don&#x27;t have to put product in, the frizz isn&#x27;t there. I can go out on the weekends, and after coming home, my hair looks awesome still!  I decided the salon was too $$$. I remembered how it had been done the first time and found really good steps from a review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNCMJFPXJRYB/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm  My hair did not fall out. I saw a reivew that said this happened... Don&#x27;t know how, but, I still have all my hair! In fact, I wear my hair down more often now, and before this treatment, my hair used to fall out too much, so this has helped keep my hair.  I have stuck with using sodium-chorlide free shampoo. I use the Coppola shampoo because that&#x27;s what I have left over from the salon. Per the sylist, the shampoo matters what&#x27;s in it, the conditioner, not so much. I think the Coppola shampoo (&amp;conditioner) really makes my scalp extra dry, So I try to use a different, extra moisturizing conditioner. The good news with this product, you do not have to used as much sampoo &amp; conditioner.    Love it ! Love it! Love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have long very wavy/moderately curly hair with out of control frizz. I had read about this keratin treatment and was not about to pay the outrageous price for a salon to do it. So I researched several products and settled on this one. I followed the directions on the back of the bottle, which are very easy to understand. My hair is virgin so I prewashed with a clarifying shampoo three times. When applying the treatment, I did note that my eyes and nose were burning some, but it was not unbearable. I recommend using the product in a well-ventilated area though. As instructed, I left the product in for 72hours without washing my hair, which was the hardest part. My hair was so greasy by the last day, but I kept straightening it anytime a wave would appear (especially every morning when I woke up). Of note, I did buy a straightening iron specifically for this, since the one I had didn&#x27;t go up to the required 450degrees. Anyways, I washed it out yesterday (used Coppola keratin shampoo/conditioner) and just blow dried my hair using my fingers only (no brush). I am AMAZED at the results. My hair was straight, but had body, and NO FRIZZ AT ALL!!!! Considering it usually would take me 45min to blow dry then straighten my hair, this is an absolute fabulous product. My hair, which was always a frizzy mess, looks so phenomenal; it looks like the Pantene commercials! I cannot rave about this product enough, and I was skeptical since I had tried many \\&quot;smoothing serums\\&quot; and shampoos in the past with no real effect. My sister and I both did our hair and used the 8 oz bottle. Her hair is down to her mid-back and mine is a little below the shoulders and really thick; we used 2/3 of the bottle so I still have another treatment left. By the way, her hair looks gorgeous too, although she had less frizz and wave to start off with. However she still can&#x27;t stop talking about hoe she doesn&#x27;t need to waste time straightening her hair anymore!</li>
    <li> I can just wash my hair and go now for the first time in my life!! I had wavy long hair that looked very frizzy/dry if i didnt flat iron. The only negatives i have are that 1) seemed to lighten my (colored) hair color a bit and 2) my hair is on flat side now. I wish i still had some waves left now that wavy hair is so trendy but this is not a big deal bc i can just add waves when i want w a curling iron.     Overall i def recommend if u have to use flat iron to fight frizz. I get ready every day now in a fraction of the time it used to take.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and you will get amazing results.  Worth every penny.  This product is to die for!  I wish I had discovered this in my 20s!  I have very curly, black, spanish hair and this treatment has made the most incredible difference I have ever seen in my hair.  I receive compliments on how shiny, healthy, bouncy, and soft it is.  My hair withstands humidity, rain, and even toss/turn at night in my sleep.  I will continue to buy this product as long as it exists.  Highly recommended.  Highly worth the time and effort.  Highly worth the money.  And this is coming from a woman who really does not know how to blow dry hair that great!  The time it took to blow dry my hair was cut in half.  The effect was like I just took the rollers out of my hair--bouncy, shiny, soft, and beautiful.  I did use the shampoo/conditioner from the same line as well as the keratin repair and thermo shine.  I also dye my hair due to grays and I cannot believe how this makes the color shine, last, and natural.  A must try!  And trust me, I never review anything from amazon, but I just can&#x27;t believe the efficiency and wonder of this product.</li>
    <li> This is great to take all the frizz out of your hair &amp; leave it silky. After your done coconut oil or Moroccan oil is the bomb to condition! Have fun girls it&#x27;s easy to use as long s you use it right :) My daughter &amp; I both use it do our own hair, save money &amp; love it!</li>
    <li> I am a professional, however in my area, I have been unable to locate a distributor for this product, so I am grateful to buy it here.  I understand pro&#x27;s issues about unlicensed/untrained people using this. Here&#x27;s my take, for what it&#x27;s worth: It is not \\&quot;easy\\&quot; to do yourself, OR on others. It is tedious and time consuming. (I use it on myself as well as on clients).  The two challenges I see is the ability to evenly distribute the product through your own hair while not wasting it, and effectively ironing without causing crimps or burning your hair. It is also essential to know that you should not use any iron which does not have titanium plates. Ceramic will absorb the keratin, so get a Croc if you don&#x27;t have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that many people who are using this on themselves are quite skilled at flat ironing their own hair. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve  been doing it for years now. People are going to do what they do, and hell, if you can&#x27;t afford to have it done at a salon, that&#x27;s that, right? I get it, and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s taking away from my biz. If you weren&#x27;t doing it yourself, you wouldn&#x27;t be coming in to have it done anyway, I&#x27;m guessing. :)  People are obviously overall happy with their results. When they aren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s user error, not to the product.  So, if you&#x27;re not happy with your result, you should maybe then fork over the money and pay a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you are ironing, you can feel the point when the hair changes (after several passes thru). It&#x27;s so cool! My experience is that it has changed my hair and I love it! I am at four weeks, and my hair looks great. When I finish working out, I no longer look like a mental patient.  When I am out in the rain: no prob. It is quick to style, I can put loose curls back in with a large iron. The curl holds and looks fantastic. My hair is normally frizzy, with waves in all of the wrong places. No matter what I do, it always looks a little frizzy, add rain, humidity, or sweat, forget looking good. Now it&#x27;s pretty. Yay. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the fumes are wierd. No noticeable smell, but the onion comparison is correct.  I burns your eyes and nasal passages during application as well as while ironing. Once you are finished, there is no noticeable smell. I have very sensitive skin, and had no issue with  the product.Yes, the fumes are wierd.

    <li> Having it done at a salon is so much easier though if you can&#x27;t make it to a salon this is a great product and delivers the same results. Instructions on bottle and super easy to find follow.</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair and it usually takes about 45 mins to blow dry and straighten my hair but with this product I can just blow dry using my fingers or even let it hair dry and it looks great.  The first time I did it I paid a lot of money to have it done in a salon but I saw how easy it was to apply so I started to do research online to see if you could buy the product and do it myself.  I would definitely recommend buying this and doing it at home. ITS SOOO EASY!! Don&#x27;t spend the $$ to have it done at the salon.  Trust me you will fall in love with this product! My treatments last about 3-4 months. Also, very important... if you have blonde processed hair don&#x27;t flat iron @ 450 degrees it will fry your hair!  Set it at about 400 degrees instead.</li>
    <li> Works very well I have wavey to straight hair and the treatment left my hair feeling very healthy and perfectly straight.</li>
    <li> So about a year ago I went to a salon and paid for a Keratin Treatment. I have very long, thick and curly hair and loved the results, however I did not love the price-tag that came with it (including the recommended Shampoo, Conditioner and treatment came to over $300 oh the things we do for beauty).     So obviously I jumped at the chance of trying to do it on myself, and was a little nervous on screwing it up, it would definitely be easier if you have someone with you to help, but I had no problem doing it on my own with 3 combs, a few clips and a pair of gloves, and I have a lot of hair. I should of taken a before and after photo to post. Basically my hair went from Carrie Bradshaw curly (and frizzy) to beach waves. Amazing. And the bottle has enough for another application in a few months.       I love this product.     Love, love love it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful..shipped quickly and best of all...I did it myself. I saved the $250.00 that is charged by my stylist. Yes it is a little hard to get the back but it can be done. I know my stylist may be a little miffed at me for not having her do it. But times are hard and I have had everyone at work just compliment me to no end! I highly reccomend it!! You can get at least two if not three applications out of one bottle! It has a shelf life of two years so I am thrilled! My hair rocks!</li>
    <li> I had this done at the salon first. It was the temp. version called Cappola Blow Out, which lasts only for only a few weeks.  I was on week 5 and it was still fine.  I do not wash my hair every day.  I go about 2 days then wash and condition.  I also use the Cappola Keratin Complex Infusion or the Restructing serum and I use the Vanilla Deep conditioner once a wee.  I just had my friend do this one on me.  It took about 2.5 hours, start to finish. This what I did:  -Shook the treatment well and poured 3 oz. into a hair color safe bowl which I bought at Harmons and let airate for 10-15 minutes as per the instructions  -I washed my hair twice with the Cappola Keratin clarifying Shampoo, then dried it completely with a blow dryer.   -at my kitchen table my friend used a highlight brush to apply the treatment in small 1/2 section staying 1/8 inch away from the scalp, if possible.  The she pulled it through the rest of the hair strand.  -after the head was covered, I put a shower cap on for 30 minutes.  At this point I thought felt a very slight stinging in my eyes after the cap was on for a little while.    -after 30 minutes we took the cap off and my friend combed through my hair with a very fine tooth comb removing all the excess treatment.  She made sure all the excess was gone.  I think this is very important because I read people had flaking during the 72 hour wait period.  I did not.  -at this point blow dry again with treatment in hair making sure hair is completely dry.  -now we flat ironed my hair using a chi. she did 1/2 sections running the iron over the section about 5-7 times, as the instructions said.  -72 hours with flat flat flat shiny soft hair.  I could not wait to wash my hair.  I have very dry hair so I was lucky to have a head full of grease.  I did not use ANYTHING during the 72 hours on my hair and I kept it completely dry.  After i washed it and conditioned it, it felt soft and dryed shiny and smooth.  My original hair type is dry, kinky small tight curls.  I now have smooth shiny wavy hair.  I love it.  The hard part is learning how to style my new hair type!!!!    I did wear a loose fitting hat at times, and I do not notice any type of ring or marks indentions to my hair as a result.  The product did not have a bad smell.  It smelt almost like pina colada.  I would recommend having clips handy to section off area of your hair as you work and make sure you do not do this in a small bathroom.  I would say you would feel make effects of the chemicals in your eyes.    I can not see how this could damage your hair in anyway if you do it right.  Make sure hair is DRY!!!!!  Good luck and enjoy your new hair.</li>
    <li> Pros:  -Gave my hair movement and soft texture it never had before  -Excellent shine  -Hair no longer absorbs humidity like it used to, so no frizz as soon as I step outside anymore  -I did the treatment myself, so I saved tons of money by skipping the salon  -Frizz is completely gone  -Curls are mostly gone...the ones that remain are just weak waves instead of curls  -Instead of spending 20 minutes straightening hair every morning, now I only spend 5  -I have medium length hair so I will get at least 2 treatments out of this one 8oz bottle    Cons:  -Can&#x27;t wash hair for 3 days after treatment  -Fumes from treatment made my eyes water when I was applying it, kind of like onions do  -Expensive for 8oz of product (but still much cheaper than going to a salon)    I will definitely continue purchasing this treatment as I need it.  I don&#x27;t know yet how long each treatment will last for me because I just did it a week ago.    UPDATE 9/18/10:    While my original above review is still all true, I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the treatment isn&#x27;t lasting anywhere close to the 3+ months it should.  I&#x27;ve given myself this treatment two times and each time it&#x27;s lasted only 2-4 weeks.  I use the Keratin Complex shampoo &amp; conditioner they recommend on the bottle and I do not use any other products in my hair at all, so I don&#x27;t know why this treatment isn&#x27;t lasting for me.  I will not purchase it again specifically for that reason.  So my review was previously 5 stars but now I&#x27;m dropping it to 3 because it doesn&#x27;t last for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair.  My hair stays straight and frizz free for months.  This is so much better than the Japanese hair straightening systems.</li>
    <li> THis product is absolutely amazing, I have natural curly hair &amp; about 100% frizz.  I have tried about every product on the market to help control the frizz...nothing even compares!!! Before using this I would wash my hair &amp; blow dry, my hair would be huge with all frizz....after using this I blow dried my hair with my round brush that I alway use...&amp; it looked &amp; felt like I had already flat ironed my hair.  Seriously about 95% of the frizz is GONE....It&#x27;s like Magic!!!! I love this product &amp; can&#x27;t wait to get the shampoo &amp; conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> I stopped relaxing my hair about five years ago and will never ever relax it again.  I had my first keratin treatment about a year ago and just love this treatment.  For my hair the keratin treatment has reduced frizz by about 98%; softened my natural African American two textured 3c and 3b curly hair to a 3b and 3c (about 1 curl grade); reduced my blow dry and flat iron time by 75% - talk about minimizing heat damage/breakage to your hair!!!!!  My previous shoulder length hair is now hitting my shoulder blades.      Please note it does not straigten your hair but offers other benefits whereby with current heat instruments and styling products one doesn&#x27;t need to relax hair at all.  My sisters and I never had a salon apply our relaxers - we did one another&#x27;s hair and the keratin application process is very similar - youtube also has videos on how to apply a keratin treatment. During the summer I&#x27;ll put the treatment on my hair every 2 months because with the heat and humidity I shampoo about 2-3x a week. During non summer season I shampoo at least 1x a week and can go as much as 5 months before another treatment. I need about 2 oz of product for each treatment so the bottle is worth the investment rather the cost of a professional salon appointment which could run $250-500 depending on where you live - salons use the same product line too.    I like the versatility of just air drying/diffusing for looser curls or heat drying for special occasions - just love how my hair behaves and looks.  It is worth investing in the Coppola keratin shampoo/conditioner/infusion (I still have the products I bought last year as they last a long time) to prolong the treatment as it doesn&#x27;t contain the sodium sulfate that quickly strips the keratin from your hair.  I tried the Loreal everclear sodium sulfate free hair care products but it left my hair all icky, dry and crunchy - just hated it.  I do use virgin organic coconut oil as a weekly deep conditioner and on my ends at night tominimize usual split ends too.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It really works!  It takes a long time to apply, especially if you have long hair, but it was well worth it.  Im very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair &amp; when it&#x27;s humid out it immedieatly frizzes no matter how long I spend blowing it. Since I have been using the Coppola Keratin Treatment My hair looks shiny &amp; healthy &amp; I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about it frizzing up when it&#x27;s humid out... I would recommend this product to anyone &amp; everyone... I do it myself at home &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier..</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using the Coppola Keratin for 3 years and it has changed my life.  BK (Before Keratin) it would take me an hour to blowdry my hair, then another 30 min + to flat iron and I would be tired, hot and sweaty.  Now, AK (After Keratin) I can blowdry my hair in the car using the air vents the first two months it is redone.  I have very curly hair, naturally, and the Keratin knocks it out.  The more you use it, the less maintenance you need.  I do hate the initial 3 day waiting period of being scared of water and sweat (no getting your hair wet for the first 72 hours) but in the end, it is worth it.  Here are my tricks, I color my hair so I leave the color on longer, in my mind, it feels like I need more processing time with Keratin.  Also, I flat iron my hair every day and dont wash it for 4 days.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was paying $280 to get this treatment at my salon, but I watched a video on how to do it myself, ordered the products and I actually like it better when I do the treatment!!  Seller provided fast shipping, product arrived as expected... FIVE STARS</li>
    <li> This was so easy to use. Its a lot easier if you get someone else to blow dry your hair for you because there are fumes that burn your eyes and nose. I paid $109.00 for an 8 oz. bottle in August. It took about 3 ounces for my hair because of its length. My only regret is that my hair is bone straight now but at least it is a lot easier to style now. I wet set and blow dry my hair and then finger style. Now I only have waves and no more frizzy spots. I colored my hair a week after I did the treatment and it has lasted wonderfully.I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for anyone with thin hair because the thickness really disappears.I applied this to my African American friends hair and she is delighted and I notice how her hair is always shiny and smooth now and no more uneven frizzy puff spots and touch up perms turn out perfect.</li>
    <li> I had a Keratin treatment before and the other product , which I wont mention the name , was way better, this one smooths your hair but leaves it dry and dull with no shine. I was very disappointed because ACCORDING to their comments seems to be a good product.  I would not recomended.     The dissapointed l</li>
    <li> While pricey, it certainly beats the cost of a salon treatment.  I bought the 8 oz. bottle, and hope to get 3 treatments from it.  While the instructions state to leave the keratin in for 72 hours, I couldn&#x27;t stand it, and washed my hair after 48 hours.  BUT, it feels MARVELOUS, soft, shiny, and the curls have loosened up, and I don&#x27;t have to flatiron if I don&#x27;t want to.  I also bought the Coppola Keratin Complex Infusion Keratin Replenisher, so the treatment will last longer (or so stated by Coppola).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it easier (I HATE blow drying my hair), I clarified my hair the night before, let my hair air-dry overnight, and did the treatment in the morning.  So much less work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have always used sulfate-free shampoos, and moisturizing conditioners with more natural ingredients/less chemicals.</li>
    <li> followed the direction to the T, including reading other user&#x27;s tidbits.  the first 3 days of \\&quot;incubation\\&quot; period works fine, as it was super soft and super straight.  After the first wash, it didn&#x27;t last, i used the recommended shampoo.  But if i flat iron it, it looks nice again! therefore, it can withstand flat ironing,..it looks much sleeker than prior to using it... but i cannot go out after washing my hair for air dry,..it looks the same.  so for now i just keep flat ironing it everyday..it does look better after flat ironning than before i had used the product, but not worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Keratin treatment the last week of October.  I sent an email to the vendor mid Oct. inquiring where my product was.  I received an email back saying it was on its way.  I sent two more emails on Nov. 26 and Dec. 1 explaining that I still had not received the product and asked them to please get back to me to let me know what was going on.  I never received a response to those two emails.  My next step is to try to contact Amazon to see how I can get my money back!</li>
    <li> I bought this treatment after doing a Keratin treatment in a Salon, they used GLOBAL KERATIN. I wanted to do it cheaper and if I could, better -even though this was a great treatment. After a lot of internet \\&quot;googling\\&quot; and watching a video in my salon, I wrote down everything, the video that they were showing showed how the COPPOLA KERATIN TREATMENT had to be done.     I bought the 8oz. one thinking it would just last for one treatment, and that I would just try it out. It turns out; that for my shoulder length hair, I had enough for 2 treatments (7 month supply) it is wonderful.     I bought this treatment, the shampoo, the conditioner, the deep conditioner, etc. My hair was amazing. I am Caucasian with curly highlighted blond hair and this treatment helped me have healthy shinny straight hair. I live in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, were the climate is always very humid.     After doing this treatment (3 month later) my stylist recommended another Keratin treatment -PRAVANA- which trusting her, I did. WHAT A MISTAKE. My hair broke in the crown area and the treatment smelled awful. After 1 month I can still feel the smell, and my hair, although shinny, has a lot of breakage and falling out.  I had tried the PRAVANA Shampoo, Rinse and Serum, ant they were great but NEVER USE THE PRAVANA KERATIN TREATMENT. It burned and broke my hair and the smell was awful.    Next time I have to do this treatment I WILL GO BACK TO COPPOLA. I REGRET EVER CHANGING.</li>
    <li> After long research I decided to give Coppola a try. I had never had a keratin treatment before. Neither done by myself or in a salon. You have instructions on the package as well you can find them in previous reviews. I used 430 degrees setting because of two reasons- my hair isn&#x27;t that super healthy and this is maximum temperature my hot iron heats up to. I have long hair- up to my elbows. It is VERY frizzy, curly and somehow regular in thickness i would say. I also washed out the treatment after 2 days instead of three. All I can say- If you can, do the treatment outside! I did it by myself, in bathroom, with open windows and a fan blowing on my hair. STILL i had to get out of the bathroom every few minutes because I couldnt stand the fumes!!!! My eyes would produce tears as if someone put onion in them. Same with breathing. It was just VERY irritating. So be vary careful with that. I got such bad fumes even before using flat iron. But lets get to results:) I kind of liked it:)! My hair was definitely less frizzy and if I used blow dryer it was straight! however there was one detail that i didn&#x27;t like- It was too flat! I looked like I lost half of my hair and all the volume. For sure it didnt last promised three months but it may be due to washing it out too soon. I have research even further about formaldehyde and got few opinions that in a long run it can cause hair loss due to scalp irritation. So i found out the perfect solution- I will use keratin treatment on most but not on the entire length of my hair. Lets say maybe 2/3. This way my hair shouldn&#x27;t loose the volume and it should be protected from potential scalp irritation and hair loss. I will update my review after couple uses!</li>
    <li> with naturally curly hair I have tried more than my share of products and treatments -- this ONE truly delivers my hair is soft and manageable!</li>
