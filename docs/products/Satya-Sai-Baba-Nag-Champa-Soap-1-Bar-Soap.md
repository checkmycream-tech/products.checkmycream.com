      <li>This soap has a soft, luxurious lather and a nice scent.</li>
      <li>soap itself was great, but extremely overpriced.</li>
      <li>I love the classic Nag Champa scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells very clean and exotic at the same time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super strong, just nice and fresh, but should it be strong like incense?</li>
      <li>FRESH CLEAN SMELL.THE BAR IS A NICE BIG SIZE.</li>
      <li>The soap is a wonderful facial bar soap, the nag champa scent, and leaves your skin soft, not dry at all.</li>
      <li>over all this soap is pretty mild, and make your skin really very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>A guy working at a souvenir shop in Ohio talked me into buying my first bar of this soap.</li>
      <li>It cleanses my skin very throughly and leaves it smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the fresh basic smell of Nag Champa - kind of what your house smells like several hours after the incense is done burning.</li>
      <li>Love my soap, I&#x27;ve used Nag for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a reasonably gentle soap</li>
      <li>I really wanted it to smell like the oil I like so much.</li>
      <li>I was happy to discover this soap - use in a small bathroom and it does double duty to cleanse hands and freshen the room!</li>
      <li>Follow with moisturizer or oil, if your skin tends to dry, or use a soap free product if your skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>After using it, I can tell you, I&#x27;m already reordering more of this soap, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all, and it smells terrific!</li>
      <li>Instead it smell sort of like an old gentlemans aftershave!</li>
      <li>I love the incense and not i love the soap...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like a subtle blend of sandalwood and musk - very different, but very refreshing.</li>
      <li>This soap is not overly scented which is what I was slightly worried about when buying it originally, and i have hyper sensitive smell, and can be over whelmed by perfumy smells.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately at the time of purchase, I was only able to purchase one bar,only one was available.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s a very generous size bar, about twice the size of a standard American size soap bar.</li>
      <li>IT ALSO SEEMS TO LAST PRETTY LONG.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really unique both in the bathroom and on me, not your usual Gl*ade air freshener or Di*al hand soap.</li>
      <li>Bare size is good.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
      <li>I love the small and I even traded in my other face wash for this.  </li>
      <li>It was what he expected as the scent goes, but felt that it costs a bit much for the size of the bar, which is not as big as you might think.</li>
      <li>Not so strong but not too weak.  </li>
      <li>And the scent is not very strong, it certainly doesn&#x27;t perfume</li>
      <li>Amazon refunded my money because they are awesome of course, so I purchased it again, I was skeptical because I have never had any luck using soap, it usually dries out my skin really bad, but I love nag champa</li>
      <li>A stick of actual incense would be cheaper - but would not clean my hands very well.</li>
      <li>It also lathers up really well, and the smell lingers for a little while, the bar of soap is also quite big.</li>

<li> only issue was that the bar was really not that big, maybe about as big around as a baseball, and perhaps a little over an inch thick...and that would be so bad if the soap was not almost $8.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Perfect transaction. Very nice scent!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product once, and the package got destroyed by UPS and didn&#x27;t arrive. Amazon refunded my money because they are awesome of course, so I purchased it again, I was skeptical because I have never had any luck using soap, it usually dries out my skin really bad, but I love nag champa so I bought it anyway. When it got here, the rest of the stuff in the package smelled really good too, and my front porch. After using it, I can tell you, I&#x27;m already reordering more of this soap, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all, and it smells terrific! It also lathers up really well, and the smell lingers for a little while, the bar of soap is also quite big. Totally worth the money.. smells so good!</li>
    <li> Does not smell like nag champa. Scent is so faint. It is a moisturizing soap, but doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, just wish it lasted to the end of the soap.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I have been using for 6 months now.  I love the small and I even traded in my other face wash for this.  My skin is much clearer and I just love it!</li>
    <li> A guy working at a souvenir shop in Ohio talked me into buying my first bar of this soap. I&#x27;m so glad he did! I started using it 2 days ago and I already feel the difference in my skin. Usually I must apply body lotion to my shins and elbows where my skin is really dry, but I didn&#x27;t need to today... the dry skin was gone! Also, I discovered I love the smell of Nag Champa - it&#x27;s like a subtle blend of sandalwood and musk - very different, but very refreshing. It has a great lather, too. So now I&#x27;m here at Amazon shopping for a case of Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa Beauty Soap!</li>
    <li> Soap that kind of smells like nag.  Not so strong but not too weak.  Nothing to write about.  Seriously.  Nothing.</li>
    <li> I love the incense and not i love the soap...this soap has a very beautiful smell and allow you bathroom to retain smell after bathing...</li>
    <li> This soap works and smells great</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed with this soap it smells NOTHING like Nag Champa after you lather. Instead it smell sort of like an old gentlemans aftershave!</li>
    <li> I love this Bar soap. Unfortunately at the time of purchase, I was only able to purchase one bar,only one was available. The soap is a wonderful facial bar soap, the nag champa scent, and leaves your skin soft, not dry at all. I just would have liked to have been able to purchase more. I love Nag Champa lotion as well. Will purchase more if available.</li>
    <li> This soap is a nice soap but does not smell like the oil at all. And the scent is not very strong, it certainly doesn&#x27;t perfume&lt;br /&gt;the bathroom as one reviewer suggested. I really wanted it to smell like the oil I like so much. I can get a nondescript perfumy&lt;br /&gt;soap for a lot cheaper than this. I&#x27;m using it but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My son wanted this soap, so I got it for him. It was what he expected as the scent goes, but felt that it costs a bit much for the size of the bar, which is not as big as you might think.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE  FRESH CLEAN SMELL.THE BAR IS A NICE BIG SIZE. IT ALSO SEEMS TO LAST PRETTY LONG. I WILL BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Love my soap, I&#x27;ve used Nag for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash Nag on my body, I use the soap as a hand soap, it leaves my bathroom smelling like a Nag Champa incense stick.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks guys.&lt;br /&gt;Veronica</li>
    <li> Yeah, eight bucks a bar is a bit steep, but my GOD what beautimous soap.  This is my second bar.  Smells so wonderful.  I want more!  Again and again!!</li>
    <li> Is exactly as described. The only slight draw back for me is, I have dry skin and this does little to alleviate that even though it&#x27;s not really meant to. That being said, smells great and leaves you with a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> This soap is not overly scented which is what I was slightly worried about when buying it originally, and i have hyper sensitive smell, and can be over whelmed by perfumy smells. over all this soap is pretty mild, and make your skin really very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was that the bar was really not that big, maybe about as big around as a baseball, and perhaps a little over an inch thick...and that would be so bad if the soap was not almost $8.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, i would recommend this soap for anyone who enjoys Nag Champa</li>
    <li> Nag Champa Soap?&lt;br /&gt;Yes and it is a lovely fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers nicely. Bare size is good.&lt;br /&gt;Did I say I love the fragrance?</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this soap and will be buying more. It is soft and subtle but sticks with you. It is not moisturizing, so you might want to order the same scent lotion or use unscented.</li>
    <li> Nag champa is the champion, I think, for cleansing an area of \\&quot;body\\&quot; smells - dog accidents, cat box, teenaged boys (lol), and bathroom ghouls. I was happy to discover this soap - use in a small bathroom and it does double duty to cleanse hands and freshen the room! It&#x27;s not super strong, just nice and fresh, but should it be strong like incense? They make solid perfume and body oil if you want that! ;) It&#x27;s just the fresh basic smell of Nag Champa - kind of what your house smells like several hours after the incense is done burning. This is good, I think. A stick of actual incense would be cheaper - but would not clean my hands very well. It&#x27;s a reasonably gentle soap - it IS soap, though, this is not a D*ve bar, lol! Follow with moisturizer or oil, if your skin tends to dry, or use a soap free product if your skin is sensitive. I have psoriasis and I do fine with this, just following with a good moisturizer. I LOVE the scent. It&#x27;s really unique both in the bathroom and on me, not your usual Gl*ade air freshener or Di*al hand soap.</li>
    <li> Big fan here of Nag Champa incense for decades. And now, my guests get to wash their hands with the soap in the guest bathroom. I will probably buy another one for use in our own shower... It is not overpowering.. (and in a way, I wish it was), but it sure smells good!</li>
    <li> It is very expensive but I love the way it lathers and it smells very good.</li>
    <li> This soap is so good. It was ordered by mistake, but we used it. It is my favorite scented incense and now my favorite soap.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful smelling soap! I love the classic Nag Champa scent. Plus it&#x27;s a very generous size bar, about twice the size of a standard American size soap bar. It cleanses my skin very throughly and leaves it smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Smell was disgusting like cheap perfumed soap.</li>
    <li> This soap has a soft, luxurious lather and a nice scent. I was hoping it would have more of a nag champa scent though.</li>
    <li> Basically like the soap waas disappointed in the fact there was not enough fragrance and was kind of &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; after being on your skin for awhile.</li>
    <li> Dries my skin out but smells good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for years, it smells wonderful.  Try hand washing your pillow cases with this and then toss it in the dryer.</li>
    <li> The bar was the size of a hotel soap....will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself was great, but extremely overpriced.</li>
    <li> This soap feels like a treat and is worth all the money! (get the 4-pack if you like it)&lt;br /&gt;It smells very clean and exotic at the same time. If you even remotely like the smell of good incense, you will love this. Lathers really well and will make your whole bathroom smell good if you shower with it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this soap.  I will buy more for traveling.</li>
