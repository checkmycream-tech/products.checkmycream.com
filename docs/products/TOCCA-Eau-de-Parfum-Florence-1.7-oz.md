      <li>Absolutely love this Perfume.  :-)</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s her favorite</li>
      <li>Elegant glass bottle with lots of heft.</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this when I ordered my favorite perfume and,</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>Love the smelling like among Spring flowers.</li>
      <li>I have worn many perfumes over my life time and</li>
      <li>I LOVE this scent.</li>
      <li>She loved it right away and went out and got the matching body lotion to go with it.</li>
      <li>Very clean smelling :)</li>
      <li>May be too strong for work environment.</li>
      <li>I was testing like 20 different samples, and my nose was pretty shot, but I could still tell this one was awesome.  </li>
      <li>So the next day, I tested it again with a fresh nose, and loved it even more.  </li>
      <li>works as expected, a bit pricey but great product.</li>
      <li>Well, I will be ordering this full size as soon as I can.</li>
      <li>My favorite Tocca fragrance of all, for years now and still not tired of it.</li>
      <li>TOCCA Florence is a gorgeous floral scent that I can&#x27;t get enough of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>found it at a store and loved it but can actually get it cheaper on amazon.  </li>
      <li>I got a sample the first time and fell in love at first whiff.  </li>
      <li>well... I have a new favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is soft and elegant.  </li>
      <li>For me, the fragrance is classy and sexy.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my sister and she couldn&#x27;t hide her smile from her face</li>
      <li>this by far is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>But overall really nice.</li>
      <li>When it arrived it was nicely packaged with a extra bonus gift inside!</li>
      <li>As for the vendor, the product arrived pretty quickly so I would order from them again, just not a Tocca product as I no longer trust what I am purchasing from them.</li>
      <li>lol it&#x27;s not the type of scent that I usually gravitate toward, (I usually like vanilla candy scents) but when I close my eyes and smell this perfume I imagine that I&#x27;m walking through a beautiful garden of flowers.</li>
      <li>Elegant and fresh at the same time.</li>
      <li>If you purchase this fragrance you&#x27;ll be very, very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I was initially excited that this one was so cheap, but I now think it is cheaper than the sephora sold tocc florence because it is a knock off and not the actual Tocca perfume.</li>
      <li>light, classic, floral, and absolutely heavenly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s elegant and sensual, and smells like an Italian garden.</li>
      <li>Okay, I can&#x27;t really pick out the individual floral scents, but I do get a floral sense.  </li>
      <li>crushed violet petals, jasmine, tuberose and blue iris much more prominent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and light but sticks around for a long time.</li>
      <li>Rich, deep, floral and spicy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am now a senior and very careful how strong I use perfume</li>
      <li>I chose this perfume due to its light flowery scent.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent and I usually don&#x27;t like perfume</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t get much scent from the top notes of Italian bergamot, grapefruit leaves, green pear or apple.  </li>
      <li>Not to mention that the perfume is sickly sweet and not even close to what the other products smell like.  </li>
      <li>It smells so good, that despite the expensive pricetag, I HAD to have it.  </li>
      <li>High quality, long lasting effects.</li>
      <li>I still had some of the old Tocca Florence left and the scents were totally different.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and has a floral fragrance that mixed in with a little something else.</li>

<li> You need to spray on at least 2 to 3 times for it to last.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
<li> Too expensive for a little bottle.</li>
<li> it smells expensive.</li>
<li> It is very disappointing.  </li>
<li> The one issue with it is that the staying power is dreadful, as is the case with all Tocca perfumes.</li>

    <li> I purchased this perfume for my sister in law as a gift for her getting a new place oddly enough (she requested perfume instead of the usual apartment warming gift).  She loved it right away and went out and got the matching body lotion to go with it.</li>
    <li> This is a spectacular scent. I am a perfume maven. Its in my top 5. Gorgeous</li>
    <li> I order this about two times a year for my wife. It&#x27;s her favorite and it&#x27;s hard to find locally. Price and shipping is always fair.</li>
    <li> works as expected, a bit pricey but great product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my girlfriend and she loves it. Good quality and speedy delivery. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Absolutely, completely, totally satisfied!! Love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s fresh and light but sticks around for a long time. And the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> My favorite Tocca fragrance of all, for years now and still not tired of it.</li>
    <li> found it at a store and loved it but can actually get it cheaper on amazon.  The fragrance is soft and elegant.  I get lots of complements and it is not overpowering!!</li>
    <li> Too expensive for a little bottle.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this when I ordered my favorite perfume and, well... I have a new favorite perfume. lol it&#x27;s not the type of scent that I usually gravitate toward, (I usually like vanilla candy scents) but when I close my eyes and smell this perfume I imagine that I&#x27;m walking through a beautiful garden of flowers. this is the type of perfume that a woman would wear on her wedding day. light, classic, floral, and absolutely heavenly. it smells expensive. my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long. but I put a bit of the sample on the other day in the morning and was still getting compliments at the end of the day so maybe it&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t smell it on myself. Well, I will be ordering this full size as soon as I can. never have I been so in love with a fragrance!</li>
    <li> I chose this perfume due to its light flowery scent. When it arrived it was nicely packaged with a extra bonus gift inside! Love love love it! It smells ammmmmmaaazing!</li>
    <li> Love this gardenia based perfume! I have received several compliments. Very clean smelling :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. Great price too.</li>
    <li> TOCCA Florence is a gorgeous floral scent that I can&#x27;t get enough of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get much scent from the top notes of Italian bergamot, grapefruit leaves, green pear or apple.  I find the middle floral notes of ivory gardenia, crushed violet petals, jasmine, tuberose and blue iris much more prominent.  Okay, I can&#x27;t really pick out the individual floral scents, but I do get a floral sense.  The bottom notes of blonde wood and white musk are subtle enough to give the fragrance depth without overpowering the beauty of the flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you a floral fan, like me, give TOCCA Florence a spritz!</li>
    <li> Rich, deep, floral and spicy fragrance. Bought this for my wife&#x27;s B-Day. She loved it immediately. High quality, long lasting effects. For me, the fragrance is classy and sexy. Probably good anytime of the day, but best for ideal for evenings or daytime events. I encourage my wife to wear the less expensive perfumes I&#x27;ve bought for work, why waste one&#x27;s better perfumes on work. May be too strong for work environment. Elegant glass bottle with lots of heft.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of the fragrance and of all the perfumes I own, this is the one I get most complimented on. It&#x27;s very feminine and has a floral fragrance that mixed in with a little something else. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Elegant and fresh at the same time.</li>
    <li> It smells great! A stronger scent of gardenia than I was expecting. But overall really nice.</li>
    <li> I have worn many perfumes over my life time and this by far is my favorite.  I am now a senior and very careful how strong I use perfume and they is a nice garden scent.  I always get comments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is one of Tocca&#x27;s loveliest scents. It&#x27;s elegant and sensual, and smells like an Italian garden. The one issue with it is that the staying power is dreadful, as is the case with all Tocca perfumes. Still, I give it four stars because it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Perfume.  :-)</li>
    <li> This item was ordered as a gift that I ended up keeping, the fragrance was soo nice I just could not give it away.  The item arrived ahead of time and allowed me time to pick out something else for my sister.  If you purchase this fragrance you&#x27;ll be very, very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0012RXVA6 Tocca Beauty Cleopatra Collection 1.7 oz Eau de Parfum Spray]]</li>
    <li> Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> My favorite of the Tocca scents!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent. But when this item arrived, it was not the scent I knew and loved. I still had some of the old Tocca Florence left and the scents were totally different.

    <li> Bought it for my sister and she couldn&#x27;t hide her smile from her face</li>
    <li> Perfume does not smell the same as other Tocca products with the same scent.  Don&#x27;t understand why they would use the same name for 2 different scents.  Not to mention that the perfume is sickly sweet and not even close to what the other products smell like.  Would love to hear from Tocca about this.  It is very disappointing.  As for the vendor, the product arrived pretty quickly so I would order from them again, just not a Tocca product as I no longer trust what I am purchasing from them.</li>
    <li> Simply beautiful scent! It&#x27;s not strong at all. Gorgeous bottle very nice glass. You need to spray on at least 2 to 3 times for it to last.</li>
    <li> Tocca makes gorgeous fragrances, this is no exception.</li>
