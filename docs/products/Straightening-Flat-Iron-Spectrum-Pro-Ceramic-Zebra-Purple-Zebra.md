<li> Being that this is my first flat iron, I had to view a few tutorials on how to achieve the styling (I have a layered cut) and how to use it,  </li>
<li> It heats up fast and straightens my hair in one pass, which is no easy feat as I have very thick, very wavy and very stubborn hair.</li>
<li> I am a low hair maintenance person, so flat irons did not faze me until I recently got my hair cut and needed a different styling tool.</li>
<li> flat iron ended up as a white elephant gift (women were fighting over it like gazelles).</li>
<li> Not only was it pulling out my hair, the flat iron didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all.</li>
<li> Looking around for a flat iron everywhere</li>
<li> I was using the PYT flat irons for 2years before I dropped them</li>
<li> It takes much less time to straighten my hair compared to my old Remington Wet2Straight.</li>
<li> and my mom said the flat iron worked well!!!</li>
<li> I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t heat it up for long</li>
<li> The only thing I did not care for was it was a bit heavier than the previous one I had used for years, but this one was half the cost of my old one.</li>
<li> I finally broke down and joined the flat iron world!!!  </li>
<li> So, I browsed Amazon to look for a flat iron and read the other reviews on this product and was sold!  </li>
<li> Truly a deal for a flat iron I paid less than $35 for.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work well and for the price, not worth it...</li>
<li> The plates were not smooth and I don&#x27;t think it was ceramic at all.&lt;br</li>
<li> And it still caught my hair and pulled a few strands from my head;</li>
<li> Lasted longer than my 2 previous CHI brands!</li>
<li> in less than a year it stopped working!</li>
<li> i have very thick long hair</li>
<li> Not very good.</li>
<li> When i tried to curl my hair with it I had to pull hard on the straightener which pulled some of ny hair out.</li>
<li> but it won&#x27;t so little disappointed</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> Works great with no problems.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant in buying this brand because I was unfamiliar with it, but I gave it a try because it was such a good deal on Amazon.

    <li> This straightener is awesome!!! It&#x27;s everything I expected it to be and more! I will continue to buy products from this company.&lt;br /&gt;MUST BUy!!!</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and joined the flat iron world!!!  I am a low hair maintenance person, so flat irons did not faze me until I recently got my hair cut and needed a different styling tool. The curling iron, bless it&#x27;s heart, wasn&#x27;t quite getting it done. So, I browsed Amazon to look for a flat iron and read the other reviews on this product and was sold!  Received it and tried it out my freshly washed and dried hair.  Wow!  Had near salon results!  Being that this is my first flat iron, I had to view a few tutorials on how to achieve the styling (I have a layered cut) and how to use it,  so that&#x27;s why it looked almost like I went to the salon, but  I am  extremely happy with the results. Got a lot of compliments. Love the fact that it heats up quickly and it is versatile to use for any style and type of hair.  Truly a deal for a flat iron I paid less than $35 for.</li>
    <li> I love it, &amp; great price</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!. I think im going to order another one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all! When I tried it for the first time, the flat iron pulled and caught my hair between the tiny crevices of the device. I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t heat it up for long so I tried a different method. And it still caught my hair and pulled a few strands from my head; Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;I used the product 3 times hoping it would get better with time but I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Not only was it pulling out my hair, the flat iron didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all.

    <li> I needed a new flat iron and why not one that is stylish too. It works well and I like how I can adjust the temperature to my hair type.</li>
    <li> Not very good. When i tried to curl my hair with it I had to pull hard on the straightener which pulled some of ny hair out. Also, the product doesn&#x27;t straighten that good compared to my last one, which was a chi. Disappointed.</li>
