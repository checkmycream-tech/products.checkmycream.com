<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Youth Glow Eye Gel for a little over a week now, and so far I&#x27;ve been enjoying it! The gel is light and easy to apply. The pump bottle makes it easy to get exactly the same amount of product each time you use it, as well as keeping things hygenic. I like the light cucumber scent of the gel, and appreciate that you can use it on your entire face, not just the eye area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received a sample of the Youth Glow Eye Gel, but opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!!  I notice a difference whenever I use this particular eye gel.  It really cuts down on eye puffiness!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, it feels nice. Guess I&#x27;ll know more after a while.</li>
    <li> pretty good quality product. would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use this product for more than a few days.  One thing of importance to me is the fact that just about anything that gets near my eyes irritates them.  This product does not.  It is not oily and does absorb,  Using it a couple of times did seem to help with the bags under my eyes, but very little; however, I do have allergies and haven&#x27;t found anything that helps in that sense.</li>
    <li> Fantastic eye cream. Best I have ever known.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have been using it for about a week and have definitely noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product in order to provide this review. I started using it as directed, two times a day. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks - at the start, I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently but now I have been a consistent user for last two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the light hint of cucumber aroma that I smell. That was the first thing I noticed about the product! The &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the product itself is pretty nice, as other reviewers have noted, but sometimes when I apply it, I&#x27;m met with a slight burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by redness as well. Both the burning and the redness fade quickly, but I did think it important to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say I notice much of a difference at all. I&#x27;ve taken a few &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; photos but I can&#x27;t seem to get a picture quality good enough to see the fine lines around my eyes even in the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; shots (but trust me, they are there!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to try this product for a full two months and see if there is any difference, but so far, it has done no better or worse than a major beauty-brand competitor (that is not as natural and organic as this one).</li>
    <li> So far so good. Haven’t really noticed my dark circles reducing yet but my skin is sooo much softer.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. It does what it says. I have so much more confidence when I go out since using this product because the bags under my eyes have diminished significantly and my eyes look amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks. I noticed a difference from the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week. I have very sensitive skin and have had no irritation. One pump supplies enough for both eyes. I work nights so I have puffiness under my eyes from lack of sleep. This product is soothing and I have seen a noticeable difference in the puffiness. It leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for less than a week - Very impressed with the feeling, creates a cooling effect on the eyes.  One pump is enough for both eyes. Has a slight cucumber scent.  Will continue to use and would buy this one again</li>
    <li> This is not a lie - it&#x27;s the BEST eye cream. Definitley helped reduced puffiness and gave me the &amp;#34;just woke up&amp;#34; look i was going for.  It&#x27;s become a staple in my beauty box.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks, and have noticed a difference already in my dark undereyes. Mine are due to leaky capillaries and get worse during allergy season. Now they are blotchy and lighter, and I am able to cover them pretty well with regular concealer. Looking forward to continued improvement! Love the cooling cucumber smell.</li>
    <li> I have slight wrinkles but that is not what I was wanting to use this product for. I wanted the puffiness under my eyes gone. After using this product for 2 weeks I have to say while not completely gone my puffiness has been greatly reduced so much so that I will be purchasing another one to see if future use will continue to reduce it even more. I am please with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It truly reduces the puffiness and softens the lines under my eyes.  I really like it and would purchase again.  It is cooling and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky upon application.  I like the fact that it seems to plump up the skin around my eyes.  A winner for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to review this product because I suffer from dark circles under my eyes; more so now that I’m a full-time mother. It’s also genetically inherited from my mother’s side. But whatever the reason may be, I really just want to get rid of them. I was given this product free and in exchanged I’ll provided my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used other products one can find at your local pharmacy and I have to say I fell that this product was different. I’ve bought several other products that have left my eyes watery, irritated, and some discomfort on my face. I’m thinking it may have been an allergic reaction to some of the ingredients in those products.  I’m happy to saw that that isn’t the issue with Glow Eye Gel by goPURE. It has no fragranced and it has a silky smooth texture. I can see and feel it helping my under-eyes. That particular area is always sensitive—regardless of who you are. For me, I feel it moisturizes that area and I see improvement on my face in general. But remember: I have dark under eyes because it’s in my genes. These product made show more drastic improvements for other people.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product to anyone that has tried several over the counter products and have not worked. One thing I like very much is the fact that that the goPure company is willing to guarantee a 100% percent money back if the product doesn’t work for you.  As a consumer, it’s great to know some companies are willing to offer those guarantees.</li>
    <li> I have bad seasonal allergies and I always have my under eye area always dry and with dark circles. After using this eye cream for the past couple of weeks I am noticing that my dark circles are getting lighter and my skin is not dry. I use it every night before going to bed and I am loving it. Great product.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is wonderful! It has a soft, pleasant scent, the plunger dispenses just the right amount of product and it goes on so smoothly. I love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> I think it smells like cucumbers. It feels good on my skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin yet.</li>
    <li> Love love love this soothing eye gel.  Will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help rid the dark and puffy eye problems I have. I think this is going to do it. With vit c, vit e and plant stem cells this was a must try. I know I&#x27;m going to be liking this one. Thank you. I received this for my  unbiased opinion for review.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I just received this a few days ago and looking for something for a man&#x27;s face is not easy. I will let all of you guys know, over the age of 50, if it&#x27;s not what it says it is. Keep watching. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only THREE DAYS and notice a visible difference in my puffy, dark under eye circles!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much progress it will make in a month!  Very happy with this cream.  It has a pleasant scent and feels good under my eyes.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have only used this eye gel for a short amount of time but I have noticed improvement in my under eye area. I have used numerous high end department store products which cost quite a bit more money, but didn&#x27;t provide any better results than this product has.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have to deal with wrinkles just yet... but that&#x27;s why I purchased this product, to help stop them before they start.  I use this eye gel at night with my normal skin regime before I moisturize.  It has a great gel consistency and is not greasy at all.  It absorbs quickly and gives a nice cooling sensation under my eyes, really nice after a stressful day.  I have been using this product for almost two weeks and I can see an improvement in the moisture levels and texture in the skin around my eyes.  My work is very stressful so I am prone to bags under my eyes in the AM and this product has helped reduce them.  I think this is a fantastic product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> product is as described. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Better than most at 1/10 the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and have noticed a bit of improvement in my under eye dark circles.  Is not as bad as it was before.  I&#x27;ve give a 3 star review because I feel that I would have to use it longer to see better results</li>
    <li> I really like this cream and I love the fresh smell!! I have a lot of eye puffiness and this has helped. It also goes on really smooth and is absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> When you apply the cream it feels nice and cool and is not greasy. It gets absorbed into the skin fairly easily and it doesn&#x27;t have a distracting scent. I did notice a positive change in the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is extremely hydrating, I haven&#x27;t noticed much reduction in puffiness for me, but it really keeps my eyes moisturized which is probably why it makes me appear younger. I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great value. I love the consistency of this gel: not too thick, but not too thin. It absorbs perfectly and I love the feel on my skin. The smell is very slight, but I love it and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a way to diminish my dark circles for years.  I believe they are hereditary so I wasn&#x27;t sure it was even possible.  After my FIRST use of this product I noticed a difference.  Not only were the dark circles lighter but they weren&#x27;t as puffy and fine lines were reduced!  I would buy this product again!!</li>
    <li> Eye gel feels very nice on the skin, after using it for 3 weeks this is some difference around my eyes.  It has softened the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much $$$ on expensive products! I&#x27;ve always had bags under my eyes, even as a teenager. I&#x27;m 47 and I had given up on trying to correct the problem, now that it is more noticeable. Since pricey creams weren&#x27;t doing anything, I decided to try something that would at least keep the area moisturized. I read some reviews for this product and... it performed a miracle in just a day! You learn something every day... I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s not necessary to only use expensive beauty products to look your best. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff love it</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much difference.  The puffiness didn&#x27;t get any better or any worse.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I liked the list of ingredients. It contains some powerful ingredients that work very well for their anti-aging properties.  This gel goes on nicely, sinks in well, no problems putting makeup over it, etc.  I agree w/others who said it smells like cucumber scented (but it is not overwhelming).  So far very pleased with it, but I will need to use it longer to tell if it has significant improvements on the crows feet, etc.  I&#x27;ll try to come back &amp; update the review after a month or so of use.  I always have a hard time finding eye creams/gels that behave under makeup (they usually ball up/roll up, flake, etc.)  This one works well under makeup, no problems, so I am very happy about that.</li>
    <li> My under eyes are less puffy since I&#x27;ve been using this. I thought it was working, but now I know for a fact because someone at work noticed how much better I&#x27;m looking.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product my main complaint is the container arrived with product around the spout.  I found that even when I went to apply the product the next day it would randomly have stuff around the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a nice gel and it applies really evenly. Not too sticky of a consistency too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m liking this as an eye cream.</li>
    <li> We have been testing Youth Glow Eye Gel by goPURE Naturals for about a week and a half. Just like other reviewers, we are impressed with the quality ingredients, ease of application and quick results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great, a perfect size for at home use or for travel (0.5 fl. oz.). It includes an easy to use pump in which one good pump is enough to cover both eyes. The formula is 100% natural and paraben free. The actual ingredients are impressive including proprietary peptide complex, vitamin c, hyaluronic acid, matrixyl 3000, plant stem cells and vitamin e. The eye cream smells like fresh cucumbers, easily glides on the eyes (with a fairly quick drying time) and creates a cooling effect similar to a spa facial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goPURE Naturals recommends using the product for at least one full month for the greatest results. We noticed a reduction in puffiness and lines, and a ”tightening” of the skin in a comfortable way. It didn’t completely win us over in the reducing dark circles department, but part of dark circles can be from genes and usually requires a little makeup coverage to completely remove anyway. We were still impressed with the eye cream’s performance, ingredients and affordability (currently under $13) and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I tried this product product not thinking that it would do anything but it did help with hydrating, puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I study alot so sleep is a luxury. Since using this product, I don&#x27;t look like I lack sleep. The bottle recommends twice daily so I apply one squirt to both eyes at night and in the morning. I would definitely recommend this product to rejuvenate your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using product for couple of weeks,  but have not  other noticed a change.  Love the feel of it of it though,  very light.</li>
    <li> Love how cool and hydrating this gel gel is. I use it every night in my night time skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been using goPure Eye cream for few days now and i like it a lot.  It smells good, feels good, not greasy but has a light texture, absorbs in few seconds. Will need to use longer to see if my smile lines diminish :).  But so far i really like it.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks ,can honestly say that I did see some improvement on my less noticeable undereye lines . But not much on the deeper creases..Just might need to us it for longer period of time to see results.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about 2 weeks now.  I really feel there is less puffiness under my eyes.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I had to discontinue use because the product made my eyes dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> Really works. Reduces puffiness and dark circles. Cannot say enough. Amazing. Saw the difference in seconds. Love it!</li>
    <li> I hate the puffiness under my eyes and this has helped with it tremedously. I have even noticed the area lighting up a bit! I love the size because it is perfect for travel! I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait &amp; really give this product a chance to do what they said it would do. So since it is almost gone, here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;I liked the feel. It had that same tightness I experience with Nerium. It did seem to reduce the puffiness until the blooming spring flowers &amp; trees triggered my allergies! I haven&#x27;t seen any change to the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and sheer.. Not sticky. Works well under makeup</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for week and already the puffiness has gone down and the lines under and side of my eyes are softer and not as deep.  When you have puffy eyes naturally, the lines always seem deeper, but they look a lot better than i would have expected.  I have used Perricone eye cream and the results are better with this one. (and a quarter of the price!)</li>
    <li> its incredible that you can see and feel this working!! I have lots of little eye &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34; that I could not get rid of, this offers immediate results!! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> very hydrating and moisturizing</li>
    <li> Love that this is all natural. Have used it two times so far and it worked for the bags under my eyes. Thank you goPURE Naturals!</li>
    <li> The gel is awesome! I have eczema around my eyes, so although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily help it, it doesn&#x27;t make it flare up at all. A very little goes a LONG way so don&#x27;t use a lot! Very well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently still waiting on results only had it a few days.. I will keep you posted..</li>
    <li> I used it for a week and didn&#x27;t really notice any changes. Maybe I don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles.....&lt;br /&gt;Also it comes out too easily so I end up wasting a lot.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> It definitely reduces puffiness, but, full effect takes place over hours not minutes - wears off by end of the day, but, you can always re-apply.</li>
    <li> I was asked to give honest feedback because I was given a great discount on this product. I have used this for about 2 weeks and I am loving it so far! It goes on so smooth and it is very soothing and cooling It does appear to reduce the puffiness. Looking forward to see if it reduces dark circles and fine lines!</li>
    <li> I have tried this mmmm twice now? And as soon as it drys my skin feel super tight! So I see how it works for wrinkles that&#x27;s for sure! as for the dark circles after 2 uses I&#x27;m not there yet I haven&#x27;t seen a difference with that but! I will deff keep using it!</li>
    <li> I like the gel it is refreshing and feels nice around the eye...the pump however broke after 2nd use....maybe just a fluke pkg manufacturing error...?</li>
    <li> Although I have not been using this eye gel for very long. I already see an improvement in my looks. The area around my eyes is less puffy and some of my age lines have started to disappear. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is lightweight. It feels nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It&#x27;s perfect for spring/summer (nice and cooling) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for a week now and already i see a huge difference my bags are dissappearing and the blackness around it is even starting to disappear</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this lives up to its claims, but it has basically no smell and feels really good on my skin.  I have quite a number of skin allergies and this did not trigger any of them.</li>
    <li> This eye gel really worked for me. Within a couple of weeks it reduced puffiness and dark circles. I have tried a number of different products and was pleased enough with this one to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks now.  I really enjoy the texture and the tingle when applied.  It&#x27;s not too oily and absorbs quite nicely.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using it more and seeing results.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was a great deal and I have been starting to get wrinkley eyelids and dont wish for that to progress any further. It is a gel but doesen&#x27;t leave the gel like residue that I was worried about. It&#x27;s like a silky thick gel. It makes my skin super soft and I can&#x27;t wait to see how the results progress.</li>
    <li> On fine lines it had an immediate result which I love</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and smooths out fine lines!</li>
    <li> Great Eye Gel...smells like cucumbers! Gives the eyes a wake up look (under eye bag remover)!</li>
    <li> This brand isn&#x27;t under the name for Adovia brand which I like but this formula is not performing as I would like. It is smooth but doesn&#x27;t have any lasting benefits as expected.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing. I usually have puffy eyes in the morning and this brings them right down. It blends quickly and feels cool.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the product.  Does well removing fine lines and wrinkles, have not been using long enough to comment on the dark circles.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I really like this!!  Its halfway between a gel and a creme, wonderful texture, very soothing and rich in emollients.  I&#x27;m going to want to order it again!!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Thanks! Thanks! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Helps to reduce small lines/wrinkles around eyes.  I noticed a difference after about two weeks of using product.</li>
    <li> Delivers as promised.  With a smooth consistency that glides on so wonderfully I can almost feel it working to hydrate and nourish the delicate eye area.  It smells lovely and provides a mild cooling effect.  The convenient pump dispenser keeps light and air-sensitive ingredients stable.  Great value for the money.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The pump didn&#x27;t work, so I never tried it out.........I did order my l&#x27;Oreal Rivalalize that I used</li>
    <li> True to its name! This is the best eye cream I have ever tried. Love the smooth texture, the way it absorbs and how fabulously it works. I have tried all the &amp;#34;goPURE&amp;#34; products and love them all!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every night for a few weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it does anything other than moisturize the eye area. It is a decent moisturizer though, and does not cause irritation  even if it gets in the eye - so that&#x27;s definitely a plus. I will continue to use it because I need moisturizer for my eyes and most moisturizers tends to cause them to water.</li>
    <li> I like that the product is 100% natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t notice a great difference yet in using it for the past week.  But, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, so that&#x27;s always a benefit in a moisturizer.  I like that it comes in a size that easy to use for travel as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and after using the Eye Gel for about two weeks I&#x27;ve seen amazing results on her. It has helped her a lot with her deep wrinkles. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a few days. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet. I&#x27;m assuming it takes more time for it to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably way past time for me to start applying an eye cream, so I got this..I cannot get any gel out of the pump!!!  I pumped it until my finger went numb...oh well, that&#x27;s what I get for being vain</li>
    <li> Great product. Seems to work as described by quickly diminishing the prominence of fine lines.</li>
    <li> Feels good reduced puffiness.I haven&#x27;t noticed my dark circles going away yet.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for a week , i can already noyice a difference</li>
    <li> Highly recommend both this product and vendor. Service was excellent, and I have come to place complete confidence in all things Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice. I began buying strictly for my wife, but over the years purchase as much if not more for my personal use. I use products from Cleo daily, and look forward to including this new, great feeling, and high quality eye cream.</li>
    <li> i received this product for free for my unbiased and honest review and i absolutely LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and see a major difference in my face. I&#x27;m a stay at home mother of 4 and taking care of myself is my last priority. I&#x27;ve never really thought twice about the bags under my eyes and honestly didn&#x27;t even think they were that bad until I actually corrected the problem. This gel takes 2 seconds to apply and it works wonders! I saw a major difference within a couple of days, take a look and see my results just after 2 weeks. If your tired of looking tired and want fast results i HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like this. My face even felt good hours later.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I love how it feels when I put it on my face, and it has been helping my skin look clearer and more youthful!</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this product at least 2 weeks of use before reviewing.  I like it a lot.  It works just as well as some of the more expensive eye cream I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for almost 2 weeks now. I strongly believe you need to give it a little more time to really notice if a product works on your skin but so far I really do like this product. There are not many ingredients I don&#x27;t know of that are in this product and that is a very important part of an eye cream. You do not want your eye skin to get used to using certain types of products and then they continue to need that ingredient over time. I like that this doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting (which many do just from being near my eyes).I will continue to use this eye cream and if I keep noticing improvements, I will purchase more :) Thank you for the trial</li>
    <li> am using it everyday and really like results has reduced puffiness and didn&#x27;t know had dark circles until they were gone. great product</li>
    <li> Great product! Really made a difference in the puffiness around my eyes!</li>
    <li> I bought product to get rid of under eye bags. Reduces my under eye bags by 60%. Works well under make up especially. Last all day.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product ! I have been using this for two weeks and have seen a noticeable difference in my dark circles. The gel is cooling and absorbs fast . You don&#x27;t need much product , it&#x27;s light not heavy on the skin ! I can&#x27;t say enough good things ! Go get this !</li>
    <li> I have already bought another one. Amazing and smooth~</li>
    <li> Takes the puffiness away :)</li>
    <li> Feels really nice. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my contact lenses. Smooth, but non-greasy. No scent to speak of.</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old and have very sensitive skin.  I often get eczema around my eyes which has probably caused my eyes to look older than they should.  This product did not irritate my skin.  I found it to be very soothing.  I have used it for approximately 3 weeks and it seems to have softened the wrinkles around my eyes and improved the overall appearance of my eyes.  It is reasonable priced and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed,  before i bought the cream I careful read ALL the reviews,  I couldn&#x27;t not wait to use it, BUT 😕 is been Two WEEKS, NO IMPROVEMENT ON MY UNDER EYES PUFFyNESS,  well I&#x27;m still hoping..😕😕</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for about two weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The puffiness and dark circles have lessened and all but disappeared!  My skin looks firmer and brighter!  The product also smells amazing, which has no bearing on its effectiveness, but thought it should be mentioned!  I look forward to ordering more!</li>
    <li> The product shipped quickly however the cover was broken and does not stay on the bottle. The bottle is very light which makes me wonder if it is half empty. There was no safety seal on it either. I have not used the bottle because of the above reasons.</li>
    <li> Nice soothing eye gel with great ingredients, like the added benefit that it helps set my eyeshadow.  Helps keep eye area moist all day without being sticky, didn&#x27;t notice a big difference in relieving eye puffiness, but overall a good product.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Have only been using for a few days.  Product glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb which is a plus.  I didn&#x27;t have any eye irritation or feel a burning sensation when it was applied.  No visible results so far but I think I&#x27;ll give it another month or two to see what happens.</li>
    <li> Received the eye cream today. I bbelieve it worked on my first try. The smell was pleasant, that or cucumbers and the cconsistency was not too thick and dissolved nicely. Very nice amount for eye gel. Im looking forward to seeing results after a few more days of usage. Seems to do what it claims. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have noticed reduced under eye puffiness and some softening of crows feet.  Application is smooth and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> No dramatic differences noticed, but nice going on - feels nice under makeup.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is awesome.  Having an olive complection,  I have always dealt with dark circles under my eyes. They have almost completely diminished in a week or so.  As well as the puffiness.  It really is a great product.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> First off I love the smell, smells just like a fresh cut cucumber! I love how smoothly it can be applied, not sticky like others I&#x27;ve tried! I like to keep mine in the fridge for better results for depuffing! I gave this a four star because its not the miracle cure but it does work pretty well!!</li>
    <li> I am still not sure. It goes on nicely, and does hydrate the eye area. It does not tighten the under eye quite like some other products, but also does not leave the area shiny, waxy- looking. I think I like it</li>
    <li> Love not having black bags under my eyes</li>
    <li> This eye gel is very similar to the various brands that I have previously tried.  The ingredients are basically the same and this even smells the same which almost smells like a cucumber.  It is not greasy on the skin and absorbs quickly and only has a slight odor.  This does seem to be as effective as the other eye gels so far as what I have previously used.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin in any way.  I will update my review over time once I have a few weeks of use but so far this is doing what it says it does, although I don&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle worker and have realistic expectations from this in the long run.  I also suggest comparing the ingredients list and going with the best priced brand for the size of this type of eye gels since the basic ingredients of most are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Cooling eye gel also helps with bags under the eye. I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in the lines around my eyes. It is very soothing</li>
    <li> Very cooling and a great smell. It was a small bottle so I am not sure if I saw reduced wrinkles but I love the cooling sensation and the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I could tell it was working after one use.  After several uses I can tell my eyes look brighter and firmer.  I had surgery last week and was out of the office for several days and when I returned all of my co-workers couldn&#x27;t put their fingers on what looked so different, but I know it was my eyes!!  I will be buying and using this for a long time!  Great packaging (very clean look), the lotion/gel is not too heavy, pleasant scent...GREATproduct!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is 100% natural and paragon free.  I am very careful to choose natural product for myself and my family. This eye gel goes on smoothly and feels cool and soothing around my eyes.  I first tried this product after a long tiring day at work.  It felt so amazing when I first applied it and after it dried I could feel it plumping and tightening the skin around me eyes.  It gave me a visible lift and I am thrilled with the results.  I am so lucky I was given a complimentary sample of this product for trial and review.  I would definitely purchase it again.  Great anti aging product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I liked the list of ingredients. It contains some powerful ingredients that work very well for their anti-aging properties. This gel goes on nicely, sinks in well, no problems putting makeup over it, etc. I agree w/others who said it smells like cucumber scented (but it is not overwhelming). So far very pleased with it, but I will need to use it longer to tell if it has significant improvements on the crows feet, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really to soon to get the results I would like. . But, I&#x27;ll give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product for 2 weeks now and so far I have not seen any improvement in the deep bags under my eyes. I am older and have definite bags and have tried many products to help this problem. I will continue to use this and hope that I will see some change and I will be thrilled and you will have a customer forever .. I use it as directed 2 times per day. Hope to see some difference very soon.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, not greasy. Works great under make up, does not cause concealer to crack or crease. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Great for peace of mind. If it actually works or not, I cannot say.</li>
    <li> tried this product and i am usually very sensitive.product worked and it felt cool and no side effects.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS LIKE TO LOOKING FOR NEW SKIN CARE &amp; EYE CREAM FOR MYSELF.  THIS IS 50+ HAS DEEP WRINKLE WOMEN,  I USE THIS EYE CREAM FEEL SOFT AND MOISTURE, LATER MY FINE WRINKLE DISAPPEAR.  I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCTS.     I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised.  I have been using this around my lips as well as my eyes and the skin looks as it did 10 years ago.  I highly reccommend this product for women of all ages</li>
    <li> I like how this doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and sticky but silky smooth. I&#x27;ve only have been using for a few days so not sure yet on long term but so far I like what I have seen</li>
    <li> I have been using Best Eye Cream for more than a week now and I expected a better result, because of all the review I read, but I guess maybe it will take more time to work, or this is all it will do for me, even though I don&#x27;t think is all that bad, is just not what all the talk was about.!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Seems to be working very well. Non greasy which is a great add on bonus!</li>
    <li> I had come across a discount code for this eye cream, so I thought I would try it.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days now and I can honestly say that it is very effective.  After an initial tingle, might just be me, it seemed to start working in about 10 minutes.  I noticed the bags under my eyes were smaller.  Over all I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, wanted to give it some time before I put a review.  First they need to modify their packaging a little, when I got the product some had leaked out and was all over the inside of the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have VERY sensitive skin around my eyes.  When I first put this on there is a little bit of stinging, but unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried the stinging faded quickly.  Neither did it leave the skin red, burned or peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only noticed a slight decrease in the circles under my eyes, however the skin around my eyes definitely feels and looks softer.  The little wrinkles I had starting aren&#x27;t as noticeable and there is a reduction of the puffiness I can sometimes have, even with allergies going crazy around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what happens after a longer period of use.</li>
    <li> So far I am liking this product.  However, I want to give it more time to see the long term results before moving it to a five star product.</li>
    <li> i was very pleased with this eye cream. i am 54 and after only using this for 2 weeks i noticed quite a difference this made on the crows feet around my eyes and the dark circles underneath. also, it seemed to help with the upper eyelids to lift my eyebrows up and you cant seem to notice the hooding above your eyes. anybody looking to try something natural with no harsh chemicals or smells should try this. it has really made a difference for me.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product so far</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream, it feels so lightweight. This product comes in a pump bottle, and a little pump of this cream goes a long way. If you press too hard, a lot of product will come out. I apply this day and night, and I wake up having a moisturized under eye compare to not using this product. The scent might bother some people, but to me it smells refreshing. The product also applies on cold which helps de-puff. This product is 100% natural and paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC: I was sent this Eye Cream for review through Tomoson. All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective. #eyecream</li>
    <li> This is an excellent eye cream, probably the best I have tried.  It is light and non greasy, yet it seems to moisturize the area around my eyes very well.  I&#x27;ve only been using the sample for about a week, and I like it so much that I ordered a bottle.  A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I struggle with some puffiness and dark circles around my eyes, so when I was offered a sample of review by goPURE, I was really excited. I&#x27;ve used this daily for 3 weeks now, and I love the way it feels on my skin. It works nicely under my eye make up, or you can use it before bed. I haven&#x27;t noticed the discoloration changing, but I think that has more to do with my allergies than anything else (and my dr. said nothing can really change that)... but the puffiness has totally been reduced. I&#x27;m totally buying more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> As a mom we all get worn out and sometimes look sick when we are not completely there. With this product you don&#x27;t look as worn out as you might feel. The helps with you not look as old as you are. It give you a natural glow and brightness to the eye area. My super dark circles and eye puffiness has lighten up big time. It has helped with the smaller lines around the eye area. The deeper ones are lessen but not completely gone. For the little time I have been using it I am very happy with this product. It is a bonus that is made in the USA. I can not wait to find out if this will make me look 10 years younger around the eyes when the two months are up from using this. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this for 3 mornings and first I thought it was a coincidence but the slight puffiness under my eyes grew larger after applying the product. I had such great hope for this eye cream based on others&#x27; reviews. I am not able to review on the &amp;#34;fine wrinkle&amp;#34; aspect if it helps or not since I will discontinue use and return it. Also it arrived without a safety seal/ sealed box which makes me hope I didn&#x27;t get someone else&#x27;s return.</li>
    <li> Love it! I apply at night before bed and I wake up looking refreshed even if I don&#x27;t feel it my eyes are less puffy and the dark circles are less visible</li>
    <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working, but after a week, I noticed that the eye area was brighter and smoother. I use it every night and in the morning, I see a difference.  It&#x27;s ggod stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it would help with puffiness and it does not help reduce puffiness with me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thru a special offer from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice because I can&#x27;t resist an amazing offer. I would never have bought it otherwise because I don&#x27;t have dark circles or puffiness and my eye cream does a good job on my light wrinkles -- but something very interesting happened. After just one week of using this, I realized that my eye area was much brighter. I started looking at pictures and realized that while I don&#x27;t have dark circles, my eye area had definitely dulled, and slightly darkened over the years without my noticing. Now that the bottle is empty the difference is really quite noticeable. Wow! Go figure. Also, it does a serviceable job on my light wrinkles -- not the best wrinkle reliever I&#x27;ve used, but decent, and besides it does clearly indicate that it is meant more for darkness and puffiness, so fair enough. So I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with my new brighter eyes. Thanks! And as always, thrilled with CC&#x27;s amazing values, sales, and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Very pleased--1st time purchaser.</li>
    <li> I love to try out different creams, gels and serums for my face so I was excited when I was offered the chance to test this one for quality during a promotion period.  I would consider this more of a gel vs. a cream.  It has a thinner consistency and is almost clear.  Doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product, just my observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is in a pump dispenser, which I prefer over a jar with a screw on lid.  I feel like a lot of product is dispensed with just one pump.  I only went half way down and more than enough came out to do the sides, lids and underneath part of my eyes.  When it is dispensed, it has a mild cucumber smell, but that scent goes away after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin readily absorbed the product and I felt a minor cooling sensation while it was drying.  Nothing unpleasant.  After it was dried, my skin was not greasy or oily and felt slightly tighter.  This product can be worn under make up.  I also like that it is paraben free and contains all natural ingredients.  I have only been using it for a couple days so I cannot attest to long term use results.  So far, I like the way it keeps the skin around my eyes moisturized.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long but have noticed a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes from not sleeping and the puffiness. I will post an update in about a month which is what is recommended for this product to work effectively.</li>
    <li> I love your product it has helped my eyes so such</li>
    <li> This product is cool application and helps a lot with puffiness. I have allergies as well as dark circles and it helps both..:):)</li>
    <li> For the price of this item it does wonders! I love that it goes on and feels cooling! I have noticed the spots and fine lines fading a bit. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see the full effects but will keep it in my morning and evening skin routines! I love that the products are organic and there isn&#x27;t a scent to the product! It is something healthy for my skin and I love it!</li>
    <li> Very soothing eye gel. Haven&#x27;t been using long enough to seen any changed but it does feel so good on tired eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for 30 days now. I think it&#x27;s really great. I&#x27;m 40 years old and have spent most of my life in the Florida sun and am now paying the price. I notice that my eye area has plumped up quite a bit since starting this. My dark circles have also lessened greatly. I think this is a wonderful alternative to botox.</li>
    <li> MAGIC POTION. I have ALWAYS had dark under eyes. Now, they are evenly toned and smooth. goPURE is my new go-to.</li>
    <li> I am always looking to try new skin care products, specially eye product. This Eye Gel by goPure is full of skin enhancing ingredients like Matrixyl 3000, Plant stem cells, Hyaluronic Acid, Jojoba oil, Amino Acid blends. All of these provide anti- aging effects and reduce fine line and wrinkles and also enhance elasticity. It doesn’t contain any parabens, sulfates or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;The skin around my eyes seems to be developing fine lines and I want to try different products to see what works best for me. I have been using this for a couple of weeks. The gel consistency is easy to apply, as it absorbs quickly and seems to tighten the skin. I keep my eye gel in refrigerator and it feels so good to put this cool gel on. The cold gel also helps in reducing the morning puffiness.</li>
    <li> this is great eye cream. takes the puffyness down from arounfd my eyes.its an all natural eye cream. it isnt greasy nor is it sticky.the container is a perfect size to stick in your purse or bag and take it with you.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this Eye Gel, it&#x27;s smooth and spread easily on my upper eye lid, lower eye area and the corner of my eyes. I have been using another eye gel, Adovia Mineral Eye Gel for about a year. I tried the goPURE on my left eye and used my Adovia Eye Gel on the right side for a few days and I&#x27;ll report my findings. Later in the day, this new product had an effect on my upper eye lid. It seemed to peel open where the Adovia product didn&#x27;t have that appearance. I checked my left eye lid just in case there was a section that I had not completely spread out, but I didn&#x27;t notice the same irregularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I realize that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and not everyone would have the same results. Without product my eyes tend to be on the oily side. So I passed on the goPURE to my daughter. She has been an Adovia product customer for a number of years. She liked how the goPURE applied and didn&#x27;t have the same results as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re in the market for a new eye gel, give this a try. I&#x27;m sure my daughter would rate it a 5 star review, but due to the results of the product on my skin I can only say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; for a 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly, packaging was fine.  When I opened my eye cream some had leaked out into the lid.  It was not a big deal I just used that serum first and it was fine.  My first time using the product it tingled quite a bit, but not so much when I continued with the twice daily recommended routine.  This definitely reduced puffiness and my fine lines seemed to get finer.  It wears well under makeup, not cakey or flakey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times but I can def see results already. Great product</li>
    <li> This is Amelia Crowder and I enjoy the fact that goPURE eye gel is vegan friendly. Made with all natural, plant-based ingredients,&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;m getting what I pay for and something good for my health.</li>
    <li> I have only being using The Best Eye Cream for about a week now. Not much of an improvement yet.. but I&#x27;m going to use the full bottle and update my review. In all fairness.... I do have full bags and I will give it a little more time penetrate. .. fingers crossed</li>
    <li> Seems to work like other eye creams I have tried. Nothing extraordinary about this one.</li>
    <li> its was for my mom and she really loves it.  i know it has be used for long time to see actual result but so far so good.  best of all no irritation to the skin so far.  my mom loves it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve got a smaller eye area than most, or what, but I found this pump to dispense WAY too much product. A half pump was about enough for both eyes for me. I smelled a light cucumber scent, which made me laugh at first, because I found it quite distracting initially, but eventually grew to not only like, but look forward to the smell. The gel absorbs easily and quickly. I&#x27;ve tried similar eye products that left a shine on the skin (imagine my dismay to find that my under eyes glowed under black light on my sons field trip last year...), but there&#x27;s nothing of the sort here. I knew that I liked this eye cream pretty well, but I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how well it was working for me, until I saw the Before and After pictures. After about 10 days of consistent use, the wrinkles under my left eye are virtually gone, and my right eye is greatly diminished. I&#x27;ll absolutely replace this product when I run out. The good people at GoPure Naturals generously provided me this gel in exchange for my opinions on it, however, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have not been using the gpPURE long so I can&#x27;t say how it works for wrinkles but I do love the way it feels going on the skin. I also love the way this product smells. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I have been using this for a week now and I honestly notice a difference. Some of my puffiness under my eyes has gone down and the skin under my eyes feels tighter.</li>
    <li> The packaging is sleek and eye catching,  so far I&#x27;ve only used the product once,  the texture is similar to my foundation primer,  clear gel and smooth. So far I love it.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;creep into the eyes&amp;#34; if you accidentally over apply. I have noticed a marked improvement in puffiness and dark circles. I only gave four stars because of the packaging, it tends to dispense more product than needed. I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I used this product nightly for two weeks(also it says for best results use twice daily), and I saw great results. I don&#x27;t sleep well most nights, so my eyes get puffy most of the time. This eye gel kept my eyes from appearing puffy. Also I noticed the softening of the wrinkles around the eyes. My somewhat deep wrinkles smoothed out. Upon application, this eye gel feels slightly cool to the touch. It also has a pleasant cucumber scent.</li>
    <li> tried the cream for about a week now, seem to help a little.  I think I need to use it longer to see if how will it works</li>
    <li> I had tried another eye gel off Amazon a few years ago and had a bad reaction to it so I was a bit skeptical about trying another one.  Let me tell you this product worked like a charm... no issues!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it 2x a day for several weeks.  My skin is noticeably smoother and clearer.  I have had a white spot on the side of my nose for the past 2 years and within 1 week, it started shrinking.  It is now half it&#x27;s size and the only change in my facial care was adding this serum.&lt;br /&gt;My under eye area is lighter and the skin feels and looks hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I love this light, cucumber scent.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for the puffy bags under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 4 days and can see the difference.  I&#x27;m  hoping with time it will get rid of the dark circles I always seem to have.  I have very sensitive eyes and skin have had no problems with the lotion.  I also love the fact it has no scent.  It pumps out very easily and goes on smoothly, disappearing quickly.</li>
    <li> I received this try and so far like it, I believe it will help more as I use it, is soothing and smells okay, works in easily. I have very puffy dark under eye circles so will take a while before I get any real noticeable improvement but believe it will help.</li>
    <li> I got this from a promotional price, to test this eye cream, all I can say is my wife like it and she still using it . She did put it to my eye circle too.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, very nice soft smooth feeling after application. I&#x27;m using it just for a few days. I wake up not puffy! So far I like it!</li>
    <li> I have been using The Best Eye Cream by goPURE for about two weeks now and I can honestly say I can see a difference under my eyes.  This cream does NOT feel cool and refreshing when you apply it, but it dries without being tacky or sticky .. Just clean.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that I had raccoon eyes, but they were starting to get dark underneath near the corners with some puffiness towards the center.  This cream really, really, really worked to lessen the look that had started appearing for the past year.  I would highly recommend this eye cream and I am a person who is very sceptical about products that claim to work miracles, but I have to say, I am seeing such improvement every day I use it!  I will continue to purchase this product ....... I just can&#x27;t believe that it is really working.. It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I like this eye gel - it makes my skin feel tight after I put it on and it feels hydrating.  Not entirely sure what type of difference it will make, but I will continue to use it...</li>
    <li> Makes your eyelids feel so good !!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, feels good but don&#x27;t see a big change.</li>
    <li> The packaging was on the smaller size which is perfect for home use or travel use.  It has an easy to use pump and one pump is enough to cover both eyes.  Therefore, this bottle will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are great and the gel has a very cooling effect to it while absorbing immediately into the skin without leaving a sticky feeling.  Also, the fragrance is very refreshing smelling like fresh cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, I noticed a tightening of the skin in a very good way (not a dry uncomfortable tightening).  It is like it is giving you an instant eye lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark visible circles under my eyes and I know it will take some time to see a noticeable difference but so far, so good.  I have been enjoying this product and looking forward to seeing the changes and improvements it makes in the skin around my eyes over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, I would recommend :)&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to test and review in return for my unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I ordered it because it went on sale, and so I really didnt have any expectations. It gives a tingling feeling when you apply it, which I love, and its cooling when you put it on. It smells like cucumbers also. I wear it twice a day now because I love the feeling when you put it on.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, the products I use must NOT irritate the skin nor migrate into the eye causing further irritation. If a product does this, it is dispensed with quickly. Secondly, it must feel good on my skin. My eyes tend to be tender and easily irritated, so I certainly don&#x27;t want to worsen that tendency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does the GoPure Youth Glow Eye Gel Serum work for me? Well, it has not brought back the look of youth to this lady of-a-certain-age, but it hasn&#x27;t worsened either. It feels pleasant on my skin. On days when my eyes are most tender, I sense a slight tingling sensation which is not unpleasant or irritating - it just &amp;#34;is.&amp;#34; It has NOT migrated into the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vote is still out as far as I am concerned as to which is best - creams or gels. I like both. I can certainly appreciate the plus factors for gels as outlined below in the product information. I can give the Youth Glow Eye Gel Serum a vote of confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are my own. I was not compensated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps, but it certainly feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily for about a week. It has not helped the puffiness under my eyes. I had hoped that it would, I cannot even feel a tightening. Sad .</li>
    <li> I love it! Feels good. Smells good. Works great! I want more!!</li>
    <li> Great product, too small :)</li>
    <li> I have been testing Youth Glow Eye Gel by goPURE Naturals for about a week, it has really refreshing smell, feels nice on the skin, cooling and not greasy, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference yet. It says it will take 3-4 weeks for it to start working so I guess we&#x27;ll just have to keep using it and see if it does work like magic.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff is so great and calming under my eyes. I have dark circles and bags and this has helped a lot with the dark circles. I still have lots of puffiness but I have severe allergies and circulation problems. This is the best gel I have found for my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a week. With that being said I real live me the packaging the pump is a great feature! It feels very smooth and silky. It feels cool when applying. In the morning my eyes feel soft and moistureized. So far so good!!</li>
    <li> Works great haven&#x27;t seen anything yet but I&#x27;ll give it a while longer</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I have found. Reduced puffiness from chronic allergies and diminished look of fine lines. Makes my eyes look younger. And did not irritate my allergies. My age 58. Will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for about a week but am already seeing some of the fine lines fading, looking forward to seeing results as I continue to use the product. I just use a very small amount to cover the area under my eyes so it should last quite awhile. I ordered this on a Saturday and received it on Monday</li>
    <li> It works.  For people with dry skin would recommend to layer this eye cream with a mousterizer as it tends to dry up the skin.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t sticky.. feels nice.</li>
    <li> The eye cream hs have my puffiness a lot and my dark circles are even lighter. I will be purchasing this eye cream again</li>
    <li> Like the way it feels after applied to eye area</li>
    <li> Love it! For the first time a product that really works.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel. It makes my under eye area smooth and supple and it has a very soothing, cooling feel when you apply it. I use it in the morning before I apply my makeup and every night before bed. This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> My dark circles are hereditary so I don&#x27;t think anything will ever get rid of those.  I do notice that when I use it, my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy and I look more awake</li>
    <li> I have noticed a dramatic change under my eyes, the darkness is getting lighter</li>
    <li> This eye gel did not burn like most eye creams do on me. I liked the texture and really felt like it tightened the eye area. It has only been a couple of weeks, but I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Waste, changed nothing. I used for over 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I found this Eye Gel to be hydrating and revitalizing, it does indeed seem to deliver when it comes to alleviating puffiness, dark circles, and general signs of fatigue around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely a keeper for me - the ingredients list is impressive, its fragrance-free, color-free eye and made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to cool on contact and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a promotional product in order to use it and share my objective opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product worth trying!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and the seller delivered it on time! I definitely recommend this to any customer,  that wants to reduce under eye circles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> I really have not seen significant change while using this product..</li>
    <li> I started using the eye gel the evening I got it.  I applied it on my face after washing it and patting it dry.  I gently applied around my eyes, under my eyes and on my eye lids.  It felt nice and smooth with a cool feeling and gave my eye area a moisturized feeling that was not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;There is a very light scent that wasn&#x27;t bothersome to me.  I do however prefer eye serums and eye gels to be scent free since I have such sensitive skin around my eyes.  I had no problems with itching or irritation from goPure&#x27;s Youth Glow Eye Gel.  Having no smell or scent is just a personal preference of mine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel by goPURE for about 2 1/2 weeks now and really like how soft my skin around my eyes look.  I have noticed that I no longer have puffy eyes in the morning.... YAY!!!!  I&#x27;m so not a morning person so at least I look a little better :)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any fine lines appearing and my results so far since starting the goPure Youth Glow Eye Gel are nice feeling skin and a nice texture.  I do think it takes longer for results major results.  Any beauty product unless it&#x27;s cosmetic surgery needs time to start working and taking the dead damaged layers away first before we can see genuine results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying using this eye gel so far and I think it&#x27;s a positive thing when you can restore moisture to your eye area so that you can prevent lines puffiness from starting.  This is a great cream to use everyday and the price is very reasonable.  I received this product in exchange for my honest opinions.  Anything and everything I share are 100% my own feelings and results.</li>
    <li> I have ran the gamut of face creams and serums and now that I am on an all-natural, organic bandwagon effective prodCuts are more difficult to source. Well look no more! I noticed a difference in the first week and my crow&#x27;s feet and puffiness continue to dissipate as I continue use. I love this product so much I recently purchased their face serum with vitamin C and hyaluronic acid (among other wonderful ingredients - look for the deep blue bottle). Will continue to keep this little gem in my face gem in my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and already notice a difference.  I love how smooth it goes on and it feels cool and I think that helps with the puffiness alot.</li>
    <li> Cute bottle. Product came fast. Love that it&#x27;s made by someone who thought of us and our under eye issues. Haven&#x27;t used it yet because I&#x27;m finishing up an old eye cream but will update later.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.It works so well.I seen instant results and suggest this to anyone !</li>
    <li> Helps reduce fine lines</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a little over a week now, and while I feel it&#x27;s a little to early to see any major differences, it has made my fine lines around the eyes seem a little smoother. I really like how smooth this goes on and doesn&#x27;t irritate. It also has a nice cooling sensation when applied, and absorbs quickly. I also like that it&#x27;s 100% natural. I think its definitely time I incorporate some kind of eye cream into my daily routine, so I&#x27;m going to continue to use this. Only time will tell I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this item for free, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in 2 days. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and havent noticed any changes regarding the fine lines or dark under eyes area ( I use it every night and every morning). I will write another review when I finish the product.</li>
    <li> I am overall very impressed with this product. It smells like cucumbers and i absolutely love that. It works so well. I have replaced my previous eye cream with this one. It&#x27;s so hydrating and i recommend it to anyone. I will be repurchasing this product again. I love that it contains natural ingredients. I am all for natural. The label is very attractive. I love the baby blue and white.</li>
    <li> I like this gel, it has a nice feel after applying. I&#x27;ve only been using it for one week so I can&#x27;t claim to know if it is truly worthy of its &amp;#34;youth glow&amp;#34; title. The company keeps asking me to write a review, which I don&#x27;t mind but how am I supposed to know yet. Other than that I personally find it easy to dispense too much and have to intentionally half-press the button. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out around the cheeks like some other creams and gels so I&#x27;m happy about that. I&#x27;ll update when I have more long term results.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  It is very refreshing and makes the skin around my eyes feel silky.</li>
    <li> The gel helps tighten skin and fine wrinkles.  It seems to help with my dark circles after a couple of weeks of using I would recommend this product and definitely Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice.  Always a happy customer, thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the eye cream for about two weeks now, and I really like this product! It isn&#x27;t very expensive and it is very easy to use.  One small squirt is ample to use for both eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and evening and in such a short time, I can definitely see a difference.  My eyes feel more hydrated and less puffy.  I love the texture of the cream and it goes on smooth and feels cool on your skin.  In addition the eye cream smells really good (like cucumbers) and it dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am anxious to see the long term results.  In such a short time my eyes feel more hydrated and less puffy, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effect on my dark circles.  I definitely recommend this eye cream and will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is amazing! I  have had ait about a week now and every night I have used it before bed and it really does help&lt;br /&gt;with dark circles !  it is not heavy or greasy nice and light you hardly even know you put something on! A great product and I will&lt;br /&gt;definitely be buying more of this!</li>
    <li> As a new mom, puffy bags and dark circles are my badge of honor.  But thank goodness for this amazing product! It goes on smoothly, smells of white tea (so fresh!) and works so well!  It has amazing ingredients like Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells, vitamin E, and their awesome peptide complex. I can assure you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This eye cream really does reduce under-eye shadows and puffiness.  Just be sure to remove&lt;br /&gt;it between applications, in order to not create a buildup.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This eye treatment smells so nice (like cucumbers). I really like the texture and a little goes a long way. The pump is really nice too. I haven&#x27;t been using it too long but my eyes do feel refreshed!</li>
    <li> This was a nice cream, not greasy</li>
    <li> After using this product for one week, I can actually see results.  My eyelids are not quite as droopy and lines at the edge of my eye are not as visible.  I did not expect results so soon.  I know I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Got this for an insanely low price to review it and just love it.  I&#x27;m 56, fair skinned, and often have dark circles and look tired. (hell, who doesn&#x27;t get that way some times?).  It is a huge help with those and helps me look more rested.  Happy I found this!</li>
    <li> Just received my Youth Glow Eye Gel. It comes in a pretty blue pump bottle. You can adjust the amount you want to use. All natural ingredients which I love. No smell to it and it goes on very smooth. Makes your skin fell silky. Very pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I used this product for a month. I can not believe how well it has worked.</li>
    <li> I just recently tried gel eye cream and love it so much better than the lotion. It soaks in right away, decreasing the appearance of my wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film. I recommend trying this if you haven&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days so I can&#x27;t say whether it helps or not yet but I love the feel and smell of it.  It feels and smells very fresh--a light light cucumber scent.</li>
    <li> Yes. This is really the best eye cream, my results aré amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> This eye gel claims to get rid of dark circles, under eye puffiness and eye bags.  I was totally sold!  I mean, c&#x27;mon, I work a full-time job out of the home, and when I come home, I have another full-time job of being a mommy and wifey!  I&#x27;m always tired and always struggling with dark circles and eye bags ALL THE TIME!  It&#x27;s pretty much the story of my life for the past 4 years!  So, when I had the opportunity to test out this product, I literally signed up without question! I received this product free to review and provide my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;So, a little bit about the product: It&#x27;s formulated with Matrixyl 3000 (sounds like a Nascar race to me!) which in a clinical study was proven to make eyes look 2 years younger in 1 month of use.  It has natural ingredients such as plant stem cells, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and a Proprietary Peptide Complex.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past several weeks now.  I apply the gel at night before I go to bed.  I can honestly say that I see a bit of a difference now although I&#x27;d like to continue using it for at least 2 months to see the actual results as the brand recommends using the product for that long to reap the full benefits of using this product – which is OK.  I don&#x27;t mind as I can slowly see some progression with the less puffiness around my eye area.</li>
    <li> Product does what it says I was a little skeptical but was amazed.</li>
    <li> Not real happy with this product.  Used it for 2 weeks 2 times a day and did not see any of the results they advertised.</li>
    <li> I really love product and natural smell. It works really well with puffiness but, have not seen to much of a difference on my dark circles. I have been using product for about 3 months. My skin feels refreshed when I use this product in the morning.</li>
    <li> After using the product for two weeks I notice my under eye area is not as puffy and a little less wrinkles. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Feel great on my skin and made the skin around my eyes look more brighter and less puffy.</li>
    <li> Amazing results. A little goes a long way. I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact when I received the product it leaked in the bag :( I highly recommend this product  to anyone. I personally have bags under my eyes and although it doesn&#x27;t take them away complete of course it surely helps them look smaller. The smell is great not overwhelming and you only need a pea size amount. Don&#x27;t hesitate just buy it :) thanks.</li>
    <li> I have found absolutely no improvement with this product.  Under eye darkness still there; slight puffiness still there; small wrinkles at the corners still there.  I don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s even on the market.</li>
    <li> Great product by goPURE. They&#x27;re a very good and reputable brand. I highly recommend this product to tired Moms! (HAHA). You can hide that you didn&#x27;t sleep!! Works great at hiding those tired eyes and dark circles. Definitely would recommend this no matter the age!</li>
    <li> Not tacky, works well, has a pleasant fragance. Doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes cakey if used with another product. No tingling or burning sensations. *Received for free to test the product.</li>
    <li> This is like a gel but a tad more creamy in texture - it is a cloudy consistency suspension and has no fragrance.  It feels refreshing and cooling to pat it onto the under-eye area.  The easy pump bottle dispenses a lot of product, but a little goes a long way so only about a half pump is needed.  I dab any excess on other problem areas such as frown lines.  I had no eye irritation at all after using this product and I have supremely sensitive skin.  I am thinking that putting this in the refrigerator will up the cooling and depuffing feature even more and would be uber refreshing in the summer!</li>
    <li> I used this for a few days and could already tell a difference. I have 2 kids under 2 so I don&#x27;t get much sleep and I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark circles have been getting more and more prominent. This has really helped my puffiness and dark circles and I don&#x27;t look so dead all the time. I feel and look younger and more alive! The scent it nice and fresh and it&#x27;s not greasy or irritating. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Other eye creams can irritate my eyes, causing itchiness and even redness. Not goPURE. There is zero residual irritation. It&#x27;s feels so soothing and even makes the skin under my eyes feel a bit firmer throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen eye creams and would put this one at or near the top. I do think gels (as opposed to undereye creams) are the way to go. They have a cooling property that is very soothing and does a more effective job with puffiness. I haven&#x27;t found the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; cream that will get rid of my puffiness completely (I think it&#x27;s called surgery, which I&#x27;m not willing to explore), but this product is still a winner.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I don&#x27;t have too much eye puffiness so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but this is a nice eye gel. It&#x27;s thicker than any other eye gel I&#x27;ve used, and doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes as the day wears on.</li>
    <li> I have huge bags under my eyes. I have seen some improvement. But I used it all.  Dense</li>
    <li> Keeps the dark circles at bay and makes the sleepless mommy eyes look brighter and the lines less noticeable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if this product really eliminates under eye bags and wrinkles however in the two weeks I have used it I like the gel/cream texture.  I would buy this again...</li>
    <li> This truly is the BEST eye cream anywhere!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot, and this by far has worked the best! Other brands, have left my eyes irritated. This doe not! It goes on smooth &amp; is not greasy. I love my new eye cream!</li>
    <li> Pump not working  product looks like it was used very disappointed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product; however, it seemed to make the skin around my eyes more oily. It&#x27;s very difficult to put on eyeliner and mascara. I also found that it really did not reduce my puffiness or dark circles.</li>
    <li> This eye gel has a nice light refreshing cucumber scent which i do like, It feels nice, cool and refreshing on the skin which is great for those tired eyes. I do think it helps with the puffiness and fine lines, your no going to see dramatic results by any means which lets face it there is not a miracle product that i know of that would do that. It comes in a pump which is easy and convenient to use. I am glad i was given the opportunity to receive this product complimentary and provide my honest and true opinion.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye gel!&lt;br /&gt;First, let me express how much I love that this product is all natural and paraben free! It is so hard to find good quality health and beauty products that are paraben free. Especially without overpricing them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included some photos of the product and the box with ingredients for anyone who was wondering what it looks like and what is listed on the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I noticed as I began using the product:&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a natural scent to it, it smells a little like citrus. Not an overpowering smell and it did dissipate after rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;At first the gel was a little sticky, but after it absorbed it feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Do not press down on the pump fully, you will get too much product and waste it. Press gently and you can make the product last a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;It did not sting, burn, tingle or anything. No reaction. Huge plus! I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 10 minutes I noticed a big difference in the puffiness under my eyes. I was pleasantly surprised. It works better than the eye gel that I use from a large chain department store. I must admit, I didn&#x27;t think it would, but I&#x27;m glad I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I would give the con&#x27;s to the product but I can&#x27;t find any. It didn&#x27;t 100% completely remove all of the puffiness from under my eye but I don&#x27;t think that is actually physically possible under any product or circumstance. So I&#x27;m going to be realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who was like me and buying very expensive chemical laced products from the big chain stores! Put that money back in your pocket and get natural!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye  product twice a day and I have had great results! No more puffiness under my eyes or circles! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of all natural products, so I gave this a try. I don&#x27;t have too many under eye issues yet, and I&#x27;d like to keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts and have very sensitive eyes. Many eye creams can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) be used with contacts in, and I leave mine in for two weeks at a time. I never had any issues with this gel bothering my eyes or contacts.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for people with sensitive eyes. It absorbs quickly, and works well with no make-up days; as well as under sheer foundation.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and silky when I put it on. I have not used it for a long time so I do hope it begins to help me with the dark circles under my eyes</li>
    <li> I love this product leave my skin smooth</li>
    <li> Today I am bringing you from Go Pure, their All Natural – Eye Gel and doesn’t everybody need help with their eyes every once in a while? I don’t care how old you are, if you don’t get enough sleep, you are going to have bags under eyes, or if you aren’t drinking enough water, you will see some fine lines appearing from dehydration. That is where this Eye Gel comes in. If your a mom, even a young mom, you know exactly what i am talking about when I say no sleep and bags under your eyes! A few squirts into your hand of this Eye Gel and you get an instant relief from the dryness! This helps, at least for me, in brightening up my eyes, when I seem to have gotten no sleep! A few drop in the corners of your eyes, will make you seem like you have no bags, even when you know you do!&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are a young woman, if you have gotten a horrible nights sleep, your eyes can make you look 10 years older than you really are, do you agree? That is why I am loving this Eye Gel from Go Pure! It can instantly give you your 10 years back in your eyes, just from applying in the corners of your eyes and underneath also!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  After just 1 week there is a visible difference.  Many Eye creams I have tried make my eyes itch and burn and I was very skeptical about this one as well.  I am so thrilled with this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Leaves a nice cool sensation and my eyes look great!</li>
    <li> I think this product did a good job making the fine lines around my eyes appear less noticeable. I&#x27;m not sure it it was just filling in these lines or was actually making them smaller permanently. I really like the results though and will continue using it. You can&#x27;t beat the price, it is an extremely good value. As other reviewers mentioned the eye area does tingle when you first apply the eye cream. I liked this sensation i found it invigorating and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have fine lines around my eyes, so I tried The Best Eye Cream by goPURE. I have been pleasantly surprised with this product. Upon applying the product I could feel my skin firming up. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Being a mom, this stuff is so useful! It decreases the look of dark circles and puffy eyes from lack of sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eye cream for about a week, but it feels great going on, very smooth, wears well under makeup, no creasing or caking.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in dark circles or fine lines, but it does seem to decrease puffiness, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see other changes!  The gel consistency is very nice, and you barely need to press the pump to get an adequate amount of product for both eyes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much from this product because of the low price point but I&#x27;ve been very pleased. Feels great and seems to make a difference.</li>
    <li> Product has worked very well so far. It&#x27;s not greasy, works well day and night so you can put it on before you put on your makeup.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product! It feels good, very cooling, and definitely reduces puffiness. I feel good that it&#x27;s a natural product!</li>
    <li> Have used for a few days and am very pleased to see a difference in the puffiness around my eyes.  Had some reservations about trying a new product but am very glad that I did.  I will be purchasing more of this once my bottle runs out.  Very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Many eye creams and gels make my eyes water all day.  I&#x27;m happy to say that this did not.  I like this product and feel it helps with circles/fine lines.  Unfortunately, I may be too old for this product.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and find that loose skin around the eyes were actually sticking together!  I&#x27;ll continue using it for lips and forehead though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eye gel for two weeks, so I can&#x27;t comment on long term permanent benefits. It does provide  a fast reduction in the puffiness that I get under my eyes. It has a very light cucumber scent, and I enjoy the cooling effect as I smooth it on. The pump works well, I find that one pump gives me enough for both eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye gel feels sooooo good! So cooling and refreshing. I love that it&#x27;s 100% natural and paraben-free. One thing I definitely don&#x27;t need more of is chemicals! Especially in the delicate area around my eyes. I don&#x27;t suffer often from dark circles, so I can&#x27;t say how this product works with dark circles, but I do have the beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet and I can honestly say they appear diminished after only a few uses. If this product does nothing else but keep my crow&#x27;s feet under control, then I&#x27;m happy! LOL</li>
    <li> This product goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. Works well and leaves the area around my eyes looking healthy and glowing. Really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast. I received it a day earlier than I expected. I have used this for a couple of days now. You simply put it under your eyes twice a day. You get a tightening feeling immediately upon application. YOu also get this calming cooling sensation too.  My bags under my eyes are noticeably diminished.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t noticed much improvement.  Some days it help with puffiness better, some days does not do anything. I used it 2 times a day. I am glad it does not make my eyes itch. I wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying I got this product for free for the purpose of my review my opinions are my own I was not paid or told to say any of this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking to go on the more natural side of things when it comes to my skin care I was excited to try this but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice big changes it really didn&#x27;t do anything that it said it would do and I have since stopped using the product and moved on to something else it just did not work for me</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference. Maybe helped with puffiness but not dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about 10 days, but I am beginning to see less puffiness under my eyes.  The dark circles are still there, but it is also allergy season so I&#x27;m fighting two battles there.  I&#x27;m hoping for the dark circles to abate also. I also think that that skin is smoother with the wrinkles less prominent.  It does make the skin feel softer around the eyes so I will continue to use it and see how much improvement I will get.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the product. :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. One night and dark circles are disappearing. I can&#x27;t wait for my 1 week results !</li>
    <li> I tried this and could tell no difference the first day. After a week, however, I can finally see a difference. I was skeptical but now am a believer.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff. Kind of a cross between a cream &amp; a gel, and the dispenser keeps it fresh and allows easy control of how much comes out. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that this cool, fresh gel really gets rid of puffy eyes, but does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I may be wrong, but it appears to be helping with the dark circles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is unobtrusive, doesn&#x27;t irritate, and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like that it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a dry, tight, or fragile feeling like many other eye creams have in the past.</li>
    <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin soft and hydrates too!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really works. If I had a long night out my eyes need some of this and I don&#x27;t look so worn out anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clear gel for about 2 weeks now.  A little goes a long way. The skin under my eyes is very sensitive; so far, I&#x27;ve had no irritation or burning sensation while using this twice a day.  It does seem to have reduced the puffiness under my eyes; it hasn&#x27;t gone away completely, but then I don&#x27;t think anything would do that other than surgery.  I&#x27;m hoping I might notice even more difference the longer I use it; two weeks isn&#x27;t a long time.  I especially like the fact that the ingredients are natural without a lot of chemicals, which are so harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product at night and my eye area still feels moisturized first thing in the morning - something I have not experienced with any other product.  Also great because my mascara doesn&#x27;t smear when using it.</li>
    <li> Love the cream but my only issue is the bottle wants to dispense more than I need.</li>
    <li> I have used it in total about 5 to 7 times. It is still early but i think my eye area looks younger. I have previously used caffeine based products that constrict blood vessels and makes under eye area tighter. This one works differently. I guess more slowly but seems it will produce more lasting results.</li>
    <li> My bags have gone using this!!! :)</li>
    <li> This is a good product - it&#x27;s soothing and smooth, and it has a light, refreshing smell like cucumbers. I like it, and will keep using it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any WOW differences after using it a few weeks, but will update once product is gone.</li>
    <li> This eye ream went on silky smooth. It has a non- greasy feel. It reduces the crows feet puffiness around your eyes. It is in a perfect go anywhere size with an easy to use pump. goPure suggests you use it for at least a month. I am not to the one month time frame but I can see a difference already.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about a week, pleased with it so far</li>
    <li> I like the cooling effect of this eye gel.  It does not leave a film like other eye creams I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye serum. It is thick and smells a bit like cucumber. It has a cooling effect and helps to reduce puffiness. I apply every night before bed and have noticed a difference after just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  After almost two weeks of use, I&#x27;m seeing a visible improvement in the first-thing-in-the-morning eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> great product, it really does what it says it will do. It helped my dark circle and reduce the puffiness</li>
    <li> Nice eye gel.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin or irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and I liked that but I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement</li>
    <li> She loves it, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I bought three more this week to share with my daughters&lt;br /&gt;It does a good with those ugly bags , I keep one in the refrigerator , the coolness feels great !!!</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this for 2 weeks so i have not seen a significant change in dark circles under my eyes but they do say that it takes about a month to see a noticeable difference. I can say though that I love how soothing this gel is. I have very sensitive skin overall and many products irritate me but this stuff feels so soothing. I do plan to continue using it and will give another review after a month if I notice a huge difference in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Its ok. I have been using it for a week now. The eye cream feels fresh and cool to the skin which is great. I have not noticed any significant change with my dark circles and just a very slight decrease with puffiness under the eyes. So would i buy again- prob not but it feels very good on skin.</li>
    <li> WOW! I can use this when and I don&#x27;t have bags under my eyes. I especially love it when I am so, so, so tired. It takes away that tired tell tale signs your eyes have. and the crows is slowly disappearing.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this Eye Gel, it&#x27;s smooth and spread easily on my upper eye lid, lower eye area and the corner of my eyes.It feels nice on the skin, cooling and not greasy, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference maybe because I&#x27;ve used it only for a few days, and that is the same reason I gave it 4 stars .It  feels nice on my skin. I like the easy to use pump dispenser. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin but I doesn&#x27;t make my skin look any different. It says it has NATURAL INGREDIENTS and contains Plant Stem Cells, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and a Proprietary Peptide Complex. I will update my review after 2 months again .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week now but definitely see a difference with the dark circles.  Really wish I had done the before and after pics. The jury is still out for the wrinkles.  I will update in a month.  That is the only reason it only gets 4 stars for now.</li>
    <li> Definitely a fantastic product that I will buy over and over again</li>
    <li> Great product, I am reducing the bags under my eyes plus it makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now , every morning I would always get asked if I was tired and if I did not get any sleep being that my eyes looked baggy, I have not had any comments since I apply at once in the morning and once at night and it&#x27;s been working fine for me, once I run out I will order another one and by then I should know if I should give it a five star,</li>
    <li> So far it has not helped me!</li>
    <li> It didnt do anything for me .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! its totally natural and made my tired eyes alive again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  A little goes a long way.  My eyes feel and look great.  Absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> No different than any serum you can buy in a drug store</li>
    <li> Gel sooths  area around eyes and gives skin a radiant glow. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice  affect on wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in day time because is lightwight , works better for me under my makeup that creamy formulas , is really amazing. I feel fresh and hydrated my under eye zone .</li>
    <li> Let me be honest...I am completely and utterly obsessed with making sure the skin around my eyes ALWAYS has a good eye cream AND then sunscreen on, at all times.  I started doing this in my late 20&#x27;s and here I am 50 years old with no visible wrinkles around my eyes. My skin around my eyes still looks like it did when I was in my 30&#x27;s, sure wish everything from the neck down did ; ). I purchased goPure Naturals Best Eye Cream a couple of months ago and it fits wonderfully in my eye cream regiment.  I layer it with another eye cream and my sunscreen and it has performed like a champ.  It moisturizers and lifts and isn&#x27;t to heavy where it would cause clogged pores and possibly zips :o). This is a good eye cream that I plan to continue to use.</li>
    <li> Goof product for price point.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and has a pleasant smell.  I have only been using it a short while but I can see myself ordering it again!</li>
    <li> After using for a few weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in dark circles fading, but puffiness under my eyes has seemed to go down.</li>
    <li> Very nice and cooling feeling. Has all natural ingrdiants which is awesome. Feels very moisturizing and left my under eyes feeling soft and awake.</li>
    <li> Light cream. Didn&#x27;t notice any changes for 2 weeks of using.</li>
    <li> I had just received this product yesterday and after only one use my eyes where less puffy. I used it again in the morning and there is a noticeable difference. It lightened the heavy dark circles around my eyes that I have had for years.  If this continues working this good, I&#x27;m going to switch to this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Got in on a discount</li>
    <li> Amazing and instant results. Eyes looked brighter after only 5 min after application</li>
    <li> DO NOT SEE ANY RESULT.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to have a 800-Number to call. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have another product which I use which is exactly the same. It appears to be working, because my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy, my circles have diminished some, and I love the cooling feature of the gel. I bought this at a major discount, so it definitely well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I trust goPURE with my skin.  I&#x27;ve purchased numerous products from them.  Their customer service is excellent and the products are all high quality.  As a Celiac (gluten free person) I am very careful what I put on my face, especially the eye area.</li>
    <li> nice size, bought as a gift</li>
    <li> I had just received this package and put on for the first time this evening. First, may I say, that the order was shipped expediently. Since applying my face feels so fresh, FIRM and smooth! So far, so good. I will write again for a follow up!</li>
    <li> Great product! The day after using the product, I seemed to have a useful glow. My eyes appear brighter and the skin in that area is less dry.</li>
    <li> The cream is well balanced and feels nice on your skin.  This product has been  used seven times and I see an improvement in the area around my eyes and circles underneath.  This is a good product but I believe I would not purchase because of the price.  Other creams do approximately the same type of improvement at a much lower cost.  Thank you for the opportunity to purchase this product at such a low cost - keep it there and I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Makes the area around the eye super soft and the under eye bags look noticeably better!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this out, I&#x27;ve been on an all natural kick for a little bit so I jumped on the chance to test this out. As soon as I (quickly!) received the eye cream I put it on and it felt sooo good. It had a very cool feeling and I attributed this due to the package being in my cold mailbox. To my surprise the next day it still had a very nice cool feeling as soon as I tapped it on which woke up my eyes, the scent is a nice light cucumber and not overwhelming at all. One pump is more than enough for both eye lids and under eyes and feels like a gel but glides on and dries so quickly. I loved how it was a primer for my concealer. I swear it made it last much longer and as a contact lens wearer it didn&#x27;t make my eye&#x27;s tear at all. It definitely made helped with my eye puffiness and using it twice a day for over a week I&#x27;ve noticed my under eye circles slightly lightning up. This bottle looks small but will last months and is worth every penny. I plan on purchasing as soon as I am done with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was given a discount to give an *honest* review by the company. It in no way affected my review *</li>
    <li> This is a cooling eye gel that is absorbed right away into the delicate skin around Your eyes. It does not sting or irritate the most sensitive eyes, I wear contact lenses. This is another great product from ADOVIA, so keep up the good work, You are amazing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple weeks now.  I really love the way it has diminished fine wrinkles around my eyes.  A few nights ago I had a horrible night&#x27;s sleep and woke up with terribly dark circles and puffiness.  I thought this would be the real test for this product.  I put a little under my eyes and within 15 minutes the puffiness and darkness were completely gone!  I am sold on this product!</li>
    <li> It feels great. I am hoping that it will help my dark circles. I have used it for 3 weeks and I think that I see a slight improvement.</li>
    <li> The cream is very light with a cool feeling.  I have been applying the product at night and in the morning.  I have noticed a little less puffiness under the eyes in the morning.  It does make the eye area feel good.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered in timely manner.  I&#x27;ve been waiting for a couple weeks to give a review to see how it works.  It seems to be doing a good job.  I would probably buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye cream as a sample for review and evaluation and have really like it! If you are looking for something all natural and paraben free I would give this a try. I also love that it is made in the USA. It has a very light pleasant scent (reminds me of cucumber) but it fades after you apply it. It has a nice gel type consistency to it that absorbs quickly and it has caused me no irritation. I use this for dark circles and my husband uses it for puffiness, both of which it reduces. Overall I am happy with this and I&#x27;m glad to have a nice all natural product for my eye area.</li>
    <li> I have always been conscious of my eye area and try to always try the new ones that come along unless I have one I am dedicated to. The first time I used this Eye Gel, it was so cool to the touch which told me it would immediately start working. I have read interviews with models who say they keep their anti-aging serums (only gels &amp; serums) in the fridge because the coolness will give instant effects and then in the long term you will see even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to use the whole bottle, but what I do see and feel so far, it&#x27;s going to be one of my top favorites for the eye area!</li>
    <li> I am able to use this product on my very sensitive skin. It has helped the appearance of the bags under my eyes in just a few short weeks.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of different eye gels trying to combat puffiness and this one lives up to its name - the best!  I could tell a tremendous difference after just a couple of applications.  Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I am always trying different eye creams and gels searching for the one that will make my eyes look fresh and rested. I was offered this Youth Glow Eye Gel from goPURE Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, of course I ordered. I used it in the morning and in the evening. By the following morning I looked like I had slept for 2 days! It was amazing how fast it started working. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to help their eyes.</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth without be greasy.  It has a fruity smell that&#x27;s appealing. I just received this and started using it right away. It does not effect your makeup routine since it absorbs right away.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have used this eye cream for a few weeks now.  I like the light refreshing scent, reminds me of cucumbers and I do notice the skin under my eyes is firmer and starting to lighten.  I work the night shift and this cream really helps decrease bags under my eyes on days I switch to bring awake during the day.</li>
    <li> This has been the most wonderful eye product I have ever purchased. I seen results overnight with this gel. I didn&#x27;t believe others reviews at first so I had to try the product for myself. It works better than the 100.00 designer gels at clearing up dark circles and blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days but I have noticed that I do not need to use the concealer under my eyes as much if at all. It is a really fast drying cream. I do wish that there were better directions on the amount to use but otherwise I am very happy with this product. It is fulfilling all of the things it said it would.</li>
    <li> This gel is nice, light and refreshing; cooling under the eyes.  I feel my eyes look less tired and puffy.  Definitely helpful to apply in the morning when my eyes are always at their worst.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for 10 day and I can really tell the difference. I love this gentile product!</li>
    <li> It definitely works for baggy eyes, not that I have them, but I feel it  tighten my undereye skin. I use every morning and night. My dark circles have gotten better, but they&#x27;re not fully diminished. Again, I have only used for 3 weeks, so they may go away.</li>
    <li> so far I really like, its light weight and makes my skin very soft but firm, hope to contimue to see resluts, takes very little</li>
    <li> I like how this eye gel felt and how it tightened the skin around my eyes after application. Helped to relieve the tired eye look that I frequently get. Great discount price and will consider using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Oh, it&#x27;s wonderful. and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Feels good and I love that there is no scent. Time will tell how well it works.</li>
    <li> Glides on easily, isn&#x27;t sticky, feels soothing and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny residue. I love this eye cream and will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is light, and undetectable under makeup.  Definitely helps with my puffy eyes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE everything made by goPURE! However, I am a bit disappointed with this product. I have dark eye pigmentation (dark circles) and was excited to see this reduce the darkness around my eyes. I have used this product five days a week for the past two weeks and I have seen absolutely no change whatsoever in the pigmentation around my eyes. I will keep using it and hope to see a change, but so far nothing.</li>
    <li> Have not seen much dark circle results, yet... but really appreciate how gentle it is on the area around my eyes!  Look forward to seeing some results!</li>
    <li> My mom isn&#x27;t  getting younger but she is constantly on the move and doesn&#x27;t get much sleep some nights. Due to this she has gotten puffiness aka bags and fine lines under her eyes. She has been complaining about it so I was happy when I saw this product and bought it for her. I read the reviews, both the good and the bad, and decided to give it a try. My mom was not disappointed and this makes me a great little daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small but it pack a punch of effectiveness with just one pump for both eyes.  My mom decided to use it at night as she thinks it will be more effective. Her method works and loke she said she rubs the cream under her eyes with a lot of love--ha. She really likes it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has reduce the puffiness under my mom&#x27;s eyes over the past few weeks of using it. This is free of unnecessary ingredients/chemical. It has a very light smell or hint of cool cucumber. It leaves behind no residue or build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a promotional rate and this my 100% honest and unbiased opnion. The views express in this review is all mine.</li>
    <li> I have terrible bags under my eyes and this clears them up somewhat. I feel much better about myself.</li>
    <li> Since receiving this product I&#x27;ve been enjoying the refreshing, cool feeling on my skin and the light cucumber scent. It definitely helps with tired eyes in the morning. As far as reducing wrinkles go, they say you should see results after one month of use, although I don&#x27;t have that particular problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does not contain parabens, sulfates, or alcohol and is safe for all skin types. I have very sensitive skin and it did not irritate me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small, but a little goes a long way. Just one pump is needed for both eyes.</li>
    <li> I was given this product through Tomoson.com to give an honest opinion and write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My honest opinion is that it works.  I have very sensitive skin so I was really afraid to try it around my eyes so I placed it around my chin to address those fine wrinkles.  It filled in some of the fine lines and the deeper lines were less noticeable.  I very carefully place it under my left eye and waited for the rash to begin like so many other product with hyaluronic acid.  The company claims:  “This eye gel is formulated with all natural, highly potent ingredients that are guaranteed to wake up tired, aged skin. Free from chemicals, fillers, alcohol and parabens, Youth Glow Eye Gel is pure, safe and gentle enough for all skin types. “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly what it claims.  It is Pure, safe and gentle enough for all skin types.  I watched as I placed it under the eye that had the most blue under eye circles and it started in the middle of the blue and with a puff of white and evened out the color to the corner of the eye within minutes.  The company claims: “Quickly reduce the appearance of under eye circles, bags or puffiness with goPure’s Youth Glow Eye Gel. This all natural gel provides noticeable results after a single use, and has been proven to make eyes look 2 years younger after just one month of consistent use.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if my eyes are two years younger but I can tell you if this proves to be true I may purchase this in bulk.</li>
    <li> so far so good. I&#x27;m still young so I do not have many under eye &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34;. however, it seems to be the perfect product to prolong the inevitable.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product after I purchassed it at a very fair price.  It i sokay.  I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed all that much of a difference in under eye puffiness or upper eyelid sagging.  The crow&#x27;s feet may be a bit under control.  I&#x27;ve come to believe no eye cream can solve all of the problems of Father Time.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a reduction in the puffiness around my eyes, but I have not been using it long enough to notice any difference in my dark circles, so I am hopeful.  I absolutely love that it doesn’t contain parabens, additives or artificial fragrance!</li>
    <li> This gel feels cold and tingly when you first apply it. Very refreshing. One pump is enough for both eyes. I am loving it so far.</li>
    <li> doesnt work at all&lt;br /&gt;only relief my eye but dark circles are never gone</li>
    <li> I like this eye gel, but it is hard to tell yet if it is  helping so far. I just got this, but happy so far! Feels very refreshing.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the very best cream i have ever used! It glides on and my skin still feels smooth hours later. It is Wonderful! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is 100% natural and paraben free. It has a light cucumber smell that I really like. The gel is completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dab some around my entire eye as directed and it does help with the puffiness. Also helps a little with dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff:)</li>
    <li> I received this free product to review for honest opinion, I’ve never really cared about makeup or face creams before. But recently that’s all I care about after having three kids lets just say parenting takes a toll on a persons face, lots of wrinkles and bags. No matter how early I try to go to sleep it just doesn’t matter my newborn is on her own schedule she will wake 3 or 4 times out of the night that’s when id look in the mirror and see those bags, So I decided to start searching and trying different products to see what would work.This product is full of ingredients made to within 30 days of appropriate use restore your eyes back to their youthful appearance before the dark circles and fine lines came out. The company claims that if you use it the way you should for one month you should gain back 2 years of your youthful skin. If not, this company, like many I support, offers a money back guarantee. There is a slight cooling feeling to the touch upon the skin but the product with its healthy ingredients appears to be safe for the even sensitive skin types I have VERY sensitive skin and had no problems with it! I haven’t been using the product very long but so far I give it 5 stars I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> get it. get it now. Why are you still reading? Your dark puffy eyes arent going to fix themselves. THIS will. It wonder order itself either.</li>
    <li> My look really refreshed and my dark under eye circles have really improved. Easy to use and great price for the quality. Definitely worth trying if your eyes look tired and you want to look younger and refreshed!!</li>
    <li> This eye gel smells way better than what I thought it would, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the smell lol. I bought it to correct my sleep deprived eyes, since I have a 4 and 1/2 month old, my sleep life has pretty much been sleepless lol. So I bought this thinking it will improve my eyes and it did, it wasn&#x27;t sticky, oily etc. its a clear gel that you put on around your eyes. I put it on one morning and then went to the store I forgot that I put it on (yea because of the baby lol, Strange how we forget so much once we have kids!) I looked in mirror thinking o my goodness everybody is going to see some junk on my eyes lol. But nope, I didn&#x27;t see anything to my surprise. This stuff dries real quickly so you can forget about it and go on your day to tackle your many battles. Now after using this the area around my eyes feel a lot softer. I will have to update this after I have been using this for awhile. But I already love it and will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Love the gel!  Feels cool going on.  My eyes aren&#x27;t tired and puffy looking.  Look refreshed and awake.  Fine lines are less or next to none.  Will continue to use this product!!</li>
    <li> This works as expected, makes my eyes feel cool and relaxed. Not sure how long the effects will last for, but it&#x27;s not bad for the promotional price that I got it for.</li>
    <li> Upon fast arrival of this product I used immediately. The first thing I noticed is how pleasant it smells. It went on smoothly and made my eyes feel less puffy and refreshed right away. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great eye cream.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good!! Price was just right too!  **UPDATE***   I&#x27;m in love with this stuff...really helps take away the bags under my eyes... Love it!</li>
    <li> I truly love this product!  I have been struggling with puffiness under my eyes.  This product has been a lifesaver!  I use it before my moisturizer and it really seems to help.  I love the light citrusy scent and the gel texture is nice as well.  I would recommend this to anyone with similar issues.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a GREAT reduction in the puffiness under my eyes! This is the first product I have found that has actually worked for me and I Love it! I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about two weeks now and have noticed a big improvement in my dark circles under my eyes. I have had them for many years and have tried just about everything on the market. This has shown the most positive results! I also have sensitive eyes and this does not bother them. I will use again and again. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Really works great, easy to use pump. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I received this an an offer for promoting the company and I must say that I am seriously surprised how much this product works.  I always have bags under my eyes from staying up late and sleeping little (life of a college student)  and this is amazing.  I immediately saw a difference in my puffiness as well as the tightness of the skin.  There is no smell which is great and it&#x27;s not all thick and heavy on the eyes.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to believe that it will be a miracle cure for the crows feet and wrinkles under my eyes, so I gave it a try. Used it for almost a month and no change. The gel feels very nice on my skin, absorbs fast, very minimal and pleasant scent to it. The pump does give little too much so have to use extra on the forehead.</li>
    <li> The Best Eye Cream by goPure is a nice light gel that feels cooling on the skin.  I does seem to reduce the chronic under eye puffiness I wake to every morning.  I like that it is a gel instead of a cream because it stays put, when I use a cream it seems to travel up and into my lower eye rim which is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams and gels and this is a good one.  I have used it for about 1 month and have been happy with the results.  Reduces puffy tired eyes and reduces the look of fine lines and wrinkles.  I will buy again great price for product.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works.</li>
    <li> Does what it says! that gives it 5 stars in my opinion!</li>
    <li> did not see a difference in the area beneath my eyes...made my skin feel dry.  i ended up not using the product anymore after 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember. I have tried almost everything on the market it seems. This one is actually making my circles lighter! They have not completely disappeared but I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> great, very gentle on eyes.</li>
    <li> Tried this thanks to a free sample to do a blog review. It has improved the dark area under my eyes making me look more rested and fresh. I personally recommended it to a family member who is in truly need of a product like this one.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I have been using this eye gel for about 6 months now, and have been very pleased with how wonderful it feels and its performance but recently I stopped using it for three weeks to try a new skin care regimen from my dermatologist. One eye is normally always noticeably puffier than the other (heredity), so my measurement is comparing the two.  But I&#x27;ll be damned, if after those three weeks, I noticed puffiness and darkness under my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; eye, which had previously disappeared completely! After a week, no improvement, so I added Go Pure Eye Gel back into my twice daily routine. It has been almost a week now, and not only do my eyes feel more refreshed, but I am starting to notice the puffiness reduce again. So if you are not sure if it is working, try going without it for a few weeks. On second thought, save yourself the aggravation, and just learn from my lesson!  (I wonder if Go Pure can formulate something to reduce pore size, that is next on my wish list! ) ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have been using this product for three months now, and absolutely love it. I am fifty-something years old and have always taken care of my skin. It took about eight weeks before I started noticing a difference. Only one under eye is puffy and it could be genetic or because I mostly sleep on my left side. But nothing ever seemed to help. While it is not totally gone, I have noticed a reduction. I have also noticed a softening of the fine wrinkles around my eyes and a reduction of the crepiness that is just below my lash line. If I could, I would rate this a 4.5, deducting half a star because I do not look 10 years younger as advertised. Like others have said, this gel feels amazing. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight, probably because the hyaluronic acid draws moisture into your skin.  You just need a little tiny dot, so unless you put it right and your nose, you don&#x27;t notice a scent; after three months I am still using the same bottle. Reading the list of ingredients, it has all the goodies of the high dollar facial serums, but not the high price. The packaging is simple, but the pump bottle appears to be the airless type, so I expect the product to remain fresh for a long time. I just reordered for two bottles, because the price was on sale and I got additional three dollars off of buying two. I want to see if this will also work on the wrinkles in my forehead.</li>
    <li> Works great. It diminished my dark circles and the puffy bags under eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream, I am a cancer survivor and have numerous facial problems due to chemo including my eyes. This product is soothing, wish they would add a little tint!</li>
    <li> The bags under my eyes have not completely gone but they are going..</li>
    <li> Love this product! Does not sting, feel tight or sticky around my eyes as most creams/gels have in the past. Have been using for nearly 2 weeks and have noticed a difference. I do not have excessive wrinkles or dark circles (which I&#x27;d like to keep that way!) but puffiness has been reduced. This is a keeper in my book....if something works I stop looking! Now going to look at other products from this company.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very comparable to the expensive skin care brands out on the market!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about two weeks now. I have VERY sensitive skin, and have not experienced any irritation or discomfort from using this product. It having natural ingredients was one of the reasons I purchased it. There was a deal on Facebook, it was legit. I ordered through Amazon, and it didn&#x27;t take long to receive it. I am 39 and had my daughter in January. I don&#x27;t have fine lines. My issue was that I looked like a raccoon; it was dark around the eyes. I have to say that I can tell that they&#x27;ve lightened up. I can feel the firmness; tightness each time I use it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. :-)</li>
    <li> This eye cream has really made a difference in my eyes. I work night shift and have two toddlers so I don&#x27;t get much sleep so I needed something that would improve my dark circles and bags.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!!! Love, love, LOVE this product. Most eye creams, serums, and gels irritate my eyes. goPure works perfectly without seeping into my eyes and causing discomfort. Total life saver that is completely natural.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working!  My dark circles are drastically reduced and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference, but I only used it for a week....</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say that I see any noticeable difference, but I still like it.  Nice consistency and I like the fact that it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
    <li> It smells like cucumbers but the scent dissipates asap.&lt;br /&gt;Very cooling.&lt;br /&gt;Says &amp;#34;BEST eye cream  but it&#x27;s a gel.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I received this a few days ago so I can&#x27;t comment on long term use. However I love that it is lightweight so I can use it in the morning under my makeup. It has a pleasant scent and my favorite part is probably the size of the bottle. It is a little bigger than a tube of Chapstick making it easy to carry on the go. It is also a pump so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting too much out each time.</li>
    <li> I got this product to use mostly as a preventative measure, but it has brightened up my eyes so well! I don&#x27;t have a big problem with circles under my eyes, but after using this product, I can see that the area under my eyes does seem brighter looking. I&#x27;ve even received compliments. A friend recently asked me if I was doing the new highlighting and contouring trend with make-up and I was proud to say that my eyes were brighter without the use of make-up. It is naturally looking better! And it is such a mild cream that smells soft and nice. I have sensitive skin and it is perfect for it! I have taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photo and after I have used the product for a couple weeks, I plan to post the contrast.</li>
    <li> Works well. Made my under eyes very smooth. I feel younger when I use this!</li>
    <li> I love the cool sensation after dotting this under my eyes. Works well and makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> Great gel! I feel instant tightening when used</li>
    <li> This is a great product for under-eye use because it soaked into my skin and did not leave a greasy residue and didn&#x27;t cause eye irritation.  I noticed some improvement after a week or so, to my delight.  My only complaint is that the gel seems to be a little bit too thick and left a little bit of noticeable residue.</li>
    <li> This product simply did nothing for me. I never noticed even the slightest different after using it day and night. I really was dedicated to trying to get this product to work but overall I do not recommend as it was not highly effective.  https://lifestyledashbyash.wordpress.com/2015/08/04/gopure-natural-eye-cream-review/</li>
    <li> Before I get too far into my review let me state that I am not great about &#x27;using the product every day, morning and night&#x27;...I probably used about 80 percent of the time. In the month I used it I noticed a small change but nothing overwhelming. The gel has a nice texture and feel and is cool and refreshing when applied. You do need to be a little careful about only using a half pump..a full pump is too much. I travel a lot and although the bottle is &#x27;TSA travel friendly&#x27; at .5 oz, it seems unnecessarily bulky for .5 oz ....a small thin tube would be preferred. I will continue to use the product til it is gone but don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with allergic reactions to almost any eye product, but not this one!  Very comfortable eye gel that doesn&#x27;t cause swelling or irritation at all.  In fact, it appears to calm my eyelids&#x27; reactions to seasonal allergy reactions, too.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is the first eye cream I have used.  Seems to help with my skin but with nothing to compare it too it is difficult</li>
    <li> The area under my eye is much softer but it did NOTHING for the dark circles. I used it twice a day for practically a month now and i just have not seen any of the results that I would have liked. I have really annoying dark circles under my eyes that I thought this would help in fixing as it says it would but it did not.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any discernible difference</li>
    <li> I like that this cream is light on your skin. My first impressions are that it will be good product but I am using this only one week so I can&#x27;t see the full effect. I also like the packaging. It is very precise with pump.</li>
    <li> Eye gel goes on very light, not sticky like others eye gel or cream.  I don&#x27;t get puffiness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;will continue the product.  Love all natural products.</li>
    <li> Gel feels good on application, then for awhile it pulls and feels a little gooey.  Otherwise, it gives a cool, refreshed feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little eye gel! It is .5 fl oz and has a small pump to dispense the product. The cream itself is thin and clear in appearance. It smells like cucumbers. I think this would be best COLD to get rid of puffiness. If you kept it in the fridge and used it in the AM or after a long night or if you have been drinking haha. It goes on easily.. it has an nice slip and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingrediants include:&lt;br /&gt;Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Matrixyl 3000, Palmitoyl Triepeptide-3, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Globularia Cordifolia Callus Culture Extract (Plant Stem Cells), Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber Hydrosol), Organic Simmondsis Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Silk Amino Acid Blend (Sodium L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylate, Sodium Lactate, L&#x27;Arginine, L-Aspartic Acid, L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid, Glycine, L-Alanine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-threonine, L-Isoleucine, L-Histidine, L-Phenylalanine), Wildcrafted Vinca Major (Periwinkle), Organic Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice), Wildcrafted Euphrasia Officinalis (Eye Bright), Wildcrafted Ganoderma Lucidum (Reishi), Organic Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola), Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!</li>
    <li> I feel like my skin is tighter, and looks younger. The ingredients are all natural which is great. It&#x27;s very moisturizing. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try and see if it would work better than other products that I had. I have been using it ever since I received it. I have to say that I really like this eye cream.  It is easy to use and works very well.  It helps with puffiness and makes my eyes looks better. My whole face looks better. I would recommend this product and I will be reordering.  Thank you for sending me the email to try this great eye cream.</li>
    <li> It could be that I have not used it long enough since it has only been two weeks.  But I am not noticing any big difference.  I like the feel of the product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice change from the creams i normally use. Seems that gel is the more effective solution when it comes to eye care. It was very cool and soothing. I even put it in the fridge for 30 min to ensure best results. It tones down the puffiness and aids in hydration to help your dark circles appear less noticeable. It doesnt have an odor or sticky residue which i normally find with products like this. But overall I am happy and look forward to using more of it and making it part of my daily beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is nice and lightweight, goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly.  I have noticed reduced puffiness and dark circles fading after using for two weeks.  I recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a very low maintenance makeup and beauty person but recently as I have gotten older in my age and noticed fine lines and wrinkles especially in my eye region, I decided it was time to try out some products and see what they could do for me. I was interested in Go Pure Natural&#x27;s eye cream because as I mentioned my eyes seem to age the most when it comes to fine lines and crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to get 7-8 hours of sleep daily, but find that no matter what I do I am met at the mirror with dark circles each day. This new product hitting the market is made to reduce those dark circles as well as puffiness and eye bags. The product is full of ingredients made to within 30 days of appropriate use restore your eyes back to their youthful appearance before the dark circles and fine lines came out. The company claims that if you use it the way you should for one month you should gain back 2 years of your youthful skin. If not, this company, like many I support, offers a money back guarantee. We all know if you read my blogs how much I love companies that stand by their product like that. I am continuing to use this and am on week #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, lets talk price. The price on Amazon is less than $20 and even at your local department store you will find yourself paying at least this for any decent skincare items. Just the smallest dabs of product instantly make your skin feel more refreshed. This product doesn&#x27;t take much to work. There is a slight cooling feeling to the touch upon the skin but the product with its healthy ingredients appears to be safe for the even sensitive skin types. These ingredients such as plant cells, Vitamin C and Vitamin E as well as Jojoba all come together in a gel that really holds to the skin to instantly begin to fix the under eye region. There is no strong fragrance and the small bottle fits nicely in a purse or bag for easy travel.y holds to the skin to instantly begin to fix the under eye region. There is no strong fragrance and the small bottle fits nicely in a purse or bag for easy travel.</li>
    <li> This is a light weight &amp;#34;gelly&amp;#34; like product that leaves no traces on the skin.  I like it very much and I am picky :)</li>
    <li> Great product, does what it says it will</li>
    <li> I really like that this eye cream is clear and not white. It dispenses just the right amount for use when pushing lightly on the dispenser. My problem is dark circles. The verdict is still out on that as I will have to use it longer to give an honest answer if it helps with my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this gel.  This is the first eye gel I&#x27;ve tried, and it does a good job hydrating.  Keep it in the fridge, and it provides a nice cooling sensation around the eyes after a long day on the computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with how this gel has lessened my dark under-eye circles.  I&#x27;ve tried some of the expensive creams (Strivecten, LaMer, etc.) and not seen the reduction that this gel (at 2 weeks use) has done.  I&#x27;m very happy to have found a product that works for me on the dark circles and I don&#x27;t have to redo my budget for it.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem has been the cap pressing down the pump and product leaking, but I just don&#x27;t snap down the cap and its just fine.  They might want to teak the cap though.</li>
    <li> This is a thick, rich gel that is easy to apply. It feels smooth and absorbs easily, I did not notice any residue. My under eye area looked and felt smoother all day. I did notice a reduction in puffiness. I don&#x27;t suffer from dark under eye circles, so I can&#x27;t provide any feedback on that.</li>
    <li> i have had to be up very early lately and I can&#x27;t go to bed early to save my life. My eyes are one of the first areas that are affected by my lack of sleep and night after night of minimal sleep was no good on my appearance. I then started applying goPURE Naturals Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream was impressive. It nourished the sensitive under eye area and helped tame the puffiness. The purple and blue that were very prominent the night before were minimal the next morning and after a few days were very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try out goPURE Naturals Eye Creams Quality and after a patch test I feel that it is safe for even some of the most sensitive skin types like me. I always recommend a patch test to make sure it&#x27;s safe, I have learned that the hard way.</li>
    <li> Generally like the product itself.  Lots of good ingredients. Cooling feeling when applied, though a little tight on the skin, although that might help with the appearance.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the dispenser.  When it arrived a good bit of product had already dispensed into the lid.  Then when I went to use it too much product shoots out of the dispenser so it is wasteful.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging on this eye gel - it is clean and efficient and I truly prefer the pump bottles to the jars you usually see eye creams in - not putting your fingers into it will help it stay clean and fresh and thus it will last longer. The cream is not too thick so it can easily be combined with even a heavy moisturizer without adding weight. It smells strongly of cucumber - fresh and light, and the scent dissipates quickly. The skin around my eyes definitely feels softer after applying this. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to have any noticeable lasting results yet but I will update if I don&#x27;t - otherwise my 4+ star rating stands!</li>
    <li> As I am getting older I am finding that I am having to fight puffiness and fine lines around my eyes, and I want to nip this in the bud before it is no longer reversible.  So I decided to try the goPure, as I have heard great things about it.  I put it on each morning and night as part of my daily skin care regimen and I follow with my vitamin C serum and moisturizer.  I have found that the puffiness and fine lines are not visible after continued use.  Do not expect overnight results, but with continued use, this will help reverse the effects of aging such as eye puffiness and fine lines.

    <li> LOVE! I am a stickler for softness, having severely dry skin. This treats my delicate eye area so effectively!  It leaves the area super soft, and it even appears as if lines are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Smooths out your puffy eyes and gets rid of the bags! I have a baby so this is much needed! It works great!</li>
    <li> This came in actually early i wasn&#x27;t expecting it that fast so you know i was skeptical anything that gets here that fast there has to be a reason behind it, i am so thankful it did i havent been sleeping really well and it shows bags lines under my eyes, it looks like i am getting ready for a vacation without the wait, so you know my surprise when it came in, without hesitating i put some under my eyes, i was actually told yesterday it looked like i slept, which i didnt for 24 hours! and the scent was amazing it was so light that it wasn&#x27;t even there! That means it is great for men too, because we all know men don&#x27;t want our frewfew smell! I am in love with these new tops that are coming out so easy to use and this is just perfect for my purse too! I do have one Con for it, i wish it would last forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).

    <li> I love discovering new products and and was so excited to use it as soon as it arrived. Loved it! Thank you so much</li>
    <li> In the past weeks of using this eye gel i can see a slight difference around my eyes, when i apply my eye makeup I can see that my eyes seem more open. I doenst have a bad smell and its easy to apply. It absorbs quickly so she&#x27;s no messt residue. I&#x27;m glad i was given the chance to have given my own opinion. Ill be getting my mother some soon too!</li>
    <li> I really  like  this eye cream. It&#x27;s my first time getting this brand of eye cream. The cream has done wonders for me so far. I&#x27;m one of those people who has lack of sleep. I get puffy eyes and dark circles from time to time. In the small amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it I can feel a different in my eyes. The puffiness is diminishing and my dark circles are not as dark no more. The cream feels nice to the touch of the skin. I will definitely keep using this product ounce it&#x27;s all gone. I recommend it to anyone looking for a cream that will help you with dark circles and wrinkles. I got the privilege to try this product for free for my unbaisis opinion.</li>
    <li> This is an EXCELLENT product! I noticed a difference the first time I applied it, and it continues to improve the area around my eyes daily. The texture of the cream is very smooth, and it disappears completely into my skin as it&#x27;s applied.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought it, and I plan to continue to use it as a part of my morning and evening regimen.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after only 3 days of use. The skin under my eyes looks and feels much smoother. The gel is very lightweight and unscented. Shipping was very fast too!</li>
    <li> I have a 3 month old baby and the bags and dark circles are out of control. I purchased this because it was natural and I felt comfortable putting it near my sensitive eyes. I am really impressed with how well and quickly it works. Some eye creams tighten the skin by drying it out. This cream ultra hydrates and feels amazing. It makes putting on eye makeup much easier and you will need less concealer.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and the service provided by the seller. It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my eyes and  little goes  long way so press gently on the delivery button or you I&#x27;ll get too much. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using this product daily and noticed immediate results.</li>
    <li> Gel product absorbs easily.  Smells of aloe and cucumber.  A little goes a long way.  Only used for a a week but like it so far.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once so far but works very well.  I received a sample shortly after a nose injury.  Because of the injury and also lack of sleep due to the injury I had pretty dark circles under my eyes.  After one use my eyes and cheeks looked the best they had in a long time.  So far I would recommend and I am curious to see if it works as well next time.  Also container holds a ton for as little you have to use.</li>
    <li> I was cursed with gross dark circles around my eyes. As if that isn&#x27;t bad enough they are so super puffy. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to try to mask these issues, so naturally I was skeptical to try this product. SWEET SASSAFRAS! A half pump of this and my eyes instantly feel cool and the puffy look totally diminishes. I noticed my dark circles subsiding but thought I was nuts. That was until friends started noticing. The bottle isn&#x27;t huge but you only need a half pump to cover both eyes. If you want your eyes to not be so puffy, and your dark circles to start to fade get this product. I&#x27;ve even pulled a few all-nighters and goPURE kept anyone from noticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> My eyes always look tired. I have horrible dark circles and fine lines underneath my eyes. I have tried so many products, serums, eye gel etc but nothing seems to work. This product is amazing and start showing result after 3-5 uses. I apply this eye cream underneath my eyes daily. I have noticed big difference in my dark circles and my eyes look much better and less tired. Another important thing is you should take enough sleep to see noticeable change in your eyes. I really like this eye cream. It works great on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this eye cream. I would highly recommend it. I received this eye cream in exchange of my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I certainly don&#x27;t get enough sleep, and have tried so many products over the years to try to combat my raccoon eyes. The BEST Eye Cream by goPURE is a good product. Very light, easy to apply and does what it design for. I felt an instant cooling and tightening effect and the puffiness around my eyes is slowly, but surely, disappearing. I only need a small amount, so this will last a long time. The skin around my eyes a lot less puffy now. I&#x27;m really pleased with the results. I was provided with a sample of this product and in return I&#x27;m offering up my honest feedback after testing and inspection. All statements and information in my reviews are comprised of my personal thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> Great eye \\&quot;cream\\&quot;, it really isn&#x27;t a cream,it&#x27;s more like a gel but it&#x27;s very hydrating and moisturizing. It&#x27;s excellent prior makeup. Helps with puffiness under the eyes,and def. has softened the fine lines around my eyes,because it hydrates so well. Love the ingredients,what&#x27;s in and what they left out. Great price as well, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this!! It has the Hyaluronic Acid as well as vitamin C, two very key ingredients.  It works great under my eyes, it&#x27;s a gel so it&#x27;s thicker than the oil.  It absorbs quickly and can be used as a serum all over the face....so a two for one product.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe allergies so naturally I needed a remedy for my constant puffy eyes! Thank you thank you thank you!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to fade the dark circles it didn&#x27;t seem to help them but did reduce fine lines.</li>
    <li> This cream works better then expected!</li>
    <li> Super Eye Gel.  I have been using it for a few days and it is very soothing - does not burn or irritate my eyes.  Soothes out the skin and wrinkles.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does as I continue.</li>
    <li> Best eye gel that I have used.  It&#x27;s produces a cool and tightening sensation..the cooling sensation reduces the puffiness and the tightening sensation diminishes fine lines. I have been using this for one week, 2x a day.  Do I look 10 years younger?  No one has said so yet, but I notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Really nice eye gel by GoPure. I am really pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing on the dark circles and puffiness I get under my eyes. I think this a decent size bottle and it will last a long time since you only need a small bit of product. It is unscented which i prefer in any face cream. It rubs in easily and leaves the area around my eyes renewed. I am happy to recieve this eye gel to review.</li>
    <li> I love that this eye gel is all natural.  Absorbs instantly.  It smells amazing and I just love the results!  I can see the under eye puffiness and dark circles literally disappearing! I have tried so many products and this one is it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to how small the bottle size is but considering how little amount you need it is fine! Great product and really see a difference in my under eyes!</li>
    <li> I found this eye cream to be very soothing and cooling, two characteristics that I always look for in an eye cream. My daughter tried it and had varying results. She felt that it was sticky one time and and stinging another but overall felt it to be hydrating. I have had several eye surgeries dealing with issues caused by Graves&#x27; disease and find this to be very effective in soothing scars and tightness. I appreciate the purity of the product. I also use Adovia eye cream for the same reasons. The only drawback with goPure product is the bottle. I can&#x27;t tell how much is left and feel I might waste product as it gets closer to bottom. I prefer jars.</li>
    <li> I liked the way this felt when I put it on.  It felt cool and refreshing and it smells good.  It took the puffiness right out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Wow!! I just received my eye cream &amp; I love it. My eyes are extremely sensitive &amp; I have trouble using eye cream. This eye cream is pure &amp; has no scent. I Love the silky texture. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase &amp; it was shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this eye cream from Go pure which i received free from Tomoson. Absolutely loved using this eye cream.It is 100% organic made out of all natural ingredients and Paraben free. The end result was awesome. It contains a perfect combination of plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and jobobo oil and matrixyl 3000 (proven to make eyes look two years younger in 1 month of use). It also contains vitamin e which is very important to control fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream helps to&lt;br /&gt;Get rid of Dark Circles, Under Eye Puffiness and Eye Bags .&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the Appearance of Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream was clear and had no fragrance. The cream when applied to skin dries quickly within two minutes.One pump was more than enough for one time use. i had no skin irritations .The creams helps to brighten my skin and reduce dark circles. I recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes gets dry and &#x27;tired&#x27; feeling, but often moisturizing creams are too heavy for the fine skin there. This gel feels wonderful when it&#x27;s applied and it helps keep the dry feeling away.</li>
    <li> Pros: light scent product looks appealing&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t work for me&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I noticed my eyes were puffier than before and I kept rubbing my eyes as if the product was irritating them. (Most likely it was because I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face )</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly. I have only used the product a few times, but I can tell you I like the smell and feel of it on my skin. I believe the more I use it I will see a positive difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  I love the way it feels. And it absorbs quickly.  I use it every morning, and my eyes are not puffy all day!</li>
    <li> Smooth and moisturizing. A welcomed part of my morning routine!</li>
    <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> An amazing cream, does what it says, I already bought 5 of them, I love it and highly reccommend&lt;br /&gt;It to anybody who is looking for an excellent product in purest form to look younger 10 years with 1 bottle. I have two puppy kids who I love like my kids, they always had this issue of eye residue&lt;br /&gt;Sticking outside their eyes and when u take it out, it hurts them, with this gel u apply to their eyes, they comfortably let me apply it and all the eye residue is removed by itself! Thankyou, Cleopetra!</li>
    <li> Works but came in the mail with the serum cream all spilled in the cap</li>
    <li> I have tried this eye gel for about 5 weeks now and I have not noticed any difference yet. I will keep using it till the bottle is good. It has very good ingredients in it and no parabins is a big plus. Hope it starts working soon!   I have tried this for another month and it has helped the wrinkles around my eyes. Noticed a definant difference.</li>
    <li> very good eye cream takes all the puffiness away and what women doesn&#x27;t like that. I love it myself.</li>
    <li> Hello, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about  3.5 weeks. It&#x27;s fast absorbing ,  non greasy and smells  like cucumber .  I complement  my skin routine  with vegan lifestyle and this product has given me satisfying  results at this point</li>
    <li> I got this great cream loaded with VitaminC,hyaluronic acid,plant stem cells and vitamin E.Because I love Adovia and I have few products fom them I did little test. I treated my left eye with their eye cream and my other eye with this eye gel. First week I didn&#x27;t see big difference, gel was easier to apply, you don&#x27;t need a lot, just drop and it doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets to you eye like cream does( it is little salty). After two week I noticed that during day the eye there I put gel looks fresher, wrikles are smoother. I really like it. it is paraben free, made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 years old, people thinks I am in early 40.&lt;br /&gt;I have also day cream and soap from Adovia, both very good products, like it.</li>
    <li> I love that this is all natural. Unfortunately, it stung when I applied it so I only used it once or twice. I never saw full results, which is unfortunate. I don&#x27;t think this is the product for those of us with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and are looking for a great eye gel, I do recommend this. I have seen the results that others have achieved and it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s just not the product for me.</li>
    <li> Great natural, paraben free eye gel to help with under eye circles, wrinkles, bags, puffiness, and fine lines. It soothes your under eye area and feels so nice when you apply it. A little goes a long way so you&#x27;ll only need a pea sized drop for both eyes. The ingredients include a  proprietary peptide complex, vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000, Vitamin E and plant cell stems. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks and goPURE recommends using it for at least a month before you see results. I have noticed results in the circles under my eyes. They have lightened up quite a bit. The wrinkles are fading as well. Where my under eye concealer would usually crease, it now goes on smooth. This is a very affordable eye cream and I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects.</li>
    <li> bought this to reduce dark circles, its day 5 and no noticeable change. it smells good and feels good. I will update my review if something changes.</li>
    <li> After trying for a week it does really work i like to try things out before i give a review and i must say this really works smells great really makes your under eye feel like its coming back to life.. now i cant live with out it i put in on right before bed</li>
    <li> This gel is very soothing to the eye area and has a calming, mild odor as well.  Not irritating at all and a small amount goes a long way. It appears to make the eye area smoother, moisturized and not as puffy.  Will continue to use to get the full benefits!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  I have nothing negative to say but so far I&#x27;ve seen little difference in under eye puffiness or fine line wrinkles.  During this same month I&#x27;ve been helping care for a family member after multiple surgeries so perhaps the stress and lack of sleep offset the benefits.  I will continue using this cream until empty then reassess.</li>
    <li> You can see improvement on your eyes right away</li>
    <li> Love it! My eye area is so smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> Love the size, very portable. You only use a small amount so this will last awhile. I do think it lowers the puffiness, don&#x27;t see a big difference in the dark circles but for puffiness alone it is worth it.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this. The bottle is small but its nice for on the go. have been using it a few weeks &amp; my eyes aren&#x27;t looking as tired as before. I would purchase thing again. I love that its natural &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> My old eyes love this product!  It made my eyes appear more youthful looking!  Great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I call it my miracle in a bottle for my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles but I have a good amount of fine lines around my eyes.  Also, this stuff is just amazing on my puffy eyes and dark circles.  I would like to say I never experience these, but truthfully, I am so sleep deprived these days that most of the time I am sporting dark circles and swollen eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream immediately cools my eyes upon contact, and I can feel it start to tingle slightly. It is a good tingle, not unpleasant ant all and best of all it tightens the skin around my eyes as soon as it dries.  I can immediately feel and see the results on my eyes.  I am in love with this cream and at right at $15 I can simply eliminate my weekly Well Coffee trip to pay for it!  Win win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for right under a month and already I see the difference in my eyes.  I LOVE that it is full of all natural products, peptides, Vitamins, Plant stem cells, and other great ingredients.  It comes with a 100% Money Back guarantee says that if I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger in 2 months use I get my money back.  Um, Yes please and yes please again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you I love this product so much that I have passed my bottle on to my mother in law who is visiting.  She used it, felt the immediate results and asked me to buy her some.  I did her one better.  I gave her my bottle, and as soon as I put my money in the bank tomorrow I am ordering more for us.  Two new customers from one product means it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******Disclaimer:  I received a product for review.  All opinions stated are 100% honest and my exclusive opinion.</li>
    <li> I admit I was skeptical about this eye cream since I have tried SO many before this one to reduce dark circles. I am pleasantly surprised and my dark circles have definitely been reduced. I have only been using this for about 10 days but can already see a difference.  I do use it 2x per day.  I am hopeful it will continue to reduce my eye bags and am thankful I found this eye cream.  For the record I already get plenty of sleep and drink tons of water but guess allergies or genetics have left me with dark circles difficult to cover but no more ;)  Love the results so far!!</li>
    <li> The BEST Eye Cream by goPURE is a really nice, high-quality eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very nice and light.  I struggle with eye products due to contact lens use and seisitive yes but this product has given me no issues.  The texture is great...it feels light on your skin and isn&#x27;t heavy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were good.  I didn&#x27;t see any amazing differences but I did see some lightening of the skin under my eyes and they did seem less puffy.</li>
    <li> Skin around eyes looks smoother with less wrinkles! I&#x27;ve only been using 1 week and already I have noticed a difference.  I will be reordering again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for about three weeks and have begun to notice some subtle changes to the skin around my eyes.  It has lightened up the area under my eyes and my skin tone appears to be more even.  Also, the area underneath my eyes seems to less puffy and even a bit firmer.</li>
    <li> was gifted to my 80 yo Mother.  she loves the ease of application.  says it is very soft and creamy feeling. states the skin around her eyes feels so soft and smoothe. she truly loves this cream.</li>
    <li> Applies easily and absorbs quickly.  Feels good.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Reduces puffiness quickly, stings a tiny bit, but mostly very refreshing!</li>
    <li> LOVE this eye gel. It&#x27;s not a cream and it&#x27;s not a serum, it&#x27;s this perfect cucumbury smelling eye gel that&#x27;s the perfect pick me up!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is great for my eyes at night and in the day so I would recommended  both ways</li>
    <li> My skin around my eyes is much softer and smoother  since using the goPure eye Cream.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I like how it goes on and seems to be working. I also like the ingredients, which are natural. .</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and smells great.  I don&#x27;t know if I can tell a difference in the puffiness, but the dark circles are noticeably better.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews I have used beter eye creams. Would not repurchase</li>
    <li> Very soothing on the eye area.  Non irritating.  I am still testing it but loving the feel and results so far.  NOT tested on animals is always a plus.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is totally non-greasy and odor free. It feels cool going on and soaks in fully after a few minutes. The pump bottle is nice, you can get a small amount out and the rest doesn&#x27;t get contaminated because you never actually put your fingers in the product. The gel is nicely moisturizing, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my dark undereye circles; I&#x27;ve had them for 40 years and probably always will.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few weeks now and really like it. Nice product delivery system. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> i received this as a promotional item for $1.00 I love this product. I have allergies and dark circles and it reduces the puffiness under my eyes a great deal which in turn diminishes the fine lines. It&#x27;s so soothing and cooling to my eyes, I plan to be a long time user of this product. I apply this twice a day, morning and night. It&#x27;s not sticky and leaves to sticky residue like some products do after you apply it. My eyes look more refreshed and the lines are less visible.</li>
    <li> Exelent  product.  The Best  quality</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get into all of the anti aging or skin care stuff that is getting so big lately but this stuff is pretty dang good. It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing under my eyes and in only several days I can tell that the dark circles are getting less and less. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Really helps with tightening and dark circles.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any results, but maybe it&#x27;s too early.  Absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is very soothing when applied and does not irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.  I keep it in the refrigerator for a cooling sensation after a warm shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fresh vegetal smell dominated by cucumber and a translucent white color and only a slight viscosity.  It is almost instantly absorbed when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains mostly botanical and organic ingredients that moisturize, soften, and protect the outer layer of the skin, such as aloe, glycerin and jojoba oil, plus ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin E that penetrate it to support skin health and structure on a cellular level.  Regular use will help improve the appearance of fine wrinkles caused by age and damage from sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 0.5 oz. (15 ml) bottle is opaque to protect the contents from light and it has a convenient pump top that dispenses just a drop as well as a protective cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic herbal infusion, organic Aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe), Matrixyl 3000, palmitoyl tripeptide-3, kosher vegetable glycerin, Globularia cordifolia callus culture extract (plant stem cells), Cucumis sativus (cucumber hydrosol), organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba oil), Cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, silk amino acid blend (sodium L-pyrrolidone carboxylate, sodium lactate, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-valine, L-proline, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-histidine, L-phenylalanine), wildcrafted Vinca major (periwinkle), organic Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice), wildcrafted Euphrasia officinalis (eye bright), wildcrafted Ganoderma lucidum (reishi), organic Centella asiatica (gotu kola), Boswellia serrata (frankincense), vitamin E, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethylhexyglycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GoPure Naturals provided eye gel for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This gel feels nice and cool on application and feels very hydrating. Non-irritating. Like the way it moisturizes my under eye area.</li>
    <li> I have used this new product twice a day for one week.  It has a very light, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly and leaves the skin around my eyes feeling and looking less stressed. I have under eye bags and dark circles which do appear lessened with use.  I would have to use Youth Glow for a longer period to see if it deserves five stars. If Youth Glow continues to improve the look of my eyes, I would reorder and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product so I can&#x27;t say for sure how well it works. However, I do like how it feels on my skin. My eyes feel nice and tight after I apply the cream. I will give a more accurate review after an extended period of using the product.</li>
    <li> After using this product for two days, my eyes began to feel dry and uncomfortable.  I&#x27;ve had this problem before with eye creams to reduce puffiness and wish I could continue its use.</li>
    <li> I have not used this long enough to see any dramatic results, but it feels very nice on my face.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this eye gel. I have been using it for about two weeks and I am very happy with it. This gel has a very nice consistency to it, it goes on easily and takes only a small amount to cover both eyes. It feels wonderful once you apply it, it has a nice cooling effect and you can instantly feel it hydrating your skin. I have been using both in the morning and at night and can already see an improvement with my puffiness and dark circles. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles but I&#x27;m hopeful that this will help to keep them away as I continue on. I would definitly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.</li>
    <li> I got this product awhile ago, and wanted to wait until I&#x27;d had a chance to use it on a regular basis before adding my comments. It feels nice on the skin, cooling and not greasy, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference. But I think it&#x27;s impossible anyway, there are so many factors that contribute circles and puffiness under the eyes that it isn&#x27;t feasible that any one product can fight genetics and prolonged lack of sleep. So I imagine that there will be a lot of different responses to this gel.</li>
    <li> Just received product been using for a week. I notice that the skin around my eye area feels more firm after application. I hope with continued use my dark areas will fade as well!</li>
    <li> In exchange for my review, I was offered the opportunity to try gopure youth glow eye gel at a deeply discounted price. The instructions state to gently dab the product under your eyes twice daily. I&#x27;ve been doing that for a couple weeks now, &amp; while I have not noticed an improvement with continued use, that&#x27;s ok because it seems to work pretty well from the start. It does not completely eradicate the dark circles, but greatly reduces the discoloration &amp; puffiness. It also feels pleasant to apply. And while it is a small bottle, a little goes a long way. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! It made me feel like I was in a fancy spa (something I&#x27;ve not been able to do in years). It made me feel more relaxed than I have felt in awhile. Since I have only been using it for a couple of days, I can&#x27;t tell a significant difference yet, but I can definitely see the darkness under my eyes (the &amp;#34;I have a newborn&amp;#34; dark circles) fading some. I will be updating this again after a couple weeks of use, but for now it has won me over and gets 5/5 stars!</li>
    <li> So far I can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s making much of a difference.  Not sure if I would re-order.  Maybe more time is needed.</li>
    <li> I got this through promotion! And I loved it&lt;br /&gt;I use it on under my eyes for my eye bags especially when I look dull and dark area around my eyes. And Voila it did gave me a bright effect specifically I do have Insomnia which triggers my under eye soreness.</li>
    <li> The great product!  I will order again. Thanks</li>
    <li> When I first started to use the product it burned my under eye area.  I have been using it for a week now and the burning sensation has stopped now. I don&#x27;t have many issues with puffiness so I really wanted to try it out for dark circles. I will review again once I see a difference.</li>
    <li> Aside from the leak it had in shipment half of the bottle leaked all over the top.Was promised another and is yet to be delivered.  This product has worked for me as an eyeliner-a-holic my eyes naturally started becoming darker. I have used it for about 2 weeks now and I can say that it works no dramatic change but my eyes look  lighter and the skin is much tighter less puffiness as well. I use it before I apply any makeup let it dry and then do my daily routine. And at night after washing my face. No smell great texture and definitely see my self buying this again. 4 out of 5 because of shipping problems. But over all great product!!! Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> It feels fine on the skin, but  I honestly do not see any difference from before I used it.  I will continue to use it and if I see a difference, I will let you know</li>
    <li> This product feels wonderful on the skin, cool to the touch and not greasy.  However, I feel that there is not any product out there that would be able to stop the natural process of the body to which puffiness and bags can occur over a prolonged time due to lack or insufficient sleep. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product does help in soothing the strain and become less irritable.</li>
    <li> a little tightening around the eyes, but dries clear and works great so far.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for a product that actually works, I finally found it!</li>
    <li> GoPure works well on eye puffiness and leaves your skin soft and smooth. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This sruff really works! I have been using it for 3 day&#x27;s and I all ready see it working! Just wish there was more in the product</li>
    <li> I must say I really like this product. I have had dark circles and puffy eyes for as long as I can remember. I was beginning to think it was something I just needed to learn to live with.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered a sample of this product at a reduced price to evaluate and review and I feel very lucky to have received it.&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple of weeks of use I can see a big difference in the puffiness around my eyes. It goes on smoothly and feels amazing and cooling on my skin. The small pump also makes it a breeze to apply. These observations are from my own experience with this product. Others may have different results.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream.  It goes on easily and smoothly.  I found that it absorbed quickly and let my skin feeling super soft and hydrated.  And it stays that way.  With a lot of products you loose that soft and hydrated feeling but I did not with this eye cream.  I like how it makes my skin feel so I can highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks so I have not noticed all of the results this product is supposed to offer, but I do have to say that it works great on eye puffiness.  I genetically have dark circles under my eyes so I have not really seen a drastic change there, but I am sure if you have dark circles from being tired it probably works on them just as well as the puffiness.  The bottle does not seem that big when you first receive it, but trust me this product will last a long time, you only need 1 pump for both eyes and has a nice light cucumber smell to it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It smells like cucumber around your eye when you use it, it works.  It works reduce my puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few days so far and seeing a difference for this mombie. I like how it clears up the scary eye that I usually have. I am enjoying the product very much.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels. The pump may deliver more than needed but I pump lightly.</li>
    <li> Great product! Left my eyes feeling rejuvinated and reduced puffiness. Stacks up to more expensive brands at a fraction of the price. The bottle was smaller than I thought, but it was still plenty for a few weeks worth of use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed it helping with the light wrinkles around my eyes.  That could be because I haven&#x27;t been using it long though.  It does make my eyes much less puffy in the mornings when I haven&#x27;t gotten a good nights sleep.  I like that it really doesn&#x27;t have a smell and that a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful going on and can see visible results quickly. Definitely worth every penny and will be using this faithfully!</li>
    <li> This works great on my dark circles.</li>
    <li> goPURE really has develped The BEST Eye Cream to diminish dark circles and puffiness! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to diminish my fine lines but I hope within the next few weeks I start to notice them disappearing! It&#x27;s a compact pump that can easily fit in your makeup bag or purse if you need it for travel or when you&#x27;re on the go! One pump is more than enough for both eyes and you instantly feel the area tighten a little bit and change the elasticity under your eyes. I highly recommend this product! Great value for your money!</li>
    <li> Being in graduate school, dark circles under my eyes are a frequent accessory. As I began using the eye gel I have noticed a subtle change in the tone of my skin under my eyes. I have started using it in the morning and night, noticing that puffiness quickly reduces and tone is softening.</li>
    <li> Smoothing, soothing with great ingredients.</li>
