### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>This is the best curler ever!</li>
      <li>Best curling irons I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
      <li>very good profesional product</li>
      <li>I loved that one too!</li>
      <li>But the gloves aren&#x27;t great quality.</li>
      <li>The 32mm is great for bouncier, beach-ier waves.</li>
      <li>Like it very much, great curls, and easy to use !</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly and perfect size for beachy waves.</li>
      <li>Read so many great reviews about this iron.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Both curling irons are excellent, consistent, and provide shiny, long-lasting curls.  </li>
      <li>If you loosen them, you get a nice Kate Middleton blow-out look.  </li>
      <li>On Day 2 and 3, I do have to touch up much more than the 25mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love this product</li>
      <li>Also have the smaller one and they both work amazing!!!</li>

      <li>The curls we&#x27;re pretty nice for all of 5 minutes until they fell out.</li>
      <li>Gives beautiful beachy waves that actually LAST on thicker/wiry hair.</li>
      <li>First purchased the 19mm was very happy with the product but wanted a bigger curl</li>

      <li>so I may start of the day with somewhat tighter ringlets, but depending on humidity, I&#x27;ll have consistent curls into the night.  </li>
      <li>My 1 1/2 inch Hot Tools curling iron was what I was using to try to achieve a large curl</li>
      <li>I bought my first Jos&amp;eacute; Eber 25mm in 2011 and absolutely adore it.  </li>
      <li>and the 23mm gave me the large curl that I have been looking for.</li>

    <li> Gets super hot for longest lasting curls. The heat glove is thick, too. I plan on getting another one in a different size.</li>
    <li> It was a device very magnificence governor on the hair safety recommend everyone its procurement</li>
    <li> I get this one to replace my wife old and broken one. Its orginal and even less price from outlets. If you want jose eper， i strongly recomend this one for you.</li>
    <li> i have incredibly thick hair and have difficulty finding something that will keep my curls....with this curling iron - my curls last 2 days with minor touch ups on the second! I don&#x27;t even need hair spray to keep it together! love this product</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Jose Eber curling iron. First purchased the 19mm was very happy with the product but wanted a bigger curl so I purchased the 23mm. I loved that one too! But then I found they had a 23mm and knew it had to be mine! My hair goes down to my lower back and the 23mm gave me the large curl that I have been looking for. My 1 1/2 inch Hot Tools curling iron was what I was using to try to achieve a large curl but it would fall flat in an hour. The 32mm Jose Eber curling iron heated up instantly and was super easy to use and best of all the curl lasts all day! Wow! Definitely have found my favorite product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, therefore I love it. It curls her hair with ease and requires no holding agent. The curls remain through the evening and somehow are still semi present even in the morning.</li>
    <li> So disappointed. Read so many great reviews about this iron. It does get very hot, almost too hot even with the glove and there is no heat control. The curls we&#x27;re pretty nice for all of 5 minutes until they fell out. I tried several products, hairspray, and mousse and they will not hold my curl. Don&#x27;t like it at all, I will be returning.</li>
    <li> Hot but not hot enough to burn my hair like other irons. This one puts a beautiful long lasting curl without the smell of burnt hair. Great affordable buy!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and perfect size for beachy waves. Also have the smaller one and they both work amazing!!! Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> The iron looked like used already and did not heat up as described. In addition the the iron did not curled as desired, I would even say that didn&#x27;t curl at all. Will return the product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I found it off of a beauty blog&#x27;s best rated curling wands of 2014. For the price this wand is a rockstar! would definitely recommend &amp; purchase again!</li>
    <li> This heats up really fast and works as directed. I have thick Latina hair and it works well on my hair and makes it nice and shiny. But the gloves aren&#x27;t great quality.</li>
    <li> very good profesional product</li>
    <li> No joke, Jos&amp;eacute; Eber Clipless Curling Irons will change your life!  I bought my first Jos&amp;eacute; Eber 25mm in 2011 and absolutely adore it.  I ended up buying the 32mm this past year for fatter curls.  Both curling irons are excellent, consistent, and provide shiny, long-lasting curls.  I have dark, coarse, thick hair (I&#x27;m of Mediterranean descent) and I don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray with Jose Eber irons and they last until I shower (2-3+ days!).  I am not above curling my hair for a wedding, and then not even bothering to properly style my hair the next day and having beach-y waves.  So many friends, coworkers, and family have asked about my curls and about 10 have actually just gone out and bought Jos&amp;eacute; Eber cliless curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 25mm gives medium-sized curls.  I love this size, and find it particularly useful if I&#x27;m going to need curly hair all day (i.e., going to a wedding and dancing all night) --- the curls loosen for me so I may start of the day with somewhat tighter ringlets, but depending on humidity, I&#x27;ll have consistent curls into the night.  These curls will last for days, so you can just touch up on days 2 and 3, but you do start with tighter ringlets and may have to loosen slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 32mm is great for bouncier, beach-ier waves. The ringlets are somewhat bigger.  I tend to use this for work, a dinner or date.  For me, this may not work in an extreme humidity situation - I think the curls might fall.  If you loosen them, you get a nice Kate Middleton blow-out look.  On Day 2 and 3, I do have to touch up much more than the 25mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My girlfriends with blond, fine hair tend to use the 21mm as their hair falls quicker.  I personally prefer the 25mm and 32mm for bigger curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Best curling irons I&#x27;ve ever owned and they last a long time - I get compliments all the time!  Absolutely changed my life!</li>
    <li> Makes nice loose big curls and even lasts until the next day!</li>
    <li> This is the best curler ever! All my girls and their friends love the way this work and often come over to use it.</li>
    <li> love all of my Jose ever clip less irons.  they keep the curl in my straight hair for a long time.</li>
    <li> Gives beautiful beachy waves that actually LAST on thicker/wiry hair. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s frying my hair, either.</li>
    <li> Like it very much, great curls, and easy to use ! Very much recommend it. Have tried different curling irons before, but none with such great result</li>
