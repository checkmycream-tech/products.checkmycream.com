      <li>It&#x27;s very light weight</li>
      <li>because I love Amazon, you&#x27;d have to be nuts to buy it here.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it never makes my hair look greasy.  </li>
      <li>I tried many before and never used any more than once or twice.</li>
      <li>My hair feels healthy and looks healthy too.  </li>
      <li>Moroccan Oil even keeps my hair frizz free on damp and humid days!</li>
      <li>Many salons that carry this product are mixing this oil into the hair colorant as it helps treat the hair during the coloring process.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>A pump, a flip top, anything would be better than this.  </li>
      <li>For the price, can&#x27;t they come up with a better bottle????  </li>
      <li>It penetrates your hair follicles versus sitting on top of your hair which many hair care products do.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what I like more...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using this</li>
      <li>I love all of the moroccan oil products.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not the best product out there for what it does.  </li>
      <li>it is exceptional it absolutely softens hair and makes it shine.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to over do it when heat styling.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review for a hair care product, but Moroccan Hair Oil is probably the BEST hair care product I&#x27;ve ever used; after following the directions, I saw a distinct difference in my hair in just three days.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and it really reduces the drying time (so in a sense it is also eco-friendly!</li>
      <li>so my fine hair isn&#x27;t flattened.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my skin too... absorbs QUICKLY and leaves a sensual scent!</li>
      <li>It makes your hair very shiny &amp; healthy looking!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy it is here on Amazon for those people who can&#x27;t try it at a local salon.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for sure!</li>
      <li>I will absolutely be purchasing this product forever and ever!!!  </li>
      <li>I found that it&#x27;s easy to pour the product out too quickly.  </li>
      <li>I know it is pricey, but sooooooo worth the money!</li>
      <li>but it works great on dry scalp!</li>
      <li>Who would think that oil would be good in hair such as mine?  </li>
      <li>I use Moroccan Oil on my whole head of hair excluding the top.</li>
      <li>I actually have to use a fair amount of product to get the frizz fighting benefits.</li>
      <li>or you may have to get another bottle alot more quickly than you really would need to.    </li>
      <li>This has been a very good product for my hair, but keep in mind it take very little to get the job done.    </li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell that it was any better than any other leave-in treatment I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>, in fact I use it very sparingly and as a result it lasts forever!!  </li>
      <li>this product does a fine job of keeping my hair looking &#x27;and&#x27; feeling silky soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but it is a great lightweight conditioner for everyday.</li>
      <li>Moroccan Oil is truly worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It is really worth the investment.</li>
      <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>I had my doubts, but I really love how soft my hair is and also how non-greasy</li>
      <li>TOTALLY worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The scent is a bit strong and the price is high.</li>
      <li>However, if you just use a dab, it soaks right in.  </li>
      <li>it makes my hair soft, smell great, and dry faster.</li>
      <li>I used Kerastase for many years but just switched because this is so much better and costs a lot less.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so luxuriously soft and smooth just like natural shiny healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>The problem I have with Moroccanoil is most of the time it seems to work well only when combined with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and when I am able to finally get this product to work by itself</li>
      <li>I am currently using Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and love the product</li>
      <li>The result was there was not a noticeable difference between the two sides, basically both sides of my hair were soft and frizz free.    </li>
      <li>I used Moroccan Oil first when I went to my salon and the lady who did my hair used it on me.</li>
      <li>Especially great since I blow dry everyday</li>
      <li>Love this stuff...have long, wavy hair that can get a bit unmanageable (mega knots and snarls).</li>
      <li>I just started to use this oil the other day and so far so good.</li>
      <li>AS a 49-year old, those days of full and glossy hair are over.</li>
      <li>but I finally broke down and decided to give Moroccanoil a try because of all the great reviews here and on the internet.     </li>
      <li>The one thing I love most about this product is that it cuts down on the amount of time it takes to blow dry my hair (nearly in half!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is already straight and fine, hair care products can make my hair look stringy or greasy</li>
      <li>I have long normal to fine hair (a lot of it!)</li>
      <li>My hair was shiny, soft, and completely frizz free.</li>
      <li>My husband ordered me this after much research and rave form everyone.......</li>
      <li>But I had to try MoroccanOil to find out if the hype is for real.</li>
      <li>I may have to use whole product line to see results.</li>
      <li>The last test I tried was to use the Moroccanoil with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream together which resulted in my hair being frizz free, and not oily.       </li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work for me</li>
      <li>My hair is much softer-</li>
      <li>Instead you will have a healthy natural shine and will find over short usage, your hair will look and feel much healthier.</li>
      <li>If you load too much on, your hair will get greasy looking (it is oil after all).</li>
      <li>It tends to be very frizzy and unmanageable.</li>
      <li>I am caucasion with very ethnic hair-</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>One final comment - all natural does not mean a product is better than a synthetic product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair stylist likes this product a lot - she says it&#x27;s all natural and not a petroleum derivative.  I let her put in on my hair last Saturday after she cut it.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell that it was any better than any other leave-in treatment I&#x27;ve tried.  I use Phyto Relaxing Balm or Alterna leave-in [[ASIN:B001AMMSCK Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm, 10.1-Ounce Bottle]] before drying my hair, then rub a small amount of one of the silicone products between my hands and use it only on the ends of my hair.      I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in the effect on my hair betw that and the Moroccan Oil my hair dresser used.  I&#x27;ll pass on this product given it&#x27;s high price and the fact that I couldn&#x27;t use it near the scalp like I do the relaxing balm as it would make my hair look greasy.      One final comment - all natural does not mean a product is better than a synthetic product.  There are plenty of unhealthy natural things like arsenic, poison ivy, etc. and quite a few natural things (like peppermint oil) that aren&#x27;t unhealthy but can irriate the skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  My hair has never, ever been softer.  And it is a frizzy mess without a product in it.  I HATE the container it comes in.  It leaks and drips and gets all over everything!  For the price, can&#x27;t they come up with a better bottle????  Hello!?!?  A pump, a flip top, anything would be better than this.  Packed it in my suitcase last week and yep, you guessed it!  Everything in my toiletries bag was COVERED in oil.  UGH.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product! I bought it on Amazon recently, and have only used it a few times. I have long, dry frizzy hair, but after the first use, my hair was super soft, and frizz-free! I didn&#x27;t even have to blow-dry! It even makes detangling a cinch! You use a small amount on damp hair, and comb it through.     It looks like a thick, heavy oil, but it does not leave hair oily or weigh it down at all! I know it is pricey, but sooooooo worth the money! Don&#x27;t waste money on anything else! I just bought the hydrating mask from this brand, I hear it  is really great too.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for any type of hair from what I read.  Thin fine hair (like mine) thick coarse hair, curly, straight, short, long.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is unfortunately very thin and very fine and long (past my shoulders).  The girl at the salon put a bit of this in my hair before blow drying....I was like \\&quot;you just put what in my hair.....oil?!?!\\&quot;  Who would think that oil would be good in hair such as mine?  I immediately think oil would weigh it down and make it greasy.  To my surprise, it was quite the opposite!!!  My hair felt so luxuriously soft and smooth just like natural shiny healthy hair.  I am in love!  Unfortunately all they had left was the one open bottle that she used on my hair, and I loved it so much I bought that one from her at a discount.  I will absolutely be purchasing this product forever and ever!!!  This is one product you will not be sorry for spending a little more $ on!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now.  I love the smell and I love that it never makes my hair look greasy.  The \\&quot;little goes a long way\\&quot; thing though, I don&#x27;t know. I have needed to use quite a bit in order for my hair to feel any softer. I&#x27;ve gone through half the 1.7oz bottle in about 30 days. My hair takes coloring every 6 weeks, is naturally curly, very dry and frizzy, and since I live in Denver, its makes my hair even more brittle.  The oil has made my hair much softer but the frizz is only mildly cut down so far.  I have been using it with another product called Garnier Fructis Curl Cream Gel, which probably has mineral oil in it, so I am going to use just the Moroccan Oil and I&#x27;ll update again.  I just ordered a few other Moroccan Oil brand products and am going to see if they work better in conjunction with each other.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the texture of my hair has changed, and my straight hair has gotten frizzy.  Moroccan Oil has changed that, and the sleek, shiny hair I used to have is mine again.  While this stuff is kind of expensive, you only use a tiny bit, rub it through your damp hair, and then do it as normal.  I&#x27;ve air dried, blow dried, curled, and flat ironed, and it looks good every time.  Just be careful not to overdo it, because it will make your hair look greasy (it is an oil, after all).  However, if you just use a dab, it soaks right in.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using this, I hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month it is exceptional it absolutely softens hair and makes it shine. I also use a little bit of the mask and leave it in my hair. My hair is dry split and frizzy curly. After a month my hair looks less frail and splitting on the ends and it feels very soft to the touch. I bought mine from a salon but will now buy from here. please try this you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for me but it doesn&#x27;t. If you look at the ingredients it is mostly a concoction of silicones with a little argan oil thrown into the mix. It feels like aless viscous version of frizz-ease and works exactly the same on my hair, which is wavy/curly/frizzy colored blonde and medium fine in texture. I actually have to use a fair amount of product to get the frizz fighting benefits. I&#x27;m sure that is related to the dry and porous nature of my hair.   The packaging and scent of the product is superior to Frizz-Ease, in fact the scent is definitely the best aspect of the product. I love the scent!   I&#x27;ve been using Living Proof no frizz products to control my hair and find them vastly superior to this stuff. But I had to try MoroccanOil to find out if the hype is for real.</li>
    <li> I used Moroccan Oil first when I went to my salon and the lady who did my hair used it on me. It worked so well! My hair was shiny, soft, and completely frizz free. I have completely frizzy hair, although I straighten it everyday, which decreases frizz, it does not do enough. I use Moroccan Oil in my dry hair after I am completely done styling it. I know that the directions say to use in wet or damp hair, but I found maximum results when I use it on my dry hair. Moroccan Oil even keeps my hair frizz free on damp and humid days! There is only one down side to using this product: the price. It is very expensive compared to other products I have tried, and it is by far the best!  The only other thing I would add is not to use as much on the top of your head. This does make your hair LOOK oily, but it is actually just the product. I use Moroccan Oil on my whole head of hair excluding the top. I do think though, that if you are wanting to get rid of your frizz, you should purchase Moroccan Oil!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly and somewhat coarse, so it can get really frizzy. I bought a bottle of this on the recommendation of my hair-stylist last September and have used just over 3/4 of the bottle. My hair length is about 4 inches below my shoulders; I use it every day and it has lasted that long! It makes my hair softer, shinier and less frizzy (without feeling greasy) than any other product. $40.00 may seem like a lot, but considering it will last such a long time makes it worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that I can air dry in a curly style and blow dry to a straight style.  This product is terrific.  It&#x27;s very light weight so my fine hair isn&#x27;t flattened.  My hair feels healthy and looks healthy too.  I hate to say it, because I love Amazon, you&#x27;d have to be nuts to buy it here.  I can get it for $40 at my salon.  Why pay over $6 for shipping.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me.  I had my doubts, but I really love how soft my hair is and also how non-greasy the feel is.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered me this after much research and rave form everyone.......I just recently started using the Moroccan Oil shampoo, conditioner and oil!!! I could immediately tell the difference for my dull, frizzy, colored and damaged hair!!! It is awesome I am hooked..... IF in dought try it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my hair so soft (never greasy) and it dries faster.  You only use a dime size so this should last a long time.  I color my hair often and this stuff tames the frizzies as well.  I will buy more when I run out!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to Moroccan Oil two years ago and I&#x27;ve used it after every shampoo ever since.  The price seems steep, but the thing is, I&#x27;m STILL USING THE SAME BOTTLE two years later, so it is worth the investment.  This serum really is an oil, it smells (to me) faintly of roses, but not overpowering.  This is how you use it:  after towel drying your hair, pour a tiny bit, about the size of a nickel, into the palm of your hand and work it through your damp hair.  Then comb the oil through.  You can style as usual.  I have very thick, curly, dry hair which I have colored every few months at the salon, and the oil really works to keep the color vibrant.  In the humid weather we have here near the ocean, my hair can really get wild, but again, the oil keeps it under control without weighing it down or gunking it up.  It is really worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...have long, wavy hair that can get a bit unmanageable (mega knots and snarls). This really helps keep my hair soft and makes brushing the knots out pain-free. It smells awesome, but the only thing that I would be wary of is that you have you use LESS than you think. If you load too much on, your hair will get greasy looking (it is oil after all). A bit pricey, but it is a great lightweight conditioner for everyday. Especially great since I blow dry everyday and I feel like this protects and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was reading about this so called \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot; and thought well I have to see what this is about. My hair is extremely dry and chemically treated- and needs moisture and something to smooth things out. Well I have used this oil twice now - after the shower- while my hair is still damp- and WOW! my hair is so extremely soft and actually looks and FEELS healthier. The oil did not weigh my hair down at all, which tends to happen with serums and oils for me. and I love the texture- the oil is thick- just a little bit went a long way. I would highly recommend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review for a hair care product, but Moroccan Hair Oil is probably the BEST hair care product I&#x27;ve ever used; after following the directions, I saw a distinct difference in my hair in just three days. It&#x27;s softer, less dry, less brittle, more shiny, and looks so much better. AS a 49-year old, those days of full and glossy hair are over. This product helps a  lot. TOTALLY worth the money, in my opinion. And it&#x27;s true, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I got this hair oil at the beauty salon and absolutely love it! I use it every day...it makes my hair soft, smell great, and dry faster. It absorbs instantly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily at all. It&#x27;s much less expensive online than at the salon. Highly recommended! Now I&#x27;m curious about the other products.</li>
    <li> I love all of the moroccan oil products. My stylist carries it in his salon and I am so happy he talked me into buying it because it has done wonders. Some people don&#x27;t like the jar but you just have to be careful when you pour the oil out. If your hair is dry or coarse you really need to invest in this line. I used Kerastase for many years but just switched because this is so much better and costs a lot less. It also has a great scent. I use the intense hydrating mask as a conditioner and it&#x27;s awesome too. I can&#x27;t wait for the shampoo to come out.</li>
    <li> I admit that this product is good but it&#x27;s certainly not the best product out there for what it does.  I purchased a bottle of Moroccanoil about a month ago after much debate because the concept of adding oil to keep my hair soft and frizz free is not new to me. I am currently using Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and love the product but I finally broke down and decided to give Moroccanoil a try because of all the great reviews here and on the internet.     When I received the Moroccanoil I decided to put the product to the test to see what it can do, so after washing and towel drying my hair I divided my hair into two pig tails and used the Moroccanoil on one side and Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream on the other side. I then allowed my hair to air dry (as I usually do) and compared the results.      The result was there was not a noticeable difference between the two sides, basically both sides of my hair were soft and frizz free.    My second test was to use the Moroccanoil by itself, with no Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream at all.  I washed and towel dried my hair, applied only the Moroccanoil and then allowed my hair to air dry. The result was some of my hair was frizzy, other parts were oily looking and yet other parts were soft and frizz free.  I decided to repeat this test again later in the week under the assumption that I perhaps I used too much oil or didn&#x27;t spread it out enough but the ended up with the same results.    The last test I tried was to use the Moroccanoil with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream together which resulted in my hair being frizz free, and not oily.       The problem I have with Moroccanoil is most of the time it seems to work well only when combined with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and when I am able to finally get this product to work by itself the results are similar to Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream.       Other disadvantages I have found with Moroccanoil is the glass jar and the control factor when you pour out the oil.  Becauseit&#x27;s liquid oil (unlike oil in a cream base) I found that it&#x27;s easy to pour the product out too quickly.  Also the Moroccanoil is not something I have found for sale other than on the internet.     My conclusion is for MY hair the Moroccanoil doesn&#x27;t spread well by itself and when it does it requires the aid of another product.  The results are similar to a product I currently already use (Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream), is not a better price, is harder to use and is not readily available for purchase.     I&#x27;ll be sticking to my Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream.</li>
    <li> I have long normal to fine hair (a lot of it!) and it&#x27;s easy to over do it when heat styling.  I blow dry and straight iron my hair on a daily basis and this product does a fine job of keeping my hair looking &#x27;and&#x27; feeling silky soft and smooth.  The one thing I love most about this product is that it cuts down on the amount of time it takes to blow dry my hair (nearly in half!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is already straight and fine, hair care products can make my hair look stringy or greasy but I haven&#x27;t had any such problems with Moroccanoil.  I use a small dime sized amount rubbed between my palms and focus primarily on my ends before working my way up through the rest of my hair.  Blow dry and style as usual.  Another benefit of this product is that it does a great job at disguising any existing split ends you may have.  I can&#x27;t comment on product build up since I already use a clarifying shampoo once a week to keep my hair in check (if you&#x27;re shopping around for one, my pick is Neutrogena&#x27;s Clarifying Shampoo - inexpensive and it works great).  I will definitely continue to purchase this product and recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This oil does wonders for your hair but it works great on dry scalp! I have a dry flaky, itichy scalp condition and a little oil rubbed into my scalp keeps the flakes and itching at bay all day!  It is not heavy or greasy so it does not look oily.</li>
    <li> This oil is AWESOME!!  I was skeptical at first since I have very thin hair (which gets tangled easily) and not much of it.  I was especially looking for something that would help detangle, as well as protect against heat tools (blowdryer, flat iron, etc) but wouldn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Well... it does all of that!!!  Doesn&#x27;t take much, in fact I use it very sparingly and as a result it lasts forever!!  I don&#x27;t know what I like more... the effectiveness as a detangler and protectant or the SCENT which is AMAZING!!  EVERYONE can use this product!  ALSO:  I use it on my skin too... absorbs QUICKLY and leaves a sensual scent!</li>
    <li> I have bleached my hair for years and have always tried to use products to help with the constant damage.  Living in Florida I also fight environmental damage.  This oil is absolutely the best I have found to create the softness yet managability we are hope for.  Using very little is the secret to its success.  I am a constant user!</li>
    <li> This has been a very good product for my hair, but keep in mind it take very little to get the job done.    Be very careful when you initially use it because the bottle is not large,  so you do not want to overdo it or you may have to get another bottle alot more quickly than you really would need to.    But it works for me (I do not have to use it every day to get results I am happy with)</li>
    <li> I got this from Artistry in Hanover. Kristi always has cool hair styling products to try -- but she had it on her hair at my last visit and it smelled amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, she shampooed and conditioned then use the oil on the ends and I was blown away by the results. Shiny and the scent is divine. I&#x27;ve also used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has thick, curly hair and we both despise the knots that seem to come no matter how we tie it back. When I use all three products, it is a lot easier to get the comb through her hair -- and it&#x27;s so soft and shiny -- she truly looks and feels like a princess.  I&#x27;m so happy it is here on Amazon for those people who can&#x27;t try it at a local salon.</li>
    <li> I am using this product on a human hair wig.  The issue with wigs is that they do not get the natural oils that your scalp produces.  They get very dry and damaged.  I have tried Nexxium and Biosilk oils and they just do not hold a candle to this product.  Nexxium and Biosilk both had issues of making hair look oily without accomplishing the moisturizing that is needed.  I use approximately a quarter size amount of the Moroccan Oil in long hair and it doesnt look greasy because it absorbs into the hair.  This absorption provides the moisture the hair needs.  The scent is wonderful (light and powdery).  A wonderful side benefit is that your hands soak up the oil also and are very soft after using it.  Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have course, dry, frizzy hair. This product was a life saver for me. I tried many before and never used any more than once or twice. My hair dresser had to talk to me a lot to convince me to buy this product because I told him, I am paying to try this and that, and end up not using any. Anyway, works great, have been using it more than a year now.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of reviews for this for people with thick, dry, coarse hair. Well, I have very thin, limp and split-ended hair (too much ironing!) and my mom bought me this product for Christmas and I think I have died and gone to heaven. First of all, a little goes a long way and make sure to only use it when your hair is super damp. That being said, this product is a miracle worker. It keeps me limp locks moisturized but it doesn&#x27;t weigh them down at all. It smells amazing and it really reduces the drying time (so in a sense it is also eco-friendly! less electricity needed!). I am recommending this to anyone and everyone. I may never go without the product ever again. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I just started to use this oil the other day and so far so good. My hair is much softer- I may have to use whole product line to see results. I have very fine , curly hair and a lot of it. It tends to be very frizzy and unmanageable. I am caucasion with very ethnic hair- it nats underneath and is dull on outer surface- I have also noticed it is shinier. Name the curly hair product and i have tried them all. Wish me luck and all I can hope for is some improvement .</li>
    <li> I have very thick naturally wavy/curly hair, and tons of it. I get it colored every 3 months. This was suggested to me by my stylist. It makes your hair very shiny &amp; healthy looking! I will apply this and let my hair air dry and the results will be lots of curls and no frizz. Only downfall for me was the smell and perhaps the price. The scent is a bit strong and the price is high. but the results are worth it. Also..use sparingly..a little goes a long way! The bottle is quick to pour, so be careful!</li>
    <li> Finally a well known hair secret of the east is now available in the west. Moroccan Oil is truly worth every penny. It penetrates your hair follicles versus sitting on top of your hair which many hair care products do. With the use of only a little oil in the palm of your hand (dime size) you begin by rubbing the oil in the ends of your hair and then throughout the rest of your hair. Your hair will not feel oily, greasy, or heavy. Instead you will have a healthy natural shine and will find over short usage, your hair will look and feel much healthier. Many salons that carry this product are mixing this oil into the hair colorant as it helps treat the hair during the coloring process. I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist gave me a sample of Moroccan oil about six months ago, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  The oil conditions my hair and makes it shiny without making it dirty faster (I only wash every other day even with the oil, and it&#x27;s fine).  I have long hair and this product doesn&#x27;t break out my back as much as others have either--I&#x27;ve even used the oil to soften my cuticles and elbows.  Highly Recommended.</li>
