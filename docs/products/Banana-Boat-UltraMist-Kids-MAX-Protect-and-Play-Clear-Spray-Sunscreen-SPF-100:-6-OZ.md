      <li>I usually love Banana Boat and this could have been user error</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this product is SPF100.</li>
      <li>so luckely they are ok even thou they too</li>
      <li>but this was a Godsend to put on as my kids actually didn&#x27;t fight me like they do if you try cover them in the cream.  :D</li>
      <li>I had some of this and threw it away to be on the safe side.</li>
      <li>He likes the spray better than a rub on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>

      <li>red was really pretty remarkable.    </li>
      <li>I can not find spf this high locally, love that its on &amp;#34;auto ship&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>i love the high spf.</li>
      <li>Next time we will put the Banana Boat lotion on first to get good coverage and reapply with the spray.</li>
      <li>I used this product on my very fair skinned family during two back to back daytime baseball games.</li>
      <li>That in itself makes it worth buying if you have kids.</li>
      <li>I called Target (where product was purchased) &amp; they pulled product off of their shelves right away.  </li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>live in Houston, I am blue eyed and fair skinned, but I have never gotten burned using this SPF 110..</li>
      <li>Does not protect as expected, but good for no to much sun exposure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and nothing less than SPF 100</li>
      <li>the smell isn&#x27;t very strong and i can tell there was still some left on my son when i went to reapply more on him 2hrs later on our walk.</li>
      <li>: I spent 12 hours at Disney&#x27;s Magic Kingdom, reapplying every 2 hours, and didn&#x27;t get burned!</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>(we only use it once or twice a week at the most).</li>
      <li>I consistently have to reapply hourly and my daughter still got sun.</li>
      <li>The first day on the beach, we all used Up &amp; Up</li>
      <li>but everyone got burned in two hours at the pool on a hot Sacramento morning.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure how good it really works.</li>
      <li>I wore a different sunscreen on my face and my face was fine</li>
      <li>Toddlers never got a sunburn the whole summer.</li>
      <li>Bought this for the beach and worked very well.  </li>
      <li>but it was enough for me to switch back to the rub-on kind.</li>
      <li>There were about 25 products bearing the Ultramst name that were recalled although this particular one was not.</li>
      <li>I purchased these because of the high SPF</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how high of an spf</li>
      <li>easy to use sunscreen esp on little ones that moves a lot.</li>
      <li>The spray is watery and clear and smells like rubbing alcohol.  </li>
      <li>because I don&#x27;t like spraying ANYTHING directly onto my space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll say too that he has sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated it</li>
      <li>I use on my 2 year old and 5 year old.</li>
      <li>my son&#x27;s soft baby skin is never been burned.</li>
      <li>Have long bought kids sun screen because I can buy a higher number of protection.</li>
      <li>I wanted a high SPF and the only products I could find near me with an SPF over 50 was geared towards kids.</li>
      <li>On Sunday, we used Banana Boat Kids Ultra Mist SPF 110 &amp; felt like we were burning after a little while so continued to re apply the product much more frequently than expected with an SPF of 110.  </li>
      <li>it got pretty pink.</li>
      <li>However, my daughter with sensitive skin ended up breaking out in a rash the next day.</li>
      <li>Both of my kids ended up having places on their body with some patches being completely white and places that were red with a sun burn, even though I completely covered them head to toe in sun screen.</li>
      <li>a consumer comes into contact with a flame or spark prior to complete drying of the product on the skin, there is a potential for the product to ignite.&amp;#34; This was stated by the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>had a little too much sun to their faces.  </li>

<li> Be careful with this.</li>
<li> You should rub to spread it, like any other sunscreen.</li>
<li> That evening, I noticed all of them had pink sunburned cheeks and shoulders and tan lines from their swimming suits!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other Banana Boat products</li>
<li> that makes it nearly impossible to apply a second application later on, especially of another type such as lotion.</li>
<li> Dries quickly, NEVER feels oily.</li>
<li> Very disappointed, I won&#x27;t be buying this kind again.  </li>
<li> Not the easiest thing to do when you have impatient swimmers waiting to be sprayed.</li>
<li> like the Banana Boat stick sunblock for their faces, that has worked for us in the past and doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have purchased several of these for my extremely fair skinned blond granddaughter and it works.  She can play in the sun for hours and still not get a burn.  It even protects her from sunburn while playing in the kiddie pool.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my very fair skinned family during two back to back daytime baseball games. None of us burned. It was very easy to apply, and didn&#x27;t feel too greasy once it settled in. I tend to burn even with sunscreen, so the fact that none of us came home red was really pretty remarkable.    However, my daughter with sensitive skin ended up breaking out in a rash the next day. I can&#x27;t say for sure that this product was the cause of her rash, but I&#x27;d use it with caution if you are prone to eczema.    Were it not for the rash, I&#x27;d give the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Used this on our trip to Disney World.  My kids are all very fair skinned  and not one got a sunburn despite being out in the sun for hours. We used it at the pool as well and it held up just fine.  I made sure my kids were well coated on all sides of their arms/legs.  We did opt to use a cream for the face but this was a Godsend to put on as my kids actually didn&#x27;t fight me like they do if you try cover them in the cream.  :D</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen. I use on my 2 year old and 5 year old.</li>
    <li> Received these very quickly. Great for kids.</li>
    <li> I bought a can of the Banana Boat Kids 110 SPF spray for a security job I had over Labor Day Weekend. I was outside for almost 12 hours a day and this sunscreen worked great. I applied it once in the morning and again around noontime and I didn&#x27;t burn at all.     My only problem with this product was that the spray button was very hard to press and it made application difficult. This may, however, have been a faulty cap or some kind of production anomaly. I would have given 5 stars if the cap was easier to press for application.       Also, even though this product is labeled for kids, it still works on adults. I wanted a high SPF and the only products I could find near me with an SPF over 50 was geared towards kids. I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and nothing less than SPF 100 keeps me from burning. This stuff was awesome.</li>
    <li> Our family went to a Beach Soccer tournament last weekend in Wildowood Crest NJ (Beach Blast 2012).  The first day on the beach, we all used Up &amp; Up (Target brand) SPF 50 spray-on sunblock with great success.  On Sunday, we used Banana Boat Kids Ultra Mist SPF 110 &amp; felt like we were burning after a little while so continued to re apply the product much more frequently than expected with an SPF of 110.  That evening my husband and I had severe sun burns to our back, shoulders and faces.  Not only do I think the product was either expired or faulty somehow, I think the spray nozzle was faulty as well.  When you look at my husbands back, you can see the lines where the spray was applied even thou the bottle says no rub spray.  My children were all wearing hats and swim (SPF 50) shirts that day, so luckely they are ok even thou they too had a little too much sun to their faces.  I emailed Banana Boat to inform them 4 days ago &amp; they never replied to my message.  I called Target (where product was purchased) &amp; they pulled product off of their shelves right away.  That shows the differecen btwn. a co. that is costumer oriented &amp; one that is not.  I will never buy a Bananan Boat product again, not because I may have gotten a bad product by chance (maybe), but bc they never bothered to respond to a concerned costumer.  They don&#x27;t deserve my $.  Hope this is helpful &amp; can prevent others from experiencing same situation.</li>
    <li> easy to use sunscreen esp on little ones that moves a lot. i love the high spf. it&#x27;s not greasy but after i sprayed my son while he was sitting on the floor, i did see a film of it on the linoleum. the smell isn&#x27;t very strong and i can tell there was still some left on my son when i went to reapply more on him 2hrs later on our walk.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the beach and worked very well.  I&#x27;ve already bought another can of it because you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I find this sunblock spray for kids, simply perfect. It will not stain, it is not sticky, provides great protection. I just love it.</li>
    <li> Contrary to other ratings, this specific SPF product wasn&#x27;t included in the recall.  It doesn&#x27;t have an alcohol smell (although you still want to spray it outdoors), and it doesn&#x27;t sting my kids&#x27; skin, even the one with severe eczema.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but this specific SPF 110 product is the only one I can use on my kids&#x27; faces and not have it sting them.  It goes on thin and absorbs quickly, not leaving a greasy feeling like many other products out there.  I now buy it in bulk so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I try to use organics on my son&#x27;s skin as much as possible, but you just can&#x27;t find any that are spray on. This works great on the go and after hours in the sun my son&#x27;s soft baby skin is never been burned. I&#x27;ll say too that he has sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated it (we only use it once or twice a week at the most).</li>
    <li> really good kids product. I am pretty sure I have this on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I usually love Banana Boat and this could have been user error but everyone got burned in two hours at the pool on a hot Sacramento morning.  Next time we will put the Banana Boat lotion on first to get good coverage and reapply with the spray. My sister has blisters on her shoulders so it could be that she didn&#x27;t apply enough.</li>
    <li> I do take the time to write review when I know the will help others! This is the best sunscreen that I have ever found! My daughter has Atopic Dermatitis.....this is the ONLY sunscreen that she can use that will not break her out and provides highly effective sunscreen. She is not a baby anymore and I still go to this! I use the spray for her hairline and ears. While I prefer the lotion for her face and body. Hands down the best!</li>
    <li> awesome for my little ghost</li>
    <li> I purchased these because of the high SPF but they spray terribly. I was using a knock off brand before these and they sprayed well. These you have a hard time pushing it right (it&#x27;s designed to use your thumb to spray) and it comes out poorly.</li>
    <li> Best Sun protection I have ever used. Dries quickly, NEVER feels oily. I think some people think you just spray and that&#x27;s all. You should rub to spread it, like any other sunscreen. That eliminates splotches. I even spray it into my palms, then rub it onto my face and ears...because I don&#x27;t like spraying ANYTHING directly onto my space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Houston, I am blue eyed and fair skinned, but I have never gotten burned using this SPF 110.. It is water resistant for up to 85 minutes. I often swim for 90 to 120 minutes with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since it is made for kids, it does not run into, nor irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is fair and burns easily. It works. Have long bought kids sun screen because I can buy a higher number of protection. He likes the spray better than a rub on. Would easily buy again.</li>
    <li> There have been reports of four people catching on fire from the Banana Boat Ultramist products. Based on this I would say, do not buy this. You can research this on the internet but unfortunately I can&#x27;t post a link here for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If a consumer comes into contact with a flame or spark prior to complete drying of the product on the skin, there is a potential for the product to ignite.&amp;#34; This was stated by the manufacturer. There were about 25 products bearing the Ultramst name that were recalled although this particular one was not. I had some of this and threw it away to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> My kids and I used this sunscreen. We were in the sun for 75 minutes. I realized that evening that we were all severely sunburnt. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This definitely keeps you from burning.  I didn&#x27;t realize how high of an spf it was when I purchased it but very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Banana Boat products so I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one for my three girls, ages 2 - 6.  It is horrible! The spray is watery and clear and smells like rubbing alcohol.  My kids screamed and said it was burning their skin, especially when sprayed over any scrapes or mosquito bites.  I reapplied every 2 hours while they were swimming.  That evening, I noticed all of them had pink sunburned cheeks and shoulders and tan lines from their swimming suits!  I guess from now on I&#x27;ll just stick to the thicker creams because it seems this one just did not hold up in the water at all.  Very disappointed, I won&#x27;t be buying this kind again.  I do however, like the Banana Boat stick sunblock for their faces, that has worked for us in the past and doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes.  Don&#x27;t buy this spray!</li>
    <li> Easy to spray on. Smells like banana&#x27;s which I dislike greatly. Seems to protect well after one application but leaves a film behind that makes it nearly impossible to apply a second application later on, especially of another type such as lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for kids.</li>
    <li> Does not protect as expected, but good for no to much sun exposure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but it stinks in smell. Smells like bug spray.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described. It works.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  My infant daughter and preschooler both burnt when I put this on them multiple times.  I will never use again.</li>
    <li> Spray is nice but I&#x27;m not sure how good it really works. If you spray inside, the floors get covered with residue. I consistently have to reapply hourly and my daughter still got sun.</li>
    <li> Something wrong with the bottle. Couldnt spray out</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was what I used years ago at a theme park with my husband. The only thing was that I remember the sun screen I used back then was in a green can. Anyway, I bought this and used it last weekend while going to a fair.. I was out for probably 2 hours.. applied a ton of it and definitely got burned. I have no idea what happened because everywhere I put it got pretty pink. It was as if I didn&#x27;t have any block on. I wore a different sunscreen on my face and my face was fine (it was SPF 40 - a lotion type).. but this was awful. I am going on another trip to Las Vegas next week and am looking for something else. Be careful with this.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Toddlers never got a sunburn the whole summer. However, wouldn&#x27;t buy again, because I heard aerosols can be bad for their lungs? Haven&#x27;t researched it but it was enough for me to switch back to the rub-on kind. Its a great product if you want aerosol.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product is SPF100. That in itself makes it worth buying if you have kids. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the spray nozzle gets inexplicably clogged up, forcing me to stop, shake the bottle, then try spraying again. Not the easiest thing to do when you have impatient swimmers waiting to be sprayed.</li>
    <li> great product!!! especially for kids.  I can not find spf this high locally, love that its on &amp;#34;auto ship&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Purchased for summer use on my kids who are both have fair complexions. Sprayed it on both of my kids before we went to the beach to have fun, and even made sure that just about every inch of their skin was sprayed. Both of my kids ended up having places on their body with some patches being completely white and places that were red with a sun burn, even though I completely covered them head to toe in sun screen. Will never buy banana boat ever again since I can no longer trust their products after this.</li>
    <li> Pros: I spent 12 hours at Disney&#x27;s Magic Kingdom, reapplying every 2 hours, and didn&#x27;t get burned! It also applied very evenly and needed very little rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When it meets with water (on a water ride), it beads up. When you sweat (especially on your back), your skin gets greasy and never seems to dry.</li>
