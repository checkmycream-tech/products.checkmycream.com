      <li>It would just be nice though if it did have a temp control.</li>
      <li>I received a box that was labeled 1.5\\&quot; on it when it was suppose to be 1.25... he never stated there was going to be a glove in the box, while it was a nice surprise</li>
      <li>They leaked and kind of greased up the box and package.</li>
      <li>I ended up loving it though.</li>
      <li>I also hold it up to the root nice to create volume.</li>
      <li>thank you &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>With that said, im dissatisfied with the seller more than I am the product and</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I love this wand.</li>
      <li>They probably know that most people won&#x27;t bother to return it.  </li>
      <li>If your looking for perfect big curls, this is the wand for you!</li>
      <li>I was okay with that...</li>
      <li>So I used to use a regular curling iron but it made the curls too perfect</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)       </li>
      <li>Protected my hand on more than one occasion.</li>
      <li>So I am not always sure</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn my hair; more like, &#x27;steams&#x27; it.</li>
      <li>but I wanted looser, more wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>I took a gamble seeing that I don&#x27;t like to spend more than 20 on anything</li>
      <li>I love this wand</li>
      <li>I still love this curling</li>
      <li>SO much better than the cone shaped wands where my hair slides off the end.</li>
      <li>i love the way it works on my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron, however, you have to get used to this curling iron.  </li>
      <li>While the curling iron does heat nice and makes the curls nice and shiny they are much tighter of a curl than I want.  </li>
      <li>but I know I had used the ceramic and loved it and didn&#x27;t really want to have to give it up to chance whether it works well.</li>
      <li>that isn&#x27;t even LABELED right!!  </li>
      <li>My hair slips out of my fingers easily</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it, I use it almost every day and its so fast and easy and my hair looks great afterwards</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>My curls stay great, and into the next day, I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re slightly smaller than what I had hoped for, but they are beautiful shiny curls that stay even without product.</li>
      <li>It also works on volts from 110-240.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with my purchase, decent shipping time and would purchase again.</li>
      <li>, they go onto explain about an LED indicator light which it this iron does not have.</li>
      <li>Also, there is not LED indicator light.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews on this product and saw the price tag (over 50% of original $150 price) and couldn&#x27;t say no.</li>
      <li>its large and hot enough to make those perfect beachy waves</li>
      <li>so if You want an 1\\&quot; curling iron then it is not a bad one.</li>
      <li>Makes quick work of the curl.</li>
      <li>, what i really love about this is that its very fast and very effective, ive been curling my hair for the past year using a curling iron</li>
      <li>This thing gets hot!  </li>
      <li>I received the package within a few days which I was happy about.  </li>
      <li>but it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>I still burn my fingers occasionally, rarely, but that is bound to happen with a clamp-less iron.</li>
      <li>I bought this Feb of 2012, it came in the mail pretty quick.</li>
      <li>i used right after i got it</li>
      <li>Plus, I watched a girl on youtube burn her hair right off with a wand like this.</li>
      <li>I got rid of all the others!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up super fast and hot!</li>
      <li>ok, but the black cortex would have given much better performance.</li>
      <li>As far as the actual device, I wish there were heat setting, but it really does a great job</li>
      <li>I am used to my CHI which heats up super fast.  </li>
      <li>So, now knowing how hot this thing gets, I may just forget about it.</li>
      <li>it gets hot and the curl stays.</li>
      <li>It takes some getting used to and it gets REALLY hot</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, the thing stopped getting hot about two weeks after use.</li>
      <li>Also, there isn&#x27;t a light that indicates on or off, but that is my OCD kicking in - nothing major.  </li>
      <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but it still is a pretty decent size.</li>
      <li>It comes in a box and also comes with a heat protectant glove which was not listed but appreciated.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use it too much.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how curly my stick straight hair became.  </li>
      <li>Like many other reviewers, I also received a curling wand that&#x27;s 1&amp;#34; not 1.5&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I found this to be very strange and a strong indication that the box does not go with the product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and sometimes there are pieces that don&#x27;t want to behave and look like the rest. So I used to use a regular curling iron but it made the curls too perfect so they weren&#x27;t cohesive with my wavy/bohemian hair. But this makes them look like natural curls and I love it! It takes me about 7 minutes to get all of the misbehaving pieces and then I&#x27;m out the door. Plus I adored the price. A+++</li>
    <li> The curling iron is great! Sadly it doesn&#x27;t have heat regulation, but none the less, it does a great job. Also, I wish the manufacturer would have included information on the heat glove included, so you don&#x27;t have to buy another one unnecessarily.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. I use it all the time and it works great. If your looking for perfect big curls, this is the wand for you!</li>
    <li> This was suppose to be 1 1/4\\&quot;. The box said 1 1/2\\&quot;. It is actually 1\\&quot;. I ended up loving it though. SO much better than the cone shaped wands where my hair slides off the end. Beautiful waves, hot-hot-HOT, the glove included was nicer than the others I&#x27;ve seen as well. I&#x27;d be upset about the discrepancy if it had been a really expensive wand, but for this price? Nah.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail today, I thought what a great price! As i opened it, I noticed no seals or anything to indicate it had not been used. I have several irons in many different sizes. This description says 1.25 which I can assume is 1 1/4\\&quot;, the box said it was 1 1/2 \\&quot; but the actual iron is only 1\\&quot; I found this to be very strange and a strong indication that the box does not go with the product. The instructions are also strange, the say they are for the curling iron however, they go onto explain about an LED indicator light which it this iron does not have. The directions also are for a flat iron, and even state place hair between two hot plates of flat iron..? I haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;m going to return it yet..a couple other reviews said some of the same things. As for the product itself it does work.</li>
    <li> I recently tried a friends Keratin Complex 4 in 1 curling system. It was amazing! I have been using a Chi to curl my hair for years, but as we all know, it is a little more difficult. I don&#x27;t like traditional curling irons because they leave kinks from the clamp, or don&#x27;t hold curl. I wanted to find a substitute that was cheaper than the Keratin curling system (it is about $300). I also only needed one size, not all four. I found this on here, recieved it in two days, and the rest is history. It does just as good of a job at the Keratin brand for way, way, way cheaper. The curls HOLD and no more kinks. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because it doesn&#x27;t have a heat control button. It does come with a thermal glove, which is not mentioned on this listing. Buy this product! Great deal.</li>
    <li> i was amazed by this product, actually a friend of mine lend me her curling rod for my 26th birthday party last saturday april 2 and she set my hair using cortex pro curling iron and i was like WOW i need to get on of this, what i really love about this is that its very fast and very effective, ive been curling my hair for the past year using a curling iron but when i tried using the \\&quot;clipless\\&quot; i was amazed and would never go back to the curling iron.    the shipping and product was great, thank you amazon! &#x3D;)       i used right after i got it and my hair is like VAVAVOOM! im loving my curls!     thank you &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this curling iron! Definitely worth it, I use it almost every day and its so fast and easy and my hair looks great afterwards</li>
    <li> This curler is truly AMAZING it works great &amp; heats up quick! It&#x27;s also very simple to use &amp; the curls last ALL day! It&#x27;s the BEST curler money can buy!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Item as promised. Great buy.</li>
    <li> First of all, I got this package with 2 random bottles of leaky oil in the box. They leaked and kind of greased up the box and package. WTH?! This already turned me off. Then I opened the box and realized that it&#x27;s the wrong size, yet the box says 1.5 inches. WTH?!?!     I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on...</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it seems no matter how you do your curls you get celebrity hair!! i love it</li>
    <li> This curling iron produces the best waves! its large and hot enough to make those perfect beachy waves - I use it all the time. It takes some getting used to and it gets REALLY hot but it is a great curling iron.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use curling iron.  My only complaint, and its a small one, is that there are no other temperature settings.  Otherwise, it is a great and efficient product.  It curls instantly and thank goodness for the glove it comes with.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting a clipless curling iron for a while.  I was using my straightener to curl my hair which works great but I wanted looser, more wavy hair.  I thought I had to go expensive to get what I want but I read the reviews, got this one for a great price and have been getting compliments ever since.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy thick hair. This works perfectly on my hair. It gets hot enough to hold the curl for a long time. It is simple to use. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is the second curling wand I have purchased. My hair is pretty long, about 5 inches past my shoulders, and this wand works great for me because the barrel is all one size all the way down. With other wands that get small towards the end my curls were smaller then I wanted them to be. I still burn my fingers occasionally, rarely, but that is bound to happen with a clamp-less iron. My curls stay great, and into the next day, I absolutely love it. Considering my hair will not even curl let alone hold a curl with a traditional curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, however, you have to get used to this curling iron.  I can create great looks, but I let my sister barrow it today and she couldn&#x27;t get anything to happen for her  It takes a couple times to get it down.  Once you get the hang of it, you can create some beautiful looks.  I have long, long, thick, greasy, heavy hair and this iron allows my curls to last all day and are then nice waves the next day.  I do wish that the glove was a little bigger and had a little grip to it.  My hair slips out of my fingers easily so I don&#x27;t use it too much. Also, there isn&#x27;t a light that indicates on or off, but that is my OCD kicking in - nothing major.  I still love this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you cannot beat this.  I have paid this price for really bad curling irons.  Other clipless irons are over 100 bucks!!!!  Too pricey for me!!  I took a gamble seeing that I don&#x27;t like to spend more than 20 on anything but it was worth it.  This is going to be my go to curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styling tip: once I wrap it around the iron I take a butterfly clip and clip it to the iron holding the hair.  I am so clumsy I end of burning my hands the minute I look away.</li>
    <li> WOW! This thing gets hot!  By the time I had gotten around my whole head, I needed a second glove! I used one of those stretchy one size fits all gloves that every store sells around the holidays. I was super nervous about burning myself and I used a giant pot holder to set it down on when I needed a break.  I was amazed at how curly my stick straight hair became.  Banana curls have never worked on my hair before, but this wand made it happen.  The curls didn&#x27;t last all day, though, hairspray and all.  It just took so long because I had to be so cautious of the heat, that I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it. Plus, I watched a girl on youtube burn her hair right off with a wand like this. So, now knowing how hot this thing gets, I may just forget about it.</li>
    <li> I got this and started reading the directions - it didn&#x27;t match the product.  It talked about temperature setting on the iron, no such feature.  It talked about the flat plates and placing your hair between them, its just a rod, no flat plates.  This all makes me think it is a fake, that and the fact that the MSRP on the box is around $199&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove that came with it does nothing to protect my fingers from then heat.  Also, there is not LED indicator light.  So I am not always sure if I have turned it off or not.  I know it doesn&#x27;t say it comes with one, still I would have preferred one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes forever to heat up.  I am used to my CHI which heats up super fast.  I need to give this one a good 10 minutes to heat up.  If I use it too soon, the side I start on is less curled then the one I end on, even though I hold it for the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is ok and gets the job done, I am just not thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> This curler does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price, and curls my whole frizzy head in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only suggest to be careful with the heat, it gets just as hot as it says it does.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how he can advertise for something that is not what we are getting. I received a box that was labeled 1.5\\&quot; on it when it was suppose to be 1.25... he never stated there was going to be a glove in the box, while it was a nice surprise I already bought another one because I didn&#x27;t think it came with one.. and the biggest thing is that it is not ceramic is it titanium which I am not sure if that is better or what but I know I had used the ceramic and loved it and didn&#x27;t really want to have to give it up to chance whether it works well. It does not look like the picture, but I did try it and it does curl well. I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I specifically chose the black 1.25 cortex because I feel the black cortex locks in heat in your hair alot better than the silver ones do. When I recieved the package I not only did not recieve the black 1.25 cortex, but they sent me two 1.25 silver cortex&#x27; . If it wasnt in stock then it would be misleading to advertise for the black cortex. I have used the product and it locks in the curl ok, but the black cortex would have given much better performance. With that said, im dissatisfied with the seller more than I am the product and feel that I still should recieve the black 1.25 cortex.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re slightly smaller than what I had hoped for, but they are beautiful shiny curls that stay even without product. As far as the actual device, I wish there were heat setting, but it really does a great job so it deserves all 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this tool to friends and family.</li>
    <li> my husband bought this for me for xmas.. i love the way it works on my hair. it makes the curls super pretty and tight the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it doesnt have  a light indicator for when its ready like the directions state..</li>
    <li> I have a curling iron, but it never easily achieved the look I was going for (soft, believably-natural waves). That said, I searched high and low for a curling stick that met my budget. I read the reviews on this product and saw the price tag (over 50% of original $150 price) and couldn&#x27;t say no. I&#x27;ve loved owning it. Works just as I&#x27;ve expected. Doesn&#x27;t burn my hair; more like, &#x27;steams&#x27; it. VERY happy.</li>
    <li> The curling iron did not do what I thought it was going to.  It is hard to use and the results weren&#x27;t up to par with what the original price or the price that I paid for it was.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews after I ordered it.. I don&#x27;t know why did I do that, but any way - I wanted to be able to make bigger curls and it absolutely doesn&#x27;t look the way I expected it to look. so if You want an 1\\&quot; curling iron then it is not a bad one.</li>
    <li> This curling iron rocked my world when I bought it in 2011 and still does! I used to use drug store curling irons (like Conair, Revlon, etc) and the curl never held up till the next day or in the rain - my hair would be a disaster. This curling iron though makes my curls stay for so long and my hair looks like a hollywood star with the way this curling iron curls my hair. My old curling irons completely stunk compared to this. Everyone compliments me on my hair when I use it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is b/c it doesn&#x27;t have a heat setting but I have thin hair and never for a minute does this ever make my hair dry even at the 430 degree temp that it heats to. It would just be nice though if it did have a temp control. Amazon has this curling iron in a set with multiple size barrels and if you buy that set the curling iron has temp. control but I didn&#x27;t know about that set when I bought this curling iron. The 1.25&amp;#34; barrel is perfect.</li>
    <li> False advertising! Like many other reviewers, I also received a curling wand that&#x27;s 1&amp;#34; not 1.5&amp;#34;. I was okay with that...however, the box says &amp;#34;variable temp&amp;#34; but there&#x27;s definitley no temp control feature on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the thing stopped getting hot about two weeks after use. I&#x27;m hoping I can still return it...</li>
    <li> I use it all the time&lt;br /&gt;It works in my hair when its natural or when its straightened&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> I received the package within a few days which I was happy about.  I was expecting a 1.25\\&quot; barrel curling iron like the amazon description says.  The box said it was actually 1.5\\&quot; but the actual product was 1\\&quot;!  I did notice the box it came in was not shrink wrapped to begin with which seemed odd.  I ended up returning it because I already had a 1\\&quot; barrel.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best. Although it just has an on/off switch instead of selecting the heat level, it works great for me. I use it for tight curls or loose beachy waves.</li>
    <li> I had looked into purchasing the Sedu irons and I purchased this one instead. I love this wand it gets hot and the curl stays. I just wish it had a temperature adjustment.</li>
    <li> I bought this Feb of 2012, it came in the mail pretty quick. I believe I received it within a week. It came with a heat protectiong glove ( which was hard to use because my hair would just slip right thru my fingers so I gave up using it). Granted with an heating device; I did burn myself a few times while getting used to the curling wand. The packaging was very nice. I have hard to curl hair. If I want curls I usually have to use my flat iron. This curled my hair with ease and by the end of the day they were loose curls and just perfect. I really loved it. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because about 8 months later it quit heating up. Also it was just one button to turn on and no way to turn down the heat settings. I would of bought this product again but I chose to get the same brands 4 in 1 product. Hopefully it works just as great!!</li>
    <li> Awesome curls. Super hot, have to be very careful! MUST wear the glove! I have a scar from mine because I thought I could use it without the glove - I was wrong.</li>
    <li> Was concerned about the size as everyone was saying that it wasn&#x27;t 1&#x27;&#x27; 1/2 but a 1 inch. I don&#x27;t have any other curlers (either a wand or clamp) so I have nothing to compare it to, but it still is a pretty decent size. I have long hair so I was concerned about the wand making the curls too small that they almost become ringlets, but you can control how tight they are and the size is still big enough that they aren&#x27;t super small. I don&#x27;t hold it as long if I want it to be looser. The only con is that there are no heat settings so the heat is very high up to 450 degrees. However the tourmaline finish helps to protect your hair and I have very thick hair so I&#x27;m not too concerned about it. I also use a heat protectant spray so that helps. It heats up almost instantly, and the swivel helps to keep it from tangling. It comes in a box and also comes with a heat protectant glove which was not listed but appreciated. Protected my hand on more than one occasion. It also works on volts from 110-240.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied with my purchase, decent shipping time and would purchase again. You also cant beat the price that they are offering.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 1.25 inch based off the size barrel my current traditional clip curling is.  However the box I received says 1 1/2 inch and what I actually received is only a 1 inch.  While the curling iron does heat nice and makes the curls nice and shiny they are much tighter of a curl than I want.  I will be sending it back.</li>
    <li> I love this curing wand! I&#x27;ve had the cone shaped ones before and have used regular curing irons, this is by far worth every penny. I got rid of all the others!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up super fast and hot! It only has one heat setting, but realistically I never change the settings on any other devise. Makes quick work of the curl. I also hold it up to the root nice to create volume. This holds curl in my hair for two days no problem. (I have long straight hair naturally)</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling iron rod, expecting a 1.25\\&quot; rod.  Received it today and the package says 1.5\\&quot; and when I took it out of the box it&#x27;s really only 1\\&quot;!!!  This is so aggravating.  I haven&#x27;t even used it yet because I have other 1\\&quot; rods that give me that spiral &#x27;Taylor Swift&#x27; look that I can&#x27;t stand!  I don&#x27;t want tight spirals, I want big waves, hence my order of the 1.25\\&quot; rod.  They have my money and I don&#x27;t have the correct product as advertised.  This company obviously has not clue how to handle their business!  Not only is the box labeled wrong, but the true measurements don&#x27;t match anything - not the Amazon product and not the label on the box.  It&#x27;s smaller than both said measurements.  What a waste of money.  Not about to go through the hassle of returning it, as I&#x27;m sure they make that bet as they fail to care about their customers receiving the right products.  They probably know that most people won&#x27;t bother to return it.  They&#x27;ll just throw whatever they want in the box that isn&#x27;t even LABELED right!!  I&#x27;m never ordering from this comany again.</li>
