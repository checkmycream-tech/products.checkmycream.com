      <li>I found that that strength was not doing much, if anything, so I ordered the 50% glycolic acid.</li>

      <li>Works very well for my skin type (oily) &amp; complexion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 62 years old and get plenty of compliments on my skin, many from younger women.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s also a must to moisturize day and evenings, plus use a reputable sunscreen everyday.</li>
      <li>I first tried out Thanks for your review of Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel and have been using that religiously ever since 2011.</li>

      <li>If it hasn&#x27;t been done in a while might take several, gradual uses (with at least 7-10 days between) to cut through damaged outer layers to see good result.</li>
      <li>may use the same concentration but will probably use lower pHs because they are PROFESSIONALS and know (one would hope) exactly what they are doing.</li>
      <li>I had mild tingling but nothing extreme.</li>
      <li>It is definitely not a one shot, massively intense solution.</li>
      <li>I have noticed it is completely gone now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product is awesome, took away brown spots, and reduced pore size and some acne scaring. I bought the Glycolic 50% They sent me a free Salicylic 20% gel, These products are true to the discription, Love love love it!!!! Just follow the directions !</li>
    <li> Works good as one option to address issues in the gradual, controlled manner. I have to leave current bottle on for 4-8 mins at least (depend on thickness of skin at time, sensitivity, preparation but i never start that high first times) with multiple layers during that time to get good results but everyone body is different, everyone use frequencies are different (more often use usually mean less time needed) and every bottle purity may be different (label says start with 1 min and work up to 4 min so I use caution). Less is best, so I slowly try to find the least amount of time needed to leave on to get good result without leaving on too long (start with test in inconspicuous place). After rinsing off it works slowly after use and takes body sometimes at least a week to slowly and subtly work microscopically to smoothen and reveal full result. If it hasn&#x27;t been done in a while might take several, gradual uses (with at least 7-10 days between) to cut through damaged outer layers to see good result. It is definitely not a one shot, massively intense solution. Other solutions seem to be used for that. This operates more gradually and subtly with slightly improved noticeability after each use. This is review of my experience. On products like this that can effect body always remember don&#x27;t take review as advice.</li>
    <li> Even though the product says \\&quot;Peel\\&quot;, it does NOT, actually, make you peel, however, it does make a major difference in your skin&#x27;s skin tone and touch.  I have tried, virtually, everything from a department store to a mall kiosk expensive face products, but this one (who I heard about from my dermotologist), combined with a sunscreen will make an absolute noticable difference in your skin when used once a week.  Glycolic Acid 50% may be a little high for some people with sensitive skin, however, those who have received regular treatments of other types may find this to be just right.  It will sting, slightly, when applied during the first 5 minutes or so that it is left on your skin before it is washed off.  It has found a permanent place on my shelf!</li>
    <li> The product I received must be different from the one the other reviewers are raving about. I have used 10% Glycolic Acid and know how skin starts tingling or stinging after a few minutes of use. 25 minutes after I applied this product (50% Glycolic Acid),I still felt nothing: no tingling or stinging. I would return this product if the seller accepted returns.</li>
    <li> Twice I tried this peel just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t something I did wrong. It wasn&#x27;t. This product did absolutely nothing! Was like applying water! I am really upset I feel like I was taken advantage of!</li>
    <li> I had to wait a bit to review while using this product. I have been using this peel once a week for a couple months and it is awesome! My colouring is more even, pores smaller and it has definitely improved the texture of my skin. For years I had a wee hole on my cheek, from what I do not know. I have noticed it is completely gone now. You can feel it working it&#x27;s magic so have a fan close by and tough it out. Rinse with plenty of cool water. I have been applying a cortisone gel afterwards that I had got from a spa where I had a series of 6 very expensive peels done. The redness is gone soon. I use a light weight cream and plenty of sunscreen afterwards. Love it!!!!! BTW, I am 52 years old and thought I looked great before but this peel really improved upon that 100%.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased glycolic acid 10% products that were stronger than this supposedly 50% product. Dont be fooled or waste your money!</li>
    <li> I started off with the combo glycolic acid/lactic acid product because I have sensitive skin and wanted to start with a low strength. There was a little tingling, and the areas around my mouth dried out a bit, but my skin accommodated quickly. I found that that strength was not doing much, if anything, so I ordered the 50% glycolic acid. There was some slight tinging on my chest, but nothing on my face. I find it hard to believe this product is the strength they say. I will keep using it for a while and see if I get any results.     Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but the real issue I have with this company is that I suspect most of these reviews are fake, esp on the company website, but also on Amazon. The writers all seem to have a similar writing style and often write long reviews giving instructions on how to use and claiming great results. I&#x27;m not buying it. The real reviews are the ones with one or two stars. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Results were better than I had hoped for. My skin has been cleaned up significantly. I have very sensitive skin, and had used the 35% twice before at the dr.&#x27;s office for more than what I paid for this. It brought problems to the surface that eventually sloughed off. The first time I used it, more blemishes showed up than now because my skin is cleaner, clearer &amp; brighter. I used it on the bottoms of my feet to slowly remove callouses. I can leave it on as long as I want now without any burning. I also purchased the HQ+ &amp; was very happy with that as well.</li>
    <li> I have used the glycolic peel and am always told that I have great looking skin. I recommend this product and was pleased to save on shipping by purchasing through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The effect, for the time/trouble/price is very good. If you have paid for the treatment at a salon or spa, you know what I mean. If you haven&#x27;t tried Glycolic Acid at a professional concentration, you are in for a pleasant surprise. Use as directed, be careful of lips and eyes, WEAR SUNSCREEN, moisturize and eat right and you will see an improvement in you skin, from wrinkles to breakouts. Don&#x27;t use on open breakouts, it will fry the edges of the skin. If you are new to skin care, or you have dry skin, you might want to dilute it. If you are new to it and have oily skin, don&#x27;t wash your face first, the oil will help dilute it. Be gentle with your skin for 24 hrs after, no picking or pressing, this can leave broken vessels/red splotches. However, I use mineral makeup after with no problems.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results. I definitely saw some nice peeling effects of spots I had concerns about.</li>
    <li> I am frustrated beyond belief. I have had several 50% glycolic acid peels before. Usually by 3 minutes I&#x27;m frantically racing to get it neutralized, burning and stinging so much it&#x27;s unbearable. Just received this today. After 8 minutes I was still feeling nothing!!!!  I was wondering if I even needed to rinse my face off. I am extremely annoyed and hope to receive a refund of my 48 dollars!!! What a waste of money. It&#x27;s acid. It&#x27;s supposed to sting! Especially at 50%. I&#x27;m not new to this stuff. I&#x27;m frustrated that I&#x27;ve been had. Would give it zero stars but you have to give at least one.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite acid to work my skin. Its very potent and does what it claims. I will continue to order from this company and this acid. Great buy!</li>
    <li> in my over-40 skin. 50% only stings a bit, and, doesn&#x27;t have an ugly peeling period, for me. My 11s are improved and my feet are so much softer. I reordered before I ran out. Personally, I find coconut oil is a nice follow-up for the full treatment. For daily use, I moisturize with grape seed oil and put a few drops in that for good measure.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple of times but I can tell that my skin feels smoother and softer. The darker skin areas have also lightened some. I think with repeated use they will hardly be noticeable but only time will tell. I will likely order the 70% peel after I use all of this one. I would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 50% Glycolic Gel every week for a few years. I&#x27;m 62 years old and get plenty of compliments on my skin, many from younger women. After cleansing and when my skin is completely dry I pour a bit of the gel into a shot glass (actually, one of those little plastic cups that come with cough syrups) and fill till just the bottom is full. Then I dip a cotton gauze pad into the gel, dab onto my skin from hairline to just below the jawline and wait about 7 minutes. It does tingle (burn) sometimes but I&#x27;ve never experienced any burnt patches. I rinse with barely warm water - and lots of it! It&#x27;s also a must to moisturize day and evenings, plus use a reputable sunscreen everyday. I live on the Olympic Coast of Washington State and true to the \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot; series it&#x27;s very gray and rainy, but even overcast days have a UV index, so the sunscreen goes on!</li>
    <li> Turn it over when you get it and check the expiration date.  I wish I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and checked the order date: December 2011.  Expiration date: January 2011.  It had been expired for nearly a year when shipped.  That&#x27;s why you see all these people complaining about the strength.  They were shipping product that had long since expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin mostly in my T-zone. I first tried out Thanks for your review of Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel and have been using that religiously ever since 2011. I shortly bought the Glycolic Acid 50% Gel Peel in 2011 as well.&lt;br /&gt;This is a Level 4. So as indicated I built my tolerance ont eh Salicylilc Acid (Level 2) before I could go to Level 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always research before use/purchase and during use on all my products. These chemical peels are by far the best effective and do exactly what they are intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin Regimen: Glycolic Acid 50% Gel Peel&lt;br /&gt;I used it weekly as indicated and now I use it on occassion as it is strong yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;Read it&#x27;s info and levels at their website: https://www.skinlaboratory.com/</li>
    <li> NO PEELING. Did NOT reduce sun spots. Tried 3x, leaving on for up to 15 minutes... nothing but slight tingling.  This should have given me a salon worthy peel after 8 minutes max.  WASTE OF $$$$.</li>
    <li> This product is gel-type and is perfect, makes applying to facial area easier. Seems a little weaker than when I have the peels professionally done at the salon, but this works great for the &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; times. I also use it on the back of my hands (in addition to a hand cream with SPF) to help lighten the age/sun spots, works great!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Works very well for my skin type (oily) &amp; complexion. Would definitely recommend to experienced users.</li>
    <li> First, I want to say that my review is not fake, I&#x27;ve been buying on amazon for years. Why it works for some and not others is hard to pinpoint as there are a lot of factors that can affect results including, but not limited to, application and skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When comparing one product to another, even of the same %, you have to keep in mind that some peels are buffered and others not, that makes a BIG difference. What largely determines a peels potency is its pH, not just its percentage, and that&#x27;s one thing you also want to compare. Brand A 50% acid may not have the same pH as Brand B 50% Acid.  A 1.0pH peel can be 10Xs stronger than a 2.0pH. Spas may use the same concentration but will probably use lower pHs because they are PROFESSIONALS and know (one would hope) exactly what they are doing. For home use, safety is a priority because most of us are not fully knowledgeable and may hurt ourselves then blame the company. They are not meant to be the same as one peel you got at the spa but rather to achieve similar results gradually, in the comfort of your home, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are cumulative. Think of your skin in 10 points of depth (this is in no way accurate, just an example).  The first peel takes 2 points off and brings it to an 8. A week later you have new skin that brings it up to a 9. Next peel takes another 2 off, bringing you to a 7, a week later are back to an 8, and so it continues. So after several consecutive peels, you want to give your skin a few weeks of recovery, you don&#x27;t want your skin to get too thin. As far as this brand goes, the company has a lot of information on their website and are very responsive. I&#x27;ve been very happy with all their products and service so I continue to buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with peels started out with Lactic 50%, then Lactic 70%, then Glycolic 35% then Glycolic 50%. The glycolic 50% definitely \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; a lot more than any of the lactics! The first time I tried this peel, I started with a one minute application. I had mild tingling but nothing extreme. I added 1 min each time until I was doing 4 min. I continue to notice subtle improvements as I continue my applications. My skin looks smoother and somewhat clearer but glycolic does not have the moisturizing qualities of Lactic. From my understanding, they work on different levels of the skin. The glycolic being able to penetrate to a slightly deeper level and can help with the texture of the skin as opposed to lactic which works more on the surface. So, now I alternate one week of lactic, one of glycolic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hispanic with fair-medium skin. I&#x27;ve struggled with stubborn, resistant hyper-pigmentation (melasma) around my eyes for years. I tried countless products that seemed to work for others but not for me. Only photofacials had been able to remove it but it returns with the slightest bit of sun (hyper-active melanocytes) so they were too expensive for a temporary solution. These peels, week by week, gradually increasing the strength, along with a combination of other products I have listed on my profile, has slowly and surely faded my melasma. It&#x27;s now 95% gone. It will still occasionally come back when I have a run in with the sun but it fades away again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I will note about Melasma that I have noticed is that smoking aggravates it. When I quit smoking, my melasma was easier to treat. When I started again, some came back. This happened twice. I looked it up online and saw that other people struggling with melasma experienced the same thing. When I get the urge to smoke, I now use electronic cigarettes and those have not had any effect on my melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES ON PEELS:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t do it more often than they recommend.  They recommend you do it every so often for a reason. Your skin has to have time to heal and develop new skin before you strip it away again.&lt;br /&gt;-You HAVE to wear sunblock. Your skin is more exposed and vulnerable to damage from sun. Protect it. If you don&#x27;t you are canceling out or even reversing your progress. I like this one, [[ASIN:B004ZF75LS Ole Henriksen Protect the Truth Sunscreen SPF 50+-1.7 oz]].  Its not the best moisturizer but as a sunblock, its great.  Its my favorite because its hard to find high spf that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze, smell funky or make your eyes tear up.&lt;br /&gt;-When you are doing your peels, make sure you start with a clean DRY face, water will dilute the acid in your peel. I am wondering if thats why some people did not see any results.  I wash my face, swipe it with alcohol on a cotton ball to remove any leftover oils and to help dry it. Wait 10-15 minutes, then apply the peel.&lt;br /&gt;-Use a fan brush like this one[[ASIN:B004NMF63W Taklon Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator for Glycolic Lactic TCA Skin Peel / Masques (Small)]]. Mine has lasted over a year. You can use cotton balls/squares but I think they absorb product so you will waste some and get less peels out of your bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-Watch your face when the peel is on.  The recommended time is a guideline, everyones skin is different and reacts differently. Thats why they recommend you start slow.  Some are ok 1 min the first time, others the full 4 min.  Once your skin starts looking pinkish, its time to remove. If it gets red, you&#x27;ve gone too long.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you wash off ALL of the acid. Wash, rewash, wash again.  I like to shower right after to make sure its all gone.  Any leftover acid will continue to work its way into your skin. I like to use a post peel neutralizer as an extra precaution. MD Formulations had a post peel neutralizer that was AWESOME but they don&#x27;t sell it individually. I am trying this one [[ASIN:B000VEN3RW Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]]. It works but I am still trying to find one more like the MD formulations one.  You pour onto cotton ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water. You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize after. This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]. I also use it as a night cream. Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a residue.le to damage from sun. Protect it.

    <li> Delivery and ordering was issue free.  I just expected it to be stronger.  I have used the 70% one before so this one felt a little weak.  May just be me though......</li>
