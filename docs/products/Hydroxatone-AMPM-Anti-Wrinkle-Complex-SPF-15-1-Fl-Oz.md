      <li>This cream feels really good and goes on with no problem as a night cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d seen it advertised on TV and it sounds good.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes people have reactions to perfectly good products.</li>

      <li>I am fair completed and am ex smoker and have seen results minimizing the wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
      <li>Also, eating a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and lots of water results in beautiful, hydrated skin,; just like God, in Jesus Christ&#x27;s name, intended.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Love this product and have been using it for sometime now with great results.</li>
      <li>It seems perfect for my skin right now.</li>
      <li>I like it best right after washing my face and neck with warm water.</li>
      <li>I love this product, have been using it for years!</li>
      <li>I still love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love Hydroxatone products!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
      <li>I personally love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Instead I received Hydroxatone Intensive which is more a gel &amp; not so pleasantly scented.</li>
      <li>Ingredients are very important and I feel they do provide good fulfillment in that catagory</li>
      <li>and it is amazing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is amazing plus has the benefit of being spf 15.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice feel on the skin.  </li>
      <li>nice cream</li>
      <li>So, is hydroxatone also fraudulently claiming your products contain effective ingredients when they in fact contain nothing but sunscreen?</li>
      <li>It is the best that I have tried and service was fast.</li>
      <li>pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be fair, I&#x27;m going to try it again to make sure it was the cream that caused the pimples.  </li>
      <li>The best cream I have tried so far!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>the vitamin A in this product is controversial.</li>
      <li>However, some of these ingredients are controversial and may not protect that well.</li>
      <li>the vitamin A in this product is controversial.</li>
      <li>I am 75 yrs young, this is best Anti-Wrinkle cream that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is great for winter use, when one wants a more effective day cream.</li>
      <li>and I thought if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  </li>
      <li>so I would suggest it more so at night or during the day if you don&#x27;t wear makeup or don&#x27;t put to close around the eye area which kind of defeats the purpose about minimizing fine lines.</li>
      <li>and I broke out in couple huge pimples!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>Octinoxate (which is misspelled on the Amazon description as of 1/10/2013) is considered fairly safe although EWG [Environmental Working Group] says \\&quot;Estrogenic effects are noted in laboratory animals as well as disruption of thyroid hormone and brain signaling.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of different products over the years but nothing compares to how great my skin looks and feels with Hydroxatone!!</li>
      <li>Reminded me more of tanning oil than sun</li>
      <li>I love this product and what a bargain price.</li>
      <li>Love that it has SPF as well.  </li>
      <li>and maybe we should stick with companies who have delivered beauty products to use for many years - those companies seem to do the research required to give us more bang for our buck.  </li>
      <li>It may work better for you</li>
      <li>Will buy more.</li>
      <li>And cancel you Credit Card as soon as you order your free sample!</li>
      <li>I love it also my mother</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My sister gave me this product several years ago and I use it morning and night. I am fair completed and am ex smoker and have seen results minimizing the wrinkles around my mouth. I love it!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this product, but the bottle she got from this purchase seemed to be out of date. the expiration date had a sticker over it and it was oilier than previous bottles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hydroxatone for about 6 months.  My husband has not yet told me I look \\&quot;10 years younger\\&quot;, because I don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a fine moisturizer, but not much better than others I have tried (Oil of Olay, Loccitane, etc.) and not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this was throught Hydroxatone website.  The price is $88, I loved it, but couldn&#x27;t afford it.  I found this on Amazon and it only costs $34, including shipping..What a bargain!</li>
    <li> No real results revealed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Product is very rich and a little does goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this product and for the price I have found that there are drug store items (Olay, Garnier and Neutrogena) that work just as well if not better than this product, especially for me.  It may work better for you then it has for myself so it &#x27;could be&#x27; worth a try.  As for me, I will go back to my other product that worked better for my skin.  I truly feel this product is more hype than fact; I also feel it is way over priced.  Ingredients are very important and I feel they do provide good fulfillment in that catagory however BEAUTY CAN BE GOTTEN AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE and maybe we should stick with companies who have delivered beauty products to use for many years - those companies seem to do the research required to give us more bang for our buck.  THANK YOU for the opportunity to leave this review.</li>
    <li> Love this cream..very moisturizing .</li>
    <li> Great product. I saw results after 3 days.</li>
    <li> use it in the morning and at night. it is a great product! thank you as always. i&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> At first, I couldn&#x27;t tell whether or not this product works.     I got a sample of a different product in the Hydroxatone line (90 Second Instant something or other). It worked so well I went on Amazon the next day and ordered what I thought was the same product.     I realized my mistake after the fact. Since I don&#x27;t have issues with wrinkles (but puffy undereyes), I wasn&#x27;t expecting great results. But as soon as I started using it, I started getting compliments on my MAKEUP. I hadn&#x27;t changed my makeup, so it must be this stuff.      It doesn&#x27;t really help with puffy eyes, so I bought the undereye product, as well. Between these two products, my face has been looking brighter--or at least I think it has.     I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 for two reasons: 1) the TV commercials promise dramatic results, and my results were subtle; 2) it stings a little, especially when applied near the eye area, so I&#x27;m not sure it should be used on the eyelids.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0013COFAU Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex For Day and Night Use SPF 15]]  I love the texture of this moisturizer.  It is very creamy yet light.  It leaves a nice feel on the skin.  The price is very good through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and for the price I have found that there are drug store items that work better than this product.  My skin does not feel any better/smoother, it actually feels dryer since I started using this. I find I have to put another lotion on shortly after putting this on.  Makes me wonder what they actually even sent me as I read that it works for others. I&#x27;m not impressed as I had hoped to be with this product.</li>
    <li> My order came promptly, no waiting. Product is exactly as advertised. I was very happy to find the deal on it that I did. Amazon  is the best and nearly the only place I shop anymore for anything I cant get at the grocery store or WM. Sad but true. It just so easy. This moisturizer is amazing plus has the benefit of being spf 15. Has caused no skin problems and I have very sensitive skin. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I used to like it but the chances of getting a good product are about 50 50 so I will be finding something entirely different.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very good price.  Will contribute to buy it.</li>
    <li> WELL I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE AUGUST AND I THINK FOR ME IS WORKING WELL MY FRIEND SONIA PEREZ INTRODUCED ME TO THIS PRODUCT. SONIA HAD GIVEN ME A SAMPLE AND I LOVED THE WAY IT LEFT MY SKIN, SO YES SO FAR SO GOOD I MAY SAY SO I WILL CONTINUE ON.</li>
    <li> You have 30 days to try this product.  After 3.5 weeks, I saw absolutely no difference whatsoever and it made my undereyes itch.  When I called to get a Return Number, I was told that it takes 6-9 weeks to see a difference.  Then, why would they only give you 30 days to try it?  I did get the return number and sent the product back.  If there was a \\&quot;zero\\&quot; rating, I&#x27;d give it that.</li>
    <li> August 11, 2011&lt;br /&gt;SUITS SAY THERE ARE WRINKLES IN HYDROXATONE&#x27;S RISK-FREE-TRIAL OFFER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketers of the anti-aging skin treatment Hydroxatone are being sued for wooing customers with a free trial and then allegedly denying refunds and applying excessive charges. In putative class actions in federal court in Newark, customers say they face unauthorized credit card charges, difficulty returning products, unwanted shipments of products and other problems. Customers who call to complain \\&quot;are verbally abused and refused any recourse,\\&quot; the plaintiffs allege in one of the suits, Gray v. Hydroxatone LLC, 11-cv-4586, filed Monday. The plaintiffs allege violations of the N.J. Consumer Fraud Act, breach of contract and unjust enrichment and seek equitable and injunctive relief, damages, restitution, attorneys&#x27; fees and costs, and other relief.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smooth and has a nice fresh look! Not greasy, I wear it am and pm. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and although it is very creamy and smooth I can not tell any difference in the texture of my skin. purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described and I received it it a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and used it over a period of 3 months. It did nothing for skin tone or wrinkles. I might as well have been using vaseline on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up and passed it to my sister who recently confirmed that she has had no results.&lt;br /&gt;My blood pressure rises each time I see it advertized on TV. Daylight robbery.</li>
    <li> I am now using the entire line of Hydroxatone. I see a big difference in my face. My daughter commented on how great my eyes look and my husband told me I am beautiful without makeup. Good stuff for beautiful people.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I am very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> My husband thought I would like the cream arranged a trial didn&#x27;t read the fine print and $300.00 later we cancelled further deliveries.  They probably operate within the law but I feel their operating procedures are unethical they suck people in to buy products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hydroxatone for over a month. My skin feels smooth, but that&#x27;s it. There is absolutely no change with my fine lines. The product does go on greasy, but is absorbed quickly. I found it just another product in the anti aging industry that does not deliver.</li>
    <li> This review was sent out to soon, but I think I will like it when I have had time to use it for a couple of weeks to a month</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  I love this product and what a bargain price. I had very uneven skin. I had a dark patch on each cheek. With in 1 month the  patches were faded and after 2 months they were gone</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams claiming to reduce wrinkles and improve the condition of the face.  This is by far the best.  Does what is says it will.</li>
    <li> I use hydroxatone as a daily moisturizer.  It has SPF 15 which is very effective.  I also like the texture and coverage.</li>
    <li> A friend actually gave me a jar of this and i&#x27;ve been using now for a couple of weeks and it is amazing i love it!! I put it on my forehead and I have definately seen a difference!! And I feel like once you put it on everytime it working you just feel it working and its not greasy @ all!!! This is like a miracle in a jar!!!!! I give this 5 stars all the way keep up the good work!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had some minor facial treatments which required me to purchase an outragiously priced product by another company. (TNS)  I bought the high end product twice and found that I just could not do it again.  After much research I found Bellaplex and purchased it.  For the money, I found it comparable in expectations to TNS but much cheaper.  I would recomment this product to anyone in need of keeping your skin soft, even toned, mosturized, and younger looking.</li>
    <li> Great item, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I stopped using it.  I found regular moisturizing lotion was just fine.  Also, eating a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and lots of water results in beautiful, hydrated skin,; just like God, in Jesus Christ&#x27;s name, intended.</li>
    <li> Not only is this product garbage but they use deceptive and scammy advertising techniques. I participate in an email/advertisings rewards program which pays you to read emails/try out offers. These ppl advertise on there and the reward you receive is $10 for a \\&quot;risk free, free trial \\&quot;. I wondered &#x27;how is that possible &#x27; so i went a &#x27;googling and found nothing save faux review /pr scammy sites. I am grateful to amazon for showing me the truth (the most expensive $10 you&#x27;ll ever earn) and though i don&#x27;t care about the product i wanted to leave a neg review so that as many ppl as possible learn the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world&#x27;s really gotten to the point where, to thinking people, the amount /hype of advertising is INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL to the actual value of a product. This junk is a prime example.</li>
    <li> Product was purchased after using sample received in the mail.  Product was not the same consistency as the sample and did not seem as effective.  Perhaps this was my fault in order a similar, but not exact, product.</li>
    <li> Product counterfeit - contains sunscreen only! NOT the anti-wrinkle hydroxatone!</li>
    <li> Only using product for a few days very disappointed with this product finds it stings my skin and makes my eyes water very disappointed would love to send back but the costs is  too much. I feel that I have been misinformed will never get caught like this again.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product on an infomertial and now I can&#x27;t live without it....I will use everyday forever....It is silky smooth and leaves no heaviness or sticky film....it goes great under make up too!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have been using it for years!  It&#x27;s very hydrating and makes my skin look amazing!  It definitely keeps the fine lines and wrinkles away!  I have tried a lot of different products over the years but nothing compares to how great my skin looks and feels with Hydroxatone!!</li>
    <li> I started using this about a year and a ahlf ago and was immediately sold on it.  It seems to smooth the fine lines around my mouth and forehead and it lasts forever.  A lttle bit goes a long way so it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year.  It definitely made my skin tighter and brighter.  Love that it has SPF as well.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> From my experience Hydroxatone products act no better than any other moisturiser. Their big scam is in their billing and lack of genuine communication. I have been charged for a free sample(a  supposed  reward for completing a small survey), charged for another shipment I did not order, charged for and did not receive a refund for another shipment that  I sent straight back without accepting delivery and finally charged for a shipment that I did not receive. I  cancelled my Visa Card but not in time to pay over&lt;br /&gt;$AU300. There has been a refund of $AU8.65! They have refused to address any of my issues and have simply sent an identical automatic reply to all my enquiries. Sadly my issues are shared world wide despite a class action in their home city - Jersey City,&lt;br /&gt;New Jersey, USA.. A rash of new &amp;#34;surveys&amp;#34; have started last week with the same &amp;#34;free rewards&amp;#34;- Hydroxatone, Celebrity Weight Loss, and a $50 Visa Gift Card that is never available?? Please read all reviews and complaints before replying to Hydroxatone ads. And cancel you Credit Card as soon as you order your free sample! At the moment this company seems untouchable.</li>
    <li> very good cream I love it also my mother</li>
    <li> Not a first-time user.  Still enjoy the results from nightly use.</li>
    <li> The packaging was different than the product and the product is more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer. It&#x27;s thick and greasy. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother who swears by this cream.  She has been using it for years and years.</li>
    <li> Burned and broke my skin out.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money - joke of a product.  And, you will likely get trapped in the auto ship deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  Because I have very sensitive facial skin, I have to be&lt;br /&gt;very careful about my choice of an anti-wrinkle facial cream.  I recommend it  to someone with equally sensitive&lt;br /&gt;skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself, and found that my wife had appropriated it. She loves it - when she compares this to more expensive products, this is both more effective and cost-effective. Certainly worth a try.</li>
    <li> Showed this product to my dermatologist and she said that it is a sunscreen product . . . not anti-wrinkle.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> It is smaller thatn I had expected.</li>
    <li> I did not find any noticeable improvement in my skin tone from this product.  I have oily skin and it seemed to only emphasize that more.</li>
    <li> I started the program last year and love the results.  I was looking for deep moisture and this really fulfills my needs for severe moisture.  I tried everything before finding this.  Love Love Love</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for over a year now. It&#x27;s amazing. My skin is never dry, and always looks hydrated.</li>
    <li> I called the toll free number for Hydroxatone to look into taking advantage of the free trial period.  I wanted to know the price first.  I do not remember the price I was given, but it was over $80.  I decided to opt out of the free trial before I even gave out my debit card information.  The person tried to get me to at least take advantage of the free trial.  If I did not feel that it was worth that price, I could return it.  I said that if they mail the free trial to me, I would send it back without even trying it.  Therefore, there was no reason for me to give out any credit/debit card information.  To those of you who could not get any refund on the Hydroxatone and continue to get charged for what you keep returning, I would suggest that you report this to your credit/debit card company and ask for a change of your credit/debit card number and have your card replaced.  Be sure to advise them of your most recent credit/debit card purchases that were authorized by you.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all the Hydroxatone products I use.  Keeps my skin looking great and has SPF as a bonus.</li>
    <li> I have used this product probably for about 3 - 4 months,  I have very large pores and acne scars and they are starting to fade.  Taking a little time but nothing works overnight.  I was buying this at Kohls for $59 or $69, can&#x27;t remember and glad that I can purchase here at a lower rate.  I tried something from QVC for $66 a month, was supposed to be enough for 3 months at 2x a day.  By the end of month 2 it is gone and I still owe another month.  I will return to Hydroxatone.</li>
    <li> nice cream ~ i am in the sun a lot and my skin feels soft and protected.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product on a television ad and I thought if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Prior to using this, I had been using a brand available in any drug store which Consumer Reports selected as the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for two weeks.  I am in my forties with sensitive skin, so I would be the consumer it would be marketed to.  Almost immediately, I noticed my skin was much drier and very flaky, especially on the cheeks.  If anything it made my skin look thinner and older.  it has been over a week since I discontinued using it, and my skin still feels very tight and dry, even though I have resumed my usual routine.  Prior to using this, my skin never felt that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for the cream say to keep away from the eye area.  It should go further and say it is a major eye irritant.  The other product I use may be used in the eye area and one night, after a rough day, I spaced and put this cream on like I always do.  It got into my eyes and BURNED!  I felt like someone had poured shampoo directly into my eyes.  I had to wash my face and rinse my eyes with water for about ten minutes before I could stand it.  My eyes were still so irritated the next day I couldn&#x27;t wear my contact lenses.  Another time I accidently rubbed a smaller amount into one eye and it was the same reaction, only not as severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money.  I appreciate the lack of coloring and fragrance but it has not aided in my skin&#x27;s appearance or level of moisture.  In fact I regret the weeks I have used it in place of my normal products.  As I was curious I went to the internet to look up the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar lists three ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;75% Octinoxate - a chemical compound from petroleum by-products used for sun protection&lt;br /&gt;4.5% Octocrylene - absorbs UVB and short wave UVA rays&lt;br /&gt;3.5% Oxybenzene - used in sunscreens, highly criticized since 1993 as it penetrates skin and acts as a photosentizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything listed on the jar is for sun protection, I guess that is why it is called an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle cream\\&quot; as sun does cause wrinkles.  In my opinion there are far better and less expensive sunscreens on the market.</li>
    <li> This cream feels really good and goes on with no problem as a night cream. But as a day cream under foundation it tends to come through and give you a shiny oily look and make your face feel greasy. So I use it at night and there is no oily feeling upon awakening in the morning. As for the anti wrinkle affect it might be more affective if it was an oil-free base where you could utilize it during the daytime but it&#x27;s not quite there. This might be good for someone that has really dry skin that is not sensitive to the hydroxatone formula. For that reason and for that price I&#x27;ve had better luck with other brands I could use in the daytime that were more economical and when this is gone I think I will switch back to my tried and true good ole standby as I really see no outstanding results from this free trial. Just cannot justify the cost with the effects, or lack of.</li>
    <li> I love this product, have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  I am 73 and it makes my face look much better so imagine what it would do for someone younger.  I have ordered it several times over the past two years.</li>
    <li> A letter I wrote to Hydroxatone after they denied returning my funds..And they returned my money as they should...Hope this helps someone else who has been scammed by them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Whom it May Concern,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Lindsey and I am a law student in British Columbia, Canada. In July, I saw an ad for your product online. Without first doing any research, I hastily made the decision to sign up for the \\&quot;risk-free\\&quot; trial, thinking that the company would send me a small sized sample package that I could try out.  Mid July I then received two entire bottles of the product, and thought that that was a lot of product just to be sampling. Life gets busy, and I hadn&#x27;t even used the product yet when, on July 18th, I saw a charge for the product on my bank statement. Immediately I called the number on your website and was assured by one of your employees that you could refund my money. Your employee redirected me to another number to call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now mid August and I have barely made a dent in one of the two jars you sent me. In fact, I do not like the product, it feels too greasy for my skin, and in fact I thought it felt very much like a sunscreen. Just yesterday I had some time to call about the charge on my bank statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The representative on the phone told me that there is no way to possibly refund my money and in fact I am due to be debited additional charges because it was past the 30 day trial period. I tell him I do not even use or want the product and that I did not agree to be charged in the first place, let alone ever agree to future charges.  He tells me that I will be sent to collections if I do not pay! I am outraged. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Not to mention, lawfully, your company&#x27;s actions equate to fraudulent activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At no time was I made aware that I would be charged full price for the products in the \\&quot;risk free\\&quot; trial or put on an auto-ship type program. Your employee on thetelephone informed me that the small print where these facts are disclosed was not provided (with cancellation instructions) until AFTER I had entered my credit card information online for the free trial.  Ultimately, failing to be informed of purchase details before entering into a contractual agreement is, without a doubt, FRAUD. I was not made aware, either, that I would have to incur costs returning the product in order to get my money back. Again, this is fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wonder where on the website a person is given the option to order just a single jar of your am/pm cream or the \\&quot;Instant Effect 90 second wrinkle reducer\\&quot;?  I was not sent the Instant Effect, and on your website it appears to be a separate product. Does this product even exist? If so, why is the only option on your website to sign up for the \\&quot;free-trail\\&quot; which does not include this product? I do not believe any other ordering options exist.  It seems curious to me why a legitimate company would not have legitimate ordering options, only a \\&quot;free-trial\\&quot; option. This seems largely a method of fraudulent websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does your company trick consumers into purchasing your product, after doing some research, I question the product&#x27;s authenticity. Some websites claim that your creams contain anti-aging ingredients such as Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic Acid, and Argireline. However, the label only lists Avobenzone, Homosalate and Octisalate.  Homosalate is merely a compound derived from salicylic acid and is contained in 45% of all US sold sunscreens.  Avobenzone and Octisalate are also ingredients whose clinical uses are simply to block UVA and UVB rays respectively. NO OTHER INGREDIENTS ARE LISTED on the jar.  So, is hydroxatone also fraudulently claiming your products contain effective ingredients when they in fact contain nothing but sunscreen? I have half the mind to have the product&#x27;s ingredients analyzed in my university laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I am officially requesting the funds you unlawfully debited from my account on July 18, 2013 returned to me promptly. If you do not comply, I will take this further.  I will retain an attorney and I will investigate how to go about reporting your business to every consumer fraud department in North America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to your company&#x27;s denying to return funds, refusal of any recourse and attempting to apply additional charges, along with false advertising of product ingredients, I know I have the resources and ability to file for, and in time be awarded, damages caused by consumer fraud.  I would also seek equitable and injunctive relief, restitution and attorney&#x27;s fees. I will see to it that other consumers are made well aware of your fraudulent activity.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before and absolutely loved it. From the very first time I used what I ordered here it was not the same. It never felt smooth and creamy. Always felt greasy. This week when I opened it to use it, it has completely turned to a yellow grease and has evaporated to nearly nothing. Don&#x27;t buy from this company.</li>
    <li> great product.  this is my third jar.</li>
    <li> This really works.  It absorbs instantly, improves skin tone, minimizes wrinkles and lasts better than any other moisturizer and anti-wrinkle application i ever tried at any price.  It is phenomenal, easy too apply, and is not at all greasy.  Using it for a few days, the effects are readily visible and remarkable.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for 6 weeks now, day and night. It feels nice on my skin but as advised on the jar I did not put it around my eye area ( even though it states its good for crows feet) but the cream does make its way into the eyes and when it does it is very very uncomfortable. Stinging, watering, redness, horrible ! . I have to say that I see no improvement to my skin at all, so I guess my advice, if asked regarding purchasing this cream would be, save you money.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed for the first time.  There was hardly enough to last a month</li>
    <li> I had used this face crème for quiet a long time, and I have had  extraordinary resulst.  My skin is dry and hard to absorb any product, this is the only one that adds glow and revitalizes my face.</li>
    <li> There was an expiration date change on the product handwritten. It only had about a six week shelf life with the altered date.</li>
    <li> I will never buy from Hydroxatone again.  After returning some of their products I was given a credit but when I went to use the credit 6 months later they have no idea who I am or what I am talking about.  They kept $139 of my money and I got nothing in return.</li>
    <li> Returned product as i researched this product on the internet and it contained ingredients that makes your skin droop!Other reviews were certainly not good either.&lt;br /&gt;I hardly found anyone that said yeah they looked 10 years younger like the ad says.&lt;br /&gt;Bunch of hype and marketing to make money off of our poor souls that just want to make aging alittle better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkly Complex SPF 15 on and off for about 4 years now.  I&#x27;ve tried a few others in-between including Strivectin only because a friend told me it was a miracle cream.  I have to admit I always go back to Hydroxatone.  Not only does it significantly reduce appearance of wrinkles it also does a wonderful job of tightening the skin.  I am now 61 and will use Hydroxatone products forever!</li>
    <li> I was foolish to try the Ha ha risk free Hydroxatone trial as what this really meant was they charged me £80 on my card which is in the small print buried somewhere when you give them card details - big mistake do not do it. They were rude and caused me undue stress when I tried to return the product which is useless in my view.</li>
    <li> The product is advertised as anti-wrinkle and is supposed to serve \\&quot;as your daytime moisturizer, your nighttime moisturizer, your anti-aging treatment and SPF 15 sunscreen.\\&quot; I have not used it long enough to judge it&#x27;s wrinkle-fighting properties but the box says it contains Argireline which was recently developed to combat wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the box, the ingredients listed there are not identical to the list as it now appears on the Amazon description, so if your skin is sensitive, get out your reading glasses before you open the container and read over the long list on the box. Unfortunately the typeface is small and the pretty silver on blue color scheme does not offer much contrast. I&#x27;ll mention a few of the ingredients below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several ingredients are supposed to be sunscreens adding up to SPF 15.  However, some of these ingredients are controversial and may not protect that well. Octinoxate (which is misspelled on the Amazon description as of 1/10/2013) is considered fairly safe although EWG [Environmental Working Group] says \\&quot;Estrogenic effects are noted in laboratory animals as well as disruption of thyroid hormone and brain signaling.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another sunscreen in this product, Oxybenzone, is considered somewhat risky by researchers. EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Database cautions that it may cause \\&quot;Biochemical or cellular level changes\\&quot; and is associated with photo allergic reactions. Furthermore, it contaminates the bodies of 97% of Americans according to the Centers for Disease Control research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Octocrylene is another sunscreen in this product that has dubious utility. Wikipedia says \\&quot;This organic compound can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA damage and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-user.\\&quot; Whoa, that&#x27;s alarming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the vitamin A in this product is controversial. Here&#x27;s what I found: In the presence of sunlight Retinyl Palmitate (vitamin A) may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions. Also, the FDA (USA) has raised a concern that  daily skin application of vitamin A creams may be undesirable for women of child-bearing age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative and sometimes causes an allergic reaction. As far as I could tell, most of the other ingredients in Hydroxatone seem to be safe. But I would not use it as a sunscreen due to the concerns mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the cream felt smooth on my face although it did not comfort my winter-dried hands at all. I suppose that is because it is non-greasy. Anyway, now that I have read up on the ingredients I cannot recommend this product for daytime use.creen-users compared to non-user.\\&quot; Whoa, that&#x27;s alarming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the vitamin A in this product is controversial.

    <li> I have been using this product for almost one year and find that it does help to reduce the vertical lines above the mouth.  I find very good prices on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> It will take a few months to know for sure about the \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; part of the claim but in a couple weeks it has lived up to expectations.  We have been having severely cold weather resulting in very dry indoor and outdoor air and very dry skin.  Within minutes of application my skin feels much less tight and dry.  This is a day and night use cream that is very thick but goes on easily, without dragging or pulling skin, and leaves no oily or sticky feel.  When I put it on before going to bed there is to wicking into a pillowcase at all.  At this time I would recommend it to friends to at least give it a try.  I like it, but since it was through Amazon Vine I have no idea what the price will be (or is if it has already reached store shelves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/27/2013 Update:  I still love this product!  It&#x27;s been seven weeks and there is at least another two weeks supply in the jar.  My severely sun-damaged facial skin is showing significant improvement in reducing lines and wrinkles as well as moisture.  I&#x27;m using it at bed time, once daily alternating mornings with another similar product.  Now it&#x27;s time to start looking for it on store shelves !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/18/2013:  Just finished the jar last evening so it went a little beyond my \\&quot;another two weeks\\&quot; estimate.  I still like the product and I&#x27;m very pleased with the skin improvement I&#x27;ve experienced.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cream.  Seems to be helping</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a year. Noticed results within a month. To use something for over a year is a long time for me.</li>
    <li> I received this AM/PM Anti Wrinkle Complex w/ spf15 Hydroxatone from amazon on the vine and have been using it for about 2 wks. It is a very thick moisturizer and does seem to go a long way. If you tip the container upside down nothing would come out. I&#x27;ve tried other anti wrinkle moisturizer&#x27;s before and have sensitive skin. I could never use Oil Of Olay products, my face always had a bad reaction to them. Before trying this I was using Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle cream w/ retinol and it took me a while to get so that my face could tolerate the retinol, it had a burning effect and I had to gradually work up to using it as directed. Having said that, I was able to use this straight out of the jar without any problems or sensitivity to my skin. I used it as directed in the am &amp; pm. Under my makeup I did feel like it made my face look shiny and definitely had to use my loose powder, which I use anyway so it didn&#x27;t really create any extra steps. The one thing I did notice however that when used under my makeup in the am it made my mascara run so I would suggest it more so at night or during the day if you don&#x27;t wear makeup or don&#x27;t put to close around the eye area which kind of defeats the purpose about minimizing fine lines. I also noticed several days when I had it on under my makeup that my eyes sometimes started tearing and felt as if they were burning. I&#x27;m guessing I got it too close to my eyes or somehow a little bit worked its way in and if felt as if I got soap in my eyes. I didn&#x27;t think I put it close enough for that to happen but nonetheless it did happen. I did feel that it made fine lines look less noticeable when wearing the hydroxatone but after washing make up off and before applying it again, I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference. Having looked at the price I definitely think there are others out there that are just as good for less than half the price. So yes it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, as far as wrinkles go it is definitely no miracle cure,(although face appeared smoother with the cream rather than without) as far as price goes you can find similar products that work just the same for much less.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long yet, but I like the results already.  A few more weeks and I will know.</li>
    <li> This Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex SPF 15 cream is so luscious and thick that my skin just drinks it in.  Living in Colorado is very drying to our skin and I truly appreciate a good night cream that can also be used during the daytime as well.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like my pores are clogged - just well loved.  There is little to no fragrance, just a lovely clean smell.  The price tag of $40 plus shouldn&#x27;t scare you away because it really is worth every bit.</li>
    <li> Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex SPF 15 is the best cream for your face you can get. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years now and people can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m as old as I am. If your smart you will use Hydroxatone AM/PM Anti-Wrinkle Complex SPF 15 starting now!!</li>
    <li> I have always used Hydroxitone for several years.  I love the way it feels and it removes the appearance of wrinkles--although I am 77 years old so I need to put it on again later in the day if I&lt;br /&gt; am going someplace so I actually use it 3 times a day,  I always try to buy it through Amazon as I can get it cheaper but sometimes I worry if the cheaper Hydroxitone has the same ingredients as the more expensive kind you buy in department stores?  I read different ingredients on each jar I get so that worries me-- although it works very well and I have been told I do not look 77.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for way more money at Ulta and wanted to warn everyone that it is a complete waste of money. Buying products at your dermatologist for same price is better.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my arms and legs.  I have porokeratosis which is spots that look brown to red and are scaley.  I look like I have sores when they are really bad.  No cure according to the dermatologist.  It is from sun damage and just looks bad.  I used this product on them and they faded significantly.  They are not gone but I can wear a dress now and not get asked over and over what is wrong with your legs!</li>
    <li> Not for the eye area. Every time I put it on, it would seep into my eyes and sting. Seems ok otherwise. Better for other areas.</li>
    <li> . . . After using this for a short time, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it works or not, but I was eager to try this product.  I&#x27;d seen it advertised on TV and it sounds good.  It is light and nongreasy - I like it for those attributes.  Whether or not it will improve my skin probably won&#x27;t be known for a time, but I&#x27;m willing to give it a try.  It does have an SPF of 15 and that&#x27;s always good.</li>
    <li> Like lots of 40ish women I am a bit of a face cream junky.  I have used a lot of different creams that promise to do everything but clean my kitchen.  And we all know that almost none of them live up to their promises.  When I tried Hydroxatone I was already a consistent user of moisturizers and AHA&#x27;s.  The jar is almost comically small and when you open it, the amount of cream is smaller still.  The smell was not over powering.  The cream did feel a little sticky on my skin but that feeling passed.  Hydroxatone did not improve my skin.  I did not notice improvements in wrinkles, tone, or coloration.  However, I also did not notice my skin getting worse.  This means that Hydroxatone worked as well as my current regimen of creams and AHA serum.  So it&#x27;s not a bad face cream.  My previous regime was cheaper so I will stick to that.</li>
    <li> I have continued to use Hydroxatone AM/PM it took a while before I saw results. I&#x27;m on my second jar its light and doesn&#x27;t feel oily, absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. This is what she says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream and I love the blue luxurious jar it comes in. I have dry and sensitive skin, my share of wrinkles ( I am 60 ) and I love the sun. I have been applying this cream to my face and neck in the morning and in the evening. It is a very smooth and light cream with a pleasant, delicate fresh scent. It is very quickly absorbed by the skin without leaving a greasy, shiny skin. I can immediately apply my powder to my face, or use nothing else. It provides moderate sun protection with an SPF 15, which is sufficient for me. I feel like I have several products in one - a day and night cream, sun protection and a cream fighting my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: after 2 weeks of am/pm applications, my skin feels soft and delicate and I already see less wrinkles on my face. I am a fan of this cream!</li>
    <li> The beauty of aging is that as your body starts to fall apart, everything hurts, your skin sags, gets brown spots and wrinkles, it&#x27;s harder to lose weight, etc, your vision also starts to go so you can&#x27;t see any of this happening.  You know why you don&#x27;t have to pluck your eyebrows anymore?  Because you can&#x27;t see that you need to.  #winning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fortunate (can&#x27;t see) that I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles (probably do, but I can&#x27;t see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But enough about me, how about the cream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like the cream.  I work from home so I hardly ever wear makeup.  I put the cream on after showering, and even if I don&#x27;t wash my face for a day or so, it still feels really good.  I feel like the cream really holds the moisture on my face, which I need because (naturally, I&#x27;m old) my skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the $64,000 question - Does it help with wrinkles?  I have NO idea.  1.  I don&#x27;t have that many (can&#x27;t see them) 2.  Even if I could see them I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell if they were reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely feels better than an $8.00 moisturizer from drug store.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now ... where are my glasses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  A month later ... I really like this cream, it feels great and it keeps my skin moisturized.  Unfortunately, I think it&#x27;s clogging my pores.  I have a larger than normal number of milia on my face since I started using this.</li>
    <li> great price for this product online.  My friends have raved about how good my face looks! 61 and going strong.</li>
    <li> This cream is so thick you can barely get it on your finger to apply it to your face.  It is very hard to spread over the skin.  I don&#x27;t like to pulla and tug on my facial skin.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for sometime.  I believe it works for me!!  The price was affordable and delivery was quick</li>
    <li> I returned the product as per the instructions received with the &amp;#34;trial shipment&amp;#34; and well within the time frames.  In addition, I contacted the company via phone a day later and advised them of the return and to make sure that they did not send any more to my home.  The agent on the phone informed me that I should have called to ask for a return authorization.  I informed him that those instructions were not included in the information that I received.  He said he would annotate our conversation and would make sure no more future shipments were made, but still insisted that I should have known to call first before returning the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I found a charge of $69.95 on my checking account statement. I contacted the customer service department for Hydroxatone, and the agent indicated that the charge was made because I did not contact them for authorization before returning the merchandise.  I advised her that I followed the instructions exactly as provided in the information that I received.  She also admitted that even though she knew the requirement to call in advance was not there, it would have helped with their administrative processes.  When I pressed her on the issue, she relented and processed a refund of the charge.  I received a confirmation email within about 10 minutes from the end of the phone call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I not have been as assertive as I was with the agent, I believe that no action would have been taken - and I would be out $70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - don&#x27;t let them bully you into not providing a refund.  Stand your ground!!!</li>
    <li> I have chronic insomnia and as such often have bags under my eyes and have mild crows feet around my eyes. As such, it makes me look a bit older. However, this does help take away some of the darkness under my eyes and makes the skin look smoother. But do not expect this to be a miracle worker that will take away the effects of aging. Honestly, you could probably find a coco butter based lotion, preferably one lacking alcohols in it (many lotions do), and get the same results and save money.</li>
    <li> So I, too, bought into the television hype. I used a jar and a half-and honestly feel it made my skin worse! My pores seemed larger, my skin less...even. The faint lines at the corner of my eyes actually seemed accentuated by this really heavy cream. Switched to Derma e &amp; only one week had me wishing I had the money I spent on Hydroxatone to spend on Derma e&#x27;s products!!!</li>
    <li> This is a heavier-looking cream moisturizer than the liquid type I&#x27;m used to, so I was concerned about clumping and residue if I wore it under foundation or blush. However, the cream is light weight enough to blend in perfectly on the skin while providing thorough hydration. This is great for winter use, when one wants a more effective day cream. It is also useful as a night cream, though I prefer to use the night cream in this product line. A very effective product, feels good going on and hydrates all day, does not interfere with makeup use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this moisturizer that much, works ok, but the smell was a little off for me and I didn&#x27;t see the miraculous results the ad proclaimed.  I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my wrinkles eaither, but then, it will take more than a miracle to overcome the ravages of aging!! Can&#x27;t blame the product for that. Its an ok moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I jumped at the chance to try Hydroxatone, without dealing with the parent company since I heard a lot of consumer reports on the free trial offer.  All in all, the product is greasy for those who have oily and combination skin. I used a tiny bit to get better less greasy results, but tiny bit will not help make this a sunscreen, and it does not even have and UVA sunscreen ingredients so it really isn&#x27;t much of a sunscreen.  This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> It has given me a much clearer and more comfortable skin. Still waiting for wrinkles to disappear but ever hopeful</li>
    <li> This cream is an absolute dream, goes in smoothly not greasy at all highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product as it is very hydrating, great at smoothing the skin plus sunscreen and am/pm. Takes care of a lot of issues at once. Much like a bb cream. :-)</li>
    <li> I did not like the texture of product  it sat on skin  ended up with a rash  would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using this cream for over a year and am very happy! It has significantly reduced the wrinkles on my face. I get compliments all the time about how young I look! Will never be without it!</li>
    <li> I am 59 and sold a state of the art upscale skin care line for yrs. I was a premier user of Hydroxatone and paid $40 for a jar. Use sparingly.  One jar lasted four months After six months my crows feet diminished. A year they were gone as were the sun spots from years of swimming. I have extremely dry skin and thin under the eyes.  I used the am/ pm and eye cream - my dark circles were gone. My skin was soft and stayed that way till morning.&lt;br /&gt;They sent me many complimentary  products over the years and I loved them all. Amazon probably has them as well.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop buying it when they started selling in expensive New York stores. The price went to $80. I&#x27;m very happy to see the price Amazon is offering a great price and will order again.</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled, this is a scam. I purchased this using my prepaid card and because I work at a financial institution I knew better than to give them my acct numbers associated directly with my acct. I attempted to use a prepaid debit card and they first advised the couldn&#x27;t take it so I told them I didn&#x27;t want the product. The next day I received a call from the supposed ordering company saying they can use my prepaid card. I told them I would call back and they called me back. That was my red flag then! I cancelled the order and sent everything back emptied the jars as they said I could and then they sent me a bill for 139.00 saying they didn&#x27;t receive the jars a back and I advised that if not they gave me the wrong labels with the wrong address. Then a representative named Maco said he could cancel my order and I can disregard the bill. He said I would get an emailed confirmation with my cancellation # and I never received it so I called back. Low and behold Maco answers the phone again at 1800-538-5712 and I told him I didn&#x27;t get my email. He automatically gives me what he says is my cancellation # without verifying me at all to know who I was calling in. I called the # above two days later and the number is disconnected. The number from the website under contact tab 1800-672-2259 also disconnected. The number 877# a representative said they were the ordering company only and referred me back to the 1800-672-2259 which does not work at this time. SCAM SCAM SCAM BUYER BEWARE!!!&amp;#34; C.T. Montgomery, AL</li>
    <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t receive the exact product ordered which should have been Hydroxatone AM/PM (creamy &amp; lightly scented). Instead I received Hydroxatone Intensive which is more a gel &amp; not so pleasantly scented. In fact it smells like its been sitting in heat, turning chemicals rancid. Its not horrible but its definitely not what I needed, wanted, or ordered. Amazon however, was terrific &amp; took great care to resolve the issue.</li>
    <li> This product does not work,  nor can it.  Listed as active ingredients,  are sunscreens which are also available in drug store moisturizers.  Furthermore,  it contains harsh unlisted ingredients too. I used it once and broke out into a rash that looked like a burn. It took two weeks to heal,  and still not completely.  I still have scabs down either side of my nose.  I made sure I used nothing else while I tried this gimmicky product.  What&#x27;s worse,  when I called customer service,  the young man who answered the phone,  named Craig,  was rude right from the start.  You could tell he hated his job. I asked him to speak up so I could hear him and he blamed my phone for that,  refused to speak up.  Then he went on to question me as to why I didn&#x27;t call as soon as the reaction happened. Then he said he was sorry I took him the wrong way. When I asked to speak to someone else perhaps a supervisor he said he was the only supervisor available.  Sometimes people have reactions to perfectly good products. But I can tell the quality of a product is poor from this interaction.</li>
    <li> After paying $1.99 for a trial and cancelling within the 10 days of receiving the order my account was charged with $ 79.97 twice. I asked my bank to block further payments and opened a dispute in regards of the withdrawels.&lt;br /&gt;The bank needed to change my credit card details to avoid further theft out of my account.The cancellation on their advices phone number did not seem to count since I had not asked for a return authoritycode number ( which was not explained to me in anyway) nor had returned their product even if the har would be empty. This was news to me. It is not written on their invoicing or terms and conditions. I&#x27;m still in dispute through my bank. Not happy, will not be able to recommend this product due to its aggressive sales methods and deceipt full bank withdrawls.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on basic Hydroxatone skin care.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2 years as part of the combination of products (Hydroxatone Intensive Youth Serum).  Excellent products.  Not cheap, but not hundreds of dollars either.  Best I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
    <li> My 92 year ol mother has used this cream for years and believe me she looks years younger.</li>
    <li> I use this cream each evening and my skin in smooth and wrinkle free at an age when I should probably be having wrinkles.</li>
    <li> As everyone else has written, there seems to be no real difference in wrinkles but the cream itself is nice.  However, as I live in Canada, it does not cost \\&quot;1.99\\&quot; to try.  It cost almost $15.00 to have this delivered!  I shud have just refused it, but was sucked in the marketing ploy that it would take 10 years off my face.  This product is way over-priced to begin with, then add on outrageous shipping costs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for quite sometime and will not use another face cream ever! My skin is very soft. It is not greasy and a little goes a long way. I love Hydroxatone products!</li>
    <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t live without it.  I ordered it each time before running out, using it flawlessly for almost 2 years.  Then the price went up and I tried Philosophy skin care.  My skin has never looked and felt so good.  And it looks younger.  My daughters friends were stunned that I am we&#x27;ll over 10 years older than most of their Moms.  I&#x27;ve always drank allot of water...still do,</li>
    <li> If you can get past the oatmeal smell (my husband says it smells like spackling paste), it works pretty well.  Clearly, it is hard to judge whether a wrinkle cream is working after a month or so but my skin is definitely softer and smoother after using it.  I use it morning and night and it does not make my foundation peel up like a lot of creams do.  It also contains SPF 15 which is great for the winter sun.</li>
    <li> Have not been using Hydroxatone very long, but I believe it&#x27;s better than Oil of Olay Regenerist. Will have a better feel for the product over time. It&#x27;s pretty expensive but I think it will work better if used continuosly.</li>
    <li> I have droopy eyelids and this makes them go away.  My skin looks firmer amd my wrinkles less noticeable.  This product works for me.</li>
    <li> Ordered it through the tv ad 6 months ago, and quite frankly I wish I never called. Shipping was over-priced, and the first time I used the product it was oily and it stung! I still tried the product nightly and called the company and they were very rude and unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I had no results, and the burn got a little worse. They made it really hard to send it back, as well as getting my money back. Complete jerks that try to fool people with their USELESS product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never order anything from this company ever!</li>
    <li> I have read some negative reviews about it and it surprises me. I personally love it! I have been buying it for years and intend to continue. Of coarse there is no miracle in just one cream but in combination with healthy life style and overall good skin care, you will see the results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but I bought from a store.  I like the product.  It has great ingredients in it.  What I didn&#x27;t like is that it didn&#x27;t come in the original box.  And when I opened it it did not have the plastic seal on it that normally comes on it.  And the lid had scratches on the top like it wasn&#x27;t new.  I wasted my money because I was too scared to use it.  I will go back to a store even if I have to pay more.</li>
    <li> Feel the tingle wen it goes on but doesn&#x27;t last long and my face doesn&#x27;t rash up like other products like this that I have used. Also my skin is definitely softer and smoother with more even colour.</li>
    <li> It is a lovely product that I have been using for about two weeks now, but I only use it on one side of my face while I use Rejenerous Oil of Olay on the other side and get the same results at half the cost.</li>
    <li> Was different from the product I had before. Really greasy. I was not happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products but keep coming back to this one. I like that it goes directly into the skin and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> As advertized this cream doesa good job moisturizing.  It leaves no residue on sheets, pillows, clothes, etc.  I have not seen any evidence of antiwrinkle-ing.  Unfortunately still have all my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I like it. it works. My skin is softer &amp; the wrinkles are going away. easy to use. and the jar is really pretty &amp; looks nice on my dressing table. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot at one time. good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Hydroxatone for a few weeks and sadly I don&#x27;t look any younger yet - in fact I look a few weeks older since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  In all seriousness, the metrosexual side of me does prompt me to use a face cream daily to at least attempt to slow down the relentless march of Father Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the number one thing I look for in a face cream is SPF protection because the sun is the key ager...this cream has SPF which is good.  Then I look for retinol-type ingredients to hopefully give me some good old fashion bio-chemical skin cell regrowth (hopefully) - from what I can tell this Hydroxatone does not have retinol but more along the lines of organic all natural type ingredients probably derived from various wives tales passed down from the ages of man.  I like face creams that don&#x27;t make my skin all greasy and oily and being a man I prefer low sheen - I found this Hydroxatone to be a bit on the oily side for my tastes and made my skin a bit too shiny.  Lastly, I like a good value price point since I use a face cream regularly - $40+ is a bit too pricey for me for a product unless it really is turning back the hands of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in consideration of above I rate this product 2 stars out of 5 in consideration of my usage needs and price/value.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Neutrogena for Men at $15 with a nice non-oily, low sheen experience.</li>
    <li> As I said in the title, your results may be better/worse than mine. This made my skin oily, oily, oily. I mean so oily (and I have dry skin) that even after putting it on at night and showering in the morning, I was able to wipe the oil off my face with a Kleenex by lunch time.  I finally stopped using it...so there&#x27;s really nothing I can say about how it would work long-term. I have used Origins products which are roughly the same price point, and I liked them better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. After 2 weeks, the fine lines on her face are diminishing. She still has that fresh in the morning look at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This is non-greasy and a little bit goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling hydrated though. As far as diminishing lines and wrinkles, I am not seeing a difference. Perhaps it needs more time - it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, creamy moisturizer that leaves a slightly greasy look at first but then seems to absorb.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft and it&#x27;s worked well on my dry spots, but I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in my wrinkles. However, I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks so maybe it would do better after longer use.</li>
    <li> This product is not really that good like the other kind.. No wonder y is cheaper than the other hydroxatone</li>
    <li> Not good enough for the price</li>
    <li> Great product. Really see a difference in fine lines and elasticity. Skin appears brighter.</li>
    <li> I did the trial, and I have seen ZERO difference.  Then I canceled the trial, and BAM they charged my bank account anyway. Dont buy this over priced worthless crap.</li>
    <li> I am 75 yrs young, this is best Anti-Wrinkle cream that I have ever used. My friends give me great compliments!!</li>
    <li> made my combination oily normal skin feel like silk. It did not clog pores or make me break out like some creams will do. I loved the feel of my skin after it so soft.</li>
    <li> I did not like the cream since it is very thick and I live in Hawaii, it made me sweat profusely and I broke out in couple huge pimples! Customer service was and still is difficult. Have yet to receive my refund but have received an email confirming. However, they have again charged my credit card for another product that I did not order. I did respond to online with a complaint. Do NOT advise doing business with this company. Hoping to settle and get out of this time consuming mess they are creating.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over 3 years, and it is wonderful, but this one came half empty and was hard. I am using it because it is the only one I have at the moment. I feel I threw my money away</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles yet since I have been moisturizing my face and neck for years and have been keeping it out of the sun. I wanted to try this though and see if there is any noticeable change in my skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I hate the smell. It is nasty. I am used to unscented products but nothing like this. Secondly, when I put it on, it is thick like paste and it just doesn&#x27;t feel good having gloop on my face. Thirdly, my skin burns after I put it on. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin per se, but this stuff stings. Even if I did like it, the price alone would turn me off. It is rather pricey for a month&#x27;s supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stick with my drug store products as it is friendlier to my budget as well as smelling a bit nicer. It is a shame since there were some hype built up to this anti-wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/9/13</li>
    <li> What a rich and nourishing cream! And the fact that it provides SPF 15 sunscreen is an added benefit. The light yellow cream is thick and verges on oily but does not leave the skin feeling oily if it is put on in a thin layer. I like it best right after washing my face and neck with warm water. Then I feel the pores slurp in the best of the cream. I am trying this in the winter when skin needs a lot more wrinkle protection but a lighter sunscreen. In the summer it could seem too heavy, I don&#x27;t know. It seems perfect for my skin right now. After trying it once a day --well, most days-- for two weeks, my face feels soft, smooth and relieved from dry areas. I can&#x27;t claim that it has removed any wrinkles as yet!&lt;br /&gt;Although it does not have a catchy and memorable name (Hydroxatone... real!y!), it is an excellent face cream and the round blue jar is attractive as well.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of Hydroxatone AM/PM anti-Wrinkle Complex - anytime a product can do double duty I&#x27;m all for it, particularly because apartment living limits the available medicine cabinet space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream did not live up to that all-in-one promise. It is a thick cream so it does feel suitable for nighttime use.  Day use, however, did not work for me.  The cream was thick enough to interfere with my foundation and my face looked greasy.  I had to dig out some pressed powder to cut out the shine which added time to my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walk about a mile or so to the train and I don&#x27;t know if it was because of the greasiness of the formula or because the sun screen is not adequate,or something in the product made my skin more sun sensitive, but on a day with strong winter sun I got a little pink in the cheeks - and I&#x27;m not that fair.  Reminded me more of tanning oil than sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment yet on the anti-wrinkle aspect of this, but it is thick enough so it might work with twice daily use.  I&#x27;ll be limiting my use to nighttime only.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be buying this for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different wrinkle creams.  This one was slightly greasy and made my skin develop a lot of little pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be fair, I&#x27;m going to try it again to make sure it was the cream that caused the pimples.  But I&#x27;m sure it was.  I don&#x27;t have oily skin and rarely get pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you are over 40, this product is a must use to erase time from your face.  You will not do without.</li>
    <li> The best cream I have tried so far! Great!</li>
    <li> Be warned Hydroxatone is running an international credit card billing scam with this product.Once they have your credit card details they will ruthlessly deduct amounts from your bank account without your permission. No amount of talking to them will help either. If you have already been caught out by their &amp;#34;Free Trail&amp;#34; Scam then your only help is to cancel your credit card immediately.You have been warned! The product itself does not work and is just sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It is the best that I have tried and service was fast.</li>
    <li> Used this product for 6 months and saw absolutely no change in my face what&#x27;s so ever. In my opinion its just not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and I&#x27;ve used this product for the last 5 years.  Never want to be without it. Everyone asks me how I get my skin to glow, and I tell them &amp;#34;Hydroxatone&amp;#34; and that I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Also helps keep blemishes under control</li>
    <li> This Is Amazing Stuff!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and have been using it for sometime now with great results.</li>
</ol>
