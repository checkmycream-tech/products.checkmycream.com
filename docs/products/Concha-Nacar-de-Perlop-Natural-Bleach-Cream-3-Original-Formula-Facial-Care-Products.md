      <li>For $5, I can almost guarantee you&#x27;ll love</li>
      <li>Be sure to moisturize your skin while it&#x27;s still moist after using this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is NOT THE CREAM! I&#x27;m 45, white, female…. Its not the cream so its mislabeled - but it does works great as a face mask. It gets rid of blemishes instantly after one application and it works great on my age spots. If I get hives, pimple, anything, I can use this and in one application (I just leave it on apx 10-30 mins depending) and it make smy skin smoother, age spots lighten a lot and I get very clear soft complexion!</li>
    <li> I received 2 containers and both were dried out.  I had never purchased it before so I had not idea it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be this way until I asked someone who was familiar with it.  Needless to say I am very disappointed with the quality.  Not sure if the seller is selling very old outdated products??</li>
    <li> This is a harsh scrub that I don&#x27;t think anyone should use on their face. I returned it. It&#x27;s described as a cream as if its something you can put on and leave on as a moisturizer, however it&#x27;s just a scrub you use then wash off. How is that going to lighten your skin? Maybe because you&#x27;d scrape 3 layers off with ground up shells??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it four times now, and each time I felt that it did a great job of exfoliating my skin and made my skin feel as though it is being healed. Hard to tell if it is clearing up my skin at this point, but I trust that it&#x27;s doing something positive. As for a comparison to pure bentonite clay, the sensation on my face from this product pales in comparison to the intensity that comes from the pure clay. I think this product could use more green stuff. Otherwise it is great for the price!</li>
    <li> I used this to help fade my acne scars. With the first two uses I noticed a difference. I didn&#x27;t expect it to help so much on my acne. I am glad because I barely have breakouts now, and I know it has to be because of this. I do cleanse my face with neutrogena cream cleanser also. I use this mask at night and leave it on for 60 minutes then rinse off. The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because I may have used it about only 7 times(maybe once and sometimes twice a week) and I&#x27;m already out. It could be that I&#x27;m putting too much on my face I don&#x27;t know. I just put it on to the point it is opaque where you can&#x27;t see my skin. I do notice a difference in my pores also, seems to have shrunk a bit but it could just be me thinking it has.</li>
    <li> This bleaching cream works well, and it has a good price. It leaves some residue on the skin after cleaning up unless you use a facewash. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation this far. Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products, but I really like the price and results. I have brown spots from sun and acne and found that this lightens them without irritating my skin. I&#x27;ve tried other lightening creams and they just make me break out all over again. I usually just use it as a spot treatment though. This has worked for me and I have pretty acne prone/sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this for a few weeks. I noticed no change in my skin at all for better or worse. It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell. It is rough and sticks to your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, good price.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product that has made my skin so supple, new, and blemish-free. I use it every other night. I use my clarisonic and usual acne-free face wash first. You want to start with clean skin. Then you spread a thin layer of the Concha Nacar on your face and leave it on for about an hour. Rinse it off with cool water and feel how smooth your skin is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now. I had acne scarring and discoloration with frequent breakouts prior to using this product, even with the clarisonic and various acne medications. Nothing has made my skin as clear, soft, and blemish and mark-free as this product. I strongly recommend giving it a try! Be sure to moisturize your skin while it&#x27;s still moist after using this product. It will lock in the moisture and leave you such an awesome glow!&lt;br /&gt;My skin used to be both shiny and oily, with other parts flaky and dry. This product has made my skin dewy and uniform. I can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is cheap and its all natural.  I am not sure about its efficiency yet since I&#x27;ve only used it once.  It is a of a thick and chunky texture.  And you paste it on your face like you would a thick clay mask.  But I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry out like a clay mask would.  I had it on for almost an hour and I was able to laugh and do other facial expressions as the mask was very soft and comfortable.  I bought it mainly for the purpose of whitening/brightening my skin.  But I don&#x27;t see a difference after just one time use, maybe it would start whitening my skin if I use it consistently.  Overall, since its ingredients are natural and not chemically harsh, I would recommend trying it just for the cheap price alone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really a cream, you put it on (30 mins+ as the product label suggests) and then you wash it off. It smells kinda bad, like bleach...I used it for a few days but it got to be too much work because washing it off took forever. Since I didn&#x27;t use it long enough, it&#x27;s hard to say how well it works on clearing up dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed that it says &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; on the website even though it&#x27;s more of a cleanser.</li>
    <li> Helped clear away scarring. I would recommend giving it a try for the price.</li>
    <li> I have light sunspots in my hand, was looking for something that could help, it has helped would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I instantly noticed a difference in the darkness of some of my red marks after using it just once. I will say this, the smell can be off putting. When I use it, I splash my face with warm water, sparingly pat to a moist state, then I mix it with my finger and spot apply. Anywhere that I have an oncoming breakout or an active pimple, it will sometimes itch for the first few minutes, but after it&#x27;s fine. Also, this stuff doesn&#x27;t try, so it&#x27;s not a product you can just rub all over your face then fall asleep with, some may be tempted since you need to leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour, I&#x27;ve left it on for 3 hours before and with no weird side effects.</li>
    <li> You have to apply the cream for 30 min and then rinse :/&lt;br /&gt;Was expecting to apply something and leave it not rinse after use</li>
    <li> ok but not the &amp;quot;cure all&amp;quot;</li>
    <li> This bleaching cream is great cleaning impurities from your skin/face.  However my sun spots have not even lightened up.  They are still as they were when I first started using it so I&#x27;m a bit dissapointed in the product.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this product and have been using it three times a week. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough either. I&#x27;m continuing to use it and give it some time</li>
    <li> I bought it several weeks ago. There are several little black dots on my face. I tried to use it every day. However till now, I can&#x27;t see any progress...    Maybe I should try longer time...</li>
    <li> Skin is always much lighter after using this product. When my acne scars start to get a more brighter reddish tone to them I use this product and it lightens them up right away.</li>
    <li> First off, this cream is one of my treasured secret weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is a great treatment. I alternate between retinol and glycolic acid for my face and kojic acid for my body to even out my skin, treat minor blemishes and maintain my skin tone. I have a very high contrast look with dark hair so I fuss over the tiniest spots (I have very fair skin...think Dita von Teese fair). Both acids are very strong and the retinol can cause temporary red spots if applied to wrong areas of my face. That said, this cream is by far the most gentle of any exfoliation/lightening/evening/whitening method I&#x27;ve used. I love that I can read all the ingredient names!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is so gentle, it does take a while to achieve the desired effect. This cream&#x27;s main focus in on healing and subsequent maintenance of clear skin, so I would say about 3 weeks of consistent use and you will start noticing a difference. I use this mask daily after cleansing and stepping out of the shower at night. It does not take much to cover your whole face. I also mix pure pearl powder from my local Chinese herb store to enhance the process. It says to leave it on for up to an hour, but I&#x27;ve been known to stay on an hour and a half, sometimes 2 hours! The gentleness of this cream allows me to also use a light retinol after washing it off without adverse effects. Remember, since it does lighten the skin, the effects can only be preserved with the daily use of sunscreen during the day. With daily use and sunscreen, I noticed an exceptional difference at the 2.5 week mark. I haven&#x27;t had one of those tiny persistent stress spots in the 4 months I&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people that are having breakouts, I agree with another reviewer that mentioned the initial skin purge. Some people&#x27;s skin does that with almost all products. I&#x27;ve also heard of reactions to Irish moss as well as zinc oxide, especially since zinc oxide is the star in many mineral-based sunscreens. I recommend testing a patch of skin, about the size of your fingernail, for a week and observe the reaction. With this cream, slow and steady is the name of the game.d testing a patch of skin, about the size of your fingernail, for a week and observe the reaction.

    <li> I have NEVER felt my skin so soft! The changes in color and condition were amazing and noticeable after first treatment.  I will continue buying this product!! I love it, I used it for the first time one morning and that evening my husband and I were attending a gala, he kept telling me: you glow!!   Truth is that all black heads in your face become bleached, so your sking looks a lot younger, plus days after, you notice breakouts become fewer! Great product!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this product was referred by a dermatologist.  It really works.  It is not immediate but over time it is fading my huge scar from a weed eater on the inside of my ankle.</li>
    <li> Ya it does work it really good it cleans good the treatment takes two months or four months its good.</li>
    <li> Skin looks great.  It does work.  MR.</li>
    <li> I got this from the reviews, claiming its magic.  Neither the reviews or descriptions say its  a mask not a cream.  This isnt like other lighters, its a thick paste, it must be worn for 30 minutes, 3 times weekly.  Who&#x27;s got time for that?  I dont know if the one I got had separated or what, but it left what looks like little pieces of tissue all over the skin, and they fall off everywhere.  I search for bikini area lightener, you cant put this on bikini area not because its irritating or anything because you cant sit down. walk, or do anything but stand for 30 + minutes 3 times weekly and nothing can touch it because it will rub off onto towels.</li>
    <li> Everything I Expected From The Product!</li>
    <li> The first thing that I would like to say about this product, and any other skin product out there, is that nothing is ever going to be a fantastically fast worker. In truth no matter what you are using, if it promises you results in 5 minutes or 5 hours, it is wrong. It will always take 4 weeks for your skin to be be effectivly influenced by anything you are putting on it, it is proven by medical science. 4 weeks. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are some people who see results in a couple days, however these people don&#x27;t realize that the results they are seeing are effecting what is right below the first two layers of skin. Also, you may see results within two weeks, but not a huge diffrence that most people are looking for. For most people, myself included, our problems lay deeper. Think of your skin as an onion, yes like shrek, you too have layers. The product has to go through multiple levels of skin and this does not happen over night. So you could speed this up by using something that draws impurities closer to the surface, such as Aztec Secret: Indian healing clay, otherwise you must be patient.  Now, for this product, I must say that I love it. I don&#x27;t use it for acne, I use it for the dark marks left behind. I&#x27;ve been using it for three-four weeks now and have seen very nice results. I mix it with a clean make-up brush specifically for this product, a 1$ ELF foundation brush, and apply it to the areas of my skin that need work. It has a fine gritty feel to it and an interesting smell, not harsh or bad, that I enjoy. I tend to leave it on for an hour when I wear it. I say &#x27; when I wear it,&#x27; because in the beginning I used it Every Night for two weeks straight, though I see other reviewers say they only apply it 2 days a week. However, now a days I apply it when I remember to, which is usually three or four times a week. I put it on after I use The Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, which I tend to use every other night, and am surprised that my delicate skin never has an issue with it. That is a great sign.  I then take it off with a washcloth and cold water, using soft strokes. This stuff does not dry onto your skin, which I was surprised at, but there are some little &#x27;white out-like&#x27; chunks that fall off after a while. This means you don&#x27;t have to scrub your skin to get the stuff off which would only mean more redness. Always use cold water as well, to elliminate any redness that hot water leaves behind, and make sure to rinse your washcloth right after to avoid staining. I would not say this is a bleach exactly, as I have gotten it on my eyebrows and they are as brown as ever, but it does leave white spots on your wash clothes.  Afterwards, when my skin is dry, I tend to take pictures of the problem areas. I can tell you without a doubt that when I review the recent pictures with the ones taken when I first started, there is indeed a diffrence. Nothing hugely dramatic yet, as I just reached the fourth week mark, but the red spots have started to blend into my skin better and the newer acne spots have dissappeared almost entirely. My problem areas are my forehead and my right cheek, and I have noticed that I have to apply far less makeup then ever to cover those marks, which usually stand out against my pale skin. So yes, this product will help you, but if you don&#x27;t see results in the first three days like some of these reviewers surprisingly do, don&#x27;t fear. Remember that it takes two weeks for you to build a habit, and four for your skin to build one.</li>
    <li> This cream works,gritty,thick,looks like oatmeal,dosent smell bad to me I applied this because over the summer my face got alot of discoloration dark age spots ,pores looked large anyway my skin was really looking stressed out.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 washed with warm water left my face moist and applied to my face for 1/2 an hour rinsed abd my skin looked a little brighter and less stressed.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 apllied to 4 age spots 3 larger pores and discoloration on the jaw and chin and slept in it .&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 forgOt it was on made the dog scream  and rinsed .&lt;br /&gt;Well!!!!! 2 of the age spots where only half as dark WOW it really had lightned up.&lt;br /&gt;All pores had shrunk and I mean shrunk&lt;br /&gt;discoloration on jaw 70 percent gone and chin about 50 percent .&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt beleive my eyes,there is a little skin peel on the chin and my skin is lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Im 52 live at the beach swim and work outside and have olive skin.&lt;br /&gt;For the price give it a chance.</li>
    <li> I am latin and have heard of the benefits of this product for years, unfortunately it made me break out, but I have sensitive skin.  Not for everyone.</li>
    <li> The smell is irritating, I still use it once or twice a week though, it&#x27;s a good exfoliating product, it&#x27;s not a cream/moisturizer but rather a gritty mask that you leave on for 30-60 minutes. The smell is strong so I am not a huge fan of it.</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 weeks ago due to some dark spots on my face that were VERY noticeable, So a few days ago I looked in the mirror and notice that dark spots have faded away and I&#x27;m not sure if it was this product that helped or if it went away on it&#x27;s self.</li>
    <li> I love this product, 2 or 3 times a week in Spring and Summer I mix this with Nivea Soft lotion and evening cleansing, and apply with a face brush, and leave on for an hour!  Rinse, and moisturize, it leaves the skin so smooth and soft!  I do it once or twice a week in Fall and Winter!  I love the Perla Madre brand better, because you get more product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!  You only thought you had to pay top dollar for a good moisturizer!  I love this lotion for the silky feel and the wonderful clean scent.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and have never entertained the notion to change.</li>
    <li> i seldomly change my skin products since i have sensitive skin. But I was hoping to look for something to help lighten my acne scar, not too expensive and not to harsh at the same time for my skin type. After the initial use, my skin feel very smooth right after, i am not too found of the smell of the product, tho it is still acceptable. Price is very nice and it did not cause any irritation (a plus of course). I have only used twice so far, so cannot really see a huge difference if any.  I will try to update later and review it again if i see a difference on my face.</li>
    <li> This is thick and gritty but it does it&#x27;s job. I am not thrilled with the fact that you should leave it on for almost an hour for full effect as it doesn&#x27;t dry and remains greasy throughout treatment. My face is soft and glowey when I&#x27;m done. Also I have sensitive skin and Eczema and this did not irritate. I only use it once a week. I do not like the fragrance and wish it was fragrance free, but overall, A+</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand what the Amazon ad description mean by \\&quot;natural bleach\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and don&#x27;t really see a significant change in the texture of my complexion. The little dark spots are still there, didn&#x27;t decrease nor increase in size but still there where I don&#x27;t want them to be. Am just hoping that after I finished the two bottles I ordered, it&#x27;ll actually work! Then, I&#x27;ll use \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lemon juice that sells cheap in the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE dated 6/10/2014&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that the product does not work for me. After using it since April 21st, 2014, my complexion remained the same. I sincerely hope I can still return the second bottle for refund or credit. If the first bottle does not work, I don&#x27;t know how the second could.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old male, half hispanic half white.  I bought this after some shaving cream gave me some razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck.  My skin had dark spots.  Not extreme or bad, but I noticed them.  Some new Dove Men&#x27;s shaving cream combined with this product helped them to go away.  I use this product two to three times a week for about an hour at a time.  Makes my skin brighter and healthier looking.  I have acne scars from teenage acne and this has helped diminish their appearance.  Slightly.  Better than nothing though.  If you&#x27;re getting fine wrinkles and aging skin, check out Bel Essence Intensive Anti-Aging Treatment.  I use that after using this product and it helps keep my skin from feeling dry.  Because this product also makes your skin a little dry right after you wash it off.  I use a drop or two of water to help dilute this product a little bit too.  Anyway, for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> More than a review this is a question.. I wonder if this cream will work for dark circles under eye area. I don&#x27;t want to apply this all over my face. I do have clear skin but dark circles are becoming an issue . I&#x27;ve seen work wonders in other people. It removed ugly scar I had so I know it works. Just not sure if it would world for dark circles if I apply it underneath eyes . Has anyone tried it??</li>
    <li> I have always used the Obaji line, which is quite expensive, and I have seen better results in a few weeks with this product!! Texture is thick and not what I expected but it can be used as an exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Felt like it pulled impurities out of my skin upon first use.  I broke out.  But then, I applied again and my skin reacted much differently.  It&#x27;s thick and feel like it exfoliates great.  Can feel the oyster shells.  My skin one seems to be evening out but I&#x27;m also using a derma roller and hyauloronic acid and collagen…hard to tell which is doing what but the combo is working for me!</li>
    <li> I just got it and I guess i should have paid attention to the details. This item should be put on to the face and left on for about 30-60 mins 2-3 times pre week.  it smells good and it has small pieces of sea shell in it, i guess you could scrub your face with it but its very think when you put it on and coud be very annoying having to wear it for 30 mins at a time. But I will give it a try and come back with another review when the jar is empty.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results.  I also don&#x27;t like how this feels. Feels like I&#x27;m applying a gritty mud to my face.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product especially if you use it consistently (1 hr/day). It really evens out your skin complexion with natural ingredients. I have olive skin that shows sun spots really easily. I get so many compliments since I started using this product. I used to get peels but not anymore. If you are consistent and disciplined this will work as well. Results show easily. I have experienced one or two break outs, especially when I don&#x27;t use it consistently. But if I am constantly using it it works really well. It also lasts a long time, I&#x27;ve had my 2 ounce container for 3-4 years now. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Love that this is a multi-tasker! This lightens acne scars, evens out my skin tone, and acts also as an exfolilator. My skin feels so good after each use.</li>
    <li> After 1 year of use, I didn&#x27;t notice a change in skin</li>
    <li> Love how my skin looks WOW must have check it out. It works my skin feels and looks soft. Amazing, bought another one I am so happy with the results.  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Saw an amazing improvement in just the first use. Also applied it to a sunburn on my upper chest and didn&#x27;t have any mal-effects and took care of the sunburn immediately. Didn&#x27;t have any tenderness or anything. Freaking great product!</li>
    <li> I feel the clean, and i do see changes, but it takes time, i like it</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was about 13, having found it forgotten in the back of my mother&#x27;s bathroom drawer. Unlike my mother, I have an olive complexion that tans easily but also scars (with a darker mark) easily. This means a breakout could lead to brown freckle like dots on my face after they heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution to this was to dip the end of a toothpick into the cream and apply it onto the area after cleansing, being careful to be exact. This cream always lightened the spots and if caught early enough, prevented them. I have this cream to thank for keeping my complexion even through my teen years and into adulthood. It&#x27;s my not so secret weapon.</li>
    <li> My face seems clearer and it really does whiten your skin but not drastic white. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> ive use just about everything to try and diminish the apperance of my dark acne scars and nothing seems to work. ive been using this for at least tree months now and i dont notice a difference. i should tell you though its a gritty paste substance. good exfoliator though.</li>
    <li> Product is ok, shipped as promised</li>
    <li> excelente producto llego a la fecha esperada y en buenas condiciones todo el proceso fue muy rapido y sencillo gracias</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and must say it really gives your skin  glowing look ,so getting this product is worth the price</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I purchased this with very low expectations, I have had a dark brown rough patch of skin on the top of my foot for over a year.  My dermatologist prescribed a very expensive ointment, that I religiously put on my foot twice a day, NO RESULTS.  So I then tried many different foot creams from the pharmacy, again No results.  I even scoured the internet for any and all homeopathic remedies, tried many, non worked.  Then, a friend told me to try this, I rolled my eyes, but bought a jar.....UREKA!  after just two weeks, I am seeing results, the patch of skin is noticeably smother, and the dark pigmentation is fading! WOW, I am thrilled, at this rate I suspect the skin on my foot will be back to normal by the end of two weeks.  I am a true believer!</li>
    <li> It perfectly works for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure this stuff out.  I can&#x27;t find a whole lot online, so I&#x27;m checking out the ingredient list and going from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the bottle marked #3; Bleaching Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s not a bleach.  Technically, hydroquinone is not a bleach either, it operates by shutting off excess melanin production where applied.  That said, I have been looking for non-hydroquinone alternatives to treat birth-control induced melasma.  Treat your acne, get dark spots instead.  Go figure.  Anyway:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is sticky and gritty.  I like this because I can gently exfoliate with it once or twice a week.  Perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stir the jar with a toothpick, as the directions indicate, before use.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of contaminating it with my finger.  I apply it evenly, which doesn&#x27;t take much, massaging it in, then layering it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on for the recommended 60 minutes.  I can say that my skin looks similar to after using a very mild glycolic acid; that is to say, the surface is refined.  I think this is the honey working, along with the citric acid from the lemon juice (BTW, a mask of 50/50% lemon juice and honey is fantastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product contains bentonite, which is found in my very FAVORITE clay mask, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay.  It&#x27;s also found in a very expensive pre-mixed clay mask sold at Sephora.  At any rate, it&#x27;s very very good at drawing out impurities from the pores.  The combination of bentonite, along with the citric acid from the lemon and refining properties of the honey, I believe is what makes this work as a spot-treatment as well.  I read that this mask also contains papain (papaya), a fruit enzyme.  So there&#x27;s another hydroxy acid to help refine and encourage cell-turnover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I believe this mask to consist of natural ingredients that are meant to both chemically and manually exfoliate, with honey and irish moss to sooth and keep it gentle.  It&#x27;s gentle but does the job, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a 1-2 times per week kind of mask.  I recommend cleansing with the Grisi&#x27;s Concha Nacar bar soap, steaming your face, then applying this mask while it&#x27;s still wet.  For $5, I can almost guarantee you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I read that people are having breakouts from this.  That&#x27;s because the ingredients cause more rapid cell turnover and renewal, which can cause an initial skin purge.  With regular use, it will go away, and you&#x27;ll be left with clearer skin than you had before.  That stuff was going to come out at some point anyway; this is just drawing it out quicker.I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a 1-2 times per week kind of mask.

    <li> Could not see any helpful effect even after using the product as per its instructions for 1 month+</li>
    <li> I came to start using this product through a total coincidence-- I was getting my nails done and one of the other women in the salon started talking about how her mother used to treat acne by drying out oyster shells (after removing the oyster itself) and combining the scraped-out shell bits with something else to make a paste/masque. Well I didn&#x27;t really want to invest the time/money in oysters just to do that, so I did a quick search online to see what products already had oyster shell. So glad I found this product! Even the first time I used it, my skin was noticeably healthier looking after I took the masque off. Like other reviewers I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; effect-- just an evening in tone. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s maybe more like a long-term toner masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that when I leave it on for at least an hour (the package says 1/2 to 1 hr) I see more results. It&#x27;s a little messy to use (I use a headband AND tie my hair back, and taking it off means a quick shower because that&#x27;s easier than trying to take it off with a cloth), but I really believe in this stuff. My skin looks much more even, I notice that swollen blemishes go down when I use this, etc. I started out using it every day but went down to 1-2 times a week because my skin was getting dried out (to be fair, I&#x27;m not 100% sure it was from this), which is actually what they advise. This product is a real treasure-- a great secret find!</li>
    <li> I thought it was a cream, not something you have to leave on and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;BUT. I like it very much</li>
    <li> The oyster shells that have been refined in this product work very well on skin. I highly recommend this product because it is all natural and effective.</li>
    <li> i was expecting something else</li>
    <li> been using this product for over 7 years its my secret weapon in fighting discoloration, and acne marks it evens and beautifies my skin tone</li>
    <li> I was doing some research and came across Concha Nacar Bleach Cream #3. Before trying it I wanted to get all the information I can about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years my face have become sensitive and quick to irritate especially from any kind of heat so I started using only natural food and products for sensitive skin. After researching Concha Nacar  I saw that all the ingredients it has I use or have used before but had to give it a second thought because of the lemon juice and papain ingredients, I didn&#x27;t want the citrus to irritate my skin. After thinking hard about it I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s gentle and can be use daily. I usually apply it only on my blemished areas before cleansing my face because I don&#x27;t like how the product stay on after rinsing off with cold water as directed. To make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated I would massage as small bit of grapeseed oil on my face before applying the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I allow the cream to sit for about 45 minutes on my face and the remainder 15 minutes I let the steam from the shower open my pores to get a good deep cleansing from the bentonite clay. Then I cleanse with oatmeal, honey and cinnamon. After I&#x27;m done my face feel very smooth and soft. I have noticed some of my blemishes and acne scars are getting lighter. Even though I just started using Concha Nacar Bleach Cream I would recommend this product if your looking for gentle and natural.</li>
    <li> what I find excellent about this product is how it eviscerates acne, even the nasty cystic ones that occasionally show up. Also feels good and has 100% natural ingredients which is hyper important to me. As well as awesome price. Only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it seems to have done nothing for skin spots/discolouration, which is what it is marketed for</li>
    <li> I have had Blackheads for 40 years---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried tons of stuff--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product and St. Ives Apricot Scrub really helped--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not total elimination but great improvement--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steady customer both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Daily and it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I need to start by saying that my skin is not sensitive, and I have oily-acne prone skin. I just came out of a horrible breakout (severe acne all over my face) due to the use of another product. My acne was getting better, but I started to see little ice pick scars all over my face, plus tons of hyperpigmentation. I decided to give this mask a try since I always watch infomercials of the benefits of concha de nacar when I was little and lived in South America. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such great results. The first time I put it on I did experience some tingly sensation, but nothing too uncomfortable, after I took it off my skin felt soft and fresh, and I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference after the first use, but after a week of using this product twice a week, I could really see a change. All my hyperpigmentation is lighter, I don&#x27;t have to use tons of make up to hide it anymore, the little holes on my face are not as bad as before, but they&#x27;re still there, I guess they took longer to repair. I&#x27;m using this mask every other day at night now and I see results the following morning after I use it, it&#x27;s awesome and really easy to use cause one thing i hate about face masks is how hard it is to wash them off, but this one is not. I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> I did not see any change after one month this is not is a good product. Really I don&#x27;t like it. This is nota bleaching cream.any one is expecting some color change please don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Idk what this product really do so far nothing</li>
    <li> Great for acne prone skin. My skin is drier now and so that is why only 3 stars. Watch out for mineral oil though in products. This is a fairly natural product and for me clays are a bit drying. That said it leave a nice feeling of exfoliated skin, not sure about the whitening, but I will keep using it. If the whitening occurs then I will reorder again. I do wish I knew about this product when I had acne. It is very superior having acne care in this, yet it is not truly overly drying. Well done on this. I would try other products by this maker, but I noted mineral oil as the first ingredient on a cream and mineral oil can block pores, enlarge then and cause acne.</li>
    <li> not sure ........ didnt notice any difference</li>
    <li> When I was 23, i had alot of acne scars. This mexican guy told me to sleep with this on everynight for a week or two. Well it worked!  Now I dont usee it anymore because too much use on oily skin will cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light weight cream that would help with some acne spots I have, something that would be of a lotion consistency and rub in easily so I can get on with other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT that, it is heavy and more like a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; with it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real oyster shells&amp;#34; that seem to be ground up to a fine consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, although it is not what I was looking for, I do like it!  It is like a scrub that leaves your skin brighter and smoother.  I also like the super clean scent it leaves behind.  You get an immediate brighter/cleaner appearance on the area, I haven&#x27;t used it enough to speak on long term results because it is a time consuming process.  The directions say leave it on for 30-60 minutes, I leave it on for 30 minutes as I am too much of a busy body to stay still that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars for it&#x27;s scrubbing brightening effect.</li>
    <li> This product is not a cream, but a facemask. It&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients such as lemon juice and oyster shell. You apply it to a clean face and leave it on for 30-60 minutes and wash it off. I haven&#x27;t used it typo often due to the fact that it is a mask, but I do give it points because it is all natural (supposedly)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least 3-4 times a week for the pass few weeks and I&#x27;ve seen little to no change. I think I should invest more money and get a stronger product.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin super soft and smells great. I recommend this product but I&#x27;ve read you have to be careful because it has bleach on it so if you are planning on buying it start slowly.</li>
    <li> Not really working for so far. I do plan to continue using it, hopefully I see a change.</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s gritty like a exfoliating scrub. I was expectinga cream. I wish they produced this as a lotion I love the fact that it has natural iingredients. But overall I did see a difference in the brightness of my face after using this a couple of times.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice bleach cream to fade sport scars or scars in general. It&#x27;s quite thick in texture; the smell is somewhat strong, &amp; should be used only a tiny bit on the spot that needs it.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Didnt really do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t fully understand this product. It says it&#x27;s a bleach cream, but it&#x27;s more of a scrub/face mask/???? And you have to leave it on for like an hour for it to work, which, for the most part, it doesn&#x27;t. 2 stars because it&#x27;s a decent face scrub.</li>
    <li> I wish I did I before and after picture...I&#x27;ll keep that in mind whenever I try out a new product. But seriously Concha cream is usually my go to stuff when my skin is going through some serious outbreaks. Pimples for me means scars so knowing I cant help but &amp;#34;relieve&amp;#34; a pimple I can only expect to heal with brown spots. With the concha cream I literally see my acne get less inflamed and my dark spots are incredibly lighter. I especially love using this mask just to have baby soft skin. Its oh so pleasurable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I have combination skin, little to no acne depending if I leave my make up on after a loong(maybe drunkin) night, I have anemia so I scar easily...&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are also explicit which I enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;Optimally drinking lots of water keeps skin clear.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvements. I have been using it at least once a week but the results are not worth mentioning. Save your time and money.</li>
    <li> I used this product many years ago and was I buying it at Walmart but, it was discontinued. I was very happy to have found it in Amazon. The best inexpensive mask facial product I&#x27;ve tried. I like it for being a natural product.</li>
    <li> i have not used this for very long but i can say it has helped with break outs have not noticed any lightning yet</li>
    <li> This is not a one time use cosmetic.  Several applications are required to start to see results, but you do see results!</li>
    <li> people have seen changes. Majority of my dark spots are gone</li>
    <li> It does take a while to get results and I mean a WHILE but it does work. Reasonable price, good quality and efficient.</li>
    <li> not exactly sure i bought two??</li>
    <li> This is simple and easy product to give skin a lift. It works very well and I recommend it for ladies who are looking to brighten skin as we go through the menopausal years.</li>
    <li> Amazing results every time. Use regularly and have amazing skin.</li>
    <li> This cream leaves my skin feeling so soft and exfoliated. It is difficult to wash off but its worth it. I bought it to help fade some acne scars but it is too soon to tell. Either way, I like it.</li>
    <li> Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras</li>
    <li> I started using this on my face, which has never looked better after using it! I read that it&#x27;s good for scars, so I tried it on a really bad raised scar on my hand. It&#x27;s already feeling less raised. On a whim, I decided to try it on my arms, and it&#x27;s getting rid of the red raised spots I had there, as well. I have sensitive skin that reacts badly to a lot of things, but this has been very gentle, and it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy like I feel with every other type of exfoliant I have used.</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this product I thought it was one of my family&#x27;s crazy miracle remedies that all Latinos seem tho believe in...and didn&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t help that its not available in Australia. So my skin went from bad to worse with medium to sever acne on both my cheeks that has left quite a bit of scarring.&lt;br /&gt;I received the cream quickly and in a nice package and it might seem lik a lie but in just ONE WEEK i was getting complimented on my skin being smooth and my scars going. It&#x27;s now been 3 weeks and most of the right side of my face has barely any scars left (just some blackheads) and my left side is still a work in process but it&#x27;s coming along very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;To anyone with scars PLEASE buy this for yourself, . It works like magic !</li>
    <li> I love this mask...it leaves your skin glowing and looks like you just had a professional chemical peel...it goes on very smoothly and i leave it on for an hour and then wash it off....it does not dry on your skin so you can wash it off easily....your skin will have a gorgeous glow after and fell smooth and fresh !!! highly recommended</li>
    <li> This cream was nice...ans soft for skin! But not so good as I was waiting for...well it&#x27;s a good bargain anyway.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely manner although it says to leave it on for at least 30 - 60 minutes. I have only been able top use it 2 times so far but am looking for the amazing results everyone else has gotten.</li>
    <li> OK product but didn&#x27;t work as well as I was lead to believe. Smaller scars my be ok</li>
    <li> This cream is one of the worst cream you can try .. Doesn&#x27;t work.. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> do not like. It did not remove the damage like the commercial said it would do. Will not recommend. Not a good product for me.</li>
    <li> After seeing an article in which celebrity makeup artist Kathy Jeung swore by this stuff, I decided to invest all of $5 in a container of this. I&#x27;m currently recovering from my first acne flare-up in years, and have been trying to counteract the damage with a bevy of masks and creams from brands like Clarins, Fresh, Kiehl&#x27;s and Philosophy. I have very dry/sensitive skin and am therefore limited in the products I am comfortable sampling. Many brands are pretty heavy-handed with chemicals, so I have to avoid most of the mainstream acne-vanquishing products. All of the products I have used in the last few weeks have been either ineffective or exacerbated my remaining blemishes. I was literally at my wit&#x27;s end, so I tried this. The first 5 min stung ever so slightly, but this eventually subsided. After an hour, I washed it off and was surprised that my skin was not raw at all - despite the initial sting. In fact, my dull, acne-ravaged skin was transformed. It glowed all night and was noticeably softer/plumper/healthy-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this once a week or so for about an hour since I purchased this and can say that it substantially reduces the darkness of my acne scar discolorations after each use. Forget Clarins Bright Plus Night Cream. Forget Clinique Even Better. And definitely forget about Mario Badescu Healing &amp; Soothing Mask. THIS WORKS.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the hope that it would help fade my freckles. I have not noticed much of a difference in the color of my freckles after using this for the past month. It is good quality and my face feels smooth and clean after I use it. The best feeling is washing it off with warm water which makes a very good exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I use the mask twice weekly in order to improve the redness and marks left behind from mild acne. Since I started using this product about four months ago, I have also noticed that my acne has cleared up more than ever before, and my skin looks great!! I use this in combination with Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay mask, another natural product.. I highly suggest this as well. The Concha Nacar mask has a pleasant light scent as well. :)</li>
    <li> I love this smell!  I have incredibly bad skin. I&#x27;m 53. Very mixed skin type. Mixture of Skandinavian, American Indian, African. I&#x27;m very light in the winter and very dark in the summer (I do not burn) If I go out in the sun, I come in with a spot no matter how much sunscreen I put on.  I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles, but sagging. I had beautiful skin when i was younger, went through menopause early and the havoc began. My skin is sensitive and I use water to pat this stuff on or it would tear my skin. With water is become very smooth.  My spots are lighter after only 1 week of use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for skin lightening. While I use it successfully in combination with Kojic acid soap and Dr. Fred Summit Skin Whitener for that purpose, and while I&#x27;m not sure how much the impact is from this product, it certainly makes your skin look and feel FABULOUS!!!! You scrub the skin with it and let it sit 20-30 min. then rinse off. It seems to absorb grease/toxins, even skin tone, smooth lines and pores, and leave skin sooooo soft. It is a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for a little dark circles from the sun.  Once you apply the cream have to wait 1/2 hour to cleaned up. I was using it 3 times a week like it says in the directions, but it wasn&#x27;t working. I began applying it everyday and the spots became lighter, but my face became dry, so I had to get a moisturizer. I liked, but it took a while to work, I guess to see results one has to purchase more than one.</li>
    <li> Works as directed , one con would be it&#x27;s course like sand and clumps form and fall everywhere but that&#x27;s the conk shell</li>
    <li> My acne scars didn&#x27;t fade at all... Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have been using Coanchar Nacar for about 20 years. It works better than anything in  the market. try it and see it foe you self&lt;br /&gt; you will love Concha Nacar porducts&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Concha Nacar</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a cream as stated in the description , and it does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> It has improved my skin apperance. No miracles, you need to be patient and discipline.&lt;br /&gt;It worth to try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for the last 2 weeks, and my skin has improved a lot. My scar are slowly getting lighter and less noticeable. But be careful if you have oily skin, i would not recommend using it every day. I noticed lil tiny pimples on my forehead. Besides that, my skin looks very fresh, moist and with less dark and acne spots. Also my pores looks smaller.</li>
    <li> does not work.  do not buy. awful smell and does nothing to the skin. I used this for 3 months and saw absolutely no results</li>
    <li> I have used this cream before and it worked well. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores anymore and all other lighteners are an overnight cream. I am happy to find it on amazon. I use this cream to lighten dark spots and even out my skin tone. I like the ingredients, it feels very natural on the skin. I recommend this for light and darker skin. It also provides a faster result than other overnight skin lighteners.</li>
    <li> Didnt cause any irritation. I put it on three nights a week before bed for about 45 minutes. For me, not a big deal. For others, might be inconvenient. Each morning after I noticed a difference in an overall more even skin tone. I have a couple brown sun spots and acne marks that Im trying to get rid of. Theyve gotten a lot lighter, it will probably take at least two more jars before theyre gone. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really works. But, I know it really does burn. Make sure you use proper moisturizers when you use it. I stop using it, because I really didn&#x27;t notice any results.</li>
    <li> OKay maybe I am just the type of person who is impatient but after about using it 3 times and following the instructions it didn&#x27;t work for me. It aggravates and creates a burning, tingling sensation on my skin. Probably made it worst for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you have the patience, try it out.</li>
