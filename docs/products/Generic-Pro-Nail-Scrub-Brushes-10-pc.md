<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use in shower to clean body crevices.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
    <li> flimsy, weak plastic handles.  Not good.  Will not buy again. Would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Very good value. It has soft bristles.</li>
    <li> Too soft, cannot clean fingernails.</li>
    <li> these ARE plastic but well made. do not regret this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> We ordered these for use in our Occupational Therapy department for our rehab residents for nail care.  The handle makes it very comfortable and easy to use even with weakness.</li>
    <li> Terrific price.  Bristles are softer than we&#x27;re used to.  Was hoping for some manly colors, but got all pale pretty pastels!</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these little brushes a few years ago, and when I got down to the last one, I panicked, because I use these for many tasks. Thankfully, they were still offered here on Amazon, and still at that almost ridiculously low price. But these are not ridiculous brushes at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid gardener, I&#x27;ve never found a better brush for getting the dirt and grime off my hands and out from under my fingernails. As a cook, I&#x27;ve never found a brush that works as well as these for cleaning vegetables. And then there a dozen or more other handy uses for these, like cleaning the grout in my antiquated tiled kitchen or scrubbing around inside the drains of my equally antiquated kitchen sinks. More simply put, these small brushes are the ultimate, best little helper around!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I HIGHLY recommend PrettyLikeMe via Amazon.com. Buy with confidence from these amazing folks. My order arrived quickly---I had not expected that level of service from anyone but Amazon themselves. Thanks, PrettyLikeMe!!!</li>
    <li> Good for the cost and purpose--you can&#x27;t beat the price for 10 brushes.  I have them for not only finger nail brushes, but for cleaning things that need something smaller.  There are multiple colors, so that too is nice to designate a name or purpose to the brush, and the handles have space to easily write the name/purpose using a permanent marker.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Super great deal! Good quality materials and Shipping was fast, they came 2 days before the estimated shipping date. A+++ will be ordering from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Awesome price and they are sturdy.  We use them for a number of uses such as suede shoes and scrubbing the soles of shoes, so getting so many for such a great price is AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Cheap price for 10(!) brushes.  Works well as a nail brush and for lots of other cleaning activities.</li>
    <li> Not the BEST quality BUT good enough for what I needed, good price and good for a girls spa Party</li>
    <li> These are softer than other fingernail brushes I&#x27;ve bought, which has its good and bad points. If you don&#x27;t need to scrub motor oil or other difficult substances from under your fingernails, these are probably fine. They&#x27;re certainly more gentle than some brushes. These would probably be very nice for GENTLY scrubbing some vegetables, or maybe for removing the silk from ears of corn. Good for anything that needs a gentler scrub. A good buy, especially given the low price!</li>
    <li> very nice for the money Everyone should keep their nails clean</li>
    <li> Ten brushes is a bit overkill. They are cheap, but they do the job. I am still trying to give some of them away. ; )</li>
    <li> Same as the salon! Good quality!</li>
    <li> Great brushes... will be buying more</li>
    <li> I would have paid twice the price and still would have felt I had gotten a good deal. cleans vegetables, toe nails, etc</li>
    <li> Soft, sturdy bristles (just right).&lt;br /&gt;Handle is unexpectedly convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Very lightweight (but not cheap).  If you try to bend them, they are flexible but strong.&lt;br /&gt;Colorful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will convert to these ergonomic brushes over the curved-handle brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes.  The brisstles are more substantial than I thought they would be.  A pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> We needed nail brushes because my kids get sand under their fingernails at the playground.  These are good enough quality and they work fine.  The ones we got are all white, the mulicolored would have been more fun, but how fun do they really need to be?  They are also useful for other things such as grout scrubbing.</li>
    <li> pretty good bristle strength, but not real tough like i wanted. but better than the really weak ones.</li>
    <li> Great little brushes  lots of uses..</li>
    <li> These are so inexpensive and useful...I love them. 10 in a pack and came early! Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> Colors are vibrant and come in a variety as pictured. The bristles stay intact and keep their shape for a reasonable amount of time. The $ store carries these at a buck a piece so the bundle is a steal. Nothing fancy but practical and efficient.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t coloured. All were white. Good packaging and arrived on time. Bristles are a bit tough compared to the more expensive that I had bought before.</li>
    <li> Work great and great price!</li>
    <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were quality brushes.Shipping was super fast, and my husband uses these for scrubbing grease from under his nails, so they have to be strong. Thankfully these work very well and we are still on our first one, no problems. Would definitely recommend, quality product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COLORS!  ONE FOR THE BATHTUB , ONE FOR EACH SINK (2 BATHROOM SINKS &amp; KITCHEN SINK), ONE FOR THE SHOWER,  the rest in ziplock waiting for one to wear out.</li>
    <li> These get the job done, but the picture shows multiple colors and I was sent 10 gray brushes. I wanted to use the colorful ones as cute gifts with other manicure supplies but probably will end up just keeping them for household jobs.</li>
    <li> These scrub brushes are a definite necessity.  They come in a variety of beautiful colours, makes it easy to remember what each one is used for.Like the handle at the end of the brush instead of on top.</li>
    <li> not at pictured -received all one color and very light weight materials.</li>
    <li> Only issue I had I did get the correct  colors...other than that it was a great product</li>
    <li> Received 10 in different colors, just as described. Firm bristles, works great.  I received them about two weeks earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Nice strong nail scrub brushes. No complaint</li>
    <li> Cant seem to make brushes that have firm enough bristles to actually stay stiff and go under your nails.</li>
    <li> All 10 brushes arrived as pictured and described. See photo. Bright colors, as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for placing at the sink and using when washing hands, to keep nails clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave some to our family members to use in their homes too. Been in use for over a month and bristles still look like new. Our granddaughter just thinks these are the neatest little things, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrived quickly and seem to be of good quality for the price. They are just plastic but at roughly 2 for a dollar, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased from seller BB SYNERGY. Hand written note included with shipment...  A simple kind touch we don&#x27;t see often enough. Smile. Buy with confidence. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Very good value.  Handle is lightweight but adequate.  Brush bristles very good texture for hand and nail cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to receive a package with a variety of colors. And although it arrived earlier than listed, I was not as excited once I opened it up. I received 6 purple brushes and 4 orange. That&#x27;s it, no pink, blue, or green. I feel as though it&#x27;s kind of false advertising, but since it lists it as a variety I guess you get what you get. The quality of the brushes seems to be fine, but not high enough to get me to raise my rating after the disappointment over the lack of variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Just as described and plenty of them.</li>
    <li> Needed scrub brushes for cheap. Got these 10 for a great price and received them the next day. They are not heavy duty but that is not what I need them for.</li>
    <li> Works well for nail brushes.</li>
    <li> Good balance between the bristles&#x27; stiffness &amp; length to get the garden dirt out of my hands.  Works well as a fingernail brush if there is not too much dirt under your nails. It likely would not work for greasy car dirt under a mechanic&#x27;s nails.  What I did not expect was how light weight are the handles. So light weight they are bendable. As a nail and hand brush this should not be a problem, but not a brush you would use to clean out grout or scrub little kid toys. Also as there were 10 in a pack I expected to have a mix of colors. No, I received 10 blue in one pack.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  Very hard to find in stores but got a bunch for a little $$!  Thanks, they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> Useful to have lots of cheap disposable brushes, but these are a little too soft to be good nail brushes.</li>
    <li> I really love that I got a whole box full of them.  I keep one at each sink where I wash my hands and one in the shower and one travels with me.  The bristles are very sturdy and work very well.  They really get that dead cuticle skin off and the nail clean.  Highly recommend.  Buy a box today.</li>
    <li> Came one day earlier than scheduled.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are fine with the exception of one brush which had one row missing. But not a big deal.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy, but seem to work fine, bristles are pretty good and stiff, only pink and blue not mixed colors.  They came in good time.</li>
    <li> Great. Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> love them ... I use the on everything.</li>
    <li> This are great: use a few times/toss-n-replace brushes.  Bristles hold up well.  Enough colors for everyone in family to have their own.</li>
    <li> The brushes came in drab white and a dirty looking beige.  Bristles are very stiff ... possibly good for pedicure.  But most of all there&#x27;s  huge (for the size of the brush) black MADE IN CHINA writing that is not a label and cannot be scraped off the handle. I sure can&#x27;t use these brushes. Even though they were under $5 and no big deal, when they&#x27;re boldly mis-advertised, I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay the shipping back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;mon Amazon!!  This is not what I expect from an ancillary Amazon supplier.</li>
    <li> using these for another item to stuff in cosmetic bags I am giving for Christmas. the bristles could be firmer but these were right for the price</li>
    <li> These are really coarse and I can&#x27;t use them as nail scrubbers. They are quite painful. However they have worked very well for scrubbing many many other things. I&#x27;ve labeled them and placed them around the house. I use one for scrubbing potatoes, and another for scrubbing dirt from the soles of shoes, another for scrubbing grout etc. But I wouldn&#x27;t actually use these on my hands. OUCH</li>
    <li> they do what they are meant to do, wish the colors were a little more assorted when they arrived I received 9 purple and 1 clear</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck, and an essential item in my home.</li>
    <li> I know they are cheap but never have I had a brush fall apart on the first use.  Scrub to hard and they fall apart or the bristles flatten.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for a friend who does nails. She was very happy for the gift because she needed to order some.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice. I use them for fading.</li>
    <li> I have these everywhere! One in the bathroom and two in the kitchen! I like that I can label one with a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; for vegetables and there are plenty of them so I can easily replace them when I need to. So far, I have found they are very durable!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes to use in my home... one at every sink (with some extras!).  They are firm enough to feel like they&#x27;re really cleaning well but not so hard they hurt your cuticles.  Only down side I have to say is several bristles fell out of the brushes when I removed them from the package but the rest seem to be staying in nicely now.  Not the highest quality brushes but definitely good for the price.  I would purchase them again... although it may be a while before I need to, I anticipate they will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Great for massaging the nails.  Small enough to have in the shower.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for!  My hair and makeup artist (from when I had my television show) first turned me on to these - they are great for *so* many things!  I keep two near my kitchen sink (one for veggies, one for other scrubbing jobs), one by my bathroom sink and one in the shower (for, you know, actually scrubbing my nails) and have given several away - everybody loves them!  A 10-pack is barely enough! :-)</li>
    <li> You cannot find these stupid little brushes anywhere at the stores.  I love them when I come in from gardening.  I had one forever and then my hubby found out how well it worked and well a new was was needed.  10 of them is soooooo great.  Good deal.  Would definitely do business again.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not one bad thing to say about these. They are an extremely good value and I love having extras put away for later. I keep one in each shower/tub for feet and one at the kitchen sink for after gardening...</li>
    <li> These types of brushes have just become so difficult to find, especially ones made with quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so many uses for these brushes. It is not funny.  The most important use, is to scrub by hands with them, after I guve them a good washing.  May I suggest, that if you have been working on your car, you use a nail file to get the dirt and great out.  It will make cleaning under your nails a whole lot easier.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also let my cat drink out of a very nice decorative fountain.  Even though I use Arrowhead water, there is still an accumulation of minerals, so I keep one brush just for keeping that clean.&lt;br /&gt;Another brush we use to clean our bird dishes out with, and well, you get the idea.  They are just awesome, and have so many purposes.  Because of the long handle, you do not have to get your hands in whatever chemical you are using, in order to clean an item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more packs, just to have them around.</li>
    <li> Great for all the grandkids.</li>
    <li> EVERYONE needs these!  I couldn&#x27;t stand seeing my own kid&#x27;s dirty finger nails, even after washing their hands.  So, I decided to order these, and my only regret....that I didn&#x27;t order these when my kids were toddlers.  Each of my kids has their own color, they continue to use them regularly, and I am happy to know that they aren&#x27;t carrying around extra germs under their nails.  These are nice quality, gentle bristles, pretty inexpensive, and come in some fun colors.  I may even consider ordering these for my students next year.  I strongly encourage regular hand washing with soap, rather than hand sanitizer, especially before lunch.  I think the kids at school would be willing to use these on a regular basis also.  I can just number their brushes and hang them in clear closet shoe pockets.</li>
    <li> They work fine for my nails.  I garden and they seem to do the job.  They are very reasonably priced, and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> These are NOT assorted. I received ALL TEN in the ugly green color.</li>
    <li> Make great vegetable cleaning brushes.</li>
    <li> In a house with lots of dirty little hands, nail brushes are important. Love the colors and pop them in the dish washer on the top shelf. Couldn&#x27;t find these locally.</li>
    <li> bought these as part of a girls spa weekend for my sisters. great contribution to a gift bag of pedicure tools. love the bright colors!</li>
    <li> All 10 pieces came in a gross olive green color!! Yuck!</li>
    <li> great for the price and quantity! wd buy again</li>
    <li> Way too small to do much of anything with. Very small compared to the picture. It reminded me of a oversized toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Exactly as the description said.  Good product.</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE GREAT NAIL BRUSHES, WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Great durable nail brushes.  Great colors and wonderful price for the number I received. I used them for stocking stuffers this year. I will be stocked for a long time.</li>
    <li> Some were damaged from shipping, but it came with so many that it didn&#x27;t bother me, I have more than enough for what I needed them for</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THINKING THET WERE DIFFERNT COLORS THEY CAME IN CREAM ONLY , BRISTOLS WERE VERY HARD STILL WORKING WITH THEM</li>
    <li> They are okay nail brushes. I was dissapointed they didn&#x27;t come in different colors as shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> I got a bag labled brushes but full of wooden popcicle sticks.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product but somewhat disappointed because I thought I would get multiple colors. Mine are all yellow. :(</li>
    <li> Came fast, cheap price, great quality.</li>
    <li> Perfection came on time Abe was exactly what I needed&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Not much to say about nail brushes, they do what I need them to do and clean nails or dirty little hands.</li>
    <li> Not as stiff as I wanted. The bristles are too soft for me.</li>
    <li> These are so cute. I think for the price it&#x27;s perfect. I got these for a ladies night favor bag and they came four days before delivery date. They are decent quality which I am surprised about because of the price. You get random colors.</li>
    <li> Great quality nail brushes, just like at the nail salon!  I love treating myself and guests to these; they just give you a little luxury at home and you feel a little more pampered.  I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> Great - hard to find item. Very good price!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes work well.  I store throughout my home.  good for hand-washing, and cleaning items that require a soft brush.</li>
    <li> These make better hair brushes than nail brushes.  The bristles are way too stiff and make it an uncomfortable experience.  I could find a lot of uses for these brushes... Cleaning my toilet, sink, floor, pots and pans, but not fingernails.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the amount that you receive.</li>
    <li> A must have for nail/salon time</li>
    <li> No problems with the order or the shipment. The pack of brushes arrived on time and are doing a very good job. These brushes are well worth the small cost and would be a good value at twice the cost. When I need more scrubers, I will order these again.</li>
    <li> These nail brushes came sooner than expected, their plastic-like see through look makes them look more cute</li>
    <li> Product is as pictured and described.  Brushes do their job.  However, the bristles seem a little cheap and that each brush will not last many hand washes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll probably order more of these when I run out. I bought 5 packs and they are a really good deal. I give them away in new client gift bags so my clients can maintain good nail hygiene at home.</li>
    <li> The price on these 10 brushes makes it great. The bristles are&lt;br /&gt;a bit soft, but that allows one to vigorously clean their entire hands.</li>
    <li> These brushes are totally useless. I purchased them to clean under fingernails. They&#x27;re not stiff enough to be effective.</li>
    <li> What a great nail brush set. The bristles are strong, the multi-color pack is what I got and very please. Very sturdy handle, easy to manipulate can&#x27;t ask for a better nail brush.</li>
    <li> rougher than usual, but great price for value</li>
