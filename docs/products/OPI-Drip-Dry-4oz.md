    <li> A polish drier than really works.  OPI does not disappoint.  This is the big refill size, so you need to buy a small bottle, get a *small* funnel and refill as necessary.  This size does not have the necessary dropper.  The stuff is more economical with this huge refill.  If you can&#x27;t find a mini funnel, use the dropper to refill your smaller bottle - you can&#x27;t pour if right out of this bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s pricey but dries polish within 90 Seconds. Nothing else like it!!</li>
    <li> I use to finish my nails with seche Vite top coat, and then spray a quick dry coat. This drys so quickly, you can leave home after 10 minutes.</li>

    <li> I have used this for a few years and decided to get this size to refill my small bottle that has a dropper in it.  The product works very well if you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but this dries my polish in minutes.... all the way through.  No more morning sheet marks in my polish because I could not stay awake until it was dry.  Fast shipping.  Good packing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this baby since 2012 and I can&#x27;t do my nails with out it&lt;br /&gt;It seriously cut the time of drying those nails , it takes one drop 1 min and your ready to roll</li>
    <li> My favorite. No more sitting still for 30 minutes...or lights.</li>
    <li> Really good product. My Nails are dry in seconds. I strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely works.  It doesn&#x27;t dry immediately, but it definitely decreases dry time.  My nail used to remain moist for hours &amp; I would need to be careful for a long time.  Now, 1 good hour of waiting...much easier.  A ceiling fan helps too.</li>
