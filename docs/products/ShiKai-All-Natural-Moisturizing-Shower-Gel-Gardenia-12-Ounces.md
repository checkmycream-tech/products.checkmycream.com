<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice shower gel, but I wish it had a stronger gardenia scent.</li>
    <li> This shower gel smells terrific. Very clean scent makes a luxurious lather ad rinses off leaving you month and soft but not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering othe products in the line.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the fragrance.  I wish they made it without any fragrance.  However, I&#x27;m definitely hooked on the way it leaves my skin feeling.  It&#x27;s much softer and more pliable and I feel good not having all that \\&quot;soap\\&quot; stuff on my body.  If you like shower gel and if you want to have great skin I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Terrific scent and softening lather I use it as bubble bath daily and my husband also enjoys the gentle scent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cross-posting my review to all variants of this Shikai shower gel as a warning. For my original review (proving I&#x27;ve been purchasing the product), see this link: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB9NM6DVMAQT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001ET7EAU&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap because I have dry skin (and it claims to be a moisturizing product). After using a very small amount of the product on my face over the past few YEARS, I recently (past ~6 months) developed severe dermatitis around my eyelid and scalp. The itchiness and redness were unbearable, and my dermatologist prescribed a topical steroid that helped somewhat. Unfortunately, the dermatitis always returned and yet I didn&#x27;t want to believe this was linked to some product I was using because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in years. It was tough to tell if this soap was the cause because the symptoms didn&#x27;t disappear quickly / seem to line up with my usage, but after finally going cold turkey a month or two ago the dermatitis has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this week, when I decided to do some research (why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner, I don&#x27;t know). This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just read about it for yourself, and skip this one until the manufacturer uses some other type of surfactant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> i stumbled on to shi-kai while living in sonoma county ca. which is where this product is made. since moving away from that area i buy it from amazon or sometimes shi-kai&#x27;s web site. my favorite scents are the gardenia, yuza and melon cucumber. i have liked every scent i have tried.  everyone always tells me how nice and clean i smell, how soft my skin is. well, i use shi-kai&#x27;s bath products and matching lotion. all natural,  earth friendly products.    i love this company!</li>
    <li> ShiKai makes good products for the body. Gardenia is my favorite scent to start the day.</li>
    <li> I just used it and I like the gardenia smell and it suds nicely, but it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin so much that you feel like you have to immediately put on lotion.  I did put lotion on but I didn&#x27;t notice any dryness right away which is good because some gels I have used in the past make you feel dry immediately after showering.</li>
    <li> ...soap free...I have been using it for years. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Great if you have psoriasis and need something gentle. I love it.[[ASIN:B001E77PM4 ShiKai All Natural Moisturizing Shower Gel, Gardenia, 12-Ounces (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> This shower gel is super fragrant and lovely to use.  It has been a regular member of my shower for years.  It has a smooth silky texture and a good lather.  It washes off easily and leaves a gentle but not overly perfumy scent on your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice smell while I lather!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Non drying, truly has a gardenia scent!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use anything else, I think it is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Great product-Great price!</li>
    <li> I love it it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, lovely scent of gardenia. I highly recommend it. I also have the citrus scent that might be perfect for man. Wakes me up mornings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced trouble with this product, personally, but another review tipped me off to the presence of Cocamide DEA in this. I&#x27;ve since done some more research and confirmed--yes it&#x27;s in here, yes it&#x27;s probably not great for you, and also the ingredient is nonessential so why is this product even still formulated with it? Sigh. It should not be so hard to find an &amp;#34;ethical&amp;#34; company which is responsible and conservative about the safety of the products it makes, especially when so many such companies exist that inhabit (or try to) the environmentally responsible, health/safety-conscious &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; sphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will still use this product, as I do with my probably fabulously toxic fancy perfumes--sparingly and with great enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;I get that, unless you as a consumer are willing to commit a lot of time and money to research/whipping up your own products, it&#x27;s very hard to really cut out all the potential, proven and unproven toxins from your life. But really, for a company that insists on having such a healthy, natural image, I expected better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now, pretty happily. I wanted to continue to be able to  dump this in the tub and feel good about it, and give it to family, friends with little babies, etc. Now that I know, I won&#x27;t be doing that any longer, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I hardly ever have to use lotion. I am soft and clean and soft.  I ran out of dog shampoo and used it on my dog.  It is soap free like most of the pet shampoos i have to buy for his dry skin. He was so shiny, clen, and soft.  No itching.  So, i tried it on my frizzy, coarse, and unmanagable hair.  Shiny, soft, and clean. Didn&#x27;t even use conditioner.  Sold.</li>
    <li> This product will get you clean, while leaving your skin really soft and filling your bathroom with a lovely fragrance. I love this shower gel, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I pay almost this much for just 1 in my local store, and here I got 3! Will definitely be back for more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower gel.  It&#x27;s gentle and smells heavenly, more like plumeria than gardenia.  It&#x27;s like a little trip to Hawaii every time you shower!</li>
    <li> This shower gel is great.  Wonderful fragrance yet not overpowering and moisturizes really well. Highly recommend.  The price on Amazon was attractive too.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is light and refreshing.  Puts you in a good mood after showering with this.  Wish I could smell the other fragrances this comes in as well</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING ARE PERFECT. GOOD PRICE, GOOD FRAGRANCE, GOOD MOISTURIZE.Especially the elegant floral is my favorite. I&#x27;ll recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:: The 3 pack is no longer available as part of Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program, I wish they would bring it back! The product still deserves 5 stars so I&#x27;ve left my original review but I&#x27;d like to suggest that the shower gel can be purchased by the gallon for around $45 - $48, we refill our bottles at a huge savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Shikai shower gel for my family for years. It has a fresh, natural aroma, very gender neutral, men feel comfortable using the flowers and women using the sandalwood, traditionally a more masculine scent. It&#x27;s perfect if you suffer dry skin or eczema, the only shower gel or soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn or aggravate my kids skin when their eczema is flaring. During winter when the dry air can chafe or cause ashy dry skin my kids avoid hand washing. We can&#x27;t have that! Using Shikai at the sink as well as shower is the only way I can get them to wash up with whining. It&#x27;s around $10 per bottle in my area stores, buying it here on amazon with subscribe and save is like getting a bottle free!</li>
