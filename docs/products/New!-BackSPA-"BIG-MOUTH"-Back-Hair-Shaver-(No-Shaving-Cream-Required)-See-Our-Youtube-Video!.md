      <li>Not only is the customer service from BackSPA amazing, but the product is the best I have ever seen.</li>
      <li>If your back hairs have grown longer than an inch it might not be the best product to start with but</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s the best shaver to maintain your back hair.</li>
      <li>I was so impressed with the shaver that I recommended it to several of my friends who are \\&quot;hairy dudes\\&quot; as well!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a problem that I had not been able to kick until now.  </li>
      <li>but even he was impressed with how well the blades actually works.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it for two reasons.</li>
      <li>Also a AWESOME back scratcher.</li>
      <li>The thing I love most about this shaver is how easy it is to use.</li>
      <li>I get so incredible embarrassed when my girlfriend rubs my back</li>
      <li>I just ordered a couple replacement blades and they&#x27;re easy to replace.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a maintenance tool to keep the clean look.</li>
      <li>I found this company and their product and after reading how people found this to be an easy and maintenance-free shaver I decided to purchase the shaver</li>
      <li>Hands down awesome!</li>
      <li>after that 1st shave it&#x27;s the best product to maintain with hands down.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best service and communication</li>
      <li>Great product; it&#x27;s so easy to use no instructions are necessary.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect my back hair to just pick up and leave but finding a tool like this shaver to help me keep the problem at ease is great for me.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the Backspa to do a great job shaving my back.</li>
      <li>important to you, BackSPA is the company for you!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great product for anyone who deals with the curse of back hair.</li>
      <li>leaves me smooth, just like my face, or anywhere else I shave with my razor.</li>
      <li>I have since been using the shaver and it feels great to have a clean back again.</li>
      <li>The Mfg is great though, they were very understanding and issued me a refund and promised they&#x27;d send out their \\&quot;New &amp; Improved\\</li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s been closer to 5 years since I successfully shaved my back</li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>With my first time I was able to get a really good shave done in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this is that the blade cuts right above the skin,no more itching when the hair grows back...</li>
      <li>offered a true resolution.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend any wives out there to get this for their hairy hubby : )</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the product but even more the company.</li>
      <li>Thanks guys for such an ingenious product!!</li>
      <li>However, I also felt that perhaps the owner was just a great guy and, after all, with all these great Amazon reviews how could I go wrong!  </li>
      <li>After buying this shaver I was able to verify how creative and unique this back shaver really is.</li>
      <li>A quick and Effective way to shave your back without spending an hour in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth your while.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m good now until the end of the summer at least : )</li>
      <li>Wish the replacement blades were cheaper but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth getting.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t think this review is useful than don&#x27;t buy it,but if you do,grab it and kiss it.lol</li>
      <li>I would have gotten made fun of.</li>
      <li>I need to recruit one of my friends which is always so much fun.</li>
      <li>He ended up loving the shaver and my role as the \\&quot;official back shaver wife\\&quot; is over.</li>
      <li>Product didnt quite work out for me but the manufacturer bent over backwards to make it right</li>
      <li>and you can get a clean shave without too much effort.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use as well and it covers a lot of area all at the same time.</li>
      <li>Although the ads looked great the procedures really let me down on the results.</li>
      <li>I was okay with the delays though because I simply wanted a product that would effectively shave my back.  </li>
      <li>After 5 or more passes, I barely noticed if any hairs were cut.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave this item 2 stars only because it is great to scratch your back with.</li>
      <li>Very affordable when compared to other options on the market and most of them don&#x27;t give you as good of a shaver as this big mouth shaver.</li>
      <li>Funny...</li>
      <li>This is more of a back scratcher than anything.</li>
      <li>This personally worked better for me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s case-by-case depending on your back hair.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s pretty out of control</li>
      <li>I was overall extremely pleased with the quality of shave that this shaver provides.</li>
      <li>This is not my first time around the block.  </li>
      <li>I, however, have better things to do than spend over an hour in awkward positions while achieving nothing except perhaps some great exercise stretches.  </li>
      <li>If the smell wasn&#x27;t present and it were priced more reasonably</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the back hair most guys don&#x27;t have that is very embarrassing.</li>
      <li>I finally decided to take action into my own hands</li>
      <li>First, I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time in front of the mirror trying to get a glimpse as to what I am trying to shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the hair as long as I can remember and with that I&#x27;ve always been shameful of it as I think most guys are.</li>
      <li>A quick solution to the problem is what everyone is after and this offers just that.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s definitely the best back shaver on the market hands down.</li>
      <li>If you are expecting a blade like a real razor forget it.</li>
      <li>Buy a Mangroomer, you&#x27;ll be much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, that being said I really don&#x27;t have too much of a self-esteem issue.</li>
      <li>After years of doing absolutely nothing about it</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave very close ...</li>
      <li>I absolutely h-a-t-e</li>
      <li>The electronic trimmers don&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like and they also take way too much time to get a completed shave done.</li>
      <li>There is really nothing else out there that I can see that works quite like this shaver.</li>
      <li>But these people who say that it left them smooth...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Summer time is here and again I look for another back shaver or solution to fix this gross back hair problem I have been dealing with for way too long. I noticed this shaver was just released and after reading some of the reviews I gave it a try. Hands down awesome! This shaver has a features that no other back shavers or back hair remedies on the market offer. A quick solution to the problem is what everyone is after and this offers just that. I was so impressed with the shaver that I recommended it to several of my friends who are \\&quot;hairy dudes\\&quot; as well! I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need to spend so much time just getting my back ready to be shaved which I have be used to doing for so long. I would say that I probably give myself touch-up shave once every 4-5 days. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s case-by-case depending on your back hair. This is definitely a maintenance tool that allows you to keep your back hair \\&quot;under control\\&quot;. If you have large amounts of back hair to begin with I would suggest trimming it down first and then continuing to use this shaver. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> My husband has recently started taking a new medication.  The medicine is working great but unforutnately one of the side effects is excessive body hair growth :(. SO we were looking for products to help with this issue.  We came across this and we purchased one.  We figured we had nothing to loose!!!  We got the product and we were completely amazed.  It not only worked well but it was incredibly easy to use!!  I cannot stop raving to my friends and family.  I have even convinced a few others to buy and try it!  They have and loved it as well!!  So glad we got this!!!</li>
    <li> My husband is a good looking minority which can be a double-edge sword because in order to not turn me off he needs to continuously keep his hairy disgusting back shaved clean. He never really shaved his back before we started dating but I can tell you that he told me he tried 2 different products previously of which will remain nameless and he had zero luck. One product required that he apply shaving cream on his back which he seriously hated because it&#x27;s one of the main things that gave him a kink in his neck when going through the process each time. The other product is made very poorly and does not cut the way that he said he needed it to. After purchasing the back spa Bigmouth shaver he can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best \\&quot;up-keep\\&quot; shaver on the market. If you have bushels of hair on your back or have you really let yourself go he recommends having someone shave your back first before using this product. It&#x27;s the best shaver to maintain your back hair. If your back hairs have grown longer than an inch it might not be the best product to start with but after that 1st shave it&#x27;s the best product to maintain with hands down. My husband and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Has anyone ever gone to the beach during the summer and felt like a disgusting old man even though you are in your twenties?  I absolutely h-a-t-e my back hair so much that I have developed a complex over it.  I get so incredible embarrassed when my girlfriend rubs my back it&#x27;s on a day that I had forgotten to shave.  It&#x27;s horribly embarrassing when I forget to shave when going to a public pool and it&#x27;s a problem that I had not been able to kick until now.  I purchased this big mouth back shaver and it was the best decision I have made since who knows when.  This shaver offers something that I have never seen.  This is not my first time around the block.  I have bought back shavers and other \\&quot;solutions\\&quot; before but not of them offered a true resolution.  I was literally at my wits end and then came across this new back shaver that offered a wider shave with having to deal with the hassle of shaving cream.  I can tell you that this shaver only takes me about 3-5 minutes to shave my entire back.  I just ordered a couple replacement blades and they&#x27;re easy to replace.  If you want to be clear of back hair this summer I recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and I have suffered from back hair all my life. When I was younger it really wasn&#x27;t accepted to shave your back hair. In fact, if the guys on my football team were to find out I was shaving my back I would have gotten made fun of. However, today it&#x27;s much different because guys are shaving everything these days. My wife of 20 years never really like my back hair but of course because she loves me she always put up with it and would even shave it for me which I hated doing to her but there was no way for me to take care of this problem. She suggested getting my back waxed which I just don&#x27;t want to go through pain like that so I ended up going online and looking at other options. I found this company and their product and after reading how people found this to be an easy and maintenance-free shaver I decided to purchase the shaver and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I spend about 5 minutes once a week shaving my back and the problem is under control. The biggest problem in this category for me has been time consumption and embarrassment. I didn&#x27;t want to keep putting my wife through grueling tasks of shaving my back while at the same time I didn&#x27;t want to sit and get a shave that took 30 minutes. The big mouth in my opinion is the ultimate solution guys. Let your wives get back to the cooking!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing!  I just got my Back Spa today and started using it right away.  It took me no more than 3-4 minutes to do my entire back without having to use any shaving cream.  Great product; it&#x27;s so easy to use no instructions are necessary.  I use (three now) products to keep my body well groomed: Panasonic ER-GN30 for my ear/nose hair, Philips Norelco NT 9110 for \\&quot;those\\&quot; sensitive areas (make sure you rinse it once in a while for it to work properly) and now the Back Spa Back Shaver.  For just about $55 altogether now I can keep my self impeccably groomed year-round.  Thanks guys for such an ingenious product!!</li>
    <li> I am definitely a hairy dude. My back hair has always been an issue for me and my buddies have always made fun of me for being hairy. I tried a couple of electronic back shavers over the course of the last 3 years but they end up collecting dust. The electronic trimmers don&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like and they also take way too much time to get a completed shave done. My wife actually purchased this shaver for me and I absolutely love it for two reasons. First, I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time in front of the mirror trying to get a glimpse as to what I am trying to shave. It&#x27;s hard to explain but with this shave b/c of the size of the blade I can actually tell what areas I have shaved and still need to shave by feel. I&#x27;m done in minutes and it&#x27;s a descent shave as well. Very happy with the results so I ended up purchasing some extra blades so I&#x27;m good now until the end of the summer at least : )</li>
    <li> This shaver offers what most \\&quot;back hair resolutions\\&quot; don&#x27;t offer.  A quick and Effective way to shave your back without spending an hour in the bathroom.  Seriously, i can&#x27;t even imagine how much of my time I&#x27;ve spent prepping my back with shaving cream or using trimmers to cut my hair down.  I, like others, get to a point that i realize i&#x27;ve been running around in circles trying to fix this ongoing problem.  I swear by this product and I recommend to anyone who is trying to find a fix to their back hair issues.  Definitely worth your while.</li>
    <li> Product didnt quite work out for me but the manufacturer bent over backwards to make it right and that is a big plus in my book.</li>
    <li> Just an FYI for everyone...women do not like back hair. I have been dealing with looking at and feeling my husband&#x27;s back hair now for over 12 years and to be \\&quot;frank\\&quot; it&#x27;s gross. I have been helping him shave it since we got engaged and my life have been full of back hair ever since. I have always kept my eye out for things that might be great to replace me in the mix and I finally came across this Backspa back shaver and decided to purchase one for him. He ended up loving the shaver and my role as the \\&quot;official back shaver wife\\&quot; is over. He now takes care of it himself once a week which takes him about 5 minutes. This is really a maintenance tool that keeps his back hair shaven so if you have bushels of back hair you might want to hack away at it with a trimmer before maintaining it with the backspa shaver on a regular basis. 2 thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Hair gets caught in the blade&#x27;s teeth too easily and is hard to get out for maximum effectiveness. Also the blade got dull very quickly. It worked ok the first few times but after that it just scrapes the skin.</li>
    <li> Not only is the customer service from BackSPA amazing, but the product is the best I have ever seen. It literally took me a mere three minutes to use. The blade is huge and covers a large area at once, but more importantly, the protective cover over the blade prevents you from cutting yourself like you would with a regular razor (while still getting a very close shave). I highly recommend this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big dude and I have always worked out quite a bit. So, that being said I really don&#x27;t have too much of a self-esteem issue. I would say my biggest self-esteem breaker is the back hair that is never cool to put on display at any summer party. Because I&#x27;m a big dude I have a large back and in order for me to shave my back I need to recruit one of my friends which is always so much fun. Needless to say I&#x27;ve done a few procedures of laser hair removal which didn&#x27;t work as well as I had initially thought. Although the ads looked great the procedures really let me down on the results. I had come across this shaver at a health convention and I spoke to a rep for a bit about the blade. After getting a sample I decided to purchase the shaver and it&#x27;s definitely the best back shaver on the market hands down. I probably spend a total of 5 minutes twice a week and I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s more of a maintenance tool to keep the clean look. If you grow your back hair too long you might want to trim it down with a clippers but after that as long as you keep up with it you are good to go. Very solid product and a 5 star in my book.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of a larger &amp; faster back shaving experience... The unit does not work.  The Mfg is great though, they were very understanding and issued me a refund and promised they&#x27;d send out their \\&quot;New &amp; Improved\\&quot; blade that should work. It&#x27;s been a few months now and I have yet to receive the blade, so all I have is an elobatare back scratcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Mangroomer for years and nothing beats it, only issue with the Mangroomer is its cutting surface is rather small and that&#x27;s what inspired me to try this unit.  Buy a Mangroomer, you&#x27;ll be much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review should the new blade ever show up from the mfg with my results, be it good or bad.</li>
    <li> I believe it&#x27;s been closer to 5 years since I successfully shaved my back but I haven&#x27;t shaved it since because it was a nightmare. I really don&#x27;t have an enormous amount of hair on my back but it&#x27;s enough to turn off the ladies. I was recently on vacation and the company backspa had a promotions give away that they were doing close to the beach we were stating. They were handing out their blades and I was definitely impressed. I have since been using the shaver and it feels great to have a clean back again. The thing I love most about this shaver is how easy it is to use. There is really nothing else out there that I can see that works quite like this shaver. Very wide blade face and you can get a clean shave without too much effort. My friend who was with me doesn&#x27;t have too much back hair but even he was impressed with how well the blades actually works. Great product for anyone who deals with the curse of back hair.</li>
    <li> Just like another guy mentioned, I also believe these reviews are mostly fake.  FYI, I was reluctant to leave a negative review because this is a small business and I know times are not the greatest.  However, when I suspect that this company is posting a bunch of fake reviews to make a terrible product into something sent from God himself, well I don&#x27;t have a problem posting my review.  There is simply no way this product deserves even average reviews.  With that said, I ordered this product from the manufacturer since, at least at the time, it was slightly cheaper.  After several delays and a couple of excuses, the product arrived.  I was okay with the delays though because I simply wanted a product that would effectively shave my back.  The owner also mentioned a free upgrade to his new product due to the delay.  I thought that was strange since that obviously cuts into profits.  It also gave me the impression that this product may not work well.  However, I also felt that perhaps the owner was just a great guy and, after all, with all these great Amazon reviews how could I go wrong!  Well, I was very wrong.  You can go over your back hair several times with this blade and it will simply not cut most of it.  The design of the product is not flexible and you are stuck with a blade (or rather a dull piece of crap) that will leave you trying various moves in the mirror to try to get the thing to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product at all.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, then order it.  I, however, have better things to do than spend over an hour in awkward positions while achieving nothing except perhaps some great exercise stretches.  You will have much better shaving results finding a big tree and rubbing your back against it.  Simply put, this product design isn&#x27;t even fit for early cave man engineering.</li>
    <li> I have been having my back waxed now for almost 2 years and although most guys are not ok with the pain I actually don&#x27;t mind it. The part I do mind though is the $ that I pay to have it waxed. I was going through so much money on having my back waxed that I needed to find another solution. I came across this shaver online and decided to give it a try after reading some of the reviews. I have been so completely satisfied and happy with both the effectiveness of the shaver as well as the price. Very affordable when compared to other options on the market and most of them don&#x27;t give you as good of a shaver as this big mouth shaver. Definitely worth getting.</li>
    <li> I have always nagged my husband to do something about his awful back hair. After years of doing absolutely nothing about it I finally decided to take action into my own hands and I decided to buy a do-it-yourself back shaver. I saw the reviews on the backspa bigmouth back shaver and decided to make the purchase. I have literally been replaced by this shaver and he cannot get enough of it!! I love it!! He uses the shaver once or twice a week and it&#x27;s very easy for him to use. I would say it probably takes him no more than 5 minutes. Highly recommend any wives out there to get this for their hairy hubby : )</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s summer time and my kids go swimming with me they always joke and say the monkey or ape is going to get us! It&#x27;s become a running joke that when daddy&#x27;s shirt comes off to go swimming I turn into the monkey or ape man. Funny...yes...but when in public places I definitely turn a shade red and get embarrassed which is why I decided to finally take a step and purchasing something to rid myself of this carpet on my back. I do have chest hair that&#x27;s pretty out of control but that&#x27;s not really embarrassing. It&#x27;s the back hair most guys don&#x27;t have that is very embarrassing. I&#x27;ve had the hair as long as I can remember and with that I&#x27;ve always been shameful of it as I think most guys are. Maybe back in the 1800&#x27;s it was acceptable to have back hair but not now-a-days. After purchasing this bigmouth shaver I realized I found something to help me fix this annoying problem. I don&#x27;t expect my back hair to just pick up and leave but finding a tool like this shaver to help me keep the problem at ease is great for me. Since purchasing the shaver I probably take about 10-15 minute a week maintaining it and that&#x27;s it. Not any longer than that. The blades are protected from slicing up your back as well which is always a nice factor when you&#x27;re not getting the best view of your shaving surface. I would like to recommend this to a bunch of my friends but it&#x27;s quite the embarrassing topic so I&#x27;ll recommend this anonymously to all of you!</li>
    <li> Great, only AFTER I buy it do I find that a lot of the reviews seem to be fake.  This thing works a LITTLE, but really not enough to make it worthwhile to purchase.  I wasted money on it AND the replacement blades.  Ahhh!! Stupid thing takes like 50 passes to get most of the hair and then it still doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.  Seems to be currently unavailable, probably out of business, but if it does come back, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a scam, it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the manufacturer would have hoped.</li>
    <li> I totally agree with the review that gave 1 star. I have just receied the product and I have just found out that is not what I expected. reading back all the review it is very easy to see that are all fake. product is below average and 1 star comes from the fact that i feel that ihave just been screwed over...</li>
    <li> I was a little on the cautious side when I bought this,but I was sick of getting my back waxed.It seemed a little expensive but I said WTF and tried it.It does take a little to get used to it,but after a minute or 2,you are hooked up.Wish the replacement blades were cheaper but it is worth it.Only a couple minutes and your back is done.Also a AWESOME back scratcher.I love it for that reason alone.I recommend that you buy this,then go on their website and order like 10 blades a pop,because they screw you on the shipping.The best thing about this is that the blade cuts right above the skin,no more itching when the hair grows back...I hated that so bad.If you don&#x27;t think this review is useful than don&#x27;t buy it,but if you do,grab it and kiss it.lol</li>
    <li> The item doesn&#x27;t warrant the price tag.  It&#x27;s not a heavy duty type of construction.  The shave is not really close but it does work.  However, the really odd thing is that the plastic from which this is made has an overpowering smell to it such that I cannot leave it in small space like a bathroom.  I have no idea what that smell is about but it doesn&#x27;t go away.  If the smell wasn&#x27;t present and it were priced more reasonably I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good purchse, but it&#x27;s probably a $15 item, tops.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product got any decent reviews.  IT DOESN&#x27;T CUT HAIR!!!  After trying it on my back and suspecting that it wasn&#x27;t cutting hair, I tried it on my belly, which without trimming is also hairy.  After 5 or more passes, I barely noticed if any hairs were cut.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this \\&quot;trims\\&quot; hair for super, guerrilla back hair.  But these people who say that it left them smooth...I call BS!!  I&#x27;ll stick with RAzorBA - leaves me smooth, just like my face, or anywhere else I shave with my razor.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately went this year to spring break having to shave my back using my girlfriend and my Gillette shaver. Only after coming back did I come across this shaver and realize that I could have used it before my trip. I was overall extremely pleased with the quality of shave that this shaver provides. It&#x27;s very easy to use as well and it covers a lot of area all at the same time. The other really good feature this product has is a row of protective teeth that protect your back from getting cuts during the shaving process. All-in-all this is a product that I have recommended to some of my friends and I would recommend to anyone who wants to finally maintain the gross back hair they have.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lot more based on the large amount of excellent reviews...I will be going back to buzzing</li>
    <li> After buying this shaver I was able to verify how creative and unique this back shaver really is. The way the blades are laid out are very different (in a good way) compared to the rest of the other back shaving options. With my first time I was able to get a really good shave done in a short amount of time. Of course any back shaver takes a little getting used to since you are literally shaving behind your visual but the handle on this shaver is very light and easy to use. I also found that it&#x27;s easier to use this shaver after trimming your longer hair down. I had a lot of long hairs on my bad and decided to trim it down first. This personally worked better for me and now I can just keep up with the smaller hairs using the shaver.</li>
    <li> To be honest I&#x27;m not very impressed with this shaver ... it does have a nice huge blade but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave very close ... but maybe the new blade that is coming out for it will be&lt;br /&gt;a great improvement .. but for guys like me that ordered a extra set of these not so great blades to a already expensive plastic shaver I kinda wish I would have stuck with my man groomer</li>
    <li> I gave this item 2 stars only because it is great to scratch your back with. Don&#x27;t buy into the high rating reviews here. it&#x27;s bologna. I was expecting the Backspa to do a great job shaving my back. I do not have thick back hair but I do have hair. This product barely shaved any hair at all. If you are expecting a blade like a real razor forget it. This blade seems like a dull razor, takes a little bit off but just doesn&#x27;t do much other than scratching your back.</li>
    <li> The product works as promised. More importantly Matt at BackSPA is awesome! Hands down the best service and communication I have had in a very long time. I would highly recommend the product but even more the company. If customer service and companies that stand behind their product and more importantly their service promise are[[ASIN:B008N3V11S New! BIGMOUTH backSPA Do-It-Yourself Back Hair Shaver (Requires No Shaving Cream) See Our Video]] important to you, BackSPA is the company for you!&lt;br /&gt;I will be referring friends to the product and company.&lt;br /&gt;A very happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for everything Matt.&lt;br /&gt;-SY</li>
    <li> This is more of a back scratcher than anything. It does not shave at all. It was kind of a waste of $40.00. I would have paid like $10 for this and it wouldn&#x27;t of been such a loss. razorba and a plain razor work better.</li>
