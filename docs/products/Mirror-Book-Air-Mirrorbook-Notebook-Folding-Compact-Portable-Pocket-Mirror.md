<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> U don&#x27;t get the silver color U get a white one</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moHBET6EWB18IK]]Okay, so i ordered 3 of these as small gifts for friends...&lt;br /&gt;it looks cheap feels cheap, and theyre all white. disappointed. considering sending them all back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure that this is a genuine Apple product, but it sure is adorable!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Plastic is cheap and light. Mirror does not stand up on its own. Hard to open and close. I wish I would have just bought a plain one, but I thought this was cute. Would return but it&#x27;d cost more to return than I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister.  She loved it and uses it every day.  If you got a teenage daughter or sister, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> The item was broken  from left cornerwhen received. Still used it.</li>
    <li> VERY poor quality. It looked like that mirror was just glued on, the ink of the keyboard was precise so you could tell it was fake, the mirror wouldn&#x27;t sit up like it does in the picture. Its arrival time was almost 3 weeks after I ordered it - so forget wrapping it was a Christmas present. I was very unhappy with this product.</li>
    <li> There are alot of bad and good reviews on this page but i got my mirror and i was very impressedit is a godd quality mirror and it looks just like the MacBook Air so i say buy it its worth the money and it is very cute but one this is that it will come in your mailbox but thats not an issue and the colors you get are random i got the silver and ther is also a white color</li>
    <li> The product is all white plastic rather than seemingly the texture of an Air Book. Although the details are very accurate I would like the finish to be closer to the look of an actual computer. Produce shipped on time with no problems. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Cute as can be. Great quality. I gave this as a gift to my granddaughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Fell apart into three pieces as soon as it arrived (mirror plus two halves of the shell).  It&#x27;s a novelty item, so I didn&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Looks great. Nice and durable.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how it works as a compact, but my 8 year old daughter uses it as a mac for her American Girl dolls. She loves it. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> My girls use these for their American Girl Dolls.&lt;br /&gt;They love them!</li>
    <li> Very cute. Perfect size for 18 inch doll. Arrived on time. Great condition.</li>
    <li> Adorable. My daughter uses this as a laptop for her American Girl dolls.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a lot for $4.50 including shipping but this product still didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It was white instead of the typical grey MacBook color and the hinge didn&#x27;t work very well. I was expecting a cool trinket to show people but I&#x27;m probably going to just throw it away.</li>
    <li> Really cute and perfect sized for dolls, it arrived nicely packaged and no scratches, it was white instead of silver (which i was expecting) but then i realized it came in a random color, so it was all good UuU</li>
    <li> I bought these for gifts. One for granddaughter 18, three for granddaughters in 20&#x27;s and two daughters in late 40&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Fun fun fun for granddaughters american girl doll</li>
    <li> The hinges do not keep it open the way I would expect them to.  I was hoping it would hold itself open so I could use it as a desk mirror - instead it cheaply shuts itself due to gravity.  I have found another way to implement it at my desk at work, and have gotten compliments on it, but if it doesnt hold itself open it doesnt deserve a high rating.</li>
    <li> Perfectly sized (about palm sized) and thin enough to fit in a wallet or small purse. Cute and detailed with small USB ports and individual keys, great gift for the Mac/Apple aficianado in your life. I thought this might be cheap but pleasantly surprised by the quality and detail!</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled with the item. She wanted it for her Ameeican Girl collection. It did its job. Thanks</li>
    <li> so cute, perfect for my daughters American Girl doll. It did take 3-4 weeks to receive though.</li>
    <li> So cute! A real delight. Took a REALLY long time to be delivered (4+ months??)</li>
    <li> My cockatiel told me this was the best present I ever got her. She really likes closing it and throwing it around her cage. I think it&#x27;s cute as long she plays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the buttons might push or wiggle but they don&#x27;t. The whole thing is one solid piece.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of these to put inside purses like gift baskets for my step daughters and they loved it. Everyone I showed them to just adored them . How cute.</li>
    <li> When i received it, the outside of it was perfect. It was clean, nice looking, but when i opened it the mirror was very dirty, I had to clean it. I don&#x27;t expect a product i buy to be perfect but the fact I had bought a new item and it was dirty and i needed to inspect it before i gave it away as a gift was disappointing.</li>
    <li> My daughter actually bought this to use as a laptop for her American Girl doll!  Perfect size and MUCH cheaper than AG items!</li>
    <li> its a handy little mirror to carry around. its a clever little idea, for someone who doesnt have one. j</li>
    <li> Very cute looks real but instead of a screen it has a mirror and it&#x27;s about 4 inches by 3 inches. Goes great in my lap top bag/purse/backpack.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these for my 8 year old daughter.  She make believes her beanie boos are playing on the computer.</li>
    <li> it is inexpensive and so adorable, looks like a really mini mac air, I highly recommend others to buy one!</li>
    <li> This product is super cute, and the mirror is clear, and big enough so you can see your whole face. My only complaint is that the screws holding the two pieces together are a little loose, so the bottom hangs if you&#x27;re trying to use it.</li>
    <li> The product came in white, I was expecting silver. It looks and feels very cheap, so I would not give this as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is a great little stocking stuffer for any Mac lover! It has so many little details (power outlets, USB spot, little keys) I am rather impressed for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting one and its the perfect size for the American girl doll</li>
    <li> Cute cute cute!  Big Apple fan lives in my house so this was a fun gift to give her.</li>
    <li> This is what it is - an inexpensive toy.  I read that some buyers use it as a compact, which is a cute idea.  This is for my daughter&#x27;s Our Generation doll.  If you&#x27;re read reviews about how it&#x27;s a cheap piece of @#&amp;%, I respond by saying What were you expecting for a few dollars?  Be warned: shopping is a long time, so if you need it fast, that plan won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This thing looked so nice online, but when I got my package, it was terrible. First off the mirror doesn&#x27;t stand up on its own like it is showing in the picture, second, the paint is not nearly as fine as it is in the picture, there was a ton of excess black paint on the inside, where the keyboard is. Third, the paint on the outside is terrible. It is not smooth, there are bumps, there are scratches, I would even think this thing was used. It is not a quality piece at all. And lastly, the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay shut, there is no mecanism to keep the mirror closed. I am very seriously contemplating returning this... very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Not an item I would usually buy however as a joke for my wife it fit the bill!  She has wanted a MacBook Air for a while.  She did not think it was funny!  Had to go out and buy her the real thing!</li>
    <li> So cute.  My daughters use it for their American Girl dolls. Looks like the real thing</li>
    <li> This is the cutest thing ever! I get tons of compliments when I use it out in public or at work. It is cheaply made but it still works so get it. It is only $5</li>
    <li> It is great to use with your american girl dolls at a cheap price and it is very realistic. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great for AG dolls, the girls love them.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I got this in the mail today, and OMG it&#x27;s really really cute. I am currently taking partial pictures of it and sending it to my boyfriend, and he keeps asking me how much I spent on it for those &amp;#34;stupid specs.&amp;#34; Basically, he&#x27;s 100% fooled into thinking that it is a real macbook still. I mean, the bottom has really really small text (100% of which matches the real one, except for the fact that it says &amp;#34;Galifornia&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Ghina&amp;#34;, but who would really notice that but me LOL). The keys are absolutely adorable. The sides even have holes for &amp;#34;ports&amp;#34;. I only take off one star because it has two little gray imperfection spots in the making of the plastic (and yes, not because I got a white one, which I did). The mirror is crystal clear, not like those cheap and thin &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; mirrors. I can&#x27;t guarantee anything, but I think it&#x27;s worth a shot to get it. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a little gag gift as her real Macbook just died on her. The one I ordered came in white not silver, but that&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me. The mirror doesn&#x27;t hinge all that well. By that I mean you CAN&#x27;T set it down and angle the &#x27;screen&#x27; in whatever position you want. It&#x27;s either open or closed. But it&#x27;s a pocket mirror. Its purpose is to be held while in use anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure this thing is cheap, but you should know that going in. If you&#x27;re looking for something super high quality that comes out of China for eight bucks, you&#x27;re in the wrong place. This thing is really cute and is going to make my girlfriend laugh and smile when she opens it. She&#x27;ll also think of me every time she uses it...which will probably be like a dozen times a day. That&#x27;s a steal for eight bucks.</li>
    <li> For a little novelty item this is really cute.  It is not a cheaply made item and does stand up to tossing around.</li>
    <li> This is really cool it is way more detailed than I thought it would be all buttons and everything are on there no broken mirror and arrived way earlier than expected</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping to get it in silver as pictured, but received white. The white was so cute that I kept it. The hinges are loose but the mirror is adorable, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for your pocket or even 18&amp;#34; dolls/action figures/etc.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see that it said random color. I got a white one instead of the silver thatI wanted. And it is very flimsy.</li>
    <li> Many different choices and some are different than others... Yes, it did take quite a while to get in from China, but came well packaged.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter to use with her American Girl dolls. It is the right scale and looks awesome as a doll prop.  My daughter loves it.  It took a few weeks for it to reach me from overseas, but this is plainly stated in the shipping information, so no complaints here!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adorable, cute and looks EXACTLY like a real mac... just teeny tiny! ;)</li>
    <li> Nice gift for my clients that purchase macbooks, Great product and timely service.</li>
    <li> This is the most adorable lap top for an 18 inch doll. ( eg American Girl Doll)&lt;br /&gt;It is so cute and looks just like a mac book. It is made well and comes in a unique box that is wrapped securely so that it is not damaged on the way. We were amazed at the integrity of the packaging because it came from overseas. It is a functional compact mirror as well and can be used as such. Fun gift for any Apple product fan. I would like to order more to give as gifts and use as stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> i was tryin 2 get a silver one BUT HAD 2 get a white</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it. It&#x27;s so realistic and perfect for an American Girl doll.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be gray, it&#x27;s white. and can barley stand open but the idea is cute.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this compact! It&#x27;s so slim it fits in my pocket or clutch easily and it&#x27;s always a conversation starter.</li>
    <li> Thought I was going to get a silver one - but it is white.  Oh well.  For the price, it is exactly what I expected.  Just wish it was silver.</li>
    <li> This thing is hilarious and I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it, but the picture is wrong. It actually is white and looks like the old plastic macbooks rather than the new aluminum ones. But for the price I dont care. It was a joke gift anyway.</li>
    <li> There are small scratches on the mirror. Not in very good quality when you really hold it, but the originality is excellent!</li>
    <li> I got it for My daugher&#x27;s American Girl Doll.  It looks so cute and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Was purchased as a toy for an American Girl doll and it&#x27;s perfect. Was delivered timely as well.</li>
    <li> Nice for american girl dolls.</li>
    <li> Yes. My daughter loved it! Thanks</li>
    <li> Pretty clever product. I bought several and each of the hinge mechanisms could be a bit tighter, but outside of that, not bad.</li>
    <li> No problems...product was shipped on time and as described</li>
</ol>
