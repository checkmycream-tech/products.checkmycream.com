      <li>I was looking for something different than what I normally would buy</li>
      <li>I expected a bit more pigmentation, but it did little to nothing for my lips outside of what their regular lip balms do.</li>

    <li> The lip balm looks good and it actually very useful for me. May be next time I need to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I loved this color. It went on smoothly, and made my lips really soft. It added a hint of color without over doing it. My lips are pretty sensitive, and wearing lipstick will dry them out quickly. Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s kept my lips moisturized and added the perfect amount of color. I will for sure be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have the color of petunia, it is not good color, and my lips are not looking great with it</li>

    <li> This gloss is the perfect thing to grab for absolutely any occasion. It is work appropriate, great for going out on the town, but also appropriate for just everyday use. Think of it as your every occasion lip product, not a lipstick but not quite a nighttime lip balm. When I leave the house, I grab my phone, my wallet, my keys and this nourishing and sassy lip balm. It works better than Chanel or Dior, and leaves my friends questioning where I got that perfect shade. BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!!! Your lips will thank you :)</li>
    <li> Love it! Got 2 more colors and one for Mom.</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of light tint and super moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love this color! I can&#x27;t go anywhere without my Burt&#x27;s Bees and I love how this gives a little bit of color.</li>
    <li> Oh dear Burt&#x27;s Bees...how I SO wanted to love you! For the first 1.5 weeks, I adored using this product. Then out of nowhere, my normal, perfectly fine lips starting chapping and FLAKING. Sorry Burt&#x27;s. Changing over to Palmer&#x27;s for a better, cheaper product. Maybe next time.</li>
    <li> Smelled rotten.  I normally like Burt&#x27;s bees but this just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever brought a Burt&#x27;s Bees product. I was looking for something different than what I normally would buy and I&#x27;m glad I did. Not only are my lips softer than they&#x27;ve ever been but I can use it as a lip gloss as well. All I can say is , buy, buy, buy.</li>
