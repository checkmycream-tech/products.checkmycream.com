      <li>This particular batch is the first shea butter that has smelled strongly.  </li>
      <li>skin is very sensitive to many chemicals and additives used in many commercial</li>
      <li>The smell is not offensive or strong to me in any way ... just earthy and natural.</li>
      <li>My experience in business is that while this practice might make you a little more money in the short term, giving the customer more than they expect will pay huge dividends in the long term with repeat business and good reviews.</li>
      <li>I melted the butter at a temp of 165 (to kill any wild bacteria) and strained it through two layers of ultra fine nylon netting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from this company a couple of times before and have always been pleased except for this last time.</li>
      <li>I will set be order in  more but probably in a larger size</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is great but.... IT CAME IN A BAG. Which is a seller problem. I wish they had sent it in a container because I look crazy pulling a bag out to use my shea butter. I&#x27;m thinking of transfering it to a real container but I really should have to because they should&#x27;ve sent it in the right container. The actual product is great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Apparently they tell you that this comes in a bag to save on shipping! My bad. Changing my review now! I really do love the quality of the shea and have purchased again!</li>
    <li> I was going to give this a good rating until the 2nd time I used it. It came in a resealable foil bag which was great for storing, had the ivory color and nutty scent I was expecting and did moisturize well. I broke a chunk off to use for my first attempt at making body butter and the result was definitely usable but gritty, even with whipping it. So for my second attempt I decided to melt it and combine with some other oils and whip it after it cooled. However when I had it on the double boiler and it was melting (there was probably about 2/3 of the pound I&#x27;d received left at this point) I noticed that there were things floating in it. First it was something that resembled plant matter which wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but then I saw a rather large bug. It was dead, obviously, but I was very uncomfortable with using the product even after scooping the bug bits out and I ended up throwing it all out. I understand that its unrefined and all, but to me this is not acceptable. Maybe I&#x27;d try a refined version but probably from a different source or 3rd party seller that can vouch for quality.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed that the Shea Butter that I received was a different color from  the picture.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get to try it because there is a law in México that does not allow us to pass This kind of product.</li>
    <li> great product, i use it to make my own body butter. the packaging is not so great, just a plastic bag. Can easily be transferred into a reusable storage containers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard shea butter is really good for natural hair so I decided to try it while my hair is transitioning. This was the first time I bought shea butter and my experience was not great. The packaging is very difficult to work with because it comes in a plastic bag. It was fine to use on my skin but it left my hair greasy for days. But what I really couldn&#x27;t get over was the smell. I expected a light nutty smell like I read in some of the other reviews but it was a really bad, almost rancid smell. Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to it and that&#x27;s the way it is supposed to smell or maybe I just got a bad batch but I&#x27;m not sure if I should continue to use it. I guess I&#x27;ll have to find something  else to use on my hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome I love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the silkiness of this shea butter, but not much the color. The picture on the website is different from the actual product&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> I bought my first shea butter last month, liked it so well I ordered more.  I use it to make body butter which I love.  This is a great butter.</li>
    <li> I will definitely be ordering from this seller again. It was perfect for making my shea butter mixes! I think I received this item at the beginning of February/End of January and I still have about half a pound left or so. And believe me when I say that I&#x27;m extremely generous when it comes to using shea butter to seal the moisture in my hair.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.  It came in a double layered bag...gets a bit messy because it&#x27;s in a bag, but you can cool it a bit in the fridge and scrape up all the butter.</li>
    <li> This is great authentic Shea Butter. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is super moisturizing! At first it is grainy but when you smooth it out with your hands or whatever you use, it feels like butter. I use it all over my body, it soothes the bumps and nicks after shaving. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from this company a couple of times before and have always been pleased except for this last time. The Shea Butter was soft but there are tiny hard particals in it. I&#x27;m not sure what they are but I do know that I&#x27;ve never had them in my Shea Butter in the past. They&#x27;re almost like little plastic particals and the weight was off by .30 grams, like I said this is the first time I received bad product from this company and hopefully the last.</li>
    <li> Sooooo happy with my big ol&#x27;bag of shea butter.  The seller clearly states that it is in a plastic bag for cheaper shipping so I&#x27;m good with that. This is the real deal raw unrefined shea butter. Shipping was a lot quicker than anticipated so that&#x27;s a plus. The price can not be beat, I love a bargain and I really did get one with this.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to live a healthier lifestyle and get off the chemical based lotions on the market. This raw and unrefined shea butter leaves your skin so soft and healthy and you do not feel guilty or grossed out by the thoughts of chemicals being absorbed into your skin. I use this on me and my kids. Make the switch!</li>
    <li> This butter mixed easily with olive oil to give me an awesome whipped butter. I am not too fond of the bag it came it, I guess I am used to the plastic containers from butter n&#x27; bars. It was still good value for the price.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just like described, smells pleasant enough, and is working great. packaging was good, no bursting or leaking of the container/ package. I got 1 lb and that was enough to last a good long whole, but when i need some more will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> The product was better than I thought.  I will re-order in the future and recommend to those who need this item.</li>
    <li> smells fine, doesn&#x27;t leave a yellow residue like one I bought before, and melts just great.  The only think I didn&#x27;t really like was that it came in a plastic bag.  I would have liked something a little more are tight and that I could reuse after opening. And it makes my face a little oily than usual and break out. :(</li>
    <li> Raw Shea Butter is great if you mix it. I put 1/4 cup of goats milk lotion, 1/4 cup of coconut oil 5 ml of Lavender oil and I will be adding 2ml of Sandalwood and 2ml of Jasmine to this. If you whip it all together it makes a very rich creamy butter. The smell is not great alone so you will need to add scents to make it smell nice. However Shea butter is wonderful on the skin. I highly recommend it for that.</li>
    <li> Love the quality and consistency of this shea butter. I use it as-is and have noticed a marked overall improvement to the appearance and feel to my skin. The smell is not offensive or strong to me in any way ... just earthy and natural. I may start adding some essential oils and possibly coconut oil and pure natural vitamin E oil (d-alpha Tocopherol) in the future, but right now just grabbing a chunk and rubbing it on my skin is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
    <li> i am a lover of the yellow shea butter..because i have seen the results for myself in myself and for other people.especially in skin eczema&#x27;s and weirdo rashes.. but i did try the white and i am very pleasantly surprised at the viscosity and  texture and it has a wonderfully different smell that i really love...WOW  i love it ....is all i said.  thank-you to the ladies and gentlemen that make it and the long hours it takes to make it!  a-ho</li>
    <li> Very soft and skin nourishing.  This is the creamiest shea butter i&#x27;ve ever experienced.  ( I&#x27;ve bought from several sources.)  This particular batch is the first shea butter that has smelled strongly.  So beware - most shea butter smells slightly nutty, but once in a while, a batch rather stinks, even though it&#x27;s not rancid.  Just different growing situations for the nuts, or something.  (Rancid shea butter will be blotchy / uneven in color, and smell more than nutty - apparently.)  Save an old snap-lid food container or purchase one to store the butter.  I apply after every shower - everywhere.  Inexpensive, and great for every inch of skin.  I&#x27;m caucasian / Euro background, and apply to hair before bed.  If you try it, you may need to wash your hair with dish soap a few times to really get the hair clean.  (A vinegar rinse afterwards is great, too, if you use shea on hair.)</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s soft and easy to use. And I just plain love raw shea butter. It&#x27;s great as a moisturizer for your skin and hair, and I&#x27;m curious as to the benefits it has for other things I looked up on pinterest like a natural cure for:&lt;br /&gt;rashes&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;flaky skin&lt;br /&gt;(etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff and will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Wow...I didn&#x27;t expect so much for what I paid...this will last a long time and will mix well with my Shea butter hair cream...it smell great and the delivery was quicker than expected...recommendations is extremely high...</li>
    <li> This product is really nice: it arrived in a plastic zip top bag and is a light creamy yellow in color. It smells like shea butter should. I have previously purchased shea butter from another seller and I prefer this seller&#x27;s product as it&#x27;s much softer and easier to use. I used the butter in making some body lotion and it melted really nicely.  You can also use it as is, since it&#x27;s soft enough to just rub onto the skin.</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair and use it in my mixture and It is a very very good product.</li>
    <li> This is really pure shea butter. I was a little soft and mixed really well with my oils. It makes my hair incredibly soft and really locks in moisture. It came on time in a plastic bag, but I had no problem getting it out. This bag will probably last me until spring or summer. You only need such a small amount to make your mix and it lasts a long time. I love this it&#x27;s.  Must for my dry transitioning hair. I can&#x27;t be without it and the price was fantastic so was the shipping. I will set be order in  more but probably in a larger size</li>
    <li> Do not expect it to come all nicely wrapped up in a container. I got exactly one pound of shea butter. Great for skin, hair etc.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice product at a really good price.  I used it for making lotion and it melts really well.</li>
    <li> Ive bought this a few times now to make body butter and everyone that has tried it loves it too. Does have a mild earthly/nutty fragrance and is a light tan color. But once you whip it up the color is mostly gone. The scent is nice, I like it. I also have added difference fragrance oil to the body butter and it smell great even with the light natural scent of the shea butter.</li>
    <li> It smell like cocoa butter and it&#x27;s feel like grits in your hand, even after its melted</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter. We use a lot on grandson eczema. It stops the itching.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is pure and organic. Comes in a plastic bag. Used my owned plastic containers to store butter. I keep it in a very cool, dry, place. Smellgood company offers the best price for raw, organic, shea butter. I did not filter my shea butter when I received it. I just started using it in it&#x27;s purest form. Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and all natural, I&#x27;ll keep on buying it for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive to many chemicals and additives used in many commercial products.&lt;br /&gt;A good alternative to using topical steroids for skin conditions.</li>
    <li> Nice but its nor as smooth as I will like it.</li>
    <li> show the real picture b/c I didn&#x27;t get ivory.</li>
    <li> The shea butter was very smooth and I whipped it with a other items and it feels amazing on the skin. I will definitely be purchasing this item again</li>
    <li> Some other reviews had stated that they didn&#x27;t get the full measure of product, so right out of the box I weighed mine. With the bag, 1 lb exactly. Without the bag, I came up shy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is fine. Clean, smells good, etc. it&#x27;s just too bad that the seller is trying to pinch a penny by sending a little less than promised. My experience in business is that while this practice might make you a little more money in the short term, giving the customer more than they expect will pay huge dividends in the long term with repeat business and good reviews. Had I gotten a generous measure (or at least a full one) I would have become a repeat customer. As it is, despite the nice quality of the product, I will have to seek another supplier who will be sure to send the full measure of what I paid for.</li>
    <li> As described, works great in my lotion</li>
    <li> Great raw ivory Shea butter, I will be buying it again</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter.  The scent is mild and it&#x27;s so soft and creamy.  The color of the product was as pictured.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance make anything yet, I bought it to make my own skin products for myself and as gifts, and add to homemade soap.  I use it right out of the bag after a shower and it makes my skin so soft.  I have very dry skin and have eczema.  I haven&#x27;t used it in my hair yet but will soon.  The packaging was very simple, just a thick plactic bag with a label taped to it, but the product is luxurious. The label warns you that it is a raw and unrefined product and to pick out any debris.  I only found two tiny sections that were a little brown, I&#x27;m thinking it was from the nut shell when it was extracted.  I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> The shea butter arrived a bit slow, but not too bad. It came in a plastic bag within a box with instructions to clean it yourself because it is raw. It was the correct color and it smelled nutty/woody. I actually like the smell, but my significant other said it smelled like an old attic. I melted the butter at a temp of 165 (to kill any wild bacteria) and strained it through two layers of ultra fine nylon netting. There was very little debris, but there was some fine stuff. It was exactly like I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that the distributor pack it a bit better. It was left in my mailbox. It gets hot in there in the summer and the bag did not look sturdy enough to prevent a leak if it had melted. The plastic bag was in a box, where it was able to slide around and get banged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say that I am satisfied. I already have used it and made one batch of soap with some of it.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter it  is very easy to work with. i like that it is not hard like some of the other Shea butters. the smell is a mild aroma that is not over bearing in my products like some of the the others.will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to mix. It&#x27;s smells like raw shea butter but the smell can be removed with the adding of oils . Great buy will do again</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter ever, it&#x27;s soft and it has a nice cocoa smell to it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shea butter!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with this type of product, but I used it to make a lotion and it worked out just fine.</li>
    <li> Shea butter was really moisturizing for my hair</li>
    <li> Not the Shea Butter I expected.  I guess I normally order refined shea butter.</li>
    <li> Good but has a strong smell</li>
    <li> Not really impressed and has a stale smell to it that I cannot seem to cover with oils so basically can&#x27;t even use product unless I want to smell horrid</li>
