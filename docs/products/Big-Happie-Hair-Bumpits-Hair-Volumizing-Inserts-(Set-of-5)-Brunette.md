      <li>I received my order and very happy with them</li>
      <li>I am happy to say, that they are working out quite well (yayyyyy!).</li>
      <li>I received my order and very happy with them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved having my hair teased and \\&quot;bumped\\&quot;, but could never do it myself, so bumpits seemed like a no brainer for me!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;She seems perfectly happy with it...</li>
      <li>and we got some great up-does out of them..</li>
      <li>but once they are in the are great.</li>
      <li>this is great hair accesory because you didnt broke your hair , and you dont need nothing to hold it.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Great tool for the hair,I am thrilled to have purchased them!</li>
      <li>&amp; she really liked it!</li>
      <li>This is a good idea.</li>
      <li>However, I loved the look it gave my hair, that I can&#x27;t get with teasing and hairspray alone.</li>
      <li>good good</li>
      <li>The idea is great, but I got them to try and avoid any teasing to the top of my hair.</li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;m very glad I bought them.</li>
      <li>,it will stay in place quite nicely...</li>
      <li>its really great comes in handy and its worth every cent....</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t use hairspray) and fan it out over top of the bumpit.</li>
      <li>:-)    </li>
      <li>I just wish they stayed in place better</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re hair more or the teeth shows through.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s make most women&#x27;s hair look like Flo&#x27;s hairstyle.  </li>
      <li>Probably made for thicker, more coarser hair.</li>
      <li>but I make sure to spritz some on there to add thickness and hold.</li>
      <li>My daughter was getting married so we needed something to do with all the girls hair and these were perfect because they were different sizes so some were for the bangs and some were for the top of the head</li>
      <li>and, ahh, I cannot say how cool they are!</li>
      <li>I have gone out for the night with one of these things in with just a headband and some bobby pins to secure the hair over it and it stayed put.</li>
      <li>so since this product was so ridiculously cheap</li>
      <li>The Hollywoodsize is VERY big and is great for the partystyling and the smaller one is great for the every-day-look.</li>
      <li>and it is easy to use and pretty secure.</li>
      <li>But if you have thinner hair, it&#x27;s hard to make it perfect!</li>
      <li>I have super silky hair (sounds great but not really)</li>
      <li>Because my hair is wavy and light it clings to the teeth in the bumpit pretty well and the brown color of the bumpit blends in with my hair color.</li>
      <li>This product would have been better if I didn&#x27;t have a smaller size head and really fine hair.</li>
      <li>AND SHE WAS RIGHT...</li>
      <li>I didnt buy them right away, and went to the internet, to read peoples reviews on them..</li>
      <li>It takes some practice also to get them exactly right.</li>
      <li>but maybe that&#x27;s my lack of knowing how to use them exactly the right way and lack of patience to find out.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I have medium length wavy brown hair.</li>
      <li>Yeah, it was an investment, but i was willing to take that risk.in the hopes of achieving that look..</li>
      <li>If your have fine hair, it is a little more challenging to get the big hairdo on the cover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for half up styles and a small poof at the top of your head-</li>
      <li>it´s easy to make different styles with it.   </li>
      <li>Other than that concern, they are easy to use and fun.</li>
      <li>They give me even more volume than I already have and are fun for a departure from the everyday, although I wouldn&#x27;t want to fuss with them all the time.</li>
      <li>You really just have to know how to put them in...</li>
      <li>They just require a bit more teasing, some hairspray, and careful consideration when you pull the hair over the bumpit.    </li>
      <li>Not thin and silky, like mine.</li>
      <li>All you need to do is play around with them-some styles work well with them, and some styles not as much.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really do a lot of teasing to get it in</li>
      <li>price and shipping very well</li>
      <li>I think the idea is good if you hve thick hair.  </li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t the most comfortable to wear and I have VERY thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I was kinda expecting these to work like magic, so I did minimal teasing and fixed these in.  </li>
      <li>These work great with my long, thick, curly hair.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping these would allow me to have fabulous volume with little effort, but not the case.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use the small ones to put a bump in my bangs but it took a lot of hair product to use it.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a really great idea, but I have to back comb and do all the usual stuff, then there&#x27;s really no point to them.</li>
      <li>I&#x60;m addicted to it and just love it!</li>
      <li>Bump-its are not for people with curly, thin, or silky hair - MOST people!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a big difference from the large size one.</li>
      <li>Works like a charm on very straight long hair.</li>
      <li>I PURCHASED THIS BUMPIT FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER...</li>
      <li>Unless you do some teasing the bumpits won&#x27;t look natural.</li>
      <li>its a steal of a deal would definitely buy again and recommend it to any one who wants to style away....</li>
      <li>(possibly why I love them so much), but when I tried to put one in my sister&#x27;s thin hair they didn&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
      <li>They are kind of difficult to put in and get to stay</li>
      <li>The bumpit has little teeth (NOT painful) raised above it that grip the hair above and below it.    </li>
      <li>When I don&#x27;t use these, I guess I know my routine, so I know how long its going to take to section up my hair, create volume, get in place, and then tease it into a natural look.  </li>

<li> I have wanted to achieve this look for such a long time,so when i saw the infomercial on bumpits, i jumped with excitement...</li>
<li> Took less than 15 minutes to figure it out the first time and significantly less thereafter.</li>
<li> Like other consumers below me, I contemplated buying the bumpits before I actually bought them.</li>
<li> However, if your hair is very thin they are definitely going to show through, so consider your hair type before you buy these as seriously as you consider what kind of shampoo and conditioner are compatible with your hair type.</li>
<li> so I am not able to completely cover the bumpit .</li>
<li> unless you have tons of thick hair already this product will not work for you, it was a bummer:/ so this little hair creation is suposed to help us ladies who have fine maybe somewhat limp hair, but unless you already have super thick hair this product does not work, which kinda defeats its purpose entirely, you have to have alot of hair to cover the bumpit, it was a bummer, at least it wasnt expensive but still a bummer, the bumpit is a bummer:/</li>
<li> I already had the other bumpits but didn&#x27;t have the hollywood one</li>
<li> It feels really weird having this thing stuck on your head at first</li>
<li> many people said they didnt work, and they didnt stay in,and that the comb showed through, and they were crap etc etc etc...</li>
<li> You would think they wouldn&#x27;t stay in, but they have EXTREME staying power and can actually be a bit difficult to get out if you didn&#x27;t lay the hair over it properly.</li>
<li> It comes with a really big \\&quot;rock-star\\&quot; bumpit included and that thing has to be worn with a serious updo</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews,these things work, they just take a little practice,a little teasing, and a little hairspray...</li>
<li> My hair is long and thick</li>
<li> so stuck it tangles your teased hair into a messy knot around the teeth and takes forever getting it untangled.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t work as well with thin hair.</li>
<li> The teeth show through, they are hard and hurt your head</li>
<li> then you take the hair from the front, tease it a bit at the base, then carefully cascade it towards the back ,covering the bumpit..</li>
<li> They&#x27;re simple to use-lift the hair, give a little tease at the base of your hair</li>
<li> and it was uncomfortable, but not unbearable.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical of this product because it seems so absurd, like a prosthetic for your hair, but I like that retro look</li>

    <li> I was really hoping these would allow me to have fabulous volume with little effort, but not the case.  When I don&#x27;t use these, I guess I know my routine, so I know how long its going to take to section up my hair, create volume, get in place, and then tease it into a natural look.  I was kinda expecting these to work like magic, so I did minimal teasing and fixed these in.  I have super silky hair (sounds great but not really) so these just wouldn&#x27;t stay in.  In when I used kirby grips they ended up crooked with teeth showing within 2 minutes.  They&#x27;re a really great idea, but I have to back comb and do all the usual stuff, then there&#x27;s really no point to them.</li>
    <li> This is a good idea. But if you have thinner hair, it&#x27;s hard to make it perfect! You have to tease you&#x27;re hair more or the teeth shows through. Probably made for thicker, more coarser hair. Not thin and silky, like mine.</li>
    <li> Well it does work but the teeth show thru and try getting it out of your hair when your done!  It gedts so stuck it tangles your teased hair into a messy knot around the teeth and takes forever getting it untangled.</li>
    <li> I think the idea is good if you hve thick hair.  I do not so I am not able to completely cover the bumpit .</li>
    <li> this is great hair accesory because you didnt broke your hair , and you dont need nothing to hold it. and you will look fashion.  price and shipping very well</li>
    <li> The idea is great, but I got them to try and avoid any teasing to the top of my hair. Unless you do some teasing the bumpits won&#x27;t look natural. It takes some practice also to get them exactly right.</li>
    <li> Like other consumers below me, I contemplated buying the bumpits before I actually bought them. I found them for $5 at a CVS Pharmacy, and decided to go for it. I&#x27;ve always loved having my hair teased and \\&quot;bumped\\&quot;, but could never do it myself, so bumpits seemed like a no brainer for me! The bumpit has little teeth (NOT painful) raised above it that grip the hair above and below it.    In fact, I&#x27;m very glad I bought them. They&#x27;re simple to use-lift the hair, give a little tease at the base of your hair (I don&#x27;t use hairspray) and fan it out over top of the bumpit. You would think they wouldn&#x27;t stay in, but they have EXTREME staying power and can actually be a bit difficult to get out if you didn&#x27;t lay the hair over it properly. It&#x27;s great for half up styles and a small poof at the top of your head- I&#x27;m not a fan of using them at the crown of your head. All you need to do is play around with them-some styles work well with them, and some styles not as much.    The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t work as well with thin hair. My hair is long and thick (possibly why I love them so much), but when I tried to put one in my sister&#x27;s thin hair they didn&#x27;t hold as well. They just require a bit more teasing, some hairspray, and careful consideration when you pull the hair over the bumpit.    All in all, I would definitely recommend the bumpits! I was DEVASTATED when I forgot to pack mine when studying abroad in Italy for 6 weeks!</li>
    <li> I have wanted to achieve this look for such a long time,so when i saw the infomercial on bumpits, i jumped with excitement...I didnt buy them right away, and went to the internet, to read peoples reviews on them..many people said they didnt work, and they didnt stay in,and that the comb showed through, and they were crap etc etc etc...so then I thought to myself, why not give it a try? Yeah, it was an investment, but i was willing to take that risk.in the hopes of achieving that look..so I went to the mall and bought them.  I am happy to say, that they are working out quite well (yayyyyy!). You really just have to know how to put them in...one tiny tease on the bottom and one spritz where you insert the bumpit,it will stay in place quite nicely...then you take the hair from the front, tease it a bit at the base, then carefully cascade it towards the back ,covering the bumpit..(i even tried putting 2 bumpits together,one behind the other, to give an even better volume effect)...and, ahh, I cannot say how cool they are! Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews,these things work, they just take a little practice,a little teasing, and a little hairspray...:-)    Great tool for the hair,I am thrilled to have purchased them!</li>
    <li> Bump-its are not for people with curly, thin, or silky hair - MOST people!  The teeth show through, they are hard and hurt your head and they take A LOT of time to get in.  Why can&#x27;t we come up with a design that is made from material and doesn&#x27;t show through?  I&#x27;m returning mine ASAP!!!</li>
    <li> Bump It&#x27;s make most women&#x27;s hair look like Flo&#x27;s hairstyle.  She is the Progressive Insurance commercial saleswoman.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm on very straight long hair. Took less than 15 minutes to figure it out the first time and significantly less thereafter.</li>
    <li> If your have fine hair, it is a little more challenging to get the big hairdo on the cover. Besides, they can be a bit unconfortable on your scalp. I&#x27;d rather use something softer.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for a friend...&lt;br /&gt;She seems perfectly happy with it...&lt;br /&gt;Makes me jealous that my hair isn&#x27;t longer....</li>
    <li> If you like volume like me, the bumpit is the thing for you!  I save lots of time in front of the mirror since i started to use it and it´s easy to make different styles with it.   The Hollywoodsize is VERY big and is great for the partystyling and the smaller one is great for the every-day-look. I&#x60;m addicted to it and just love it!</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I have medium length wavy brown hair. Because my hair is wavy and light it clings to the teeth in the bumpit pretty well and the brown color of the bumpit blends in with my hair color. I was skeptical of this product because it seems so absurd, like a prosthetic for your hair, but I like that retro look and it is easy to use and pretty secure. I have gone out for the night with one of these things in with just a headband and some bobby pins to secure the hair over it and it stayed put. It feels really weird having this thing stuck on your head at first but you get used to it; it feels like it is going to fall out but it stays on there. I don&#x27;t really do a lot of teasing to get it in but I could see where someone with thinner hair on their crown may have to. Also, I don&#x27;t go all 80&#x27;s with the hairspray but I make sure to spritz some on there to add thickness and hold. You can see the teeth if you get all up on it, but no one is going to do that and if they do, your biggest concern is not that they saw your bumpit. I showed it to my friend with longer blond hair and she bought one and likes it as well. It comes with a really big \\&quot;rock-star\\&quot; bumpit included and that thing has to be worn with a serious updo otherwise you look like a total alien-head.</li>
    <li> They are kind of difficult to put in and get to stay but once they are in the are great.</li>
    <li> its really great comes in handy and its worth every cent....its a steal of a deal would definitely buy again and recommend it to any one who wants to style away....</li>
    <li> I already had the other bumpits but didn&#x27;t have the hollywood one so since this product was so ridiculously cheap I just ordered this one and I like the hollywood one. It&#x27;s a big difference from the large size one. I just wish they stayed in place better but maybe that&#x27;s my lack of knowing how to use them exactly the right way and lack of patience to find out. lol</li>
    <li> These work great with my long, thick, curly hair. They give me even more volume than I already have and are fun for a departure from the everyday, although I wouldn&#x27;t want to fuss with them all the time. However, if your hair is very thin they are definitely going to show through, so consider your hair type before you buy these as seriously as you consider what kind of shampoo and conditioner are compatible with your hair type. Other than that concern, they are easy to use and fun.</li>
    <li> I received my order and very happy with them I received my order and very happy with them good good</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t the most comfortable to wear and I have VERY thick hair.  I could still feel the teeth poking my head after a while and it was uncomfortable, but not unbearable.  However, I loved the look it gave my hair, that I can&#x27;t get with teasing and hairspray alone.</li>
    <li> unless you have tons of thick hair already this product will not work for you, it was a bummer:/ so this little hair creation is suposed to help us ladies who have fine maybe somewhat limp hair, but unless you already have super thick hair this product does not work, which kinda defeats its purpose entirely, you have to have alot of hair to cover the bumpit, it was a bummer, at least it wasnt expensive but still a bummer, the bumpit is a bummer:/</li>
    <li> My daughter was getting married so we needed something to do with all the girls hair and these were perfect because they were different sizes so some were for the bangs and some were for the top of the head and we got some great up-does out of them..</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS BUMPIT FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER...SHE SAID &amp;#34;IT FALLS OUT&amp;#34;!  SO I TRIED TO PUT IT IN HER HAIR...AND SHE WAS RIGHT...AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR ...IT FELL OUT!</li>
    <li> Purchase as a gift &amp; she really liked it!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like, gave to a friend..</li>
    <li> This product would have been better if I didn&#x27;t have a smaller size head and really fine hair. I was able to use the small ones to put a bump in my bangs but it took a lot of hair product to use it.</li>
