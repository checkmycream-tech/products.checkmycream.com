      <li>After using this soap at my friend&#x27;s house 3 years ago, I really liked how it easily came off from the body, washing in the shower and loved the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazing product :)</li>

      <li>I love, love, love Castile soap.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve switched to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s just recently and are very happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>Including laundry soap, cleaning practically every surface in my home, and I love the Almond scent.  </li>
      <li>I really do love this stuff.</li>
      <li>, it has interesting reading material all over it in case you have nothing else to read ...</li>
      <li>Otherwise I love the soap and the smell.</li>
      <li>Much better alternative than the anti-bacterial hand soaps that are sold in the supermarket since it doesn&#x27;t help to breed tougher bacteria.</li>
      <li>no nasty chemicals!</li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>I use it every day as a mild body soap, and we always take it camping for bodies and for dishes because it&#x27;s nice to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are fantastic and this -- my favorite of all their soaps -- is no exception.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good soap, but know what you&#x27;re really paying.</li>
      <li>Also my hair is kind of wavy but more on the frizzy side between curly and straight</li>
      <li>You also may not want to transfer this soap into a soap dispenser as it can easy get solidified and clogs the pump.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I use it as a body wash, along with my shampoo once a month to get super clean hair, mix together with alcohol, water, ammonia&lt;br /&gt; to make my own spray.</li>
      <li>We even use it on our children&#x27;s hair instead of traditional shampoo and it works beautifully (though</li>
      <li>smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>but I can only imagine that it will be just as great.</li>
      <li>My husband can&#x27;t use the commercially available soap or shampoo.  </li>
      <li>For anyone who uses Bronner&#x27;s as a primary soap staple, this gallon jug is the way to go.</li>
      <li>soaps\\&quot; that you&#x27;re familiar with in the pump bottles.  </li>
      <li>Dr Dronner&#x27;s products are high-quality and the gallon size package is an easy and economical way to order this product.</li>
      <li>I use it with vinegar to clean sink, tubs and toilets.</li>
      <li>clean hair</li>
      <li>Diluted in another bottle I wash my dishes, I clean my house with it (peppermint)</li>
      <li>I dilute it 2:1 in an old Dial foaming soap pump and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>The almond scent is light and fresh.</li>
      <li>The gallon should last me for a while, and it smells sooooooo good.</li>
      <li>These are real and simple liquid soaps, and very effective.  </li>
      <li>This one gallon lasted me several months because it can be diluted with water and clean just as effectively.</li>
      <li>and before it would never look good unless I blew it dry and straightened it.</li>
      <li>Cant say enough how much i love dr bronners liquid soap!</li>
      <li>I buy as much as I can in the huge gallon bottles.</li>
      <li>While I do still think that $50 is a bit high for a gallon of soap, it&#x27;s the most economical way I&#x27;ve found to purchase this item, and it is certainly a case of \\&quot;getting what you pay for.\\</li>
      <li>I feel squeaky clean but it rinses well with no residue and my skin has been super soft.</li>
      <li>That turned out to be a good idea because it even worked in the foam pump bottle with a little water and doctoring of consistency.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know the name, they charged shipping (couldn&#x27;t get it from an Amazon Gold source), but it was still a better deal than at my local store.  </li>
      <li>I actually like the Peppermint soap better than the Almond, but, the wife doesn&#x27;t like the Peppermint, so we got Almond.</li>
      <li>got the most recent gallon bottle from \\&quot;Vitamin Grocer.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I had to use a hot water on the soap dispenser once/week.</li>
      <li>Bronners soap are excellent, I have used this for years, I delute some in a bottle and keep it in the bathroom for hand washing and in the shower instead of hard soap, it smells fantastic and washes off easily, nothing negative about this at all.</li>
      <li>Combine this with baking soda for a super scrub and you will be able to clean up any mess!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I ever use any other kind of soap.</li>
      <li>This soap smells delicious and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like many other harsh antibacterial hand soaps and such.</li>
      <li>when I tried it on mine, the result wasn&#x27;t as good -- it&#x27;ll do in a pinch, but it&#x27;s not going to replace my usual product anytime soon).  </li>
      <li>It lasts me for more than a year, and over time the savings in cost and packaging waste are extraordinary.</li>
      <li>but I just use my regular conditioner and its fine.</li>
      <li>I originally tried other brands of almond castile soap that appeared slightly cheaper, but found that they were sticky or overly drying and didn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I use this as our body wash (and have for about four years) and it works very well.</li>
      <li>If you figure it at 30 cents an ounce, that would work out to $38.40 for the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>Nothing against the soap, but the listing says this is 27 cents per ounce, which is way lower than the real price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nontoxic, gentle, and smells like cookies.  </li>
      <li>You really have to know them, though.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap for many years, and I have no adverse reaction to it in any way--unlike other soaps.</li>
      <li>I heard some people used different rinses and special conditioners</li>
      <li>The trade off is well worth the lack of chemicals found in more common brands of soaps.</li>
      <li>My only issue is I noticed it was watery, but it also super concentrated.</li>
      <li>Very strange company,very strange labels, very strange marketing and advertising (virtually none) but GREAT SOAP.  </li>
      <li>I had heard many things over the years about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps on different blogs and such but was always a litle hesitant to try it because I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t always respond well to new products.</li>
      <li>When we lived in TX, we used it on our hair as well, but now that we live in NC, I&#x27;ve had to switch to shampoo to manage the increased humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this soap, no overwhelming scent or harmful chemicals.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Background: After using this soap at my friend&#x27;s house 3 years ago, I really liked how it easily came off from the body, washing in the shower and loved the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: I bought this gallon size to save some $$$. I am a single user and lasted for about 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: One complaint is that it leaves the brown color on the shower curtain after using it for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;  You also may not want to transfer this soap into a soap dispenser as it can easy get solidified and clogs the pump.&lt;br /&gt;  I had to use a hot water on the soap dispenser once/week. You should consider using a simple container with a hole&lt;br /&gt;  on a cap.</li>
    <li> healthy skin, soft hair, great for anything! no harsh chemicals. smells fantastic. fair trade. organic. what are you waiting for?!?</li>
    <li> I really do love this stuff. I got it for cleaning around the house, hand washing, body wash and dish washing. It&#x27;s the only natural green soap I could find that DIDN&#x27;T add any toxic additives in the soap... My only issue is I noticed it was watery, but it also super concentrated. Otherwise I love the soap and the smell.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love Castile soap. Almond, especially. I added it to the partially used pump bottles around the house because I couldn&#x27;t wait for them to empty or throw out perfectly adequate soap. That turned out to be a good idea because it even worked in the foam pump bottle with a little water and doctoring of consistency.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve switched to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s just recently and are very happy with the product.  I originally tried other brands of almond castile soap that appeared slightly cheaper, but found that they were sticky or overly drying and didn&#x27;t smell as pleasant as the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand.  While I do still think that $50 is a bit high for a gallon of soap, it&#x27;s the most economical way I&#x27;ve found to purchase this item, and it is certainly a case of \\&quot;getting what you pay for.\\&quot;  We even use it on our children&#x27;s hair instead of traditional shampoo and it works beautifully (though when I tried it on mine, the result wasn&#x27;t as good -- it&#x27;ll do in a pinch, but it&#x27;s not going to replace my usual product anytime soon).  It&#x27;s nontoxic, gentle, and smells like cookies.  Can&#x27;t see a downside to that!</li>
    <li> Love this soap, no overwhelming scent or harmful chemicals.  Some people have commented negatively about how liquid this soap is and not being able to use it in a squirt dispenser.  I use foam pump dispenser (store brand and dial) and it works great.  We do drip water in the dispenser after each use which prevents it from getting clogged.  The trade off is well worth the lack of chemicals found in more common brands of soaps.</li>
    <li> I love this soap it works great whether your using it in the shower or cleaning with it. The almond is the best smelling in my opinion. The peppermint one works great on killing ants too.</li>
    <li> Very strange company,very strange labels, very strange marketing and advertising (virtually none) but GREAT SOAP.  I have been using this stuff for years and have been impressed from the first time I used it. The scent, the lather, and the feel when done are second to none.</li>
    <li> Great as a laundry detergent and all over body, face and hair wash. The almond scent is light and fresh.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are fantastic and this -- my favorite of all their soaps -- is no exception. The gallon should last me for a while, and it smells sooooooo good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  It works great for everything from a peppermint foot bath to shampoo to cleaning my floors.  It is wonderful and safe and I am hooked ;-)</li>
    <li> This is a great all purpose liquid soap that gets you clean, it&#x27;s concentrated and even though it smells nice the scent doesn&#x27;t overpower or linger leaving you with a migraine like a visit to a Yankee candle shop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  You really have to know them, though.  They aren&#x27;t the creamy, chemicalized so-called \\&quot;liquid soaps\\&quot; that you&#x27;re familiar with in the pump bottles.  These are real and simple liquid soaps, and very effective.  I use it every day as a mild body soap, and we always take it camping for bodies and for dishes because it&#x27;s nice to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the most recent gallon bottle from \\&quot;Vitamin Grocer.\\&quot;  Didn&#x27;t know the name, they charged shipping (couldn&#x27;t get it from an Amazon Gold source), but it was still a better deal than at my local store.  To my surprise it came in just a couple of days!  Excellent service from Vitamin Grocer.</li>
    <li> Much better alternative than the anti-bacterial hand soaps that are sold in the supermarket since it doesn&#x27;t help to breed tougher bacteria. Can be diluted with water as desired, since this soap is quite concentrated. I dilute it about two parts water and one part soap, and find that works out well for washing hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap for many years, and I have no adverse reaction to it in any way--unlike other soaps. Unfortunately, it is very expensive, and that&#x27;s even with me diluting it.</li>
    <li> I buy as much as I can in the huge gallon bottles. I started out only using as soap - man what a waste. It is now my dish washing liquid, laundry detergent, shampoo, and all purpose cleaner.</li>
    <li> Cant say enough how much i love dr bronners liquid soap! I use it for hand soap, laundry detergent body wash and just about everything!</li>
    <li> For all Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps... There are endless uses for this soap. I brush my teeth with it, wash my body and hair, grind up the bar soap and use it with borax, washing soda and baking soda for laundry detergent, wash my car, wash my dog, replace toxic hand soap with this stuff. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I like having a lot of this on hand, pour it in a refillable pump container and it foams up nicely with a poof as body wash.  Use it in a refillable suds pump for handwash (ratio abou 1:5)...cleaning and as a backup for washing dishes....nice smell</li>
    <li> I actually like the Peppermint soap better than the Almond, but, the wife doesn&#x27;t like the Peppermint, so we got Almond.</li>
    <li> Sure, I change up the scents, but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is ALL YOU NEED! Diluted in a 32oz bottle (1/2 cup of soap &amp; 2 tbs carragean gum) it&#x27;s my shampoo and body wash! No gum? Put it in a spray bottle (nice aluminum ones on Amazon), keep it hooked on the shower caddy and SPRAY your shampoo and body wash on! Diluted in another bottle I wash my dishes, I clean my house with it (peppermint), I do my laundry with it (lavendar) and with the Sals Suds (pine) I mop my floors and clean glass better than Windex!!! NO JOKE! It really is magic! :D</li>
    <li> I use this as shower soap .  It last me six months, smells the best and does not burn like the peppermint .</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s! I use it as a body wash, along with my shampoo once a month to get super clean hair, mix together with alcohol, water, ammonia&lt;br /&gt; to make my own spray.</li>
    <li> I use this soap for everything! Including laundry soap, cleaning practically every surface in my home, and I love the Almond scent.  Combine this with baking soda for a super scrub and you will be able to clean up any mess!</li>
    <li> This product is great I have used it before as a base for all soaps needed in our home. Delivery was slow but well wrapped and secure in its package so no leaks or damage to the bottle. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have MCS (be very glad if you don&#x27;t know what that is...) Very happy with it, but kids say need a conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I use instead of shampoo as well as body wash. clean hair no nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> My husband can&#x27;t use the commercially available soap or shampoo.  Uses this instead and his dermatitis problems have disappeared.  Stores usually don&#x27;t carry large size.</li>
    <li> I had heard many things over the years about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps on different blogs and such but was always a litle hesitant to try it because I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t always respond well to new products. Also, I always thought that the only shampoo that would work well was an expensive salon brand. I couldn&#x27;t argue with all the 5-star reviews so I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try and I&#x27;m so glad that I did! I use it as a face wash, body wash and a shampoo and my skin and hair has never looked better! I dilute it 2:1 in an old Dial foaming soap pump and it is amazing. So much lather and the almond smell is great. I feel squeaky clean but it rinses well with no residue and my skin has been super soft. I barely have to even use lotion after although there is no greasiness. Also my hair is kind of wavy but more on the frizzy side between curly and straight and before it would never look good unless I blew it dry and straightened it. Now after using this, I can actually let my hair air dry and it looks great! I heard some people used different rinses and special conditioners but I just use my regular conditioner and its fine. My hair is shiny and has a ton of volume. I love this stuff!! Try it, you will be pleasantly surprised. I just ordered a gallon of both the almond and peppermint. Haven&#x27;t used it for cleaning the house yet but I can only imagine that it will be just as great. Amazing product :)</li>
    <li> This soap smells delicious and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like many other harsh antibacterial hand soaps and such. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is renowned for being multifunctional and it truly is in my home. I use it for hand and body wash for my entire family, it&#x27;s mild enough to add to my toddler&#x27;s bath water; and I also use it for household cleaning like bathrooms and floors. This one gallon lasted me several months because it can be diluted with water and clean just as effectively. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Nothing against the soap, but the listing says this is 27 cents per ounce, which is way lower than the real price. If you figure it at 30 cents an ounce, that would work out to $38.40 for the whole bottle. It&#x27;s a good soap, but know what you&#x27;re really paying.</li>
    <li> Amazingly great!  Use it on everything from my body to my dishes!</li>
    <li> Dr Dronner&#x27;s products are high-quality and the gallon size package is an easy and economical way to order this product.</li>
    <li> For anyone who uses Bronner&#x27;s as a primary soap staple, this gallon jug is the way to go. It lasts me for more than a year, and over time the savings in cost and packaging waste are extraordinary.</li>
    <li> this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I ever use any other kind of soap. This is the best. I like the bar soap better but I feel the liquid last longer. Maybe I should get both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it has interesting reading material all over it in case you have nothing else to read ...</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this as our body wash (and have for about four years) and it works very well. The scent is pleasant and it cleans well. We&#x27;ve kept using it over other body washes because it leaves 0% residue on our skin, even after a quick rinsing. When we lived in TX, we used it on our hair as well, but now that we live in NC, I&#x27;ve had to switch to shampoo to manage the increased humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, you might want to try a small amount before you use it. It dries my skin out, which works for my oily skin, but someone with dry skin might find it too much.</li>
    <li> I love this and recommend it!  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Grew up using the peppermint version of this. Love this scent. I use it with vinegar to clean sink, tubs and toilets. Does not have SLS. Cleans well and not drying. Bought this to refill the 32oz bottles I was buying frequently.</li>
    <li> Castile Liquid Soap-Almond Hemp Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, all varieties of Dr.Bronners soap are excellent, I have used this for years, I delute some in a bottle and keep it in the bathroom for hand washing and in the shower instead of hard soap, it smells fantastic and washes off easily, nothing negative about this at all.</li>
