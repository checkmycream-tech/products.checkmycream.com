      <li>works great, i think its as good as the professional models.</li>
      <li>They are very smooth and does not grab the hair like cheaper clippers.  </li>
      <li>price is okay</li>
      <li>&quot; So glad I bought this kit for $8</li>
      <li>BUT MUCH MORE MONEY</li>
      <li>These are great for the Fast Feed model.</li>
      <li>Hopefully these will prove more durable.</li>
      <li>I would buy them again since I lose the all the time.. satisfied...</li>
      <li>Worked great and ft my older oster clipper</li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give these a 5 star rating is because they don&#x27;t quite fit my clippers perfectly.</li>
      <li>More information about the models it fits should entered into the description, it doesn&#x27;t fit the clippers, so I will have to return them.</li>
      <li>There are more to choose from than the original ones which kept falling off the clippers.</li>
      <li>Holds better than the original clippers and comes with a #0</li>
      <li>Comes with more blades that the clipper came with originally.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;re not as brittle and break as easily...</li>
      <li>Perfect fit for my Oster Professional Fast Feed.  </li>
      <li>They work fine on my Oster Fast-Feed clippers.  </li>
      <li>Great selection of different lengths.</li>
      <li>The fit and quality are also improved.  </li>
      <li>the cheap price, it&#x27;s an acceptable problem.</li>
      <li>They were cheap, but they kept vibrating off.  </li>
      <li>These combs fit my Oster razor, 76023-510 just as well as the originals did.</li>
      <li>At this price he felt like he was getting professional clippers and is by far the best purchase he has ever made.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just make sure you have the right clippers before you buy it.</li>
      <li>This is what should come with the original trimmer.</li>
      <li>The original combs that came with the Oster Fast-Feed broke.  </li>
      <li>Worth every cent!</li>
      <li>I also received additional sizes that weren&#x27;t provided with my original purchase.  </li>
      <li>At least not as perfectly as the manufacturer&#x27;s version.</li>
      <li>The wide range of sizes makes it easy to give a good cut.  </li>
      <li>These fit EXACTLY like the guides that originally came with the product.</li>
      <li>I wear my hair short, so the attachments that came with the clippers were fine, but I would still recommend buying a set of attachments that will go you more choices.  </li>
      <li>They fit on my clippers very well.</li>
      <li>Our old clippers may have more decades in them yet.</li>
      <li>They work well enough, but they slide off even more than the original guards do.</li>
      <li>Very resonably priced replacement for the original guides that came with my Oster Fastfeed Clippers.  </li>
      <li>This set is made from plastic that is just the right balance of rigid and flexible.  </li>
      <li>I got this set along with my Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed clipper set and they fit just fine.</li>
      <li>They sharpen just fine and work well, but needed new attachments.  </li>
      <li>Fit my Oster Fast Feed Clippers very well.</li>
      <li>These have a bit more flex making them mount tighter, quieter and appear as if they will last longer.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>ONLY GAVE 4 STARS BECAUSE THERE ARE BETTER ONES ON THE MARKET</li>
      <li>I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....</li>
      <li>The longest one was even longer than how he wanted his hair, so there are many different style possibilities here.</li>
      <li>These attachments don&#x27;t grip my Oster Classic adequately and wiggle and fall off.</li>
      <li>I recently decided I was talented enough to cut his hair</li>
      <li>These Oster clippers are extremely quiet and cut through my hair so easily.  </li>
      <li>Now i just need to know how to calm my cat down. :-)</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t look cheap neither the material is plastic as advertised, any problem in the future gonna report ASAP!</li>
      <li>These combs will fit the smaller of the two cutters that come with the Oster 76 clipper.</li>
      <li>To my pleasure, they work very well.  </li>
      <li>Fits perfectly on my fast feed clippers.</li>
      <li>They complement the few that come with the clippers nicely.</li>
      <li>The original guides were starting to rattle and fall off while using the clippers, which isn&#x27;t very reassuring.  </li>
      <li>It is rigid enough to stay and place and not bend when in use, but flexible enough so that the slide on fitting does not crack and break off like</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these as replacement guides.  </li>
      <li>These seem a little more resistant to cracking (or it could just be they are 15 yrs newer).</li>
      <li>They are a little more flexible than the rigid and somewhat brittle ones that Oster also sells as replacements.  </li>
      <li>What I think has normally already been said.</li>
      <li>Bought these as an add on to an Oster Fast Feed and they have a very tight fit.  </li>
      <li>Nice that it came with the extra small guard also.</li>
      <li>only fits certain oater blades and does not lock in place.</li>
      <li>The clippers were so loud.  </li>
      <li>His clipper just says \\&quot;Oster Adjustable Professional</li>
      <li>However, the many negative reviews about this product prompted me.</li>
      <li>Why did I waste my money on this if it doesn&#x27;t fit as it should?</li>

</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you&#x27;re planning on cutting your hair low, beware the 1 tends to slip off the clipper.  That&#x27;s the only complaint, but it&#x27;s significant if you&#x27;re particular about your hair height.  Other than that, they work well.</li>
    <li> Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment. I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....in the garbage can!</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading. It shows this item on the side with other non-included items in the center, e.g. hair clipper. It is only a few plastics (the \\&quot;Combs\\&quot;). Shame on me that I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to this dishonest sales trick. Not worth the $19.99 at all! I returned the junk immediately.</li>
    <li> I started cutting my hair at home about 2 years ago.  I cut my hair every week and keep it short &amp; tight.  This is the 3rd different brand I&#x27;ve used.  My last pair of clippers were Wahl and I was extremely disappointed.  The clippers were so loud.  These Oster clippers are extremely quiet and cut through my hair so easily.  I wear my hair short, so the attachments that came with the clippers were fine, but I would still recommend buying a set of attachments that will go you more choices.  If you are looking to cut hair at home, I would definitely recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> The combs were what I wanted and fit my clippers, but one of them was broken.</li>
    <li> Powerful and very silent, Oster clippers last forever. My brother bougth his back in 1992, that&#x27;s right 18 years ago, and the clipper still works perfectly. Great value and quality for under 50 dollars, what else do you want.</li>
    <li> I HAVE OWNED THESE CLIPPERS NOW FOR TWO MONTHS AND THEY ARE GREAT. THEY DONT HEAT ON YOU AND THEY CUT MY HAIR EVENLY GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. ONLY GAVE 4 STARS BECAUSE THERE ARE BETTER ONES ON THE MARKET BUT MUCH MORE MONEY THOUGH SO I&#x27;M HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE THEY DO YOU WHAT I NEED THEM TO DO AND I ONLY USE THEM ON MY HEAD. SHIPPING WAS GOOD VERY GOOD BUY</li>
    <li> They work fine on my Oster Fast-Feed clippers.  The original combs that came with the Oster Fast-Feed broke.  Hopefully these will prove more durable.</li>
    <li> works great, i think its as good as the professional models. i would buy one again</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re OK, not great construction quality and slip off my Oster trimmer from time to time, but for the price it&#x27;s nothing to complain too much about.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers for my husband and here is what he has to say about this item.  They are very smooth and does not grab the hair like cheaper clippers.  He says they cut the hair cutting time in half and are very fast.  At this price he felt like he was getting professional clippers and is by far the best purchase he has ever made.&lt;br /&gt;You get what cha pay for in his words.</li>
    <li> Flimsy. It feels like these won&#x27;t hold up to even the occasional use that we need them for.</li>
    <li> Fit my oster fast feed perfectly!</li>
    <li> only fits certain oater blades and does not lock in place. price is okay but without lock guide moves around a lot</li>
    <li> For the price, this product meets the need.  I think this material is a little softer than the original guides that came with the clipper so I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;re not as brittle and break as easily...only time and use will tell. (I&#x27;ve only had it for a week)</li>
    <li> Not Oster Brand.&lt;br /&gt;Fit the clippers too tight. The combs tend to vibrate off the blades about a 1/16&amp;#34; once you turn on the clippers.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my Oster Professional Fast Feed.  Holds better than the original clippers and comes with a #0</li>
    <li> Bought these as an add on to an Oster Fast Feed and they have a very tight fit.  They complement the few that come with the clippers nicely.</li>
    <li> Fit my Oster Fast Feed Clippers very well.</li>
    <li> These are great for the Fast Feed model. Does not slip off like the ones that came with the clippers</li>
    <li> The original attachments that came with my Oster were breaking and I had to tape them on every time I used it (very annoying).  I purchased a cheap plastic set of attachments at Harbor Freight, but these were so cheap they would bend when I went to cut my hair, so they were basically worthless.  This set is made from plastic that is just the right balance of rigid and flexible.  It is rigid enough to stay and place and not bend when in use, but flexible enough so that the slide on fitting does not crack and break off like the  originals did. I highly recommend these as replacement guides.  Also, it came with two blending attachments which I use extensively.  One cuts shorter than the original one that I have, and I use that around my ears, works great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> Fits my fast feed clippers perfectly, has a good variety of attachements.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;Although, I am sure this product is a good one.  More information about the models it fits should entered into the description, it doesn&#x27;t fit the clippers, so I will have to return them.</li>
    <li> These were to small for my Oster.  Maybe I can find another trimmer they&#x27;ll fit on, to much trouble to return.</li>
    <li> Works great. Fits perfectly on my fast feed clippers.</li>
    <li> good variety of sizes....a bit expensive though</li>
    <li> These clips just slide onto the clipper and does not have any attachment piece  the clips just fall off of the buzzer.. these were a bad buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Comes with more blades that the clipper came with originally. Nice that it came with the extra small guard also.</li>
    <li> These fit my Oster Fast Feed perfectly and are an improvement over the set that came with the clipper.  They are a little more flexible than the rigid and somewhat brittle ones that Oster also sells as replacements.  The rigid ones are prone to cracking and rattling (before cracking).  These have a bit more flex making them mount tighter, quieter and appear as if they will last longer.  The only drawback to these is that they don&#x27;t come with the angled L/R taper guides.  wish I found them before going through 3 sets of the old ones.</li>
    <li> I got this set along with my Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed clipper set and they fit just fine. They don&#x27;t slip like other reviewers said. My wife and I (she cuts my hair) are very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Very resonably priced replacement for the original guides that came with my Oster Fastfeed Clippers.  The fit and quality are also improved.  I also received additional sizes that weren&#x27;t provided with my original purchase.  They almost snap into place based on the different design.  The original guides were starting to rattle and fall off while using the clippers, which isn&#x27;t very reassuring.  This solves that problem.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am another victim of the tricky product picture and fake reviews that are probably written by people from that company! There are only plastics. I should read the item feature carefully before. And I wish no more people be misled by the picture and those useless reviews.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my clippers..... oster rockers... I would buy them again since I lose the all the time.. satisfied...</li>
    <li> They fit on my clippers very well. There are more to choose from than the original ones which kept falling off the clippers.</li>
    <li> These arrived very fast and were as described, although they did not fit my Oster A5 Golden clippers:(</li>
    <li> I actually made the mistake of purchasing this set for the Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper.  It is completely incompatible for that model of clipper.</li>
    <li> Great selection of different lengths.</li>
    <li> We have a decades old Oster clippers that we inherited from my in-laws.  They sharpen just fine and work well, but needed new attachments.  The sets that Oster suggested were very limited in the sizes they offered, so I took a chance on these because they looked like they should work.  To my pleasure, they work very well.  The wide range of sizes makes it easy to give a good cut.  They are sturdy enough to last quite some time with proper care.  Our old clippers may have more decades in them yet.</li>
    <li> What a complete waist of money.......the guards DO NOT stay on. As the clippers vibrate the guards slide off and........you can imagine the result. Tried all of them and all of them do the same thing.</li>
    <li> works great no problems</li>
    <li> Instead of the amount of reviews saying that this comb are no good,  I&#x27;ve used then a couple of times and I don&#x27;t see any problem,  they don&#x27;t look cheap neither the material is plastic as advertised, any problem in the future gonna report ASAP!</li>
    <li> Worked great and ft my older oster clipper</li>
    <li> This works perfectly with the Oster Professional 76926.  I will recommend this product to all my friends.  Now i just need to know how to calm my cat down. :-)</li>
    <li> They are lose and continually fall off of clippers. I would not recommend these. Oster needs to rework the configuration for these.</li>
    <li> These work perfect for the Oster Fast Feed that I just bought.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my buzzer.  Nice that it shows how each cuts in inches.</li>
    <li> these get loose after a while, but I can&#x27;t complain about the price to replace them.</li>
    <li> It fits the Oster 76 clipper. These combs will fit the smaller of the two cutters that come with the Oster 76 clipper.</li>
    <li> Guards slide off as you are cutting. Makes cutting very difficult because they won&#x27;t stay in place. Was a waste of $8.</li>
    <li> I saw some reviews that said these popped off the blades. The combs I received have not had any problems at all and have functioned as I expected.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my Oster clippers.  I had several broken combs, broken where they attach to the clipper.  These seem a little more resistant to cracking (or it could just be they are 15 yrs newer).</li>
    <li> These combs fit my Oster razor, 76023-510 just as well as the originals did.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give these a 5 star rating is because they don&#x27;t quite fit my clippers perfectly. At least not as perfectly as the manufacturer&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> I normally do not write Amazon reviews. What I think has normally already been said. However, the many negative reviews about this product prompted me. My husband has an Oster clipper he bought in 1999 (yes, he still has the receipt with the item, lol). I recently decided I was talented enough to cut his hair (it took me like a year to convince him). We used the longest guide he already owned, but it basically gave him a buzzcut (not my fault, I did a great job!). Anyway, we decided with longer guides I could cut his hair just like a professional and decided to invest in some. Now, we do not like to go store-to-store looking for things (Amazon Prime anyone?). This was one of the cheaper ones on Amazon, so we went with it. They work great. The longest one was even longer than how he wanted his hair, so there are many different style possibilities here. These fit EXACTLY like the guides that originally came with the product. I highly recommend this product. Just make sure you have the right clippers before you buy it. His clipper just says \\&quot;Oster Adjustable Professional Clippers\\&quot;. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I was worried after some of the reviews that may have problem, but they work great, easy on and off and fit snug.</li>
    <li> They were cheap, but they kept vibrating off.  I really only wanted the smallest comb.  I think the best option is to buy the head size you want.</li>
    <li> These work great! Good buy!</li>
    <li> only needed one of the blades.  good for the price point,</li>
    <li> These attachments don&#x27;t grip my Oster Classic adequately and wiggle and fall off. Why did I waste my money on this if it doesn&#x27;t fit as it should?</li>
    <li> They are one height for the newer model, but they are not the same height for the older models.  The next smaller size does the job.</li>
    <li> This is what should come with the original trimmer. 1\\&quot;-1/16\\&quot; So glad I bought this kit for $8 I think? Worth every cent! Just used them, cut hair like a pro! The range in sizes let you tapered side of the head(fade). Prompt delivery as well. Great buy.</li>
    <li> The guards are a different shape and material than the guards that come with your Oster. They work well enough, but they slide off even more than the original guards do. It&#x27;s not a HUGE deal, you just need to stop every min or so to adjust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cheap price, it&#x27;s an acceptable problem.</li>
    <li> Just needed certain ones but all things considered this was the best value.</li>
