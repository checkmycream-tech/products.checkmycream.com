      <li>glove makes cleaning my makeup brushes so much more of a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>IN LOVE WITH THIS GLOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>i love this.  </li>
      <li>After a bit of skepticism, I decided to buy this, and I&#x27;m glad it did.</li>
      <li>Great product, highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
      <li>😄so clean and nice ❤</li>
      <li>Was able to cut my cleaning time which made it easier to clean them more often.</li>
      <li>very comfortable and super easy.  </li>
      <li>Really easy way to clean your brushes without the need of wetting your hand while doing it.</li>
      <li>I was surprised by what the item was how it worked but the receiver loved it.</li>
      <li>Amazing cleans brushes super fast!</li>
      <li>By far the fastest and most effective way to clean the brushes.</li>

      <li>Definitely shortened the time to clean the brushes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I was left with startlingly clean and soft brushes.</li>
      <li>This glove works great on cleaning those expensive make-up brushes.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>seriously despise deep cleaning my brushes, because its such a long process.&lt;br /&gt;However, with this glove, it makes cleaning your brushes sooo much easier &amp; takes a fraction of the time to do so.&lt;br /&gt;SO happy with this makeup glove.</li>
      <li>This cleans my brushes in half the time and much cleaner than when I just use my hands.</li>

<li> This cleans my brushes in half the time and much cleaner than when I just use my hands.</li>
<li> It functions similarly to the Brush Egg with the added bonus of not getting your hands wet as you use it in case you need to do something else in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
<li> There are dedicated areas meant to &amp;#34;refine&amp;#34; your brushes but I did not really experience a difference between each of the different textures.&lt;br</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not a good fit for small hands</li>
<li> Like many other reviewers have already written, it is expensive but works so well!  </li>
<li> the task of cleaning my many m/u brushes a little less tedious.</li>
<li> My brushes have never been cleaner with such little effort.  </li>
<li> Over all the purpose is well meet, I hope they come with other cheaper tools also.</li>
<li> Cleans my brushes thoroughly, with little effort and no damage to them.  </li>
<li> messy to use</li>
<li> Cleans your  brushes spotless within few minutes.</li>
<li> I hated cleaning my cosmetic brushes</li>

    <li> This glove is amazing. Best and one of the most important piece of my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Really easy way to clean your brushes without the need of wetting your hand while doing it. My only complain would be too big of glove for smaller hands. Over all the purpose is well meet, I hope they come with other cheaper tools also.</li>
    <li> This glove works great on cleaning those expensive make-up brushes. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but the product is very well made. By far the fastest and most effective way to clean the brushes.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE WITH THIS GLOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;This glove makes cleaning my makeup brushes so much more of a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I seriously despise deep cleaning my brushes, because its such a long process.&lt;br /&gt;However, with this glove, it makes cleaning your brushes sooo much easier &amp; takes a fraction of the time to do so.&lt;br /&gt;SO happy with this makeup glove. I definitely recommend it to ALL!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers have already written, it is expensive but works so well!  I hated cleaning my cosmetic brushes but this makes it so fast and easy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I believe this is overpriced for sure, but it&#x27;s a time-saver for my extensive brush collection. Cleans my brushes thoroughly, with little effort and no damage to them.  I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleans brushes super fast!</li>
    <li> WOW!  I didn&#x27;t think I needed this glove but what a difference it makes!!  Great product, highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I like it because it helps clean the brushes thoroughly but I think it&#x27;s way overpriced for what it is.</li>
    <li> After a bit of skepticism, I decided to buy this, and I&#x27;m glad it did. I was left with startlingly clean and soft brushes.</li>
    <li> The absolute best, but the price tag is absolutely ridiculous, and will prevent me from repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> universal sized glove. it&#x27;s not a good fit for small hands</li>
    <li> My brushes have never been cleaner with such little effort.  Was able to cut my cleaning time which made it easier to clean them more often.</li>
    <li> Love the Sigma Spa Brush cleaner! Saves me time and makes life easier with cleaning all 50 of my pro brushes! Doesn&#x27;t ruin the soft bristles and keeps my brushes in great shape! It&#x27;s like an awesome workout for my brushes..:)</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift upon request.  I was surprised by what the item was how it worked but the receiver loved it.</li>
    <li> i love this.  very comfortable and super easy.  it really does the job!!</li>
    <li> Gets my brushes so clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> 😄so clean and nice ❤️</li>
    <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;Made the task of cleaning my many m/u brushes a little less tedious.</li>
    <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
    <li> Came right on time!!! Can&#x27;t wait to try it out!!</li>
    <li> I would rate this 5 stars if it was not overpriced for a basic silicon oven glove with a bunch of nubs. There are dedicated areas meant to &amp;#34;refine&amp;#34; your brushes but I did not really experience a difference between each of the different textures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the first glove (I do not own it but a friend does), the two sides having thumbs is a nice improvement as it allows for greater flexibility when cleaning your brushes. It functions similarly to the Brush Egg with the added bonus of not getting your hands wet as you use it in case you need to do something else in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less messy to use but again that is a lot of money to drop on this item. I do have to say that it makes cleaning brushes a breeze now and I don&#x27;t dread the chore as much as I used to.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this earlier. Cleans your  brushes spotless within few minutes. I didn&#x27;t have the original give so can&#x27;t tell  what the big improvement is</li>
    <li> This cleans my brushes in half the time and much cleaner than when I just use my hands. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Definitely shortened the time to clean the brushes.</li>
