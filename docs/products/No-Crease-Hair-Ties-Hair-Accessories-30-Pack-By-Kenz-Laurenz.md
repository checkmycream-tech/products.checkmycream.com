<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got these hair ties right on time! I also received all 30 of them. They come in the cutest variety of colors and 5 of them had patterns! A few of them were neutral colors but most were poppy and bright! But what you&#x27;re probably wondering how much they look like emi jays. The material is exactly the same when I compared then to a real emi jay. Most of them were also as stretchy and soft as an emi jay! However, a few were a little small or not that stretchy... But still cute and wearable. I love these hair ties and wear one every day around my wrist to match my outfit! Definitely buy👍👍</li>
    <li> Very nice quality. Love the different colors. I really like the mustache one.  I will never use the rubber band type of bands again.</li>
    <li> I was actually looking at Twistbands when I ended up buying these--they are exactly the same but soooo much less expensive for such a large quantity of bands. The variety of colors is quite satisfactory; I am required to wear plain blue scrubs to work so it&#x27;s nice to add a touch of individual pizazz, even if it&#x27;s only in my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the package came in a simple envelope which was not sealed at all.  There were only 10 hair ties in the envelope when it arrived.  I emailed the email in the packing slip and never heard from them.  I finally requested a refund from Amazon and they finally responded asking if they could fix the order.  I responded and once again never heard from them.  Really poor customer service.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, the few that did arrive look like the picture but are very thin and probably will not hold up well.  I will never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> It was amazing the parties came and not one was damaged. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really love these hair ties -- hold their shape for extended period of time; great color choices; good value.</li>
    <li> I received this 30 pack hair ties. It is worth to mention that the quality is superb - earlier I bought such ribbon ties from high street brand for a nearly double price, so I could compare both and to my astonishment the ones from Kenz were even better. Besides I got all possible colors, which suit to any of my clothes. Thank you for great pack. Will be buying for friends and relatives!</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors and they work great!  I will definitely buy these again.  They are shiny on one side and the other side is the same color but not as shiny.</li>
    <li> Love these, only problem is that everyone else takes them from me.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing value set! These are perfect for preventing hair tangles if you wear them in your hair and cute as a bracelet.</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties! They don&#x27;t tangle in my hair nor do they squish my curls as much as regular ponytail holders.</li>
    <li> These are good hair ties that do the job plus the varied colors are great.  They don&#x27;t snag &amp; simply slide off when you want to take your hair down.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> i bought these, love them! don&#x27;t damage your hair at all, love the colors! Ordering a new pack because i lost them lol :-( BUT I RECOMEND THEM</li>
    <li> I have really thick, curly hair and often wear it in a ponytail. Rubberbands or other stretchy hair ties pulled my hair and scrunchies just looked lame. These arrived in plastic sandwich bags...who cares. They were all new, clean, un-used. The variety of colors was awesome and I can find one to match any outfit I wear. They are good quality. Some take 2 twists to hold my hair, others take 3. If you think about it, you are only paying 50 cents for each hair tie so it&#x27;s a great deal. I will say that at the end of the day I do have a crease in my hair from the pony tail, but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting my hair would come out smooth, plus I wear them very tight. They do not pull my hair out like other ties. Very happy and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Got three packages (10 hair ties each inside), one was a primary color based bag, one pastels, one had designs on them. They are pretty shiny so if you are going for a matte-look, buy elsewhere or hope for a bag with more subdued colors I guess? But I love them for the price, shipping was great and arrived as stated , good quality product. (I&#x27;ve bought ones in stores from a major chain that recently had a credit fraud fiasco, so I turned to amazon to ensure (hopefully) that my credit won&#x27;t be burned</li>
    <li> I love them… enough to share to share with daughter and nieces.  I may need another round of them  f or the summer!</li>
    <li> GREAT value. Quick delivery, love the product!!  Best price I&#x27;ve seen so far for this product and the quality was high as well. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> They work great! BUT they STINK HORRIBLY! I soaked them 3x in vinegar to rid them of the &amp;#34;factory&amp;#34; smell and barely made a difference. Of course then some of them &amp;#34;bled&amp;#34; onto other hair ties.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my  13 year old granddaughter. Delivered in a timely manner and she loved them.Her 18 year old sister borrows them also</li>
    <li> These are adorable and very affordable. They come in an assortment of colors and don&#x27;t catch and snag your hair. I don&#x27;t think you will regret ordering them!! Super fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Bright and fun. They&#x27;ve held up well, and I am overall pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Emi-Jay for years, so cute but total ouch on the pocket book! These come in lots of cute and varied colors, no prints, but same quality! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy again!</li>
    <li> Nice vibrant colors but it doesn&#x27;t hold it shape and stretches out after one use.</li>
    <li> These ties are so cute. They are also so gentle on your hair and definitely hold. I have bought many from Kenz Laurenz because her colors and prices are AMAZING!</li>
    <li> convenient (can wear on wrist inconspicuously) and non-damaging to hair</li>
    <li> Spend the extra money and go with a company that creates a quality product.  This is a low quality product that is packaged in store sandwich bags.</li>
    <li> I love these hair bands, I ended up splitting them with girls at work and now have to order more! Amazing price and quality. Also shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> These do a great job holding hair, look beautiful, are ouch free, and are very sturdy. There is no metal closure to snag hair or to create a weak point where the elastic breaks. I will never buy those supermarket hair ties again. These are so incredibly much better there is no comparison.</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties, but they are so expensive in stores. This pack did take a while to be delivered, but definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> great hair ties..they don&#x27;t pull your hair and are super vibrant colors.  It&#x27;s the price that makes me give these a 3 star...and this was the cheapest seller out there on amazon.</li>
    <li> Today may be the day I put the &amp;#34;no crease&amp;#34; hair tie to the test.  I wore one yesterday as a bracelet just in case I wanted to use. Today I&#x27;ll be in a convertible so definitely putting to the test.  Hope there is no crease, but if I doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll still use, a color for almost any outfit.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Cyndibands (sorry) - these stretch out way too much - good for single use only.</li>
    <li> Good packaging, did not notice any odor. Lots of cute colors, only 10 are not solid colors, but good variety overall and fast shipping and service</li>
    <li> My fiancé is into these hair ties. She has one for every outfit she owns now. Plus for the money you couldn&#x27;t complain. Good quality.</li>
    <li> GREAT for anything you neeed a ribbon for.  Love em.  They will go  in my granddaughters&#x27; hair and in some mixed media collages and jewelry I&#x27;m working on.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be  2 identical orders. It wasn&#x27;t. It was 2 bundles of odd patterns. Didn&#x27;t get any 2 ties that were alike...I needed 2 of each color for braids and ponytails, but no two were alike.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered very fast, before it was even expected to come! They are great hair ties, and have not gotten stretched out. If you are interested in buying these, you definitely should.</li>
    <li> They get stretched out really easily, and stay wet for hours. But they stay in my heavy hair very well and don&#x27;t pull when i try to pull them out</li>
    <li> The colors are cute and the price is cheap, but these are not great quality. They stretch out after just a few uses and no longer hold hair well.</li>
    <li> Holding up ok not stretching out as fast as regular covered rubber band type ties but they can&#x27;t really hold up a ton of hat for very long I use them to cover my traditional band for color with lots of options :)</li>
    <li> I LIKE THESE VERY MUCH. THEY ARE COLORFUL  AND THEY DO NOT GET TANGLED IN MY HAIR. THEY WILL MATCH MOST ANY OUTFIT.</li>
    <li> I bought these hair ties as part of a bachelorette party favor with plans to divide up. There was 2 hair ties missing from my pack of 30.</li>
    <li> These are an addiction for me.  They don&#x27;t catch in my hair and I love accessorizing with them.</li>
    <li> i wear my hair pulled back and had being purchasing these for 4 dollars each at a high end store which only sold these in brown...these ties come in all kinds of colors which i really like and i also like the price which works out to be about 40 cents</li>
    <li> The hair tie stays on strong and does not hurt my hair like the black elastic ones do. Also, it does not hurt my wrist, so that a plus!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these. They arrived much quicker than expected and come in a lot of different colors- I got exactly what I ordered. They&#x27;re very high quality for a very low price- they&#x27;re definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> best ones I&#x27;ve found so far! they don&#x27;t stretch out like others</li>
    <li> These hair ties are the greatest.  Great colors &amp; prints in the package and they  work great on all types of hair. My three daughters &amp; I all use them and love them.  I&#x27;ve priced them out in other places and Amazon offers the Best Value!!</li>
    <li> These are fantastic!  All different colors!  They work great in my hair and I have really fine hair.  Something my daughter and I will be sure to enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great product, very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I expected more from these based on the reviews. They&#x27;re ok. Expensive for what you&#x27;re getting! I probably won&#x27;t buy again but I like them enough to keep them.</li>
    <li> These are cute, but misleading. I wanted them to tie in my daughter&#x27;s hair after I put it in a bun, etc, but they are very small. We kept them just to use for crafts.</li>
    <li> Very nice assortment of colors at a great price!! I love that they don&#x27;t mark my hair.  I can wear a ponytail during the day, take it down at night and wear down for a night on the town.  No line in hair to show it was in a ponytail all day!</li>
    <li> I had not tried these previously.  The product is good quality and well made but they do slip down my hair more quickly than standard elastic holders.</li>
    <li> These are great for the price! I wore one in my hair over night after washing and curling it, I always get a crease in my hair when I do that. This time, no crease!! They do stretch out a bit which isn&#x27;t a huge issue. The patterns fade on the ones with a pattern. At most stores you usually get 4 or so for this price, so this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Nice colors.  Work great.  A but expensive but very trendy.</li>
    <li> These are great, add a little extra then a plain old rubber band -some people have mistaken them for small bows ...love the variety of patterns and colors, my 13 year old daughter and I share them ; this was our 2nd order and we will probably order more via this dealer as you get way more them buying them in any stores we&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> Super cheap and cute! :)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I begin to use these ties as they won&#x27;t damage my hair.  The ties I received are of the same quality as I bought at my local drugstore, but at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I probably didn&#x27;t read the product description well...ties were nice but much too small for my adult head!</li>
    <li> I use these hair ties for Crossfit and for work! They work well for when I am working out and look cute with my color coordinated outfit for work! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $15 for a set of 4 or 5 hair ties!  These are the same quality come in big variety of colors.  I love the colors and I love the hair ties.  These are certainly a bargain and I recommend this to anyone who is looking for these hair ties but not willing to pay the crazy prices!  I hope to order more from this seller soon!  :)</li>
    <li> I first read about these hair ties online and they are supposed to prevent breakage. I&#x27;ve found them to be successful so far.</li>
    <li> I guess this product was O.K. After using it 3 to 4 times the hair band get very big and I could not find a way to tighten it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, great colors.</li>
    <li> I like all the colors, but I was turned off by the smell like other posters.  To me it smelled like gasoline or oil.  Was terrible and made my hair smell terrible.  I left the rest of the ties out of the bag for several days before wearing and that seemed to help.  Rinsing off with water helped a ton.&lt;br /&gt;I like wearing these even over regular hair bands, if I want to add color but keep super tight.</li>
    <li> These hair ties definitely have less crease than regular hair ties; though when used in long term such as 6+ hours, it does have a slight crease but it did not bother me that much. There is great variety in color and patterns but no 2 are the same color so doing twin tails would mean using 2 different colors. After 1 or 2 wears, they do get slightly looser than before. Can also be worn on wrists for cute decoration to go with outfits :)</li>
    <li> My daughter just thinks these are the best thing! No mark on her hair and loves to wear them as bracelets too.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering these.  The ties are great and good variety, however the bag I opened today must have been stored with mothballs.  My hair tie reeks of mothballs.  If you find the mothball odor offensive, as I do, you may want to order elsewhere.</li>
    <li> These work an look great!</li>
    <li> The Hair ties work wonderful, I know have every color to match all my outfits, the elastic is very good and hold the pony tail all day!</li>
    <li> daughter loves these! they don&#x27;t break her hair.</li>
    <li> Nooooo. The picture deceived me! Bought this pack specifically because I thought it only included solid colors. Came with 5 prints. (one mustache-printed, one striped, two animal prints, one pink with &amp;#34;I am love&amp;#34; written on it). Not a fan :/&lt;br /&gt;Sigh, well I guess it never said it wouldn&#x27;t include them so I can&#x27;t argue. Also it came with 29!!! They come packaged in 10s in 3 small clear plastic bags. One was open and I think that&#x27;s where the one hair tie went missing. Other than that they are pretty, the material and the colors of the solids were exactly what I wanted. Have not used them yet so we&#x27;ll see how long they last. But dang I want my five more solids!</li>
    <li> The colors fade almost immediately with use.  They look like a little piece of rag and do not hold as well as I would like.  Overpriced.</li>
    <li> Great ties. Many colors. Arrived on time and was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great hair ties! I love the variety of colors &amp; patterns - and they are exactly like the versions sold in retail stores, but wayyyy more economical. The one thing that happens with the patterned ones is that the pattern becomes a bit faded (due to being stretched out) over time. I think this is to be expected; I started noticing the fading about the 5th or so time using the hair tie. The quality is great though - they do not seem to lose stretchiness over time at all.</li>
    <li> It is very handy to have the wide variety of colors for pony tails.  The fabric has good  elasticity for easy use.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones in stores selling for way more. My only gripe is that initially, they smelled terrible. The smell disappears after a few days.</li>
    <li> Worthless. gave away.</li>
    <li> the regular sized hair ties are great...there were also some odd-sized and patterned hair ties in the package too that I can&#x27;t quite figure out because they&#x27;re too big to use as regular hair ties that you wear on your wrist...but too small to be headbands. The normal sized ones that I was expecting were perfect.... but they only sent me 21 even though I ordered 30.</li>
    <li> I use my no crease hair ties all the time! They work great! Excellent Seller!</li>
    <li> Love these hair ties.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and I have stocked up for me and my daughter.  Will probably buy again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> these hair accessories are the greatest.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Purchased this and also several five packs from Nordstrom for $10.80 for 5 hair ties.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference between the two.</li>
    <li> My girls love the Ties, Great amount for a Great Price!</li>
    <li> I ordered these on line because this type of hair tie does not pull out (or crimp) my very fine hair ... Plus, they are almost impossible to find in a store. The package arrived quickly and the ties were as shown in the picture (there are 30 of them) - there were a couple of animal print ties but that&#x27;s okay with me. The ties are in good shape and do the job. The price is great - when I do find them in a store, they are typically twice as expensive. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i was worried i wouldnt like the colors sent to me but I received a large variety and loved them all</li>
    <li> Love these.  I&#x27;ll be ordering many more.</li>
