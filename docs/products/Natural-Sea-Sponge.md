      <li>but still w/ abundant lather</li>
      <li>This is the one you can wash your face with because it loves your face, &amp; is perfect for whole faces of make-up like taking off your clown face make-up or just any make</li>
      <li>But nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and makes my skin feel awesome!</li>
      <li>I use it with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s magic soap and it leaves a nice tingle on my skin.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a Sea Sponge but couldn&#x27;t justify spending $15 or more at the places I&#x27;ve seen them.</li>

      <li>i am so displeased that i will not buy any more from you.</li>

      <li>\\&quot;I Love You Arishmary\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>A great bath sponge and just the right size to fit in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived</li>
      <li>There products are first class!!!  </li>
      <li>sponge is a pretty good size one, about 6-7 inches.</li>
      <li>It is my own fault but still shouldn&#x27;t the seller be some what honest on just how much they are charging.</li>
      <li>It had the same quality, which was very good.  </li>
      <li>Suggest that the Amazon product description be changed to 3-4&amp;#34; sponge to more accurately reflect the product size.</li>
      <li>Sponge arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>It feels like having a huge wad of cotton balls in your hand to clean with!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>This is too soft to bath with, but might be really good for a baby.</li>
      <li>Not sure how to best describe it</li>
      <li>There are many things I liked about this natural sponge, particularly its resistance to bacteria.</li>
      <li>It rinses thoroughly, and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Was super happy to find it on Amazon for much less!</li>
      <li>I have been through many natural sponges over the years.</li>
      <li>My merchandise arrived earlier than expected in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>The sea sponge I ordered came very quickly and was even better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>5-6 inch is definitely big enough to feel comfortable to hold and to cover a good amount of body</li>
      <li>I have only used them once or twice, so far so good.</li>
      <li>This one is denser and firmer but it lathers pretty well</li>
      <li>Fell apart first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>The size and quality of this sponge is exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I am overall pleased with this product and it shipped promptly as promised.</li>
      <li>A real delight to use when bathing!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t expect it to last very long, you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
      <li>They feel great on your skin, and last for a very long time if you take care of them.  </li>
      <li>This is by no means an adult size bath sponge  Would be adequate for a child.  </li>
      <li>I got in the bath and stuck it under the water, the sponge got SUPER soft and squishy.</li>
      <li>That sponge made so much lather</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>You do not receive the whole thing as shown in the picture.  </li>
      <li>Soft, big and appear to be able to stay together.</li>
      <li>It feels wonderful on body, very soft, not abrasive, day and night difference comparing to artificial sponges</li>
      <li>I used a really nice BBW shower gel and since I had never used a sponge before, I added my usual amount - I just squeezed a bunch on it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update on the longevity of the product:&lt;br /&gt;- After 2 months, the sponge looks more or less new</li>
      <li>However, after little more than a month it is falling apart.</li>
      <li>Soft and comfy ad dries out fast.</li>
      <li>It is so soft and wonderfully gentle.</li>
      <li>well, maybe it will be fresh when it finally gets here.</li>
      <li>I used this as a shower scrub, and it was okay, but started deteriorating after a few weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>My wife and I believe they are well worth the extra dollars.</li>
      <li>Looks brand new in fact.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s firm yet soft and creates the most luxurious lather from the soap.</li>
      <li>Very soft sponge.</li>
      <li>Very soft</li>
      <li>This particular sponge was a great disappointment.</li>
      <li>but so far it seems to be both durable and very soft.  </li>
      <li>Of course as this is a natural product each one will be slightly different but I would certainly buy another one of these when I need a new one.  </li>
      <li>got hooked on real sponges for showering several years ago, use one every day.</li>
      <li>This is the one that is so soft you can&#x27;t believe It is not made out of butter, or</li>
      <li>When I soft an ad for this product, I remembered that mother used a sea sponge to apply her makeup.</li>
      <li>It is soft, came as advertised.</li>
      <li>The initial 5-6 inch sponge was very unsatisfactory</li>
      <li>I would say that if one has sensitive skin, to keep shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>backyard social beside the pool on a hot day just with water because it collects so much of it, then you can throw them at each other as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it was flat rate shipping and they charged that much.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be soft enough for facial use given some other reviews and issues with prior sea wool sponges but the one I got was very soft after the first time it was wet.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t bounce back as nicely as new when</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t bother to return, but will find a new supplier next time.  </li>
      <li>By my second use I also used MUCH less soap which is nice - none is wasted and your soap lasts longer!</li>
      <li>I have used natural sponges for a very long time.</li>

    <li> 💋 🌠✨ This is the one I would have bought 10 of for My Mom if she was around after discovering that Amazon had it. This is the one that is so soft you can&#x27;t believe It is not made out of butter, or cotton candy after touching the tongue. This is the one you can wash your face with because it loves your face, &amp; is perfect for whole faces of make-up like taking off your clown face make-up or just any make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;💋 🌠✨ This is you have a bath in Cotton Candy Shower Gelly with, or even to suck up cold water in the summer time backyard social beside the pool on a hot day just with water because it collects so much of it, then you can throw them at each other as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;💋 🌠✨ It is the best for me because when I hold it against my face in the shower with all the lathering luxury around, it whispers in my ear \\&quot;I Love You Arishmary\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This company is wonderful to deal with! There products are first class!!!  A+++++++ shippers!</li>
    <li> This is by no means an adult size bath sponge  Would be adequate for a child.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The initial 5-6 inch sponge was very unsatisfactory so I gave a review stating this.  The seller came back with an offer to send me 2 sponges if I would remove the negative feedback.  So I said ok, and removed it.  In return I was send 2 sponges which are about 3\\&quot; each.  Ick.  This seller is awful.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!  They are not worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of them for myself and my friends. I am absolutely delighted to have it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It feels wonderful on body, very soft, not abrasive, day and night difference comparing to artificial sponges&lt;br /&gt;- It reduces the amount of body wash by at least 1/3 but still w/ abundant lather&lt;br /&gt;- It cleans better than just using hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size 5-6 inch is definitely big enough to feel comfortable to hold and to cover a good amount of body area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on the longevity of the product:&lt;br /&gt;- After 2 months, the sponge looks more or less new&lt;br /&gt;- After 4 months, tissues around small holes start to break through which connect the small holes into big holes, but nothing has fallen off yet. The sponge has also lost some elasticity. It doesn&#x27;t bounce back as nicely as new when squeezed.&lt;br /&gt;- After 6 months, it starts to disintegrate and needs replacement.</li>
    <li> Owned another sponge from another company for over 2 years, loved it. This one tore within a week of use. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The sponge is bulky until water is applied ,then it shrinks to a thin fragile device incapable of holding soap .</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Thanks</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this seller.  My merchandise arrived earlier than expected in excellent condition.  I would definitely transact business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> I used this as a shower scrub, and it was okay, but started deteriorating after a few weeks of use.  If you don&#x27;t expect it to last very long, you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
    <li> The sponge themselves seem great. Soft, big and appear to be able to stay together. I have only used them once or twice, so far so good. HOWEVER, I am so disappointed in the cost in shipping. I obviously did not pay close enough attention. For two sponge (which weigh little) to be shipped from FL to NY it cost $19.99. What a joke? It was not over night or express it was flat rate shipping and they charged that much. WHAT A RIP OFF. It is my own fault but still shouldn&#x27;t the seller be some what honest on just how much they are charging. I will not be buying another item from Big Deal Beauty until they readjust their shipping rates.</li>
    <li> it was verry small. it was not as big as the last one i got from you. i am so displeased that i will not buy any more from you. it was a ripoff</li>
    <li> The sea sponge I ordered came very quickly and was even better than I expected.  I would have no problem purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have been through many natural sponges over the years. This particular sponge was a great disappointment. It is quite small, and far too soft. Not sure how to best describe it but it is really not very \\&quot;spongy\\&quot; when wet. It sort of squishes down to a little wet lump when you wet it in warm water and try to use it.</li>
    <li> There are many things I liked about this natural sponge, particularly its resistance to bacteria. It is soft, came as advertised. However, after little more than a month it is falling apart. This sponge is not durable.</li>
    <li> The item arrived looking nothing like it was pictured on Amazon. It is small and coarse. Not a good value. I will probably return it. Not recommended to buy.</li>
    <li> The sponge was ok but, it falls apart after a couple of weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t find anything better I would use them.  Went to ebay and got the Max Factor sponges.  $40.00 for two... expensive.</li>
    <li> I use this sponge for my cleansing my face. It is so soft and wonderfully gentle. It rinses thoroughly, and dries quickly. When I soft an ad for this product, I remembered that mother used a sea sponge to apply her makeup. That was 50 years ago. Since Mom knows best, I bought one. It&#x27;s fantastic. Great for bathing even a tine baby.</li>
    <li> Started to tear during 1st use. Need to Return</li>
    <li> Sea sponges are great for the shower when used with body washes.  My wife and I have shared one of these for over a year and a half and it is finally time to replaced it.  Very happy with the longevity and will be buying another one soon.</li>
    <li> got hooked on real sponges for showering several years ago, use one every day. love how the sponge makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I have used natural sponges for a very long time. This is the best ever. It&#x27;s firm yet soft and creates the most luxurious lather from the soap. A real delight to use when bathing!</li>
    <li> These were supposed to be 5-6 inch sponges.  Neither of them make even 4 inches.  Probably won&#x27;t bother to return, but will find a new supplier next time.  Suggest that the Amazon product description be changed to 3-4&amp;#34; sponge to more accurately reflect the product size.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. Mine came on time, but was a little smaller than described. It was 4 inches, measured on the longest side. It was also a lot softer than I expected, and when I use it, I feel like I&#x27;m not really getting any grime off my skin, but it gets the soaking job done a lot quicker than just a bar of soap and my hands. I feel pampered when I use it haha I use it with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s magic soap and it leaves a nice tingle on my skin.</li>
    <li> A great bath sponge and just the right size to fit in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and as described by seller.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge overall, and I use it instead of a washcloth, but I wish it were softer. Even when wet and soaped up it feels like sandpaper on the skin. I would say that if one has sensitive skin, to keep shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for six months now and it hasn&#x27;t softened up any with use, but it also hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of wear or tear.</li>
    <li> For starters it was a lot cheaper than the one had had which was from Restoration Hardware.  That was the only place I could find it.  It had the same quality, which was very good.  I would definitely recommend it for others!</li>
    <li> The description said great for bathing, but not if you need something more study than a pair of panty hose. This is too soft to bath with, but might be really good for a baby.</li>
    <li> Sponge arrived very quickly. I love it.  It is quite large and I actually cut it in half so it would be easier to hold.  Very soft and I have had no problems with pieces breaking off.  Will definitely purchase again from this seller</li>
    <li> Very soft sponge. Very good size. And very good price. Will Totally buy it again. Love it, the sponge is awesome.</li>
    <li> These sponges are wonderful.  They feel great on your skin, and last for a very long time if you take care of them.  My wife and I believe they are well worth the extra dollars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a Sea Sponge but couldn&#x27;t justify spending $15 or more at the places I&#x27;ve seen them. Was super happy to find it on Amazon for much less! I waited a little over a month to write a review so it would give me time to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is a pretty good size one, about 6-7 inches. There&#x27;s no specific shape to this, but the shape of mine is like it was made for my hands! The size of mine is more like 6 to 8 inches, depending on where you measure it.&lt;br /&gt;When I got in the bath and stuck it under the water, the sponge got SUPER soft and squishy. It feels like having a huge wad of cotton balls in your hand to clean with! When I take a shower, I use Buff Puff&#x27;s for the face &amp; body - I love a good scrub! But I don&#x27;t necessarily want to scrub in the bath - I want to relax. I used a really nice BBW shower gel and since I had never used a sponge before, I added my usual amount - I just squeezed a bunch on it. That sponge made so much lather I thought I&#x27;d have to empty the tub and refill it just to rinse the lather all away! It was awesome! I have used various brands of soap and got the same results every time - LOTS of lather. By my second use I also used MUCH less soap which is nice - none is wasted and your soap lasts longer! BIG plus in my book - especially if you like the more expensive bath/shower/ gel/creams.&lt;br /&gt;IF you are looking for a product that will Exfoliate - this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you UNLESS you use a shower/bath Scrub! I have used regular soap and I have used salt &amp; sugar scrub with this sponge and I felt great any way I used it. It doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy at all. It&#x27;s been about 5 weeks since I purchased this and it hasn&#x27;t broken down at all. Looks brand new in fact.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great sponge. It&#x27;s soft and makes my skin feel awesome! If you want exfoliation - get a Buff Puff. I would buy again and would recommend!</li>
    <li> They are asking me for a review of this product, and they haven&#x27;t even shipped it.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I wouldn&#x27;t even review this yet, but since I ordered it 4 DAYS AGO, and it&lt;br /&gt;still hasn&#x27;t shipped, I&#x27;m wondering if I just ordered a picture off a website, or if they&lt;br /&gt;still have to go fish this thing out of the water. I&#x27;ll bet they&#x27;re using the wrong bait!&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, maybe it will be fresh when it finally gets here.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to all sybarites who love a leisurly bath. Soft and comfy ad dries out fast. Buy it.</li>
    <li> have only used it for a week but so far it seems to be both durable and very soft.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be soft enough for facial use given some other reviews and issues with prior sea wool sponges but the one I got was very soft after the first time it was wet.  Of course as this is a natural product each one will be slightly different but I would certainly buy another one of these when I need a new one.  Size  was also as described - about 6&amp;#34; in the largest dimension and 4.5-5&amp;#34; in the smaller one.</li>
    <li> The size and quality of this sponge is exactly as described.  I wanted a larger one but I suppose this size is the standard.  I am overall pleased with this product and it shipped promptly as promised.</li>
    <li> Nice...........a little too small.  But nice</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to this sponge compared to the synthetic one that I used to use.  This one is denser and firmer but it lathers pretty well and I think it exfoliates well.</li>
    <li> This sponge was cut in half.  You do not receive the whole thing as shown in the picture.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Fell apart first time I used it.  There was an antiseptic mailed with the product that I used on the sponge prior to use and that may have caused it to fall apart.  There weren&#x27;t any instructions on how to use antiseptic on this delicate product.</li>
