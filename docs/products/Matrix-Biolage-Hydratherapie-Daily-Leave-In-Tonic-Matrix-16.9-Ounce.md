    <li> I use this product at night before bed.  It is a great leave-in conditioner.  It is light, but really does the job.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product in stores anymore. I have tried other sprays that can be left in the hair and they all seem to make my hair greasy. I like this product the best. The only problem I have is that the bottle is so large that it is difficult for me to hold and spray with one hand. Because you need to use two hands it is harder to direct the spray to a particular area. I bought a small spray bottle and decant the tonic. It makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it right after I shower and I just need to get my hair under control.</li>
    <li> Amazing for dry curly hair. Hair is softer and curls are more defined since using this priciest and the shampoo/ conditioner. My only gripe is that because the bottle is so big it is awkward to spray the bottle resulting in overspray. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have went through several bottles of this now and so have the people I told about it. I love Biolage products and this one is no different. Makes hair easier to comb through. You get what you pay for with Biolage. The bottle was much larger than I was anticipating so that was nice as well!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair shiny and without frizz.  Use it daily</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great detangler.</li>
    <li> works well on my long wavy curly hair and hair is still soft.  ensures that my hair is not too frizzy but still curly-does not weigh hair down</li>

    <li> I have very dry hair, and prefer to wash it as infrequently as possible. Other leave in conditioners have given my hair an unnatural funky feel. A fee apprised with this gives my v hair as close to an unwashed feel as possible, and I am clean!</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is the one I have to have--I&#x27;ve tried several and perhaps there is something else out there, but I can&#x27;t say. The price was better but shipping was not so cost was a wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years!  It arrived quickly and it the same as always, great detangler and leave in-conditioner.</li>
    <li> My husband is the one who uses this every day. Hard to find and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon. By the way he uses it for dry hair and said it really helps.</li>
    <li> I have hair to my waist and no split ends. I use this on my wet hair every morning before bunning up (my daily look) my hair for work. It detangles and conditions. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before.  Could not find it in any of the beauty supply stores.  Good price for the size of this bottle.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for my fine thinning hair. It adds volume and conditions my hair to the best possible appearance.</li>
