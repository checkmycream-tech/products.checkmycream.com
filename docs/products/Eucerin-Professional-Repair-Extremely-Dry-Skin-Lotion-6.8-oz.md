      <li>I use it all over when I get skin rashes and the improvement is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing .</li>
      <li>This cream does work as advertised, but it has kind of a waxy consistency after it dries</li>
      <li>To apply lotion to my skin after a nice invigorating &amp; cleansing shower was always something that never made sense to me.</li>
      <li>and it leaves a nice shine on my skin .</li>
      <li>(I wear gloves a lot throughout the day) and this formula is nice</li>
      <li>This is the one which was immediately effective.</li>
      <li>Adds a nice glow to the face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Eucerin makes many good products but this is by far their best.  </li>
      <li>Usually I love Eucerin products, and this one was OK but not as good as others I have tried.  </li>
      <li>This really works good!</li>
      <li>fine!  </li>
      <li>It seems to leave a very light waxy film when it dries.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has no smell—it’s truly fragrance free which is wonderful for anyone who is allergic to scents; and I really like how it uses Gluco-Glycerol to make my skin feel smooth and look its best again within a short period of time.</li>
      <li>I have used many moisturizers, but none of them worked this well.</li>
      <li>and I know Eucerin can do it because they have made a magical product in this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Only this one does the superb job!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have had many people commenting how my skin looks so much better since I use this lotion.</li>
      <li>so make sure you have time before you need to touch well...</li>
      <li>I am applying it maybe 5 times a day, more on my hands if I wash them.</li>
      <li>This lotion is thicker than most lotion.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product .</li>
      <li>Absolutely love Eucerin lotion.</li>

      <li>Just ok.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
      <li>Skin looks 100% better almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of so many people saying it is &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
      <li>My Foot doctor recommend, And it sure work for me.</li>
      <li>have tried so many lotions and moisturizers, and nothing has worked.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t built up on the top.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when six hours after first applying the lotion, I lifted my pant leg to reveal nice skin.</li>
      <li>Good product, works great for dry skin, recommended!</li>
      <li>This cream is perfect for maintaining pleasing-looking hands during dry winter weather.  </li>
      <li>As a diabetic with dry skin and itchy patches, this has been the best working product for my skin.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I am very impressed with this product, and recommend it often to others with dry skin issues.</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best deal on this, grab some and say goodbye to chronic dry skin.</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff on the planet for dry skin!</li>
      <li>It would be ideal to use this lotion every 24 hours to maintain the proper  moisture level in the skin.  </li>
      <li>It cost a little more, but the benefits of this stuff are priceless.  </li>
      <li>a smooth...makes putting on gloves easy.</li>
      <li>It has a very light scent that is neutral and quickly goes away.</li>
      <li>This is their BEST product for dry skin, no matter where it IS!!!!</li>
      <li>and finally this year I will go into swimsuit season with beautiful and comfortable skin and not worry about what hopping out of pools will do to</li>
      <li>It is also free of any odors.</li>
      <li>I choose 5 stars because it keep my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;BTW, they will send you a free sample (don&#x27;t know the size) if you visit the Eucerin website and look up the product.</li>
      <li>and I like that it is almsot fragnance free and add the level of support and hydration to my face skin</li>
      <li>Goes on very easily without a greasy feeling and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
      <li>Great for dry skin with a light touch.</li>
      <li>Works very well for extremely dry skin, and put on after the shower, when the skin is still moist, is the way to achieve the best effect.</li>
      <li>They come out with a great product, then mess it up by changing it to add more profit.</li>
      <li>Great lotion for dry skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easier to use , not too thick and it leaves a nice shine on my skin . The best value for the price paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why Amazon has \\&quot; Disappointed \\&quot; on this review . I am pleased with the product .</li>
    <li> Great lotion for winter skin.</li>
    <li> My podiatrist recommended this to me because I have extremely dry, cracked heels and it works wonders! It&#x27;s not too heavy and greasy like similar products and is just as effective, maybe even more so. I definitely recommend it for anyone with excessively dry skin!</li>
    <li> I love this new lotion!  My dermatologist recommended it for my dry skin and it workd great for my dry skin while not leaving a heavy slimy residue:)</li>
    <li> Best Lotion on the Market...My dermatologist recommended it to me for my dry hands (I wear gloves a lot throughout the day) and this formula is nice a smooth...makes putting on gloves easy.</li>
    <li> My husband is using this product on his face and believe me ive seen the effect on his skin.</li>
    <li> excellent product, I recommend</li>
    <li> too runny I have a different one I like better. You make too many I was very upset as it is expensive</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after my dermatologist recommended it.  It works so well, especially on my feet. I will not go back to the regular Eucerin.</li>
    <li> Good product, works great for dry skin, recommended!</li>
    <li> Seems to work. Wish they redesigned the cap, it&#x27;s very easy to spill out and make a mess. I have to clean up the lotion so it doesn&#x27;t built up on the top.</li>
    <li> fine!  no issues at all</li>
    <li> My skin gets extremely dry in the winter and I itch in my sleep and wake up with blood on my legs. I have seen numerous dermatologists and they always recommend Cortaid or some other type of anti-itch lotion, write me a prescription for medication lotion or an antihistamine.  I came across this and it really works and keeps my skin cool and moisturized. I wish I knew this 10 years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t have so many scars on my legs!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t help my dry skin and it burned badly when applied. I highly recommend Cerave instead of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled extremely dry skin for the last year after moving to the tropics and decided to give this product a try after past success with the brand. I love how thick it is and the very first morning I put it on I felt a great, warm glow from using it and have noticed that I don&#x27;t wake up with peeling, flaky skin like I&#x27;m used to anymore. I&#x27;m sold! It&#x27;s a wonderful product at a great value.</li>
    <li> Good lotion to repair dry damaged skin.  Not an everyday lotion in my opinion, but it is good at repairing cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, is not greasy, and really works.  A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will probably last me quite a while.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Usually I love Eucerin products, and this one was OK but not as good as others I have tried.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help my diabetic skin as much as other lotions.</li>
    <li> i  like it very much good&lt;br /&gt;buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have had dry skin my whole life. Sometimes it&#x27;s so dry my skin cracks and bleeds. I have eczema and sensitive skin, and many lotions actually make the dry skin itchier or burn. I have tried countless lotions and oils. I have tried other lactic acid lotions that are just greasy. I tried this Eucerin, just another shot in the dark. I ordered it with 4 other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin Professional Repair Extremely Skin Lotion Lotion is the holy grail I&#x27;ve been looking for. Truth be told- I am applying it maybe 5 times a day, more on my hands if I wash them. It gets expensive. But I finally know what soft, hydrated skin feels like. It&#x27;s not itchy, white, flaky, wrinkly looking or tight feeling. My hard, dry cuticles are even soft and my hands look great. AND it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy after it absorbs (5 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow it with a heavier lotion with shea butter or coconut oil and/or with TheraSeal. and I think this is the last of my terribly dry skin and cuticles that I thought was incurable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never found a lotion that keeps your skin feeling soft and moisturized for more than 20 minutes, try this.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for maintaining pleasing-looking hands during dry winter weather.  I&#x27;ll purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin with an annoying, bad feeling. I do not recommend this product. I also bought a smaller bottle of intensive hand cream ( can&#x27;t think of the exact name) same brand and it  was nice but didn&#x27;t last long before it was empty.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than other lotions out there and was too runny.  It had a watery consistency rather than a cream.</li>
    <li> I had very very dry skin after surgery---and every thing that I tried on it didn&#x27;t work---but this did. So I bought  the larger size next, and I&#x27;m still using it!!</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I buy now.  I have dry skin and even though the lotion is thick it is not greasy at all.  It makes your skin so smooth and soft.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Eucerin products usually deliver what they say, I&#x27;ve found. This lotion seems to provide fast and soothing relief to dry winter skin. Very happy with the product performance and price.</li>
    <li> I have used the Eucerin Calming Creme for a long time and really love that.  I bought this thinking it would be similar but instead it was really runny and not thick at all.  I didn&#x27;t think that it really helped out my dry skin very much.  I think I&#x27;ll just stick to my usual Eucerin lotion from no on.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dr. and it works well.</li>
    <li> Really helps my dry skin by helping the dry skin to come off easily in the shower</li>
    <li> I live in the country and walk on my feet in the Texas heat (yes, I rhymed). Since I care for my mother full-time (she has Alzheimer&#x27;s), I rarely have time to go get a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Eucerin: THIS STUFF ROCKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the risk of TMI (stop reading now - really!) - when my feet get dry I get icky strings that just catch on the carpet and HURT. Using Eucerin helps keep my feet pain free, string free and soft enough to put my cold feet on hubby without hurting HIM!</li>
    <li> Our kids have extremely dry skin in the winter. 2 of our friends recommended this lotion so we gave it a try. Dry hands were soon soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> My skin has gotten dryer, winter-by-winter, for the 40-odd years I&#x27;ve lived in Minnesota. This winter, my nails have been brittle and cracked. I finally took the hint and began applying this lotion nearly every night. Thanks to this, and wrapping my fingernails in bandages, and trimming off the splits every couple of days, I have an intact set of nails again.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a dab of lotion to the backs of my hands and massage it in thoroughly, including each fingernail and cuticle. Last of all, when the lotion is nearly all absorbed, I apply it to my fingertips. This is enough to soothe the irritation of super-dry fingertips, but little enough that I&#x27;m not leaving lotion marks on everything I touch.&lt;br /&gt;The soothing effect doesn&#x27;t last for long. If I go without this lotion for a day, my hands go back to feeling like sandpaper and looking like lizard feet.&lt;br /&gt;I took away a star for a reason that might not affect everyone - and it should be half a star. The fliptop squeaks loudly when opened. It&#x27;s awakened my husband a couple of times. I&#x27;m trying to discover a way to open the top silently, but so far, this hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
    <li> This lotion has been a great product for me.  As a diabetic with dry skin and itchy patches, this has been the best working product for my skin.  Lasts a long time also.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this product.  It does a good job at moisturizing my hands which are chronically dry during the winter.  However, no matter how much I rub it in, I am always left with an oily residue...Often I have to wash my hands after I use this lotion just to get rid of the oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time when I do not experience this residue is if I apply the lotion immediately after showering or bathing.  Otherwise, it just never seems to absorb fully into my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shower. It keeps my skin moisturized, stops dry skin itching, leaves a healthy shine to the skin, and on and on. I have used many moisturizers, but none of them worked this well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Eucerin lotion. Very satisfied with the results I receive when extra moisture is needed for dry skin areas.</li>
    <li> It becomes very sticky.  Becomes uncomfortable on my hands.</li>
    <li> This product dries somewhat sticky, and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s soaking into my skin like other products do.  I will use the remainder of the container alternately with one that performs in a better fashion.  It is slightly sticky, too.</li>
    <li> Highly rated product recommended by health care professionals. Helps with very dry/difficult skin problems.</li>
    <li> I know this is for extremely dry skin, but it leaves a heavy film. I switched back to Aveeno after trying this.</li>
    <li> It does what it says, repairs skin. My forearm suffer from both sun exposure and an allergic reaction and much scratching. This product has improved the appearance of my forearms.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, and have all my life.  Up until I tried the professional strength Eucerin, I was using Eucerin cream, which took lots of effort to rub into my skin.  This formula is a lotion, and works more effectively than the thick cream.  It is best for arms, legs, and torso.  Hands and feet will still need a heavier cream.  Nevertheless, I am very impressed with this product, and recommend it often to others with dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and dry skin is a huge issue for me. My skin was in bad shape, red, itchy and cracked. This cleared it up in just a couple of days. It has a very light scent that is neutral and quickly goes away. It does leave a residue so avoid getting your freshly treated skin on sensitive surfaces such as leather.</li>
    <li> WORKS,  not as heavy &amp; greasy as some creams, highly effective with lasting &amp; noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have dry skin and this really helps.</li>
    <li> Just ok.  Not something I would buy again.  It has a very sticky feeling.  Didn&#x27;t find it worked any better than any other lotion.</li>
    <li> For her dry and rough skin:p</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect for dry elbows, feet,knees, any part of the body that is super dry.  I apply once a day and my skin has changed dramatically.  My skin is soft and smooth and not dry and flaky anymore.  I like all the Eucerin lotion and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I choose 5 stars because it keep my skin smooth. I would recommend it to people who have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin with a light touch.</li>
    <li> Eh, it was a sticky hot mess.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom since her skin is extra-dry, extra-sensitive, and she has flare-ups of psoriasis, particularly on her elbows and knees.  She swears by Eucerin and I can see why - it helps with all her issues without irritating her skin.  She can&#x27;t use products with perfumes or dyes because those aggravate her skin.  Although this does NOT fix the psoriasis, it does ease some of the itching and discomfort, especially when combined with prescription topical cream.</li>
    <li> very good. i love it.</li>
    <li> I was really desperate to love this lotion.  I have extremely dry skin which is ultra sensitive.  I used the cream on my upper arms for a few days and loved the smooth feel.  But I did have some breakout , which is so typical for me, so lotion has been moved to a growing group of products on my husband&#x27;s shelf.  If you have dry skin, give it a try (but be cautious if you have issues with these un pronounceable high tech chemicals found in most moisturizing products).  It would be ideal to use this lotion every 24 hours to maintain the proper  moisture level in the skin.  The bottle is not very large and would be expensive to use as an all over daily lotion.  Even every other day, the bottle contents would disappear quickly.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive, pale skin and this stuff has worked wonders for me. I have eczema on my upper arms and within two days this product took care of it, as in they are soft and smooth. I also use this on my face a lot. I tend have some mild rosacea on my cheeks and acne-prone skin. I use my facial anti-aging serium and then put a layer of this over my whole face and neck for moisture. After a few minutes, I then put an extra amount on my cheeks where I have the rosacea and it smooths it out and calms it down. This product has AHAs in it, so I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t cause me to flare up.  As I said, I also use this on my neck, where I have always had rough, bumpy skin, and it smooths it into buttery softness. It does leave a bit of a &#x27;tacky&#x27; feeling for a few hours, but I only use it at night. I REALLY wish Eucerin would make this exact product (NO SPFs as they irritate my skin beyond belief!) into a face lotion that absorbs well into facial skin (it&#x27;s non-comodonogenc so it does not exactly absorb into the skin, but sits on top more). I&#x27;ve tried some of their face lotions and was not that impressed. I think Eucerin needs to approach their face lotions from their current line of body moisturizers and tweak them slightly. I want my facial moisturizer to be super moisturizing, have urea in it, have anti-aging benefits, and feel like I have nothing on it at all. Not asking much, I know!!  But, I know it&#x27;s possible and I know Eucerin can do it because they have made a magical product in this moisturizer. For the record, I hate their original body lotion!  It&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to help my skin out. Give this a try!  If you hate it, you can always use it on your feet, it makes them super soft too!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. LO still buy, EXCELLENT QUALITY AND CAME TO THE SHIPPING TIME.</li>
    <li> I want to say that the lotion is very good。my skin is very dry and itch in winter,I&#x27;ve used many products are not very big effect Except  it。it help my dry skin!!</li>
    <li> I hope the company never changes this lotion&#x27;s formula because I CANNOT survive without it. I have a very dry and sensitive facial skin and there are only a few lotions I can use on my face due to the sensitivity. But this lotion is the only one I can safely use and it completely alleviates my face from dryness. I have been using it for over two years since I started having extreme dryness, which I think was due to my age and heavy use of mattifying powder foundation. Of course the skin feels a bit too oily right after application but it gets absorbed in a while and it feels really wonderful! I use this lotion day and night and safely under makeup (I use BareMinerals powder foundation and other eye makeup products directly on top of this lotion and they normally don&#x27;t smudge) and at night I apply it on my under-eye wrinkles several times then the area looks so much better next morning. It does much better job than those expensive department store night creams! I have had many people commenting how my skin looks so much better since I use this lotion. Other similar formula from this company do not work as well on my face. Only this one does the superb job!</li>
    <li> No fragrance and no greasy slick feeling after applying, which I really appreciate. But I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s as powerful as the title makes it seem. Nonetheless, I use it daily and my skin is certainly not suffering. Wish it had SPF.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and it flares up just as cooler weather arrives. So I know it&#x27;s time to start applying this wonder working lotion.  It stops that horrific itching and I get to enjoy soft bump free skin.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing!  A little heavy for summer, but  will be lovely for autumn/winter months.</li>
    <li> I have tried \\&quot;them all\\&quot; and was only mildly interested when I received a sample of the Eucerin Pro Repair lotion....wow, finally a lotion designed for dry, itchy skin that is not gloppy, heavy or greasy. Even works on my dry hands and feet during the winter. Simply amazing. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face as I have sensitive skin, but this lotion absorbs well, is fragrance free and is very affordable (you don&#x27;t need to use alot). Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions all stating the product would help with extremely dry skin... this one like all the others failed and ended up getting dumped then recycled. First the lotion was like water even after a good series of shakes after application it left skin almost gritty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ended up switching to O Keefes working hands as this is the only thing that works it seems for us who work outside or with our hands for our work.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It works awesome. I even use it on my little one she even asks for it</li>
    <li> It was what I expected</li>
    <li> Received a &#x27;sample&#x27; in mail.  Ordered from Amazon.  This lotion is &amp;#34;Wonderful&amp;#34;.  Tiny bit is all it takes, after shower.  Skin looks 100% better almost immediately.  After several days use...remarkable improvement.  This is their BEST product for dry skin, no matter where it IS!!!!</li>
    <li> I will stick with my eucerin intense repair.  This lotion was like water.  The intense repair eucerin is thicker, feels better or your skin and is cheaper than this one.</li>
    <li> Really, really helps dry skin.  Recommended to me by my dermatologist and I now know why.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was not at all like the first container of Eucerin i bought.  It&#x27;s the last one i&#x27;ll be buying online.  It&#x27;s too liquidy and it smells so bad.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer is decent. Packaging was awful, box was torn up and falling apart. Lotio last a long time on skin. Thanks</li>
    <li> There is no miracle lotion, but this one is a good one.  It goes on smoothy and does a good job.  And I am a really dry person.</li>
    <li> good product but a bit pricey though</li>
    <li> This works really well, softening the hardest skin and calluses.  Repeated use helps.&lt;br /&gt;It works on heel cracks.  The trick seems to be to find a lotion with a high urea content.&lt;br /&gt;Or so I have heard, and now I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I put this lotion on and then put on some old cotton athletic socks to let it soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no real smell or fragrance which is fine with me.</li>
    <li> While this product moisturizes very well, it leaves your skin feeling rubbery. It makes my hands feel dirty. I most likely would not purchase this lotion again. It makes for a long uncomfortable day with my clothes sticking to me.</li>
    <li> The only stuff that helps ease the sting of my skin condition. It&#x27;s gold in our house.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of so many people saying it is &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;. I have to say I don&#x27;t agree. This did wonders on my back, which is constantly inflamed and itching and has plagued me for years. Also made the dry skin disappear on my wrists in just a few applications. They should call this wonder lotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema on my legs for about a year and a half now but it&#x27;s gotten progressively worse but I haven&#x27;t had time to go to a dermatologist. My appointment is over a month from now bc they&#x27;re all booked in my area. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve managed to try and accumulate dozens of moisturizers trying to find something to keep my eczema at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually given a bottle of this lotion as a free sample from Eucerin.  The verdict: yes, it does relieve my eczema, but I can&#x27;t stand it because it leaves this awful sticky residue. Initially, I thought I just needed to give it A LOT of time to soak in. Nope, that is not the case.  Using this lotion gives me this constant sticky feeling. I feel like I worked out and sat around in my sweat for hours.  Yes, it&#x27;s gross. I feel like I need to shower it off immediately.  But on the plus side, my legs aren&#x27;t itchy! Sigh. I&#x27;d almost prefer the itch.  Maybe I&#x27;ll stick to using this in the winter months or only put it on before bed.  I&#x27;m obviously frustrated because it has actually helped my eczema symptoms only to leave me feeling gross and dirty!  I don&#x27;t even know which one is worse :(</li>
    <li> recommended by the dermatologist it&#x27;s super thick.  it does leave a greasy feel until it gets absorbed so make sure you have time before you need to touch well...anything...</li>
    <li> This lotion is thicker than most lotion.  It stays on and hydrates my skin well.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is nice.  Finally I&#x27;ve found a lotion that I love!</li>
    <li> I have used the Intensive Repair but it can be a bit heavy for the warmer months, so I tried  this one and I love it.  I even use it on my face.</li>
    <li> My hands were awful from winter dryness and cold...my knuckles were even bleeding.  I used this for two days, and everything is back to normal after a month of discomfort and trying to get aveeno to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this is the smell, but it goes away after an hour.  Also, it leaves your hands sort of greasy and slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far more liquidy than aveeno - but it actually goes in the skin. I feel like Aveeno just sits on top - and even their most intense formula was not working for me.</li>
    <li> 4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin Professional Repair Extremely Dry Skin Lotion works wonders for my extremely dry skin which has become worse (specifically, drier and more likely to crack and even bleed a little) each winter as the years go by. I used to be able to get by with much less “intensive” dry skin lotions and/or creams but I’ve reached the stage of life where I need something pretty strong. The great news is that this WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no smell—it’s truly fragrance free which is wonderful for anyone who is allergic to scents; and I really like how it uses Gluco-Glycerol to make my skin feel smooth and look its best again within a short period of time. True, it may be a bit gooey (some people may call it “silky”) so experiment a little and don’t apply too much at first until you get a feel for exactly how much you personally will need to use, but that’s not such a bad thing if you want truly rejuvenated skin that looks and feels so much better. My now formerly exceptionally dry skin no longer cracks as a result of the particularly cold weather we’ve been having this wintertime. Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my own experience, I would recommend this product although be careful of that “sunburn alert” mentioned on this product page. Of course, as always, if you’re wondering if this is really right for you in particular ask your doctor or pharmacist before you get this product and use it.</li>
    <li> Wife has psoriasis or excema--Drs can&#x27;t decide. This the best we have found OTC to help alleviate it. Nice, thick consistency: goes further, costs less per use.</li>
    <li> Works very well for extremely dry skin, and put on after the shower, when the skin is still moist, is the way to achieve the best effect.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for really dry skin.  I really only use it in the winter because the cold destroys my skin.</li>
    <li> This type of Eucerin improves the texture of my skin - both on hands and legs - where I have had very dry skin. I use this lotion at night after I have washed my hands for the last time, and my skin feels great all the next day. If I have to wash my hands a lot during the day, I put a very small amount on periodically, starting on the backs of my hands. Even though the lotion is quite thin, IT WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Amazing what it does for ultra dry/cracked skin. Stuck on it for life now.</li>
    <li> Like just about everyone that has severe dry skin especially exacerbated by dry, cold, and hot conditions I have tried just about every lotion, cream, and potion on the market and I have never been truly satisfied by the results even sometimes using expensive prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has for the first time changed my roving eye.  I keep bottles of it everywhere and finally this year I will go into swimsuit season with beautiful and comfortable skin and not worry about what hopping out of pools will do to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin makes many good products but this is by far their best.  Their lotions tend to run either not rich enough for me or so rich that I feel like I can&#x27;t touch anything for hours, my clothes stick to it and never stop feeling greasy.  The first time I applied this one I feared this fell into the former category because the texture is not very thick at all and it absorbs quickly without any greasy feeling.  I was disappointed at first until I noticed the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about this lotion, I believe the Gluco-Glycerol formula, makes this lotion totally different.  While it absorbs quickly and feels like a nice thin silky lotion, it penetrates, softens, and heals like nothing I&#x27;ve used before.  This special formula is so advanced and powerful that I now use it also as a foot cream instead of thick, expensive, and specific-to-feet formulas designed to penetrate thick calloused soles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about it sinks directly into your skin and heals it without the lotion lingering on the skin.  This also allows you to be able to apply it more frequently than you could that thick greasy stuff and therefore is perfectly good at healing even the most rhino type skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does all this without any sting or medical sensation so it is comfortable wherever you put it.  It never irritated my sensitive skin.  It is just as gentle on my facial skin as it is anywhere else and because of it&#x27;s sinking-in formula it never over-moisturizes even my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you try this even if you are really feeling jaded by the disappointment you&#x27;ve had in other lotions and even other Eucerin products.  Get this, it is highly affordable compared to more expensive lotions and give it a chance to work it&#x27;s Gluco-Glycerol miracle on you.</li>
    <li> one of the ingredients actually gave me a rash and split my skin.  didn&#x27;t work for me.  I got it b/c of the good reviews but on my hands all it did was damage.  I suppose it&#x27;s worth trying if you have extremely dry skin but wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d gotten free samples from Eucerin and this lotion was thick and very good. But the 6 bottles I got from Amazon were like water, no creaminess. I sent them back. I&#x27;ll go back to the cheaper Eucerin lotion.</li>
    <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that I prefer the thick Eucerin healing cream, over the lotion or ointment products.  You don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll like a lotion until you&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
    <li> This cream does work as advertised, but it has kind of a waxy consistency after it dries and it does have a smell. Not necessarily a bad smell, but it does have one.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> After trying several products I was determined to find something that would keep the bottoms of my heels from becoming so dry and ugly. This is the only lotion that does that for me. I don&#x27;t care much for the feel as a body lotion, but I&#x27;ll keep using this Eucerin on my feet.</li>
    <li> I had been skipping my normal body moisturizer and developed a rash because my skin was so dry. When aquaphor did not help it, Google led me to Urea, the 2nd ingredient in this lotion. This lotion softened my skin after 2 uses and cleared up the rash in a few days.</li>
    <li> This is non-greasy and works great at keeping my usually dry skin well hydrated during this crazy winter. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Great product for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry hands and in the winter it&#x27;s unbearable. This is great for when you are stepping out the door, and want to be thoroughly moisturized without leaving grease stains on everything you touch. It does come off a bit after hand washing but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> I have very, very dry skin exacerbated by a combination of diabetes and a thyroid condition. My dry skin has been a source of embarrassment for me since my middle school years. Foundation always looked terrible, and I suffered through scorching summer heat in jeans just to avoid having to show my legs in shorts and skirts. My feet are an endless source of anxiety because of the cracks and risk of infection, a potentially serious situation with the diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many lotions and moisturizers, and nothing has worked. Well, until I came across Eucerin Professional Repair Lotion. The only word I have for this is &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34;. It wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; where it just wet my skin long enough to appear moisturized until it wore off, it actually did what it claimed to do. I was thrilled when six hours after first applying the lotion, I lifted my pant leg to reveal nice skin. Nice skin! I&#x27;ve never seen my skin look like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a bit different than what I am used to seeing, but it works, so that&#x27;s not an issue. It does take some time to really soak in, but it doesn&#x27;t stay greasy. What it comes down to, is that it works. Which is the whole point of using it, so the issues aren&#x27;t really issues at all. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my doctor for me to use during my radiation treatments for cancer. Tomorrow will be my eighteenth and final treatment and my skin has stayed well lubricated. It is a little thinner than I expected it to be but still did the trick.</li>
    <li> I use this for my toddler who gets really dry skin sometimes and it takes care of the dryness in a couple days of using it.  It&#x27;s not really greasy, but his skin looks kinda wet and hydrated when I put it on.  Overall, I would recommend it for really dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and I like that it is almsot fragnance free and add the level of support and hydration to my face skin</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff on the planet for dry skin! I actually use it on my face because I get a lot of dry spots on my face in the winter. I put it on after a shower at night and when I wake up in the morning, my face feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is probably good for the dry stage before the skin gets raw and cracked.  During this stage, this formula stings and I wash it off.  The other Intensive Repair formula soothes during this stage, helps the raw skin heal, and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man with leather feet and rough hands. My granddaughter likes holding my hand so I need them smoother. For years I used the thick paste in the jar. I picked this up the other day and was instantly depressed, and got that feeling of being ripped off. This is so thin and watery, it&#x27;s no good. Maybe for a baby&#x27;s tender butt, but not for adult skin.&lt;br /&gt; This company is simply cutting it down to stretch it out. Hey folks, let&#x27;s let them know what we think of this cheap copy of generic lotion. I won&#x27;t be buying it ever again. If they make it real thick, like their known for, and don&#x27;t mess with the formula, then I&#x27;ll buy it again. Seems that many big companies make this same mistake. They come out with a great product, then mess it up by changing it to add more profit. It fails every time and they lose their good names to greed. Hope they yank this off the shelves and fix it soon.</li>
    <li> Suffering with bad dry skin problems for way too many years, I have tried just about everything.  Until now, Cetaphil cream seemed to work best for me.  Based on reviews here, I tried the Eucerin.  Jackpot!  This is by far the very best dry skin lotion I have ever used.  You can actually &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it working on the dry scaly patches and somehow, it heals everything up.  It cost a little more, but the benefits of this stuff are priceless.  Amazon has the best deal on this, grab some and say goodbye to chronic dry skin.</li>
    <li> Be careful when putting on your hands the first time. It is very runny but it does help dry skin. I can only use it before bed. Once you put it on don&#x27;t try to pick anything up for a bit</li>
    <li> Winter was a big dry-skin season for my kids. They get this stuff after bath time and they no longer complain about their skin being itchy.</li>
    <li> This has always been a good brand name. I do wish it were a little thicker although I know it&#x27;s lotion but it could be just a tad thicker and still qualify as lotion.</li>
    <li> Great Lotion for extremely dry skin. It does leave a little grease on the hands though.</li>
    <li> My infant son had white spots all over his body. we had tried changing detergents, applied other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I read only about using Eucerin for these kind of spots. I was not sure which Eucerin to use, we we tried a few different Eucerin lotions before using the professional repair lotion. This is the one which was immediately effective. His spots turned lighter and the natural skin color returned and we saw results within the first few days.</li>
    <li> Very good, very useful.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample to try after going in for an area on my back that was painful.  I had tried several other moisturizers without any relief.  After about a week of using this product the problem was fixed.  Goes on very easily without a greasy feeling and is absorbed quickly.  It is also free of any odors.</li>
    <li> This is really great for very dry mature skin.  Under eye lines and wrinkles appear softer. Adds a nice glow to the face.  Skin seems to come alive. I use the eucerin cleanser with it and the combo is great! Can&#x27;t find the cleanser in the stores but amazon has it!</li>
    <li> Great lotion for dry skin. I would recommend for anyone who likes a lotion that is not greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> First, a word about some of the negative reviews. My guess is that as often happens when a company offers such a wide array of products, some reviewer(s) put the review under the wrong item. For instance, this item is fragrance free, so if somebody says it smelled horrible, I really question whether we are talking about the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this product at the urging, no, make that insistence of my dermatologist. She said that based on feedback she&#x27;s receiving, it is really performing well. And, for those of us with REALLY dry flaky skin, I agree. This is much better than any other moisturizing cream or lotion that I&#x27;ve tried. It does this in a way that may not appeal to all. It seems to leave a very light waxy film when it dries. Somebody mentioned that their hands don&#x27;t feel clean after applying, and I totally agree; I wash my palms after applying. I think this is the tradeoff for its long-lasting performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that with any other product, 8 hours or so after application, the skin shows visible dryness, but not with this. My only complaint is that they are evidently not yet packaging the product in the 16.9 oz size, and the 6.8 oz size is 50% more expensive per oz than the products in the larger packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, they will send you a free sample (don&#x27;t know the size) if you visit the Eucerin website and look up the product.</li>
    <li> Prevents wintertime eczema in all my babies! (3 of them)</li>
    <li> This is rather sticky to the touch, but when your skin is red, scaly and wrecked...it&#x27;s amazing.  This is the base I use on my face and neck prior to sunscreen and it is so restorative.  My neck had looked like thin scales on the surface( prior to using this product) and my face required 3 different moisturizers and STILL wasn&#x27;t as supple .  I use it all over when I get skin rashes and the improvement is amazing.  It was recommended by my dermatologist, BUT the professional relief is the ONLY one that really works on severely dry, irritated skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing . I only put 4 stars instead of 5 because I got this as a free sample and only got to use it one time . After using it for the first time my skin (legs; didn&#x27;t have much to put on) felt so soft and it gave my legs a glow to them . I tan every single day in the tanning bed so this is by far the best lotion I used for my dry skin !</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be more emollient than the typical lotion I buy.  It is a good lotion, but not better at tackling extremely dry heels and such than any other lotion I have tried.  Eucerin&#x27;s sludgy cream is a good option that really helps with my dry, cracked heels.</li>
    <li> This really works good!</li>
    <li> works not sure which one is better eucerin or cetaphil</li>
    <li> To apply lotion to my skin after a nice invigorating &amp; cleansing shower was always something that never made sense to me. It seemed as if I was undoing what the shower had just done, which was make me feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;. But sadly different ages &amp; different stages, combined with living in sunny Florida, bring different problems! So I&#x27;d been looking for something to deal with the extremely dry skin I seem to have developed in recent years. Of course, I wanted something that was not sticky, or heavy that made me feel like I had never even taken a shower. A lot of lotions later, I found this Eucerin, that promised it would do the job, &amp; not make me feel \\&quot;icky\\&quot; as opposed to clean. I find it does just that, with no unpleasant odor. And for me, the price is right!</li>
    <li> This is perhaps the greatest skin product on the market. Closest thing to fountain of youth that is attainable.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommened</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to spend lots more money anymore looking for a lotion that works! This lotion really does help dry skin a lot!! It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;thin\\&quot; but it absorbs well and you can see a difference in a few weeks. I&#x27;m so thrilled that there is a dry skin product that actually does work.</li>
    <li> My Foot doctor recommend, And it sure work for me. You should try it You should try it now Pls</li>
    <li> I think I tried every product on the&lt;br /&gt;planet, nothing helped and most were pure grease. I purchased this product and It WORKED. NOT GREASY! Feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Lois A</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion several times so far and I would say it is \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; good.  I bought this product because I work in the healthcare field and my hands are terribly dry due to the constant hand washing that I do throughout the day everyday.  They become so dry that they crack and bleed.  I finally decided that I needed something that claimed to be for extremely dry skin.  What I have found after using this lotion is that it seems to do a good job of moisturizing my hands if I begin applying it regularly at the first sign of my hands becoming extremely dry.  If I wait a few hours too long and my hands have already begun to crack, it burns when I put it on.  Also, one other small complaint that I have about this lotion is that it seems to feel a little tacky at times. I always apply it on clean hands, but even so, I feel that I need to wash it off and start over again when it begins to feel tacky.  This happens quite regularly, probably every 3-4 times I use it.  Overall, I think this lotion is worth a try if you are suffering from extremely dry hands like I do.  It seemed a little expensive at first, but after receiving the bottle in the mail, I realized that it is a nice size and the lotion goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> Love it, goes on great and leaves no oily residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;IF you wear the compression hose, this is great. Especially on the feet.</li>
    <li> Good product for dry skin.  It really helps make my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> helps in the winter months</li>
</ol>
