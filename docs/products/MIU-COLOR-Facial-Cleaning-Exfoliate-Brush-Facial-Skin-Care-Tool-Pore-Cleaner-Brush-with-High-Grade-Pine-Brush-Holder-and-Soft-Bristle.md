      <li>and you&#x27;ll notice how nice your skin feels.</li>
      <li>So this brush is a nice solution for her situation.</li>
      <li>Really nice :) lathers amazingly (almost lathers TOO well) and</li>

      <li>The brush contains more than 400.000 bristles, which is one reason I ordered the brush.</li>
      <li>However the one thing she dislikes more than going in to wash her face is when I suggest she use an exfoliate to scrub flaky skin areas and help scrape the oils causing blackheads out of her pours.</li>
      <li>and I do feel much more cleaner with this brush tool than washing manually with my fingers or hands.</li>
      <li>love this brush.  </li>
      <li>It sheds hairs after a month of using, but not too many.</li>
      <li>I hope they should make more sturdy.</li>

      <li>I use it every morning and night with my favorite cleansing bar.</li>
      <li>I wanted something more exfoliating</li>

      <li>The brush itself is very soft and works really good.</li>
      <li>Accurate for its price</li>
      <li>I would have liked it better if it were a natural boar bristle</li>
      <li>I like the softness and the density, also the cute handle as it fits right in your palm.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s definitely very soft and feels really nice on your face.</li>
      <li>I also own a Clarisonic professional ...and believe me there is no comparison in cleansing..</li>
      <li>b/c a towel does a much better job and is much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Perfect for anyone who has delicate soon.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the claim of having antimicrobial bristles is true.</li>
      <li>It has helped me tremendously with my oily acne skin.</li>
      <li>I love it and will be ordering more during the holiday to give to all who would appreciate the quality and craftsmanship that it takes to make this terrific product.</li>
      <li>Pretty comfortable to use this brush washing my face.  </li>
      <li>I bought this after reading Chandler&#x27;s (a top reveiwers) awesome review and because my daughter misplaced her sonic facial cleanser</li>
      <li>She enjoys how soft it is, and she&#x27;s able to use her acne cleanser with this brush clean her face.</li>
      <li>I prefer to use a natural sponge on my face, which seems to clean my pores better.</li>
      <li>the bristles are very fine and soft.</li>
      <li>This little brush is great for traveling.</li>
      <li>Overall using the brush on my face it felt nice</li>
      <li>I must say it was worth it.</li>
      <li>husband liked the way the brush looked and attempted to confiscate it for his shaving needs but found that it did not foam well with his shaving cream and returned it back to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth every dollar you spend, and affordable luxury.</li>
      <li>I just rinse it very well until it runs clear or soap residue and put in front of a fan, and it looks good as new in the morning!</li>
      <li>Very soft and high quality brush, I use it to clean my face and it&#x27;s so comfortable and give you a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean your face very well.</li>
      <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate; more like gently massages your skin, which is a good thing for circulation and removing dead skin cells.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and feels great but is not very useful.</li>
      <li>I use this facial brush in the shower, when washing my face,  it feels great on my skin like a mini facial, I would recommend this to a friend!</li>
      <li>First of all, when i received this in the mail, I found the box that the Miu Color Brush came in says &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Thinking that it could be a dud, I then realized later that there was a english/chinese webpage in the MiuColor site, so I assumed it was ok, although I did think it was &amp;#34;USA Made&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I think this is great for sensitive skin because it does not scrub your face harshly.</li>
      <li>but if you have sensitive skin this should be a nice gentle facial brush.</li>
      <li>Really love this tiny brush and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Super soft brush.  </li>
      <li>even though it cleanses your face, it makes your pores super sensitive</li>
      <li>I try to dry it out between each use, squeezing the water out and drying it on a towel, but it&#x27;s still damp most of the time, yet I haven&#x27;t noticed any mildew.</li>
      <li>Bristles are super soft, doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate but I like it for washing my face</li>
      <li>The brush is very high quality.</li>
      <li>It is a huge improvement from my last brush.</li>
      <li>I readily agreed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is much softer, and feels like a getle massage.</li>
      <li>This does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>The bristles are extremely soft,  a bit softer than I wanted, but perhaps more gentle for facial skin.</li>
      <li>So far I am liking this brush very much.</li>
      <li>I think I applied too much pressure and was left with a red face, but now I know better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small and fits nicely in your hand.</li>
      <li>And the wood handle has not faded or warped and I use this brush mainly in the shower.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am going to have to agree with all of the people who said this brush is way too soft. I thought I wanted to get an exfoliating brush a bit on the softer side, because my skin is sensitive, but this thing is so soft it really is useless for exfoliating. I noticed no difference in my skin after using it. The bristles feel as soft as my kabuki brush....</li>
    <li> Had high hopes. I don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference, now it just sits in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> even though it cleanses your face, it makes your pores super sensitive</li>
    <li> The brush contains more than 400.000 bristles, which is one reason I ordered the brush. It is helpful with my clogged pores on my nose and chin. Easy to use and foam with my cleanser. The problem is a bit hard to dry.</li>
    <li> very nice!  cleans deeply</li>
    <li> love this brush.  it is extremely soft and gentle.</li>
    <li> This little brush is great for traveling. The bristles are a bit too soft for me, but they might be perfect for another person. The brush is very high quality.</li>
    <li> The bristles are extremely soft,  a bit softer than I wanted, but perhaps more gentle for facial skin.</li>
    <li> First of all, when i received this in the mail, I found the box that the Miu Color Brush came in says &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;. Thinking that it could be a dud, I then realized later that there was a english/chinese webpage in the MiuColor site, so I assumed it was ok, although I did think it was &amp;#34;USA Made&amp;#34;. Overall using the brush on my face it felt nice and I do feel much more cleaner with this brush tool than washing manually with my fingers or hands. I have combo/oil/sensitve skin, which I find a pain to treat, but this product does not irritate me at the least (for now). If it does so in the future, I probably just use less in a week.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:87549f1aab42143c4ac778fd247f6cb7]] I normally use a basic wash cloth for exfoliating my face. I have never used a brush for cleaning my face and when MIU COLOR asked me to test this brush and share my experience with other people I readily agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very full, it has a lot of very thin bristles (400,000 according to the manufacturer). I have attached a video which shows the brush both dry and wet. When you apply it to your skin it feels very different from a wash cloth. It is much softer, and feels like a getle massage. It is a pleasant feeling. I used with my favorite Burt Bees cream cleanser with it and that combination worked quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband liked the way the brush looked and attempted to confiscate it for his shaving needs but found that it did not foam well with his shaving cream and returned it back to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s the bottom line? I liked how MIU brush feels on my face and I use it as part of my morning routine. However, I have not given up my wash-cloth during my evening face cleaning. What I like about a wash cloth that I can wash it a washing machine and it removes makeup better. But it is wonderful to wake up with a gentle cleaning and massage of my face with the MIU brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin has started to get an oily look with some blemishes to go along with it, typical of many young teens her age. She avoids washing her face if she can help it, so the oils tend to build up in the pours and her skin always looks like it could use a good scrub. However the one thing she dislikes more than going in to wash her face is when I suggest she use an exfoliate to scrub flaky skin areas and help scrape the oils causing blackheads out of her pours. She dislikes the coarse feeling of exfoliates immensely and from the way she protests, she sounds like she goes from (almost) 13 to 3 years of age when it&#x27;s time to wash her face with something to help her acne. So this brush is a nice solution for her situation. She enjoys how soft it is, and she&#x27;s able to use her acne cleanser with this brush clean her face. Being that she has this little bush to use now, she finds washing her face to bit less of a chore, so she does it more often. She loves how soft it is when it&#x27;s dry. This exfoliating brush is a great choice when you want something that will help scrub your skin, but feels very soft and non-irritating when doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample was provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> Bristles are super soft, doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate but I like it for washing my face</li>
    <li> The brush is way too soft for me - so soft that it does not get into pores to do thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks and it smells disgusting...also the brush is way too soft.</li>
    <li> I like this but the brush is actually a little too soft. I wanted something more exfoliating but if you have sensitive skin this should be a nice gentle facial brush.</li>
    <li> I must wait until I have used it a while just had it a week but will follow up.  I had bumps that would not  go away even with scrub  I plan to try the nose brush</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this one bristles are to soft</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting something that would &#x27;scrub&amp;#34; my face, something a little stiffer. So before I tried the brush, I was a little disappointed. Then I tried it and although it is very soft, it makes my face feel wonderful afterward. I use an olive oil cleanser followed by an olive oil based cleansing soap, my face feels very soft! So far I like it and will be keeping the brush.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this brush!  One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used on my face - soft bristles, yet feels invigorating!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00DBRP3A6 MIU COLOR&amp;#8482 Facial Cleaning Exfoliate brush, Facial Skin Care Tool, Pore Cleaner Brush with high grade pine brush holder and soft bristle]] I have extremely oily skin..and this brush works like magic in cleansing my skin. I also own a Clarisonic professional ...and believe me there is no comparison in cleansing..granted the Clarisonic does a good job but this little inexpensive brush does an even more \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; job.  Just to mention..the bristles are extremely soft and is in a wooden base...very well made!</li>
    <li> I alternate this brush with another that is slightly stiffer depending on how often I am brushing or how sensitive my skin is at the time. This brush is excellent for those times my skin feels sensitive or irritated for some reason. It is well made and I like the feel of the wooden handle, as well.</li>
    <li> This is such a delicate brush with tons of teeny tiny soft bristles, and it&#x27;s done my face so much good!  I use it every morning and night with my favorite cleansing bar. I just swish it over my face in gentle quick little circles, taking a couple of minutes to gently scrub my whole face slowly.  I&#x27;ve noticed my pores getting smaller, fewer breakouts, and people have complimented my skin.  I feel like those tiny bristles really do get into every pore.  I try to dry it out between each use, squeezing the water out and drying it on a towel, but it&#x27;s still damp most of the time, yet I haven&#x27;t noticed any mildew. Perhaps the claim of having antimicrobial bristles is true.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  This small soft brush has really cleared my completion. I&#x27;ve had problem skin all my life and using this every two days has changed my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is remarkably soft and works very well.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect gentle brush. It&#x27;s small and fits nicely in your hand. cleans thoroughly and you&#x27;ll notice how nice your skin feels. Rinses easily.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, until I tried a facial brush for myself. I love this brush! Not only is it an eco tool, but it&#x27;s a quality brush. And so soft. Worth every dollar you spend, and affordable luxury. It sheds hairs after a month of using, but not too many. And the wood handle has not faded or warped and I use this brush mainly in the shower.</li>
    <li> I adore this brush! It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Super soft brush.  I saw brushes like these selling for $150 and I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  Great invention and glad I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush and think it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Really nice face brush. Very soft and gentle. Not an exfoliating brush!!!</li>
    <li> Really nice :) lathers amazingly (almost lathers TOO well) and the bristles are very fine and soft.</li>
    <li> So far I am liking this brush very much. It is a huge improvement from my last brush. I noticed I had to be careful though since I was a little rough at first. I think I applied too much pressure and was left with a red face, but now I know better. It is very soft and the bristles seem to be very solid. I haven&#x27;t seen any fall out.</li>
    <li> This brush developed with an unpleasant odor after only a couple weeks of light use. I tried to rinse it completely and wait until it&#x27;s air-dried before using it again. A total waste of money!</li>
    <li> This thing is sooooo soft and dense. Absolutely love it. The small size makes it a little bit awkward to hold at times, but over all, it is just an awesome facial brush.</li>
    <li> This was a very good deal and I love the brush.</li>
    <li> Beautifully made and everything, no complaints there - really nice.  But it&#x27;s SO SOFT it has absolutely no value for me as a facial cleansing brush.  Cannot recommend this.  Also very small.</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate; more like gently massages your skin, which is a good thing for circulation and removing dead skin cells. It takes quite a while to dry because it&#x27;s very DENSE. I just rinse it very well until it runs clear or soap residue and put in front of a fan, and it looks good as new in the morning! I think this is great for sensitive skin because it does not scrub your face harshly. I like the softness and the density, also the cute handle as it fits right in your palm. It&#x27;s just tedious to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> This is literally a paintbrush.</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful! It is so soft and delicate to the skin. Not abrasive as the battery operated plastic one I bought at 10X the price. I love it and will be ordering more during the holiday to give to all who would appreciate the quality and craftsmanship that it takes to make this terrific product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in Oct 2013. I hope to clean my pores. But I used it for over a month, 2 times per day. I then stopped using it b/c a towel does a much better job and is much cheaper. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> i purchased this for exfoliating but the bristles are too soft to do any thing to that extent. its like taking a rabbits foot keychain and trying to exfoliate with that.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! The brush part was apart from the wood handle after second use. It attached again when I put them together, but detached again while I am using it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading Chandler&#x27;s (a top reveiwers) awesome review and because my daughter misplaced her sonic facial cleanser and she loovvvveeeesss it. Now I&#x27;m going to get one for me!!</li>
    <li> Too soft for me and it got dirty and I couldn&#x27;t get it clean for nothing! It was okay but just a little too soft to really clean my pothole pores!</li>
    <li> I prefer to use a natural sponge on my face, which seems to clean my pores better.</li>
    <li> The brush itself is very soft and works really good. I was going to give 5 stars, but yesterday night the brush fell off from the hand grip.  Now I have to glue it together back. I hope they should make more sturdy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week, haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin but don&#x27;t use it daily. Main thing is that the bristles are soft and numerous and the brush has not fallen out of the handle yet. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very nice facial brush! Accurate for its price</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing. It is even too soft to brush an infants hair....how this could even be called an exfoliating brush is beyond me.</li>
    <li> This is a well made brush. I have bought several of these for my daughters and myself. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out like they do with some other brushes. I would have liked it better if it were a natural boar bristle but this is an excellent alternative.</li>
    <li> I must say it was worth it. Shipping super fast and the price is pretty fair. It has helped me tremendously with my oily acne skin. Very soft and high quality brush, I use it to clean my face and it&#x27;s so comfortable and give you a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t get the purpose of this brush at all. it&#x27;s very soft and would only work well if you have extremely hyper sensitive skin. i do not. i was look for an exfoliating brush that i could use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Leaves my face feeling clean and smooth!</li>
    <li> I wanted a face cleaning tool that wasn&#x27;t too scratchy or rough, but this one is too soft.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any scrubbing/exfoliating going on at all, and my normally dry skin has started to break out b/c it&#x27;s just not clean enough.</li>
    <li> From the photo hard to see how soft the brush bristles really are.  Wow! really is silky smooth, but extremely sturdy to keep cleansers and other lotions on the brush without oozing into the inside of the brush or sliding off before getting on your face.  Love it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely very soft and feels really nice on your face. I don&#x27;t know that it does much exfoliating, since it is so soft. For exfoliating I prefer my facial sponge to the brush.</li>
    <li> This facial brush is extremely soft. Perfect for anyone who has delicate soon. I like this product.</li>
    <li> Too soft. Fell apart.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a good item, but after a while it began to have an odor that was unpleasant and probably not sanitary.  So I had to throw it out.  For some reason the bristles never dry out because it is so dense.  Had a horribly musty smell.</li>
    <li> I use this facial brush in the shower, when washing my face,  it feels great on my skin like a mini facial, I would recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> This brush is a perfect blend between scrubbing and gentle. I have oily, but sensitive skin. Most face scrubbers are too rough and cause irritation, or too soft to get rid of the oil and grime. The bristles are soft and make a solid base for washing and provide a nice massaging action as you move it around. I&#x27;ve been using it for several days now and have notices my pores are cleaner and I&#x27;m not having problems with ruddiness or irritation from scrubbing too hard. I&#x27;ve been using it with charcoal bar soap and my skin has been soft and even since using the combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day and it is true that the bristles don&#x27;t dry out completely, but it wouldn&#x27;t have the same soft quality if it wasn&#x27;t as dense. I will probably replace it every three months, but that is what I do with any of my skin care brushes.</li>
    <li> very soft bristles, we love it!</li>
    <li> Pretty comfortable to use this brush washing my face.  Love the feeling around the nose area. Really love this tiny brush and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, soft and exfoliated well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean your face very well. I noticed no difference after using it for a week. It&#x27;s very soft and feels great but is not very useful.</li>
