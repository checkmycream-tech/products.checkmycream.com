<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying many many kinds of shampoos and conditioners from the cheap ones to the expensive ones for years and recently was told about this brand. I gave it a shot since it is not that expensive and easy to find. To my surprise, the products by far is the most productive ones and actually work. Definitely use these in a pair (shampoo and conditioner) in order to achieve a smooth result, light scent. I have permed and colored hair for years. Other kinds of shampoos and conditioners tend to make my hair fall out a lot after a shower. This brand limits that problem and still helps soften and detangle. Will keep using these.</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo it makes my hair feel luxurious and thick</li>
    <li> I purchased this, biotin, multivitamins and hair brush for shampooing my hair and my hair grew so much! I&#x27;m excited :)</li>
    <li> Love it still using it in April 2015 since I brought this last year September 2014. Natural feel</li>
    <li> my girl friend like this</li>
    <li> If Volume is what You want, this is the best shampoo I ever tried, also my hair looks shine and healthy. It makes what it promises. Very hapy</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great Deal!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this stuff  the other night, because I have heard that it&#x27;s really good.  I&#x27;ve been using Redken, but it&#x27;s too much money for me now.    First off, I find the shampoo and conditioner to have a very pleasant smell.  And when I wash my hair with it, it makes my hair feel very soft.  It also helps define the natural waves in my hair.  I have naturally thick, coarse hair, a bit past the soldiers, and it works wonders, especially when using this frizz-ease lotion stuff after I condition my hair.  I am hoping to grow my hair twice its current length, so this stuff should work good.  Though I really do want to try the deep moisturizing version, just to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t dry up.  I must prevent split ends, so I won&#x27;t have to cut a lot of my hair off again, like I did when I didn&#x27;t know how to care for it properly.    Anyway, this stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> My daughter MUST have this shampoo and conditioner.  She swears by it and her hair IS beautiful.  Mom loves the price!</li>
    <li> I saw this at a local Dollar General store today and decided to buy it. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about it, so I figured why not. I have shoulder length hair and it&#x27;s pretty fried from a lot of dye jobs. My hair is naturally frizzy, though. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, honestly. I washed my hair with the shampoo and conditioner and let my hair air dry. After my hair dried, I went to look in the mirror and the frizzies are GONE! Normally, I have to flat iron my hair and it&#x27;s still a bit frizzy. Not this time. I LOVE Mane &#x27;n Tail. I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> Great for what it is. Inexpensive and classic. The shampoo has a gelly texture and is pretty concentrated. The conditioner is high protein and has a heavy waxy texture. If you haven&#x27;t ever tried Mane N Tail before, give it a shot. I can&#x27;t use this every wash for very long, because of all the protein. Too  much will make hair feel dry and tangly. If that happens to you, give the conditioner a rest, use a different (protein free!) brand, clarify, and do a moisture treatment. However, if your hair is really damaged (relaxed, heat styled, bleached) try it out and see if a little protein can help hold your hair together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strand of hair that stretches and does not return to its original size needs protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair feels mushy when it&#x27;s wet, it needs protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to shell out the cash/time/whatever for a protein treatment, try using this conditioner for a week or two.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use Mane&#x27;N Tail and absolutely love it!  I would definitely recomend it... We even used it to bathe our dog!  Great service as always on the purchase!</li>
    <li> I feel like they changed the formula. Still does its minimal job, but its definitely not the same.</li>
    <li> This is just ok shampoo and conditioner in my opinion. Didn&#x27;t see any real difference</li>
    <li> Extremely awful.  I bought this because of some of the reviews.  However it does not even feel like a conditioner in my hair.  It makes it feel dry, brittle and tangled.  I have used it maybe 2-3 times and won&#x27;t be using it again on myself.</li>
    <li> it dose not work for me</li>
    <li> Love it makes hair so soft and easy the brush</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re hair will feel great! I did notice some thickening as well, and I have pretty thin hair. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Recently, I was hearing some people talked about \\&quot;Mane n&#x27; Tail\\&quot; (Horse) shampoo for human use. First, it sounded strange - but gave it a try. The shampoo is very thick and silky with no strange smell at all. After using the shampoo for 1-2 weeks, I noticed that my hair loss was dramatically lessened. Prior to using this shampoo, I&#x27;ve seen many hair strands washed off from my head every time I wash my hair.    I would recommend this shampoo to anyone that has weak hair roots and losing too much hair during shower. The best part about this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfume or chemicals that can damage your hair more. All of the ingredients in the shampoo are natural. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 5 weeks now. My hair has grown 3/4 of an inch in four weeks, when it usually grows about 1/4 inch in that amount of time. I&#x27;m happy with how fast it&#x27;s making my hair grow, but it seems to leave my hair very dry and frizzy. It feels like it strips your hair of all the natural oils. In order to keep down on the frizz I only use this product about twice a week.</li>
    <li> Hi! I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year and I can honestly say this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! My hair is very long, a little below the middle of my back and this stuff has helped it stay long and very healthy. I never use a blow dryer or straightener tho, because i like to keep as much heat off my hair as possible!&lt;br /&gt;I also use the conditioner and hair detangler made by the same company and they are excellent products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for long, healthy, shinny hair!</li>
    <li> Works good I use it on my labadoddles after each bath to help deal with tangles.</li>
    <li> I bought this duo based on all of the rants and raves on pinterest. I am kinda obsessed with trying to grow my hair long and have tried just about everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not make your hair grow longer! And there are sulfates in the shampoo which is really bad for your hair. I am just about done with the large bottle which has lasted me 4 months. The shampoo has little to no scent, and the conditioner sent washes out with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this to grow your hair I recommend looking into a scalp stimulating shampoo, or clarifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I realized why there are horses on the bottle and not females, it really isn&#x27;t for human hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also come to the conclusion you get what you pay for, if you want nice hair you are going to  have to pay more.</li>
    <li> I never knew this was actually horse shampoo! when I was little my mother had this to use on my hair and I was shocked to see this in the pet section. Needless to say after I washed my dogs with it I tried it on my hair again and I can see why so many parents used this then lol. My hair was shiny clean and very soft; So where my dogs coats. I guess we&#x27;ll be sharing this from now on.</li>
    <li> Shipping time was really fast. The shampoo dries out the hair but the conditioner puts it back in. I use the conditioner with coconut oil. It feels great and I can definitely see less hair coming out when I comb it. Not much breakage as before. Still using until they are finish.</li>
    <li> superb products, my hair is shinier and thicker....great shampoo for any girl.  I use it everyday and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product few months ago. However, last month I got my hair trimmed, and I decided to use mane&amp;tail frequently. And up until now, my hair grew 2 inches long! 2 inches in 1 month! not just that it clarifies and makes my hair soft, shiny, and dandruff-free scalp. It grew my hair amazingly! I highly recommend this prodcut to anyone who wishes long and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. This was less expensive than buying it at our local retailer. Great product for hair.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t grown very much in awhile but I actually saw results.&lt;br /&gt;Even though its a little weird to have horse shampoo and conditioner, I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do great things for my hair. It makes it almost limp.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I can manage my hair much easier after using this shampoo and conditioner. Thank you</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo is really slippy though, so its hard to get it on my head to wash my hair at first lol. But my hair feels really soft after conditioning. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed any split end difference or growth, but at least its softer than usual.</li>
    <li> I wish I had come to this product earlier, because the shampoo and conditioner are wonderful. I have raven black hair and a persistent, although mild, problem with dandruff. A few days into using the s and c, I noticed a real difference in my hair: it is shiny, bouncy, and static-free. It&#x27;s a wonderful feeling really.   I use the big bottles in my bath, but I understand other people&#x27;s complaints that these are heavy. Still, nothing a plastic bottle with a nozzle for each product from the local $$ store can&#x27;t fix.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with mane and tail. Good price!</li>
    <li> For as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve been settling for shampoos that clean my hair but don&#x27;t necessarily do anything nice to it. I ordered Mane &#x27;n Tail at the suggestion of a friend and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I have extremely thick hair that&#x27;s somewhere between wavy and straight, and Mane &#x27;n Tail calms it down while making it very shiny and manageable! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> She claims that this is the only shampoo that creates a sheen and clean feeling. Makes her hair manageable  and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but from what I can see, this product does help to lock in moisture for your hair but it does not help with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have a dog that I am having trouble with itchy skin. have done everything. looked at the conditioner and it suggested a solution of water and conditioner sprayed on. working very well. shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent.  Your hair comes out feeling clean and bouncy.  It&#x27;s great to use a shampoo that you and your husband can share.  He actually asked for it by name when it came time to replace shampoos -- according to him nothing else would do!  He never paid any attention to shampoo before, so I guess it really made an impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product.  BTW, being somewhat skeptical, I called the company to ask if they really used it on horses, as I was told.  She assured me that they did and that It was completely safe.  Glad I took a chance.</li>
    <li> not much to say, other than it is what I expected.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! It made my hair healthier, and it&#x27;s growing faster too! It may not work on everyone so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s tricky, but it worked for me and I love it!</li>
    <li> It works as shampoo/Conditioner but did not wow me. It is not as moisturizing as it could be. If you have thick curly and dry-ish hair, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Started using this shampoo and conditioner 5 days ago.  First time I haven&#x27;t needed a toolbox of beauty products just for my hair to not look bad.  I have thin, fine, processed hair.  In my mid 40&#x27;s and truly started losing hope that I could ever have nice hair again.  Not very nice since my 20&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve kept it short simply because it grows so painfully slow and then just looks stringy and lifeless.  I use quality products and should own stock in Beauty Express for all I&#x27;ve spent.  Right now I shampoo once with Mane N Tail then use the conditioner for 2-5 minutes (have used very little conditioner in the past because even Biolage VolumeBloom makes my hair flat).  I rinse out then put about a dime size amount on as a leave in conditioner.  I am not using a paste, mousse, gel, texturizer, blow out cream at all now.  Just cool air blow dryer and some hairspray to style a bit.  Amazing!  I will provide additional updates as I use this product longer.  Not using any other shampoo or conditioner.  So far, these are products of the highest quality.  To all the other middle aged ladies and gents out there feeling little hope, give this a chance.</li>
    <li> The package is so poor, and the product was spilled...</li>
    <li> this works wonders. for my hairIt make it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Okay so I have seriously been trying to grow out my hair... since... FOREVER! I recently just got it chopped and I am ready to grow out long healthy hair. I had to start over since i was doing some things wrong... Anyways, I absolutley love this product. My hair is dry and frizzy and thick. I always get split ends and my hair seems to never be \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot;. If anyone has hair like that...this is def for you! After the first wash, I was so amazed. My hair was actually moisturized! It wasnt dry, or frizzy! I followed up after the shower with Biosilk hair serum. INCREDIBLE combo! My hair is so soft, and I am hoping to see results soon!</li>
    <li> sister got it she liked it and i used it and it really leaves your hair super soft :P</li>
    <li> I love love the shampoo + conditioner (esp. the conditioner).  Was planning on purchasing via Amazon...this 32oz shamp/cond combo...but, gratefully, I was at Safeway prior to submitting order and found them for $5.99 ea...not on sale; regular price people.  So, nearly half Amazon&#x27;s listed price!!  Walgreens pricing is better than Amazon&#x27;s too...$7.49 ea :).</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I have ever used that made my hair silky, smooth, shimmery, and non-frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF SMELLS AMAZING TOO</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo in great hopes that it would do wonders to my hair. My hair is absolutely the same 5 months later. I would not recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I was losing a great amount of hair in the shower and after using this product for about two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen less breakage. The condition is also fantastic at detangling knots. Plus, the bottles are so big it&#x27;ll last for a while.</li>
    <li> When I first received this Shampoo and Conditioner I was excited. My hair is very wavy and it was very thick prior to using this shampoo. It did make my hair a lot straighter but I started to notice that every time I used it clumps of my hair would fall out (triple the amount that usually comes out from washing and brushing). I thought I was being silly but by the third time I used the shampoo it was starting to become apparently that my hair was getting thinner when I went to braid it or put it up in a hair tie. Just to be absolutely certain the shampoo was the culprit I tried switching back to one of my other shampoos for a week. I saw a noticeable reduction in the amount of hair that I was coming off in my brush. I then tried using this shampoo and conditioner one more time and sure enough clumps of hair starting coming out again. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all shampoos and conditioners. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy in-store where I live, though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received two shampoos and no conditioner. Very disappointed with the screw up.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair full and thick.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells good, affordable, and is good for my hair and for my lab&#x27;s coat. I like to use this for myself between using more expensive shampoo/conditioner and I think my hair is shinier and healthier now that I&#x27;ve started using it. I like to use this for my Labrador retriever as well, he smells good and feels soft and it seems to help him shed less.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast but the shampoo had leaked a little. About a tablespoon.</li>
    <li> I used this product in the past and my curls are loose, soft and shiny. This product is not meant to smell great like other products you buy at the supermarket but it does its job. I like this product because it stimulates the roots and ends of my wild mess hair :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 months and my hair soft, thick and strong! I love it I recommend it to anybody looking to make thier hair healthier! also yes my hair did grow about 4 inches since using it (:</li>
    <li> Before using Mane n&#x27; Tail my hair grew about a half an inch every 2 months. I have been using Mane n&#x27; tail for about a month and I have noticed a huge difference in the quality of my hair. Not only is it shinier and softer, but I havent had any breakage (and my hair breaks easily), I have also noticed a length difference. Its totally worth every cent and it has helped my hair a ton :)</li>
    <li> Hair type: thick wavy hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Shampoo 5 stars, I absolutely love how it makes my hair feel completely clean of build up and it smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conditioner on the other hand was a complete bust.  I give it 1 star.  I hate how it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling smooth and sleek but more like a tangled rats nest!  I did try the conditioner for about 3 weeks before I couldn&#x27;t handle the tangled mess anymore and kicked it to the trash.</li>
    <li> It came in a day later! It was fast shipping I was a happy camper. The bottles are huge so they should last a very long time(: my mom has used this product for a year and she said it worked fast and her hair grew so long down her back in a couple of months. She said this product works really well with frizzy, course, hair. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it but we have Hawaiian hair and it works really well really fast. I bought this product and my hair was an inch below my bra strap line and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and my hair is now in the middle of my bra strap and above my butt, so it worked really well for me. BUT! I stopped using heat products in my hair and after my hair was dry from the shower I put my hair up in a bun and went to sleep. This is MY routine that I did for a while and I&#x27;m still using this product and very satisfied😄😍</li>
    <li> Lots of people complain that this stuff makes your hair frizzy, but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do! This shampoo and conditioner strips all the products, dirt, sweat, and chemicals from your hair and leaves just hair. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t strip color (I know, I dyed my hair almost a year ago. My color never faded a bit until I switched to another product for a week. I immediately switched back. Except for a brown spot under everything else near my neck - thanks to Garnier - my hair has been black for a year  and I&#x27;ve had NO fading!). If you really have a problem with having frizzy hair, rub lotion on your hands and rub the extra lotion over frizzy parts. This is only temporary, it lasts for an hour, but it&#x27;s an easy solution with out putting more products in your hair. This shampoo is not only an amazing cleaner, it smells great. I will never use anything else again!</li>
    <li> i love it and i don&#x27;t mind shopping with u again i am in love with it and don&#x27;t mind buying it again</li>
    <li> This is the best for bathing my dogs!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has always been a favorite of mine, especially when you&#x27;re looking to keep hair strong and manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not saying this product is going to work on everybody&#x27;s hair but it did work on mine. I feel like it did make my hair grow faster by around a quarter every month. Realistically, it made my hair grow faster but only by a little bit every month. The shampoo is very strong; it definitely cleans your hair completely but it leaves it feeling coarse and a bit harsh. The conditioner is good but I personally didn&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t make the coarseness of the shampoo go away, it made it a little bit soft but that&#x27;s it( just get the shampoo and a good conditioner from Walmart or something). The smell is not bad...it smells clean:)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews claiming that it detangles and made coarse hair feel smooth. I found that it did neither. My hair is fine but I have alot of it so it tangles easily. After using the shampoo and conditioner my hair was still a tangled mess. As for the texture, my hair also felt coarse and that it still needed to be conditioned. I would not recommend this product and do not intend to finish what I have which is disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great I love these shampoo and conditioner they really do work. my hair was a pixie cut and in a matter of months it has grown about and 1 inch 1/2 which is amazing i really want my hair to grow and it seems to b working with this shampoo and conditionor i like this better then the ones the have at target.</li>
    <li> Probably better for horses, than humans.  Reading the set of instructions on the container, There is one set for humans, and another for horses.</li>
    <li> i like them,they make my hair looks more and natural.Though they are used  only for animals before ,for horses,haha .</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo and Conditioner! I have been using it for a few weeks now and my hair is super soft and also begging to grow longer (I have a Fault in our Stars Hazel hair cut) I recommend this shampoo an conditioner to anybody with dry damaged hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since the late 70&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&amp; keeps your hair so healthy! My hair grows rapidly while using&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I trim every 3 months. I love the smell, but at times I find&lt;br /&gt;myself neighing....lol...just kidding.  It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Got it on Saturday 5/26/2012, very nice shampoo and conditioner, it clean your hair and help your hair grow.  I will buy these from now on if the price not raising in the future.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes when I bought this. About a week of using this stuff, I noticed there were more hairs in my brush than usual. Then when I ran my hands through my hair, clumps of my hair fell out!! THIS STUFF MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT. I should add my hair was totally healthy to begin with, I just wanted it to grow. I had to spend $70 in other products just to un-do the damage it did, but it&#x27;s going to take forever for the rest of it to grow back and I&#x27;m extremely upset. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. The probable benefits do NOT outweigh the possibility of this happening.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across Mane &#x27;N Tail Shampoo and Conditioner when I was searching for a way to keep my hair from falling out. Admittedly, I bought it thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much since it&#x27;s claims to thicken hair. But, this product almost completely stopped my hair loss. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The one downfall is your hair may not feel quite as soft as before (But at least I have hair). Other than that small detail, I have no complaints. Great product.</li>
    <li> Have used these products before and this was by far the best price available.  Products came quickly and on time.  Will purchase again if price stay the same.</li>
    <li> Lately my hair has become brittle and difficult to manage and i have tried dozens of different products with indifferent results. A friend reminded me of  Mane n Tail - yay! Makes all the difference in my hair - not as brittle and much more manageable! So glad the product is still here!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feels every soft. I have just been using it for a few weeks but I can see that my hair is growing nice and healthy</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, but people were saying it was working great so I gave it a try. One thing people somewhat complained about was that it was drying their hair out, well I have naturally oily hair and no matter what I have tried I haven&#x27;t solved that problem, so I was actually hoping that the drying out part might be true. Turns out it works perfectly with my hair it is not oily anymore and looks smooth and shiney now!!!</li>
    <li> No more hair all over the bathroom floor....now thick hair on my head!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff its amazing and lasts forever and it makes my hair shine and feel baby soft i tell everyone about this shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner on my hair and it really has been growing!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Decided to start growing my hair long, but it&#x27;s been brittle and breaking.  This stuff is amazing.  In a few short weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a tremendous improvement.  My hair is stronger, shinier, and it feels great.  This is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ll use from here on out.</li>
    <li> At first it was good but I started noticing red bumps on my scalp after my 9th use</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used the shampoo and conditioner for almost 3 months and notice my hair is regrowing.  Looks like it works for me.</li>
    <li> I was SO excited to try this product because of all the good reviews, and especially the ones that claimed it makes your hair grow fast. I had bleached and dyed my hair and it got thin and damaged, so I had to chop a lot off. That being said, I wanted to grow it out fast and restore my hair&#x27;s health. The shampoo on the first use made my hair feel great and it was voluminous but subsequent uses didn&#x27;t do anything. The conditioner in particular is not good in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t moisturize well whether you use it in the shower or as a leave-in texturizer. Disappointed, especially as I had ordered a large size so I&#x27;d save myself the hassle of ordering again soon.  I&#x27;ve been using it a few months now and it&#x27;s just like regular shampoo to me (actually I prefer my other drugstore shampoos!). Mane n Tail shampoo strips my hair of it&#x27;s natural oils and is an absolute no-no for coloured hair! Because it contains harsh sulfates, which I researched only AFTER I bought it, I now use it once or twice a month as a clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> The only thing I do not like about the product is I have to color my hair much more frequently because I notice that it strips the color from covering my gray.  If this product were sulfate free, I would rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 20 years, just took a break to try a few of the newest products for this same purpose. It has always worked great and there is no substitute for Mane &#x27;N Tail Conditioner and Shampoo! I have used it on my own hair for more than 20 years. The conditioner can not be beaten, you actually feel the difference immediately. Many people will also enjoy the great smell they both have! I recommend it to anyone who wants softer, shinier hair instantly. My Poms just love it and shows it by running towards the Bath Room when I start gathering these products from their little pet care box. If you need to use a medicated shampoo for you or your pets, just add a bit of Tea Tree Oil to it before you use it, great for fleas, itching and minor irritations that Dogs sometimes have, and people too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok with nice fragrance but it&#x27;s not great.  I use it because it&#x27;s there. It hasn&#x27;t really done anything special for my hair. I do like the rinse because it&#x27;s not greasy and feel very light.</li>
    <li> My mom loves it. She said it made her hair so soft. For someone who only buys 40 dollar shampoo hair products etc at a salon I&#x27;m happy she loved it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! I had very healthy hair that was already quite long but I wanted it to grow more - I heard this shampoo would help. It literally made my hair fall out! I started noticing more hair in my comb and around the house and now it&#x27;s noticeably thinner around my temples! I used this for a couple of months without putting two and two together! I threw the bottles out tonight and picked up some salon grade shampoo for thin hair. I hope I can repair the damage and stop the hair loss. I&#x27;m disgusted with this product!</li>
    <li> Only conditioner I got.</li>
    <li> When I 1st started to use it it made my hair hard and straw like. I was about ready to give up. But I fiured I spent so much on it I&#x27;ll use it a bit more and I&#x27;m glad I did ! It&#x27;s made my hair much softer and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;As in making it grow not sure yet I had some split ends I cut off so it&#x27;s hard to tell. But as for the texture it feels amazing :)</li>
    <li> Everything other people have said about Mane &#x27;N Tail is true!!! Have been using it for a few months now. The Shampoo cleans your hair thoroughly, other shampoos cause me dandruff problems but this doesn&#x27;t and even remove my dandruff on first use. The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. FYI, I&#x27;m a guy user and I&#x27;m totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair, and keeping away from blowdrying/ironing it. I have seen this product on the shelf for years, and decided to try it. From the 1st use, my hair felt (no pun intended) tamer. It was softer, and with visibly less frizz. Your hair feels, literally silky smooth after a few uses.  The smell of the product is not overpowering at all, its very mild. From what I&#x27;ve experienced so far, I will very likely stick with this product for the long run. As for hair growth, I hope it helps, too. And even if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m still getting my money&#x27;s worth by having healthy, manageable, shiny looking hair!</li>
    <li> BEARD. Yes, that is what I use this for, and it works awesome. My beard retains softness for longer and is much more manageable, as it&#x27;s prone to chia pet outwards to infinity. It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since learned it&#x27;s also available locally at wallyworld. I only mention that BECAUSE...out of the 3 times I&#x27;ve ordered this here, 2 were secured with tape across the cap. 1 was not. The shipment without the tape leaked all over the entire box of Christmas presents that were a part of the same order. AND the vendor never responded to my complaint.</li>
    <li> I bought these because someone told me it would help prevent hair loss.  Since using both products I can tell a huge difference in the amount of hair that comes out in the shower and when I comb it.  Very very good product</li>
    <li> Made my hair so incredibly knotted!!! Even with gentle combing I lost more hair than prior to using this.</li>
    <li> I got my hair cut a bit too short and started using this to try and grow it out. That was about two to three weeks ago. My hair definitely has grown out a little but I am not sure how much is mane n tail and how much is just natural grow out after a cut. Either way I am not too impressed and won&#x27;t be using it again after I finish it which will take a while. First it does not have a nice fresh clean smell that most shampoos/conditioners have. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything but I miss having great smelling hair after a shower. The shampoo is pretty harsh and dries my hair a bit, and the conditioner does not get it super soft again like other conditioners. It is not horrible but I am not that impressed by it.</li>
    <li> It smells good. I barely started using it so hopefully it does make my hair grow quicker. Im excited but dont want to be disappointed</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Original formula product its amazing!  I have tried all types of salon backed hair products, yet this product seem to all to satisfy all aspects you could ask for, leaving my straight coarse sun beaten hair clean, soft, naturally  managable.  I did not expect much at first but will become a loyal consumer of this product.</li>
    <li> This product has very good use in it. It makes you&#x27;re hair really soft and smooth. I believe it does really make your hair grow. And for people that have color hair I have blonde highlights in my hair and it did not effect my hair color by using this hair product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase. Have been using it for two weeks now and can feel my hair starting to feel stronger. I have really thin stringy hair and after using this I have noticed a little more volume which is awesome. I would definitely recommend this buy!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, and thanks to going to college with some equestrian majors, have used it for years. I wanted to get more, but couldn&#x27;t find it at any local pet stores as I did back home. Lo and behold I found it at my local supermarket shopping one day for about 6 dollars per bottle- at least HALF the cost of the price on amazon!</li>
    <li> works amazing. love the way it smells</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair and thought this would help with growth. i couldn&#x27;t even use it for a week as it dried my hair out and I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. I was quite bummed considering the amount that was wasted. I personally would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and had high expectations......  I think I would have had better results using dish soap and olive oil as a conditioner.  I will however use this when I bathe my dog.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give you the semi short version. You can find this in Walmart in the pet section for about $11.00 for both of them together. Started using this on June 29, 2013 and today, it&#x27;s July 13, 2013. So in 15 days using this, my hair has grown almost a full inch. I use to have very long, very thick hair but it has all broken off and I haven&#x27;t been able to grow it at all for over 13 years. I got use to using extensions and such. Not a fan of weave &amp; the money it costs so trying to make the effort to take care of and grow my own hair. I take those hair and nail vitamins every day, but for the record, I had been taking those for over a year with no progress (except longer nails). ONLY when I started using Mane N Tail did I see any results. Hair feels super clean, new growth comes in fast and thick now, it&#x27;s not as brittle and the conditioner makes it super strong. For the record, I&#x27;m a black woman with a natural curl pattern, even though I do relax.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I used this product for at least a month, before I reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with hair growth, I do believe that mane and tale has to ability to help promote hair growth, mainly because it helps encourage a healthy scalp. It definitely makes thin, delicate, fine hair, more voluminous, and adds a nice texture. My hair is very fine,  but it also is wavy, so during the summer, I can get some real nasty frizz hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice, that I used this shampoo  for a week straight, that my hair felt almost TOO thick, too voluminous, and the texture became too rough. (Keep in mind, its summer time) In the summer, my hair is already thicker, and has more volume because of the huminity, so I do think that this shampoo, would be AWESOME during the winter. In the summer however, I would use this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So honestly, I went and bought myself pantene beautiful lengths - because that made my hair grow like crazy in the past. Since pantene makes my hair super silky, and almost too FLAT, I now alternate between beautiful lengths and pantene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ON A SIDE NOTE- I tried a little experiment... I used Mane and Tale on my eyebrows ( after seeing how it made my hair so thick I was curious if it would do the same for my lovely brows, and it did give a fabulous boost to them, so now, i rub and scrum my brows with the mane and tail as well. Hope this helped all who are curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think its a good product, give it a ride. :)</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. I have tried shampoo and conditioners WAY more expensive than this, with far less results. After using this, I noticed my hair not only getting longer, but also slightly thicker and the smell is nice. I do notice a slight buildup after a couple days use and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the conditioner everyday for the same reason, but that could just be my hair. I normally purchase the big bottles of this at a local \\&quot;big chain\\&quot; for way cheaper than this. I would definitely recommend for those whose hair is stuck at a certain length or is beginning to thin out.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a while and my hair looks very healthy, it hasn&#x27;t grown too much but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I have long hair, very long hair. The kind where I often end up sitting on it. So naturally, my hair gets easily tangled and damaged. I had seen this shampoo and conditioner reviewed on some beauty review sites and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s WONDERFUL. It lathers up very easily and has a nice clean scent that any gender could use.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this product, the first time I used it I could right away see the difference! I would definetly buy this product again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo/conditioner combination as a shampoo/conditioner/creme leave-in conditioner for a week without skipping days or anything. I previously used $20 thickifier in my hair every day after washing my hair. I noticed a small difference in thickness while using that for a little over 3 months. I recently studied some reviews about this shampoo and decided to dish out the extra $5 for each bottle. After using Mane &#x27;n Tail for ONE WEEK, I have noticed more of a difference in growth and thickness than I did with the thickifier. Before using this, my hair was fried from constant heat, frizzy, dry, and broken off from tons of damaging and useless hair products and hot tools. Now, my broken off pieces are less noticeable, I can actually do stuff with my hair besides use a straightening iron or tons of taming hair products, and my hair is soft and strong. The smell is very pleasant, like apples, and the conditioner is very moisturizing as both a leave-in treatment and rinse-out conditioner. I will definetely buy in the future and recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase a larger size shampoo because certain people in my household use mine up...LOL&lt;br /&gt;It is soooo nice and creamy, lathers up really good with great results. The conditioner is wonderful, Your hair comes out so shiney, no tangles.</li>
    <li> My grandaughter loves these! She says, &amp;#34;Its da bomb diggety!&amp;#34; Her hair is growing back fast!</li>
    <li> Horse shampoo really works. Best non-scam gimmick ever. My hair does grow quicker, and become thicker as I use it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> good shampoo and conditioner. After using, the hair becomes cool and clean.</li>
    <li> This product is great, if i have any complaint it is just that my hair seems a little more coarse after use, but i just use some leave in conditioner and problem solved!</li>
    <li> I like it thus far however the smell is strong. It smells as if there is way more Amonenia in it than there should be &amp; bleach.  I will see if my hair gets any longer soon.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are very great! good price!&lt;br /&gt;Although it looks like it&#x27;s for animal, it works great for human, very natural.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but you can get a better price at Walgreens . I just saw it today and it was 7.99  for each. Before you buy it, be sure you check out some other places for prices.</li>
    <li> The shampoo makes my hair extremely dry and tangled. Have to use lots of conditioner to smooth my hair... Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been through an odd season: She suddenly started losing hair. Not in clumps; it was just major thinning out. We partially blame CLEAR hair shampoo and conditioner for taking it to it&#x27;s worst season of falling out. But with Mane N Tali, along with orally taking Evening Primrose Oil, my daughter&#x27;s hair has finally stopped falling out. (The falling out had been going on for about a year.) What we found surprising after her first use of this shampoo and conditioner, was discovering her hair was a different color than it had been all these years--as if using other products were dull-ifying her real color. Her hair is still thin from whatever problem she had, but it has stopped falling out, and we&#x27;re confident it will thicken in time.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I cut my hair too short, so thought I&#x27;d try to wash with this stuff to see if it would encourage hair growth. (Keep in mind, the manufacturer does not boast hair growth; only a lot of customers do.) Right off, after the first washing, I noticed a significant difference in my hair color. I&#x27;m getting ready to color my gray again, but am amazed at how my gray, my natural, and my colored hair seem all the more vibrant and actually different in color. I think this Mane N Tail bring out the real color and clean a lot of junk off hair! For reference, I only used the shampoo, not the conditioner. My daughter uses both.&lt;br /&gt;As I learn more, I&#x27;ll try to add to this post. But for now, we BOTH are sticking with this product.&lt;br /&gt;(My other daughter, btw, uses this on her horse. The horse&#x27;s hair is quite lovely in color as well! I&#x27;ll assume because the the quality ingredients in the shampoo!)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner I will probably never use anything else.</li>
    <li> If the smell stayed, it would be a 5. Smell runs out, and you get by the same size at walmart for 6 bucks look in the dog aisle, lol.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off amazon, I went to a local pet store to try it and so far, I am pleased. I had dry and weak hair. It fell out by the the finger fulls when I showered. I immediately felt a difference in days and now weeks after using it. My hair feels heavier since it&#x27;s gaining volume and it feels moisturized. The  shampoo has the same texture as pantene and it&#x27;s rather odorless but it still leaves your hair smelling fresh and clean. If you&#x27;re debating whether or not to buy off Amazon, you could always try going to a local pet store and trying it but I recommend using the conditioner along with it.  I&#x27;m going to simply order from amazon because it saves me gas!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It is gentle on dyed hair and it makes my hair soft. My hair is also stronger and all around healthier. Who knew horse shampoo was so great?</li>
    <li> I works for what it is for. And that&#x27;s is to clean my scalp and hair and make it more health. This is not for hair growth okay</li>
    <li> it turns out that i might be allergic to this product. it gives me breakouts.in the hair which is very annoying. i suggest read the ingredients before purchasing</li>
    <li> after this shampoo my hair was really freeze, it was so hard to brush them, this shampoo is not for me.</li>
    <li> After going through chemo I lost a lot of hair and it became really thin and dry when it started growing back... I really wanted my hair to be strong and shine! After a month of useing both the shampoo and conditioner I noticed a big diffrence. Granted my hair is still not as long as I&#x27;d like it to be. But I am really loving the results!!!!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff at first, but, after about a month of use, your hair will start to get oily, I wash my hair every other day, after a month of use, my hair started to get this build up. I was useing Bosley shampoo, cond for a little over a year trying to grow out my hair...Nothing, only dried out my hair very badly, so I&#x27;ll uuse mane n tail for now, will grow out your hair, but, it takes about 3,4 months, if you have any hair loss, this won&#x27;t regrow hair that you lost, your hair will stop falling out tho...I have been useing mane n tail off, on for years, it&#x27;s takes time for hair to get long...</li>
    <li> What a great deal! The 64 total ounces (32 of shampoo and 32 of conditioner) will last a long time, even in the kids&#x27; bathroom where things tend to get used up faster than they should (due to spills and kids&#x27; obsession with washing their &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; - I don&#x27;t know if your kids are always washing rocks with their toothpast, lotion, and/or body wash, but mine sure do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is also really nice - the conditioner leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair sleek and reasonably easy to tangle. Both products smell nice, if unremarkable, and are thick enough that they don&#x27;t slip and slide all over the place.</li>
    <li> The hair shampoo is good but the conditioner is not that great. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I have dry, curly hair, and a friend recommended this. Smells great, but just made my hair drier 😞</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo in combination with some Biotin pills, and a hair serum to stimulate growth in hopes that my hair would grow really fast. Because I know friends who have mentioned to me that it inhibits hair growth and worked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work as a hair growth product (not that i need it, i just want longer hair faster) and it also didn&#x27;t work as a regular every day shampoo and conditioner. The conditioner is fine. However I feel the shampoo really strips my hair which is dissapointing. not a bad product it&#x27;s worked for some, just not me. Oh well...</li>
    <li> This product is really awesome!...My wife used Wen for last couple of months but Mane &#x27;n Tail is far better!...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem much different than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> If I wasnt so embarrased at what my hair WAS, I&#x27;d post a picture somewhere if it would let me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very FINE and potentially very thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FINALLY got my hair to grow a few years ago. I loved it but my sister talked me into cutting it because short was &amp;#34;in.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So I cut it short and it DIED! Just like Tangled, the movie! lol&lt;br /&gt;I was so desperate I put a few &#x27;streaks&#x27; in it to give it some dimension. Every strand that got bleeched fell completely out.&lt;br /&gt;I had a total mullet and couldn&#x27;t wear my hair down for over 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;Until I saw my sister after 6 months and she went from having short hair like mine to THICK hair down to her bra strap!&lt;br /&gt;She said she ONLY uses Mane N Tail no matter what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO! In 7 months my hair has NEVER been better. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s grown over 3 inches and my entire hair is almost the same length. Meaning ALL of my break offs are completely long and healthy and shinny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this shampoo and conditioner I tried EVERYTHING. Natural things, oil treatments, Bosley treatments, EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;Side note, I also was taking 10,000mcg&#x27;s of Biotin every single day without fail as well. I had been previously taking Biotin before the shampoo but I kept it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stick to it, it WILL work.</li>
    <li> it smells wonderful and makes me hair so soft. but I have noticed my hair falling out a lot more now that I&#x27;m using it. I hope I&#x27;m not the only one having this problem.</li>
    <li> Sadly when I got this the shampoo had busted a little bit, but it was no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, and since I dye my hair red the shampoo doesn&#x27;t have many sulfates so my hair isn&#x27;t stripped of color instantly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made my hair shinier, and I feel like it&#x27;s a bit thicker and a little longer. That could just be me thinking of the shampoo like a placebo but I personally think it has helped my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The 32 oz. is quite large and will last a long time. It normally takes me a month to use 8-12 ounces of shampoo so this is lasting me about 2 and a half months.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try their detangler which I do plan on getting.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair that tends to get oily fast, I haven&#x27;t seen any increase or decrease in how fast my hair becomes oily with this shampoo but it does not claim to do anything about that.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about trying it.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using it, and plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Good! but for a minor leakage.</li>
    <li> Not that impressed with the Shampoo and Conditioner as it seemed to make my hair look dull and stringy. As soon as I switched back to my other Shampoo and Conditioner my hair went back to shiny and smooth. I did not see an increase in hair growth either.</li>
    <li> Ok so I started using this shampoo/conditioner set during spring break so like two weeks almost three weeks ago (a full month) &amp; so far my hair feels fuller, softer, and less damaged. My hair also feels a TINY bit greasier...that could be the shampoo/conditioner OR the fact that I stopped washing my hair every day (it&#x27;s bad for your hair in case you didn&#x27;t know) &amp; I started washing it every 3 days. But a bit of grease doesn&#x27;t set me off because overall I feel like my hair is a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for the price. However it is cheaper at target. its $7.49 per bottle. You get a lot of product though for the price. I feel like my hair has become shinier after using this product for a couple weeks, Maybe three weeks now . My hair seems to be more &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34; , The conditioner is great. It really helps moisturize. I can let my bleach blonde chemically treated hair air dry without a leave in conditioner and my hair still looks ok. you can also use the conditioner as a leave in conditioner . I tried it on my dry ends. It&#x27;s ...not bad if your in a rush or something. I use miracle 10 light  or coconut oil split end minder by organix after getting out of the shower using mane n tail normally. the shampoo doesnt foam up too much but it does foam up enough to get the grime out.</li>
    <li> Decent smell.. Been using for a little over a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any real results yet.  Makes my hair kind of knotty but I haven&#x27;t really been using the conditioner because it will sometimes make my hair too greasy.  Will update my review if I notice any real results going forward.</li>
    <li> i spend alot of expensive shampoo but none of them are better than this one,my hair fall alot is been few year after i use this man n tail my hair stop fall , so great</li>
    <li> I did not find any difference in my hair when using this product. Shampoo is fine, but conditioner is too mild. I got these because my hair was falling a lot, so I was expecting it to strengthen its roots and make it a bit thicker in order to resist weather changes; it didn´t work. After every shower I HAD to use a leave-in conditioner to detangle. These may work very well on thicker-stronger hairs, but on me, it was not a very good choice.</li>
    <li> I have used Mane n Tail for about 6 months and I feel it lives up to the hype! I was initially intrigued but reluctant to try it because it is for horses.  However, since horses have beautiful hair, I thought maybe it could make my hair beautiful too. My hair is now shinier, silkier and healthier than it has looked in years. My hair is to the middle of my back now and I don&#x27;t have any split ends, which has always been a problem for me if I even tried growing my hair to my shoulders.  While I don&#x27;t notice a major increase in thickness (I would say my hair is naturally medium thick), it certainly feels very soft and healthy. Prior to trying Mane N Tail, I used Pantene, Herbal Essences, Big Sexy Hair, and other expensive salon products to try and get my hair in shape again and none of them worked as well as little old Mane N Tail has. Yes, the big bottles and name may not be sexy and glamorous, but your hair will be after using this shampoo!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Found in at wal-mart/theisens for WAY cheaper (like half this price)! Look in the pet section.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. I wanted my hair to grow long and fast like the other reviews. Instead it left my hair dry and brittle and I can only use it once in a while if I want to be able to comb through my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cleans hair very well. Make sure you get the conditioner as well or you won&#x27;t be able to brush it after washing.</li>
    <li> If you want strong healthy roots, this is the set to get, if, you can afford it. The original just puts back what was missing and overtime, you&#x27;ll see what people are talking about. This is and was the to go to from back in the 90&#x27;s for me. It just moisturize moisturize moisturize! Oh! it also promotes healthy hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for years, but it is getting harder to find in stores. It makes my hair full and soft. I am over 70 so my hair is naturally thinning, but with this shampoo it is fuller.</li>
    <li> Great hair great price very happy</li>
    <li> The shampoo hasn&#x27;t suited me. I had bought it assuming that my hair will stop falling or fall at a lower rate and make my hair look fuller. That didnt happen for me at least.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how this is on horses, but I&#x27;m reviewing it for human hair.  My daughter had read that this stuff is SO good for human hair - making it stronger so it doesn&#x27;t break, which will make it grow longer.  I just spent $40 at the salon having the stylist spend an hour brushes the huge matts of tangles out of her hair.  She was minutes away from having it all cut off to an inch long, because the stylist didn&#x27;t think she could get them out.  This stuff put a waxy buildup in her hair that was just disgusting, and caused the hair to all stick together.  Her hair is in terrible condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s for animals, not humans.  Stick with something made for human hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sorry I didn&#x27;t know about this before my hair lost 12 inches in two years.  I was using crappy but affordable shampoo because of lack of income.  already after a week It&#x27;s acting a lot better and I have hope again. as it grows back out I will keep using this!</li>
    <li> rip off... found it at dollar tree</li>
    <li> not what I expected but cleans good not good for oily hair!</li>
    <li> my hair feels so healthy after using this and is growing much faster than before!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t help at all and made my hair even worse</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! My hair is so shiny, smells good, and it&#x27;s growing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and my younger sister recently wanted to begin using it so she asked me to order it for her. She has not changed brands since ordering this and continues to get it so she really likes it! I tried it again but only once but I think I would need to use it for at least 2 weeks to be able to write a review for myself.</li>
    <li> This is great dog shampoo for dogs.  Makes her so soft with a fresh smell!</li>
    <li> The bottle of conditioner leaked all over the bottle of shampoo and into the clear bag.&lt;br /&gt;The clear bag wasn&#x27;t even sealed all the way, so it leaked all over the box packaging too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to pick up the package, I could already smell the soap.&lt;br /&gt;So could the person who gave it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with 1 bottle of shampoo, and 1/3 bottle of salvaged conditioner..&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair. It doesn&#x27;t have many problems like oil or frizziness, but the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. The conditionerve works great!! The shampoo is just too much for my hair, leaves it as if I didn&#x27;t wash it out. Disgusting. For thick hair for sure!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair. It&#x27;s true, you see results after one use. When I rinsed it out, my hair was so soft and smooth, and I have coarse, dry hair. It&#x27;s grown a lot since I started using it, and my hair is noticeably healthier. Smells really subtle but works great for thick, dry, damaged hair!</li>
    <li> PERFECT AND FAST DELIVERY :)</li>
    <li> I am not sure if these make hair fall down less than usual or not. However, i can feel my hair is stronger and thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for a few weeks now and have NOT found it to be some sort of miracle hair groth potion. BUT what I did notice is that I did not have to wash my hair as often. I have thin hair...so the slightest bit of oil on my scalp means I&#x27;ve always had to wash my hair daily. NOT with this. I can go 2 to three days and still have my scalp feel dry. I like that! So I like this.&lt;br /&gt;Did not notice more shine. But is is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> ok, so I have been using this for awhile, wanted to wait and see if there was any difference between this and just your run of the day shampoo I buy at publix. I do not feel like this shampoo cleans my hair any better than your average shampoo, and the conditioner is nothing fantastic. It has a nice smell, but I would just go to publix or buy something there rather than order it, since it really does not do anything special, cleaning wise.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product as it has been recommended by a friend. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not impressed. The shampoo completely strips my hair (which is good) but the conditioner leaves a think layer that feels waxy. I also don&#x27;t feel my hair has been strengthened in any way. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again but will finish using the product.</li>
    <li> HI..........THIS STUFF IS GOOOOOOD........SMELLS GREAT AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT....WORKS GREAT.....MANY HAPPY CUSTOMERS.......JUST BUY IT.....HORSES NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.......JOEY</li>
    <li> This is a Mane and Tail bottle filled with a shampoo that is NOT mane and tail! The product I buy frequently In stores has a distinct color and smell and this is NOT the product!</li>
    <li> It smells great and leaves your hair super shiny. However, in the long run, my hair started to look icky after two days without shampooing. I don&#x27;t like washing my hair too much so washing my hair every other day wasn&#x27;t working for me. Plus, I didn&#x27;t notice any rapid hair growth while using this. I have quit this shampoo for quite a while and my hair went back to its normal self. Sidenote: mom loves this shampoo (not the conditioner but I think because it&#x27;s a personal lack of need for conditioners) so it really depends on each person&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-K</li>
    <li> Professional at salon says this product is no good.</li>
    <li> makes your hair fall out</li>
    <li> I have use them twice in my toy schnauzer... it leaves her fur nice soft and it does nt tangle as easy as it used to... smell nice but not too much perfume... her fur is shinny not greasy and soft... has been a great asset to avoid so much tangles.&lt;br /&gt;I do use a detangler afterwards and it helps too.</li>
    <li> It seems to really work. Left hair soft and manageable  Will buy again for future use when I run out</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product because I&#x27;d heard wonders about how it made your hair long and silky and strong. Well my hair did grow (although I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just a product of time or of the shampoo), but it made my hair very (very) dry!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I used this shampoo for more than 4 months. I would feel a squeaky sensation while lathering my hair, which I attribute to detergents and other very chemically products.&lt;br /&gt;It may work for others, but it really dried up my hair, even with tons of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing the difference when I used another conditioner one random day and just with that one use, my hair was a lot softer than usual with the Mane n Tail shampoo.</li>
    <li> I heard the myth about mane and tail but now i am a true believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed and bleached my hair for years and no matter what i did or how often i had it trimmed my hair just continued to break off.. I also have very thin stringy hair that grows very slow and regardless of all the damage i have done my hair was always oily on top and dry at the bottom. After reading all the reviews on this and watching youtube videos about the product i finally decided to get it.. what could it hurt right? nothing else i was doing was working. So right after i received this product i made sure to have my roots touched up and have my hair trimmed again before i started to use it. I am only 2 weeks into using mane and tail and i can see and feel the difference. My hair is no longer dry on the ends or oily at the roots  and the breaking has almost completely stopped. i no longer have to wash my hair every day i can now go every other day. My hair now has volume to it as well and i can already see hair growth.. so i am more then happy with mane and tail and would suggest it to anyone who has tormented there hair like i have.</li>
    <li> Works great. But arrived with shampoo cap loose and leaking all over packaging inside box</li>
    <li> When i used this once, it made my hair so soft and silky. Since i have thick hair, after i washed my hair, i brushed my hair and it wasn&#x27;t tangled and the brush didn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best shampoos and conditioners I have ever tried! Makes the hair feel fuller and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this package deal twice, and I&#x27;m still in love with this product.  I don&#x27;t use it so much in the winter months because it tends to make my scalp a little dry, but it&#x27;s a great shampoo that&#x27;s very lathery and the conditioner feels great and doesn&#x27;t leave a really heavy residue when you get out of the shower. Plus it smells great :-)</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s friends use this for their own hair and now that she tried it she doesn&#x27;t want anything else.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was something I used since I was a teen and I just recently started to think about trying it again. It texturizes and gives lots of volume but keeps hair soft. This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> Not that great, smells ok. Seen no difference.</li>
    <li> From what I understand with this shampoo, it was originally developed for horses and after seeing improvement in the health and appearance of their horses&#x27; manes and tails they decided to try on people.  Now whether that&#x27;s a true story or something to sell shampoo, I don&#x27;t know.  For me personally, I have used the Mane and Tail brand for years as my shampoo and conditioner. From time to time, I have tried other brands but in the end I always go back to Mane and Tail. This is a great quality shampoo that gives a nice thick lather that moisturizes and helps keep my hair healthy and feeling clean. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue that some shampoos leave behind on your hair.  The conditioner is also great and moisturizes and helps keep my hair healthy. It is also gentle on my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality shampoo and conditioner without all the chemicals that other products tend to have but I do suggest shopping around as you can find the big bottles of this for around 5 to 6 bucks for each bottle. Although it may sound strange, you have to sometime shop in the pet isle in the store to find it in stock, as it tends in my area to be better stock in the pet section than in the people shampoo section.</li>
    <li> my daughter&#x27;s hair is growing and she is very happy about that! She heard about this product from a friend who told her it really works!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it actually made my hair grow long! I have long hair now but I stopped using it a couple years back and regretted. So now im back with mane n tail and intend to keep it that way. If you want your hair to grow this is the product for you. Unlike others I didnt experience the dry hair after using it but I guess not everything is for everyone. But its worth a try.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to have \\&quot;long, beautiful\\&quot; hair fast! Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this shampoo or conditioner has done anything for my hair. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that said the shampoo makes your hair feel coarse but then it gets silky smooth after the conditioner - this was not the case for me. I don&#x27;t usually lose that much hair in the shower but since using this product a LOT of hair is coming out. The smell is bearable, not my favorite. Sad to say this product did not work for me :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT DON&#x27;T GET IT ON AMAZON! It is MUCH cheaper at Walgreen&#x27;s! WIsh I had known before ordering.</li>
    <li> i have used this on my own hair and my younger sisters hair which is generally very hard to manage as it is extremely thick...i got thru her hair after a wash without any tangles or hair in the comb...and my hair is soft and bouncy....love it completely...but this price listed is extremely high, i bought the same size bottles at walmart for 5.65 each. check it out!</li>
    <li> Order this and when It got to me most of the shampoo and conditioner where all over the box and bag it came in super disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> Last for a very long time even though conditioner en kinda watery.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner for my hair.</li>
    <li> the product was damaged</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!!!! My hair is growing and more manageable. I recommend a color treated shampoo if you color. My color is dull after using for the last 3 mos.</li>
    <li> I have been losing hair like CRAZY because of my meds. I had heard from so many people about this shampoo and conditioner that I decided to give it a try. With normal shampoo and conditioner, I would usually lose enough hair to make a few wigs for a barbie doll. When I first used it, I only lost about 5 strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I AM UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY RIGHT NOW!</li>
    <li> In love with this shampoo ! It smells good, conditions excellent,  my hair is growing back I dont have as much fall out and its getting long !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and waited before I wrote a review on it. Iv used it a little over a month and let me say my results are amazing. When I started using it my hair was half a inch long. Now my hair is 2 and a half almost 3 inches long in some parts!! I&#x27;m a guy I had a buzz cut my whole life and finally I&#x27;m deciding to grow it out I&#x27;m 21 it&#x27;s time for some change! Haha. My hair feels so soft and healthy, it really feels better. I&#x27;m mixed black and German so I have curly hair it use to feel very rough but now it feels so nice. So does this product work? YES is this a crazy cheap and amazing deal? YES I LOOOOVE how cheap this is for the size and that it actually works. This might have been my best amazon purchase yet.</li>
    <li> I only got conditioner and it was advertised as shampoo and conditioner.  The conditioner was open and all over the box when it arrived.</li>
    <li> This combo is awesome! It was so cheap &amp; it really works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it really works!</li>
    <li> Works great on anything with hair!!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and I just love it! I used to lose hair when showering, and my hair gets oily in a day. after the first week of use, I have seen less and less hair loss in the shower, and I almost don&#x27;t lose any hair in shower now. The shampoo is very effective with oil control, and the conditioner works well too. My hair is straight and soft, and my friends even noticed the change of my hair condition, and asked if I had changed my hair products. I&#x27;m really glad I bought the giant bottles, and I think I would definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> it was okay. nothing impressive. same as buying the well known brands out there. I&#x27;m sure you could find better products out there</li>
    <li> Was really excited to receive my new shampoo and conditioner- got here very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately when I got it they were both COVERED in what I assume to be shampoo that leaked out. Hence the 3 star rating. Kinda disappointed with that.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is really rich and smells heavenly.  Over time it dried out my hair because of the detergent ingredients.  Conditioner also rich and creamy but tends to leave the hair waxy.  Found it&#x27;s better when both products are diluted.  Of course, the dog smells terrific...</li>
    <li> I bought this hopeful that my hair would grow faster. It has grown almost 1 inch in the last month. *BIG BONUS* My hair is very fine and falls out a lot. I&#x27;m talking 30+ hairs are lost just during a shower. After the third wash with this wonder shampoo and conditioner only 7 hairs in the drain. My hair is less frizzy and it&#x27;s so pretty now. I&#x27;ve had several compliments.</li>
    <li> I have used the best shampoo and conditioner out there. Between Fekkai, Redken, Big 10, aussie I have tried it all. No other hair care combo gives me the gloss and the strength that Mane N&#x27; Tail give me. I have very thick hair, blonde and thick. It is prone to damage, so it awesome to finally find a miracle product that gets the job done. I have received so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Personally I have very thick curly hair and it is rather unruly. I have used a lot of different shampoos and conditioners and never really found any that I love. A friend told me I might like Mane &#x27;N Tail and figured I give it a shot. I found that my hair was definitely smoother and softer after using it a few times. I was glad to find the combo pack on amazon and found it lasted fairly long. Don&#x27;t expect this product to suddenly give you Eva Mendez locks but it certainly helped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really liked the shampoo and conditioner. They both work great, they make my hair feel soft, think, and full bodied.</li>
    <li> Not powerful as expected.</li>
    <li> This product is average. It does not make your hair extra thick, smooth, or shiny. I don&#x27;t know if I will order it again, since it isn&#x27;t different than any other hair cleansing product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My hair grew extremely fast!!! I was very happy with this product!! About 2 1/2 inches in first couple weeks!!!!!❤️</li>
    <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t want to make my review instantly, so I&#x27;ve been using this product for 14 days, I thought it would help my hair-loss problem but NO, the only thing that this product works for is your hair straightness, but if you have any problem with hair-loss, you may be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Now you have to use this product properly for it to work. The first time I used it, alot of hair came out in my comb and a very gross patch of grease was imbedded in my hair. The very next morning I left a moisture treatment on 3 minutes before getting into the shower. I washed that out with tons of shampoo. You have to use alot more of both products than regular human stuff for them to work properly. I then leave the conditioner heavily on my ends and lightly on my roots for 3 minutes (combing through with my finger tips) before washing out very very thoroughly. I had little to no fallout from combing.&lt;br /&gt;Even after the two days I&#x27;ve been using it, already my hair feels so very soft and amazing. It&#x27;s like the first time I used Aussie when my hair was virgin without the static.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dyed red and that has been stripped to a copper color so I don&#x27;t recommend this for red dye. My hair is growing-that I can see already. A huge downfall for me though is this enormous disorienting headache that wont go away no matter how much ibuprofen I use. If it becomes reoccurring, I may have to make this only a weekly treatment or eliminate it from my regimen all together.&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;After the third use, I no longer have any sort of migraine-like side effect. I may have been a result of the product removing such a large amount of oil from my scalp (I&#x27;m naturally with a super oily scalp). It&#x27;s very textured and soft and long. It&#x27;s very easily a staple in my daily shampoo and conditioning. When using though, make sure not to use anything in between the shampoo and conditioner. You can use things before and after (as I do) but the system only works properly when used in tandem, back to back.</li>
    <li> I like this brand it works great been using off+on for many years, good product Thank You</li>
    <li> Before using this product my hair was extremely thin and every time I brushed my hair I would see a lot of hair coming out.. To the point where I was scared I might be suffering from hair loss. After hearing about this product from my cousin I decided to buy it and within a week of using it I noticed my hair looked a lot thicker and less dry. It&#x27;s now been over a year and my hair loss has slowly gone away and now whenever I brush my hair I rarely see any hair falling out. Will continue to purchase this product (:</li>
    <li> This stuff is nothing special, I prefer other brands in this price range. I found the shampoo drying and the conditioner was an unpleasant texture, kind of lumpy.</li>
    <li> gives my hair volume, brings out my natural highlights and is cheap as heck. Yes, you do need to use both each time. just using the shampoo will make your hair feel dry, and using the conditioner with other shampoos makes your hair to heavy. But used together, fabulous. My BF uses it too and says its the best shampoo he ever used and is so happy its so cheap.</li>
    <li> Use the Mane N&#x27; Tail products routinely for my horses, and really like their economy and effectiveness.  Combined with their excellent detangler, this is a must-have trio for a horse-barn.</li>
    <li> Works well. Give hair beautiful shine and texture. Though, a day or two after I use it, my scalp will start to itch. But it goes away when I shampoo again...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before so no surprises. Best price I&#x27;ve found is on here. I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair grow any faster but I&#x27;m told that it grows really fast! Just make sure you trim it a few times a year to keep it healthy. Great to use on pets too!</li>
    <li> 1. When I saw the price on Walmart&#x27;s webpage I was so surprised, the price of the 32 oz. shampoo and conditioner is half of the price here!! I just felt so mad. Then I cheked on some other drug stores, I felt even more depressed, they are even cheaper!!&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to purchase this product, YOU WILL DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE THE PRICES FROM OTHER STORES AND SUPERMARKETS!!!!! I know I clicked on check out but you know when you found the same products you pruchased has a lower price and you don&#x27;t need to wait, you just feel being cheated. Especially my conditioner leaked out 1 square centimeter...&lt;br /&gt;2. About this product, since I want to get the best result ou of it, so I followed the directions carefully. The direction on the shampoo says &amp;#34;work through hair with fingertips&amp;#34; so I only let the foam work on my hair and away from my scalp. While the direction on the conditioner rinse out says massage it into scalp......and I tried my best to rinse it out but my hair became oily again soon. Oily Scalp should not use this.&lt;br /&gt;3. Something I like about this product, the shampoo iseasy to lather and very foamy and the smell is not very strong which is pretty good. It does detangles, my hair tangles easily.</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells like the bleach I use on my hair and the shampoo looks like something that came out of a boy horses you know what. Is this a joke? I think they just filled old bottles with different stuff and tried to sell it...</li>
    <li> Started using this product after I dyed, bleached, and let a teenager hack off most of my hair...needless to say I&#x27;m surprised i had any hair left. What was left was badly damaged, brittle, dry, and somewhere in between a mullet. So I picked up the big bottle of shampoo from walmart then got the conditioner at sally&#x27;s for around $5.99 each. That was about a month or two ago and I usually just wear a headband to tuck my hair away because I couldn&#x27;t stand looking at it. The other day I let my hair down and straightened it for the first time and WOW...My hair had grown tremendously and is SO THICK. I would say before my hair&#x27;s longest strand came to my chin and the shortest layer was right at the tip of my head. Today my hair is almost all one length and right down to my collar bone. i know it&#x27;s because of this shampoo and conditioner. I didn&#x27;t do anything else to it or put any other products in it. I just washed it, let it air dry and put it under a headband. I am very happy with the results that I bought more and even bought the mane and tail leave in conditioning spray. I&#x27;m in the process of growing out my natural hair which is raven black so I&#x27;m excited to see the results on my natural hair. If it made my bleached brittle hair soft, thick, and manageable, I can only imagine how my natural unprocessed hair will look. This product definitely works! Never using anything else!</li>
    <li> Had to order double because the product is great.  Recommend</li>
    <li> My hair grows about a half an inch each week after starting to use this product. Makes my hair look gorgeous too!</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of hair loss lately and wanted to do something to counteract it (without going all out and getting a prescription). This shampoo and conditioner started helping me within the first week. My hair loss has almost completely stopped now and I’ve had tons of new growth since I started using it. I was shocked by how good this shampoo/conditioner smells. It’s definitely the best brand I’ve ever tried and I’m hooked!</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. I heard through many people and decided to try it and now I&#x27;m hooked. I can tell the different about my hair. Love how thick it turn out and more heavy. Highly recomended to anyone looking for thicker fuller hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my own personal hair care and my cat for approximately 2-3 months. My hair has never been so healthy and strong; i have very thin hair that snaps if the wind blows too hard. I can&#x27;t express how pleased i have been with Mane &#x27;N Tail. I have searched high and low for a product that does not contain such harsh chemicals (ex:sulfate) with a tolerable smell. Before purchasing the set on Amazon, i would buy them at my local Walmart/Target for approximately the same price (sold individually in the pet aisle). About two weeks ago, i went into the store and noticed the bottles are smaller and more expensive. Also, i think the word is getting around which means limited stock.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time. The cap had come loose during shipping though. Lost about a 1/4 of the conditioner. Other than that, I would buy again! Works great!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and excellent product. I would recommend this user to anyone. My hair feels thicker shinier and it also smells really good.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampooes around</li>
    <li> Bought for wife.  She would prefer it in smaller containers.</li>
    <li> I wash my bleached hair daily and it works well for me.  It takes out grease and dirt.  Anyone using the shampoo really needs to get the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I have long hair. Aside from the normal 50-100 strands of hair a human loses each day, I generally lose 3x as much due to breakage. After just one use of Mane &#x27;n Tail, I can already see the difference. There is no longer a massive hairball at the end of my shower. I can actually count the number of strands there now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing Herbal Essences to their stupid new direction and formula 10 years ago, I was at a loss to which shampoo and conditioner to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical at first, because of me being, you know, not a horse... But I&#x27;m sold. I will never use a different product than Mane n&#x27; Tail.</li>
    <li> This product is really good!...I used it and my dry hair are much better~!!!! I would recommend this product. it is so goooooooood~</li>
    <li> Have purchased these products for my daughters, who swear by them.  I can notice the difference in their hair after using these products.  Seems to be thicker, and looks darker.  Only hair product for which I can say I noticed a difference after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve you this product years ago and loved it.  Just bought it recently and it still works wonders on your hair.  I use Henna to color my hair and it works fine with it.  The second you start to shampoo your hair, you can feel the fullness.  When you blow dry your hair, watch out because it literally doubles in volume!  I&#x27;m not a spokes person for this product, just a happy customer.  I will say I notice I get tangles more even after using the conditioner but I comb my hair out from the BOTTOM up.  The other way only creates more tangles.  Other than that, the bottles are HUGE and well worth the money.  Packaging was great.  They tape the nozzle so it doesn&#x27;t leak during shipping.  Arrived on time as well.  Try this stuff!  You&#x27;ll love it!  This brand has been around for over 30 years as far a I know.</li>
    <li> I have thinnish blonde hair...and I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 2-3 weeks now. My hair used to shed a lot, like in the shower- but now I hardly shed at all. It&#x27;s thicker, healthier, and suuuper shiny. Like it looks fake it&#x27;s so healthy looking. I&#x27;ve also gotten a lot of compliments :) If you want gorgeous hair get this combo. I can only speak for girls with my hair type but this stuff is the bomb. I&#x27;m sure it works well on horses too but alas, I don&#x27;t have one. Get it! These bottles are huge too! :)</li>
    <li> I use this both on my hair (long and thick) and both of my Border Collies. I love it. It leaves a soft smooth finish. And it smells great!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, worked as intended</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product for years.  It did not work at all for me.  My hair felt like straw.  I quite using it half way through. I have very fine hair, maybe it is for thicker hair?</li>
    <li> Overall it leaves very manageable and frizz free for days, easy and fast to Use. A little less body than I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this shampoo and hair conditioner.  I had never heard of it before.  I was VERY surprised by how well it works.  I tend to use Matrix or Chi products.  Well... those days are over!  I am sticking to this shampoo.  It leaves my hair super clean feeling, thick and lustrous.  I find myself running my hands thru my hair because it feels so good.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the conditioner bottle is broke open made a mess everywhere</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for hair and it smells really refreshing!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you haven naturally thin and fine hair. I was really looking forward to this because I have really fine hair and I thought it would give it a healthy natural boost and help it grow, but I used it for 3 weeks and every single day it made my hair look real greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only for people with thick hair!</li>
    <li> Use this stuff for everyone in the house. People and animals and it works amazingly</li>
    <li> Absolutely makes a difference.  Softer shinier.  Not much more to say.  16 word minimum, yet?  Nope.  Honestly. Ok ok ok</li>
    <li> My mom used this on my hair when I was a child, now I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she&#x27;s bi-racial), it tames the curls, leaves her hair soft and manageable. Great product for damaged hair as well!</li>
    <li> Nice Item as described</li>
    <li> use it daily and i can see it definitely add hair volume</li>
    <li> Works well on my dry scalp and the tangles in my long hair.</li>
    <li> Wife and daughters love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> this product is made for the person who wants silky soft hair, we always try new shampoo and return to mane &amp; tail</li>
    <li> kit itself is very good, but the two units were not sealed in the lid and leaked</li>
    <li> My hair takes FOREVER to grow and ever since I started using this product, my hair grew a full inch in a month, I know that is for a fact because I have blonde highlights and my roots are coming in very very dark, that means my hair is growing alot! So happy, thank you!! - the ONLY thing that helped my hair grow is this shampoo and conditioner. btw im arabic and italian and my hair is curly and a little coarse.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I will continue to use this till I die or for as long as it is made</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner is pretty good.  I read a lot of reviews about it before I bought it and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.  The conditioner makes your hair so soft it&#x27;s amazing.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll most likely be pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is greaaaat love using it. Love how big the bottles are too! My hair used to tangle a lot, this worked well for untangling it! Definitely will get again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product wanting to grow my hair faster than my normal rate but I don&#x27;t think it helped my hair grow at all... I can feel that my hair grew stronger and thicker but it did not affect the length.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still good in the sense that it wipes out a lot of the oil in your hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it leaves my hair nice and soft and not heavy. I have used it for 3 weeks and I already see improvement on my hair and is growing and getting longer</li>
    <li> Oh my lanta this stuff is amazing! My hair is so soft and it smells fabulous all day! Highly recommend! I will be using this product from now on!</li>
    <li> I havent been using this product long enough to tell if it works for hair growth. I do like the smell of it, but it makes my hair feel coarse. its is shiny but definitely not soft.</li>
    <li> i cut my hair in October all the way to my shoulders and i started using this product since the first day i cut my hair. my hair is to middle back now! my hair has always been very thin and took forever to grow, but now my hair is thick and healthier and actually growing really fast. i love this product, and btw you can buy this product at target in the shampoo isle for cheaper. i dont buy it online, target has it.</li>
    <li> I use this on our dog and I find it an economical way to clean him and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for swimmers.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t loosing hunks of hair, but my hairbrush was getting its fill.  After reading the reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try.  After just two washings, I noticed the difference.  Now, a month later my hair is softer, silkier and in my head!  This is a great product for a very low price.  Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> Came within a few days, exactly what I was looking for, so far it is working great for my hair type</li>
    <li> It feels a little big heavy to me. Otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> But it has made my hair feel better and not be as greasy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Her boyfriend who has thick hair started using it and loves it too.</li>
    <li> This is our third order, my daughter loves these products.</li>
    <li> tell me what i got: TWO conditioners with LEAKING!! whats that ? what can i do with with two fat bottle of conditioner? I even can accept two conditioner.  I need a explanation.</li>
    <li> Daughter cannot live without this product. Good price.</li>
    <li> After about 12 or so washes I feel like I notice a difference in my daughters extremely coarse hair.  The ones I purchased came from Monster Pets and the bottles were wrapped together and in new condition.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Not good for thin hair.. Pur d dor argan shampoo is the best...</li>
    <li> A shampoo I can use every day, does not aggravate perfume allergy.</li>
