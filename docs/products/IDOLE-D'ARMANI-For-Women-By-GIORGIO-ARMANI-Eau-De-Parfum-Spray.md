      <li>Light but sophisticated.</li>
      <li>Smells very classy and pleasant.</li>
      <li>Definitely a great Christmas present for the upcoming holidays.  </li>
      <li>all day light signature smell, every time i wear it i get lots of compliments</li>
      <li>Got this item off of her wish list which I think is a fantastic way to get that special person what they would like or dream of having.</li>
      <li>Armani never disappoints me :) I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Kind of like original, but it definitely is not.</li>
      <li>It is not the best fragrance for a 16 year old but not really for the elderly either!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought this fragrance and let me tell you that I was surprised by how amazing it turned out to be.</li>

      <li>Just know that you have been notified that this is not the real version.</li>
      <li>Every person wants to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing,  </li>
      <li>If you have ever worn the real version, you will detect a knock off immediately.  </li>
      <li>This one apparently smells different (not as good), and doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
      <li>However, in the past I bought this perfume for my wife and she was happy with the scent as well as the lasting power of the perfume.  </li>
      <li>I love GA - Idole perfume - wearing it a few years now.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is seductive and almost an Oriental - but without the heavy headiness that most have.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s classy like a Dior, but seductive as an Armani.</li>
      <li>A grown up scent but not too mature.  </li>
      <li>but it was just like what was left in her old bottle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am upset that I purchased this perfume even after I read the customer reviews that it was not the real version.  It is fake.  It has a stinky skunky smell.  The original smells wonderful.  This one does not.  If you have ever worn the real version, you will detect a knock off immediately.  I see that there are no returns for this product....which is unfortunate because I buy stuff on this site all the time.  Just know that you have been notified that this is not the real version.</li>
    <li> i was very pleased with the service. i received it before they said i would, and the product was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  I get so many complements when I wear it.  It is not the best fragrance for a 16 year old but not really for the elderly either!</li>
    <li> I always keep a refill of this perfume...loved it from the first time I bought it. You want that nice going out smell or that good smell to be thought of this is it..my man loves it and sprayed it on my pillow after I left so he could have me nearby.</li>
    <li> The best perfume ever! The shipper was faster than even promised! Loved it! Every person wants to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing,  but i pretend to forget the name! ;-)</li>
    <li> I love GA - Idole perfume - wearing it a few years now.  I will buy this perfume as long as I can find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find in the Department stores so I order mine through Amazon.  I have never had a problem with my orders or delivery.  They have always ship in a timely matter.  The prices are much more affordable when I order with Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is one of my wife favorites as her son gave her a bottle two years ago. I tried to find it but had no luck until I went on Amazon. Found it. She was happy, I was happy, end of story. Some people said the fragrance  was not the same but it was just like what was left in her old bottle.</li>
    <li> Kind of like original, but it definitely is not. I think it is either fake or just simply expired. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful and it is light and not too overpowering. The bottle is beautiful and the price is just right.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells delicous.  A grown up scent but not too mature.  Light but sophisticated. Definitely a great Christmas present for the upcoming holidays.  A Winner!!</li>
    <li> I am not suggesting anything.  However, in the past I bought this perfume for my wife and she was happy with the scent as well as the lasting power of the perfume.  This one apparently smells different (not as good), and doesn&#x27;t last.  I ordered it on Amazon because this perfume is discontinued.  It was a mistake.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought this fragrance and let me tell you that I was surprised by how amazing it turned out to be. Smells very classy and pleasant. The fragrance is on the stronger side, but that&#x27;s how I like my perfume! Armani never disappoints me :) I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is seductive and almost an Oriental - but without the heavy headiness that most have. It&#x27;s classy like a Dior, but seductive as an Armani. I am shocked that it didn&#x27;t last long on shelves. It&#x27;s not classified in the ooey gooey sweetness category that is all the rage now, is all I can surmise. But Armani Idole lasts on me for hours - and a little spritz goes a long way, driving my husband into neck-nuzzling frenzies. Makes me feel like Sophia Loren, hahahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Zahara8 on Basenotes Forum wrote: \\&quot;The patchouli, ginger and spice definitely steer this scent out of fluffy territory - no spun sugar cotton candy here.

I gaurantee down the road, it will be more expensive due to it&#x27;s hard to find exclusivity. This will occur when the teeny-bopper-cotton-candy trend passes, and women want to smell like sensual women again!</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is a beautiful fragrance!  I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but HAD to take a moment to speak about this parfume.  When I neared the end of my first bottle, I used the rest sparingly until I replaced it! LOL  It is one of my favorites!  Its a fragrant that lingers and sticks to you all day.  A little on the wrist and neck thats all it takes.  Try this and you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  Great price too</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction! Got this item off of her wish list which I think is a fantastic way to get that special person what they would like or dream of having. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Smells very good. I always get compliments and get asked what I&#x27;m wearing ;)&lt;br /&gt;Wish they didn&#x27;t discontinue it, though.</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume.  Hard to find everywhere!!!</li>
    <li> this smells light and airy, great summer scent ................ great value great price all day light signature smell, every time i wear it i get lots of compliments</li>
