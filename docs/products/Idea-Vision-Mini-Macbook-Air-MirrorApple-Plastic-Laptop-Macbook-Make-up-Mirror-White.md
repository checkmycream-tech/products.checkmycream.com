<li> The hinges are rather loose on these items (I ordered two), but it&#x27;s well worth it unless you need to prop it open at very wide or very narrow angles.</li>
<li> Obviously the keyboard is a solid mold so the keys don&#x27;t depress at all, which is to be expected.</li>
<li> It has a silver Apple logo on the outside center lid of the laptop, and says MacBook on the inside center underneath the mirror.</li>
<li> Just ordered another one of these for my other daughter.</li>
<li> BUT it is dirty with black stuff on it.</li>
<li> I hate going to AG</li>
