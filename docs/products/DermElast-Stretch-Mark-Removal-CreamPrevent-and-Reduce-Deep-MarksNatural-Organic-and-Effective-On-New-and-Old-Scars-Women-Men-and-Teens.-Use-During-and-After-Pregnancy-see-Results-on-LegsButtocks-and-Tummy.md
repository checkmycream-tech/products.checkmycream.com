### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the areas are smooth!!Maybe if I continue using it over time it&#x27;ll get rid of the stretch marks but until then, I am so happy with the smoothness - and the smell!</li>
      <li>This one is great!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product as a great cream that hydrates, soothes, and smells great too!</li>

      <li>This cream feels great on the skin.</li>
      <li>It feels great going on.</li>

      <li>was amazing!</li>
      <li>Best, No, Worst.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this product and can honestly say it is the best of its kind on the market.</li>
      <li>The stretch mark cream seems to be working fairly well for me.  </li>
      <li>We all deserve to be beautiful before and after pregnancy :))</li>
      <li>So I get this nice bottle of cream with all kinds of good stuff in it, and it feels cool and comforting to the scar and smells wonderful, since orange oil is one of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>If you guys have any questions, I would be more than welcome to answer.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful and really puts the &amp;#34;elast&amp;#34; in DermElast!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>It feels nice on the skin.</li>
      <li>Ive been using the product nightly on my stomach where I was 40 pds more..</li>
      <li>It made my skin feel like it had more elasticity and the hint of grapefruit scent</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with a product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the feel of this lotion.</li>
      <li>Great smell, nice price, good product (as stated in many other reviews).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the texture feels fine.</li>
      <li>I regret purchasing this cream and using in it on my girl friend very much!!</li>
      <li>I honestly have seen some change, I really like the product.</li>
      <li>I got Newgen Naturals cream to fade some scars and some light stretch marks.</li>
      <li>the stretch marks are rather wide..it doesnt seem to show a significant change.</li>
      <li>It significantly helped eliminate my pregnancy marks on my stomach.</li>
      <li>I honestly did not expect it to work on my stretch marks because they are REALLY old</li>
      <li>They may get better if I dedicate more time to using this product, but I am going back to another one that is easier for me to use.</li>
      <li>This has a very nice smell, compared to some other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It has made a real difference  and it absorbs easily</li>
      <li>I have never encountered a single cream that smells as good as this one.</li>
      <li>Its lightened my small stretch marks &amp; it has a good smell!</li>
      <li>And after about a week of applying it twice daily I am seeing amazing results.</li>
      <li>right before I started using this cream</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products meant to do the same thing</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how far the cream will go!</li>
      <li>The cream itself is a nice texture, and not super liquidy.</li>
      <li>This cream is pretty decent.</li>
      <li>It moisturized very well too.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve faded and feel much smoother than before.</li>
      <li>I really did see a difference in my stomach.</li>
      <li>I have not seen a change, I have been using Palmers cocoa butter formula and have seen change really recomment that instead</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling very soft, after having a baby its a blessing to try to get rid of those baby marks!</li>
      <li>Used as directed, though, I have high hopes and no irritation.</li>
      <li>While it only faded old stretch marks slightly, it helps prevent new ones from forming and helps soothe the new bright colored ones.</li>
      <li>Still have a lot longer to use this product, but so far it really has helped.</li>
      <li>I like the way it goes on smooth without being too oily like other creams.</li>
      <li>When considering the price I paid, I honestly expected more than what my wife actually got to help with her post pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to notice just how smooth that particular area became (I used it on both sides of my stomach and on two tiny spots on my upper thighs).</li>
      <li>I have an old surgery scar that is stiff and ropey; it chafes on clothing even after more than a decade.</li>
      <li>so I could use it as a daily whole body cream!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m realistic enough to know that they just wont go away overnight</li>
      <li>It visually faded, some of them even disappeared completely.</li>
      <li>My expectations of this stretch mark cream were realistic, and I got what I expected.</li>

<li> Cream should be thick, not runny and just accept, we have stretch marks and no cream will help!</li>
<li> Not happy with the results.</li>
<li> I am almost done with the cream and will probably not buy it again based on the lack of results unfortunately</li>
<li> I was skeptical.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong - there are still stretch marks there.</li>
<li> However, the design of the tube makes it difficult to get all the product out</li>
<li> It was very expensive</li>
<li> is literally a bad idea.</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> but they didn&#x27;t &amp; had horrible smells!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this for my wife for her stretch marks. We&#x27;ve gone through two bottles and still are no results.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a change, I have been using Palmers cocoa butter formula and have seen change really recomment that instead</li>
    <li> I have been using this product only shOrt term.&lt;br /&gt;I apply about a finger tip to my hips. And after about a week of applying it twice daily I am seeing amazing results. My stretch marks are minimally visible. The cream itself is a nice texture, and not super liquidy. A little goes a long ways. I will purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> I got Newgen Naturals cream to fade some scars and some light stretch marks. After a week of use it seems to be softening them so I&#x27;ll continue use. It&#x27;s easy to use and the texture feels fine. It seems to do the job well at a fraction of the price of other creams.</li>
    <li> This cream is pretty decent. I like the way it goes on smooth without being too oily like other creams. It feels nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> This cream feels great on the skin. It is not oily and waxy like other similiar products. It feels great going on.</li>
    <li> The stretch mark cream seems to be working fairly well for me.  I have noticed my stretch marks are slowly beginning to fade.  I&#x27;m excited to see how far the cream will go!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. BUT, I&#x27;ve been losing weight and thought this would help on the arms and belly. Still have a lot longer to use this product, but so far it really has helped. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - there are still stretch marks there. They&#x27;ve faded and feel much smoother than before. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the results. When considering the price I paid, I honestly expected more than what my wife actually got to help with her post pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
    <li> i use it ever night before i go to bed and its been a few weeks and im starting to see results!</li>
    <li> Had to stop dreaming.  no change after weeks of applying DermElast daily.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a month I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet,</li>
    <li> Product is a great moisturizer.. haven&#x27;t seen any results for stretch marks tho</li>
    <li> My expectations of this stretch mark cream were realistic, and I got what I expected. You shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles from a lotion. It significantly helped eliminate my pregnancy marks on my stomach. It visually faded, some of them even disappeared completely. I am satisfied with a product. It moisturized very well too. If you guys have any questions, I would be more than welcome to answer. We all deserve to be beautiful before and after pregnancy :))</li>
    <li> Loved this product! I really did see a difference in my stomach. I would recommend this to anyone that I know!</li>
    <li> This product works! Its lightened my small stretch marks &amp; it has a good smell! I&#x27;ve tried many products meant to do the same thing but they didn&#x27;t &amp; had horrible smells! This one is great!</li>
    <li> That 5 star rating is for the smell of this cream alone. I have never encountered a single cream that smells as good as this one. I honestly did not expect it to work on my stretch marks because they are REALLY old and I&#x27;m realistic enough to know that they just wont go away overnight but I was pleasantly surprised to notice just how smooth that particular area became (I used it on both sides of my stomach and on two tiny spots on my upper thighs). Those areas had been a little rough to the touch right before I started using this cream and here we are a couple of weeks later of daily usage (only missed a day or 2) and the areas are smooth!!Maybe if I continue using it over time it&#x27;ll get rid of the stretch marks but until then, I am so happy with the smoothness - and the smell!</li>
    <li> This has a very nice smell, compared to some other creams I&#x27;ve tried. I honestly have seen some change, I really like the product. Will definately be purchasing another bottle after this one!</li>
    <li> I wasted my time and money purchasing this! I regret purchasing this cream and using in it on my girl friend very much!! Her skin actually got worse, stretch marks don&#x27;t disappeared, they appear even more!&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase this item is literally a bad idea.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and can honestly say it is the best of its kind on the market. It has made a real difference  and it absorbs easily and I would fully recommend it. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have an old surgery scar that is stiff and ropey; it chafes on clothing even after more than a decade. So I get this nice bottle of cream with all kinds of good stuff in it, and it feels cool and comforting to the scar and smells wonderful, since orange oil is one of the ingredients. It does say not to get it in your eyes, which makes sense, since orange oil would probably sting. Used as directed, though, I have high hopes and no irritation.</li>
    <li> Best, No, Worst. Cream should be thick, not runny and just accept, we have stretch marks and no cream will help!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel of this lotion. It&#x27;s Heavenly. However, the design of the tube makes it difficult to get all the product out (I still had 1/3 of the product inside, when I had to cut the thick tube in half). For this reason alone, I would rather buy another product. As far as the stretchmarks on my side go, they were pretty difficult to see beforehand (very old) and probably haven&#x27;t improved. They may get better if I dedicate more time to using this product, but I am going back to another one that is easier for me to use.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling very soft, after having a baby its a blessing to try to get rid of those baby marks!</li>
    <li> Ive been using the product nightly on my stomach where I was 40 pds more..the stretch marks are rather wide..it doesnt seem to show a significant change. I am almost done with the cream and will probably not buy it again based on the lack of results unfortunately</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice daily for two weeks now with no results. Very disappointed. It was very expensive and so i wish i had a little result.</li>
    <li> Starting to see results</li>
    <li> Great smell, nice price, good product (as stated in many other reviews).</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and really puts the &amp;#34;elast&amp;#34; in DermElast! I used this product daily for about a month and my skin was noticeably softer and smoother. While it only faded old stretch marks slightly, it helps prevent new ones from forming and helps soothe the new bright colored ones. It made my skin feel like it had more elasticity and the hint of grapefruit scent was amazing! I wish this came in a larger bottle so I could use it as a daily whole body cream! I would recommend this product as a great cream that hydrates, soothes, and smells great too!</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT 3 WEEKS AND CAN TELL A BIG DIFFERANCE! LOVE IT!</li>
