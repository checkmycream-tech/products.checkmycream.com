    <li> My face feels so soft and clean after using this. And it helps with breakouts.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how it calms my skin down and its very refreshing. I do however have sensitive skin and it really helps with the dryness and breakouts so far.</li>
    <li> Its very foamy and soft and I love it and its great to have some free samples too</li>
    <li> I use this every day! You only need a tiny amount and it creates a great lather! It removes all my makeup including eye make up! Love it!</li>
    <li> It cleans deeply but gently.</li>
    <li> It is sold in Korea with the price of $3. The seller says that the original price is more than $40 and it does not make sense.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my face really well.,&lt;br /&gt;I think I would try different foam too.</li>
    <li> this product it really great. it leaves my face feeling smooth and refreshed. will definitely be buying again once I ran out,which wood be til a good while. a little goes a long Wu with this foam cleanser.</li>
    <li> So gentle and soothing on the skin. Leave a bit of a residue unless washed well since it is more of a cream texture. Overall really like how this product smells and feels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product is so good</li>
    <li> I had to buy this cleanser after living in Korea for two years. None of the American brands seem to work as well as this Face Shop cleanser--not Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, etc. Good price and value!</li>
    <li> Got this facial cleanser as a birthday gift and fell in love the first time I used this. I&#x27;m currently using this every morning, and keeps my face smooth and keeps me pimple-free. Compare to other facial wash that I used before, this is non-drying, and I didn&#x27;t even experience any break-outs at all.</li>

    <li> Great for any skin, came earlier than expected. Awesome product introduced to me by a friend who was abroad in Korea. It washes off makeup and leaves your skin feeling super soft!</li>
    <li> It foams up really well, so little goes a long way. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and leaves my face feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this cleanser removes my makeup. It smells great and feels smoothing. However, after washing off the cleanser, I notice dry patches around my face, especially around my pimple areas. I&#x27;ve tried some other Korean cleansers that do not cause dry skin. It could be that I need to moisture right away or maybe it&#x27;s some part of a healing process? It may not be good for people with dry and sensitive skin. I prefer the Etude House Baking Powder BB Deep Cleansing Foam over this.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t buy this product off of Amazon, I still would like to give a review on this product. First, I would like to say the price for this product is bargain because I paid $12 for it and it was considered on sale. What I didn&#x27;t like about this product was, it dried out my skin for some reason. And yes, I do have oily skin. At first, the first few uses were great(I used this product daily), but soon my skin started to dry out and it became flaky. Reading all these great reviews from other people, maybe this product just wasn&#x27;t meant for me.</li>
    <li> If you want a good quality face wash,  then buy from The face shop. The Aloe face wash leaves a residue which feels like real plant aloe to me...it &#x27;s not a silky soft after feel like you would expect. It &#x27;s like using a bar soap with that weird residue feel,  but instead this product feels non drying and the residue seems like real plant residue. Also,  this product goes a long way....I only need a pea sized drop and I wash my face and neck with a thick lather....SERIOUSLY!  If I don&#x27;t moisturize with cream after I use this wash,  my face feels balanced. Not oily or dry...very interesting.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and I do not break out when I using them. I will purchase more int he future</li>
    <li> I really love this cleansing foam !!!!</li>
