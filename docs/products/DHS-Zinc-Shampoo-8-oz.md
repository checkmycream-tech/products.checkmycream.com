### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great Choice!</li>
      <li>Great shampoo!</li>
      <li>Perfect.  </li>
      <li>Oh, and most of all!!!!</li>
      <li>product is great.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant odor, reduces acne and itchiness and comes in an attractive plastic bottle that is easy to dispense in the shower.l</li>
      <li>It Cleans really nice but doesn&#x27;t solve the problem for which it was purchased</li>
      <li>I have a skin condition that requires this kind of shampoo, and it does the job.</li>
      <li>the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is good, but it is not as hydrating as regular shampoo, and the scent is not the best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice a lathery, but it made my scalp itch even more.</li>
      <li>It lathers well, has no medicinal odor, and controls the itchy scalp most effectively.</li>
      <li>For many years, I have had itchy, flaking scalp.</li>
      <li>Recommended to me by my Dermatologist, simply the best shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, Amazon came to the rescue!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I tried DHS Zinc many years ago on the advice of a dermatologist and have used it exclusively ever since.</li>
      <li>It is a great treatment shampoo and leaves my hair healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>thing I cannot understand is why Walgreens, CVS and most neighborhood pharmacies do not have it available.</li>
      <li>The change-up seems to be an important part of tbe strategy.</li>
      <li>I have tried every product available until my dermatologist gave me a sample of DHS with zinc.</li>
      <li>I bought this conditioner together with the shampoo, and so far I have had good results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hair feels silky clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>Great for dry itchy scalp..</li>
      <li>The good news is it does not dry my scalp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My stylist is always pleased to work with such healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>Despite the price rising to double what it was originally, a bottle lasts for years as a portion the size of a dime produces more foam than needed, although I must admit that I don&#x27;t have much hair on top.</li>
      <li>go to smile.amazon.com first!</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it available through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>so all in all, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist was right after all.</li>
      <li>In rotation with these other products I find this one to be effective.</li>
      <li>This shampoo with the active  ingredient pyrithione zinc is effective in my experience.  </li>
      <li>fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, pretty much neutral, which for my sensitive nose is a winner.</li>
      <li>I was given a small sample of this product by my dermatologist, and found it so effective that I have continued use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for anyone who has sensitive and itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for my sensitive scalp and it has done wonders.</li>
      <li>I put it into a squeeze bottle with an application tip (like one you would use for hair dye), apply it directly to my scalp, rub my scalp and then without rising I apply the shampoo of my choice on my hair and finish shampooing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s my third order with it. It keeps my deep red hair color in tact and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> For many years, I have had itchy, flaking scalp. I have tried every product available until my dermatologist gave me a sample of DHS with zinc. For over 15 years, DHS with Zinc has kept the itching and flaking at bay. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that controls my dandruff and other scalp issues. Love this shampoo. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Recommended to me by my Dermatologist, simply the best shampoo I have ever used.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This shampoo with the active  ingredient pyrithione zinc is effective in my experience.  I use it to treat seborrheic dermatitis.  As my dermatologist suggested I do, I alternate this shampoo with other ones that include selenium sulfide 1%, salicylic acid 3%, ketaconozole 1%, sold under brand names Selsen Blue, Head &amp; Shoulders, etc. In rotation with these other products I find this one to be effective. Using it by itself didn&#x27;t do the trick. The change-up seems to be an important part of tbe strategy. Sometimes it may be neccesary to use an over-the counter Cortisone Cream such as Cortaid.</li>
    <li> I could only find this on line.  It is a great treatment shampoo and leaves my hair healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I was given a small sample of this product by my dermatologist, and found it so effective that I have continued use. It lathers well, has no medicinal odor, and controls the itchy scalp most effectively. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from acne on my scalp and no matter what I did it wouldn&#x27;t go away, until I found this shampoo, that is.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the conditioner after receiving samples from my Dermatolist. Highly recommend it for anyone who has sensitive and itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Compare to Zoma brand. It works the same but for $10 cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have a skin condition that requires this kind of shampoo, and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Works like a charm</li>
    <li> My mom uses this shampoo, and likes it. Thanks for making it available through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Did not help itchy scalp</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommend this to me. It does the job on my dandruff here in the Southwest with the drying winds and low humidity.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is the ONLY solution to my scalp problems!  I tried everything else in the market and nothing worked for my seboreic dermatitis.  It ended all the symptoms, no more itching or scaling, AS LONG AS I USE IT REGULARLY AND OFTEN, that means at least every second day.  The good news is it does not dry my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I cannot understand is why Walgreens, CVS and most neighborhood pharmacies do not have it available. Fortunately, Amazon came to the rescue! I learned my lesson:  go to smile.amazon.com first!</li>
    <li> Used for several years. Does as advertised!</li>
    <li> The only shampoo I can buy over the counter that fights my seborrhea dermititis.</li>
    <li> This product is a little pricey, but you only need as small amount (size of quarter) to do the job.  Hair feels silky clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> It Cleans really nice but doesn&#x27;t solve the problem for which it was purchased</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my sensitive scalp and it has done wonders. It only takes a little bit, compared to regular shampoo so all in all, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> recommended by PA at derms office.  I found it works and doesn&#x27;t have the smell of Tgel and don&#x27;t need an RX.</li>
    <li> I tried DHS Zinc many years ago on the advice of a dermatologist and have used it exclusively ever since. It is the only, emphasize ONLY, product I have ever found to truly control dandruff.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner together with the shampoo, and so far I have had good results.&lt;br /&gt;It improved the level of oil my scalp produces, but since I don’t apply conditioner to my roots, I give that to the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is good, but it is not as hydrating as regular shampoo, and the scent is not the best. It did not dehydrate my hair too much, but it is a little dry.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for decades since my dermatologist prescribed it. Despite the price rising to double what it was originally, a bottle lasts for years as a portion the size of a dime produces more foam than needed, although I must admit that I don&#x27;t have much hair on top. Pleasant odor, reduces acne and itchiness and comes in an attractive plastic bottle that is easy to dispense in the shower.l</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice a lathery, but it made my scalp itch even more.</li>
    <li> This product has actually burned my hair.  I&#x27;ve used it twice.  My hair is not chemically treated and I do not use a blow dryer or any other heat elements.  I quite literally wash, rinse, condition, rinse, towel dry, air dry, brush and go.  My stylist is always pleased to work with such healthy hair.  I bought the shampoo because I have had a very bad scalp acne breakout and this product boasts that it can fix it.  During the second use was when my hair turned into a massive, dried out, tangled mess.  It feels like a wad of damp straw.  Never again and off to the stylist so he can cut off about 14 inches of ruined mess.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Performs as advertised.  Clears up scalp issues and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I put it into a squeeze bottle with an application tip (like one you would use for hair dye), apply it directly to my scalp, rub my scalp and then without rising I apply the shampoo of my choice on my hair and finish shampooing.  In applying it this way I don&#x27;t depend on this product to condition my hair just my scalp and I can use a moisturizing shampoo on my hair.</li>
    <li> fast delivery.  product is great.</li>
    <li> Great for dry itchy scalp..</li>
    <li> Kinda pricy for a small jug but all it takes is a small dab to work a decent lather. Been using it for a few weeks and it has cut dandruff and helped with the itching. My dermatologist was right after all. Oh, and most of all!!!! it doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, pretty much neutral, which for my sensitive nose is a winner. Hope this helped</li>
    <li> This is the shampoo that my husband uses as it sorta controls his &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; or flaking of his scalp.  This shampoo was introduced by his Dermatologist.  Great Choice!</li>
