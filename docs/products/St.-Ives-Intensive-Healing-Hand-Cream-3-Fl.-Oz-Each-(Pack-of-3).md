<ol>
      <li>Best hand lotion ever!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Best non-sticky, unscented hand cream ever!</li>
      <li>it is very nice handlotion which I can no longer get in the stores!</li>
      <li>Was extremely happy to find this.  </li>
      <li>For those who don&#x27;t care about scents it is very effective at healing</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY products but St. Ives is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I just love this wonderful hand cream.  </li>
      <li>I understand there is often a masking fragrance required in order for creams to be pleasant to use.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is really good.  </li>
      <li>Arrived very fast and is the best lotion for feet!!</li>
      <li>So great on the hands and so reasonable in price.  </li>
      <li>Remember that smell is subjective. :)</li>
      <li>Love this product wish I could find more....</li>
      <li>This is my favorite moisturizing cream.</li>
      <li>Many products claim to be unscented.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Especially great if you have dry skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hand cream is thicker than the lotion, but still works fine in face too.</li>
      <li>This cream works well, but is supposedly fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product that I will definitely buy again when I run out of the 3-pack I purchased!</li>
      <li>I like that this lotion is paraben free and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my dry hands.</li>
      <li>I am personally going to use up this lotion and then refill the bottles with the kind from the store which I think smells better.  </li>
      <li>Odor-free, quick absorbing  and non-greasy, really makes your hands feel good after using the product.</li>
      <li>They have a lotion that is hypoallergenic but unfortunately is not fragrance free any longer, so I buy this instead.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for use on my dry hands in summer, and it is not scented so my husband actually used it too, with great results!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind that works.</li>
      <li>This smells more medicinal, and may be why someone said it was old.  </li>
      <li>hand creams I have tried tend to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on top of the skin instead of actually being absorbed, but my skin absorbs this right away</li>
      <li>It is completely fragrance free and is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>But it is not dried out or anything and works fine.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t work as well as the first one I purchased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years, and my skin is soft and mostly wrinkle-free, even though I&#x27;m in my early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a very moisturing and yet non greasy and smelly hand cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the face too because it is the only product from St. Ives that is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>Works really well, but I don&#x27;t like that it contains petrolatum.  </li>
      <li>It is a thick cream, but not greasy, absorbs quickly leaves a smooth, velvety finish.</li>
      <li>I applied the cream about 3 times the first day and 2 times the second day.</li>
      <li>When I first purchased this, my hands were cracked and bleeding in several spots.</li>
      <li>But be aware that it is not exactly like the intensive healing (red label) kind sold in Walmart and other stores.  </li>
      <li>St Ives Intensive Healing Hand Cream has a completely neutral scent and also works well.  </li>
      <li>I use this product frequently throughout the day on my hands.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best hand creams for dry skin, especially in the cold winter months.  </li>
      <li>After the second day, my hands were completely healed and so soft.</li>
      <li>Most hand creams aren&#x27;t thick enough to make a difference, but this one is.  </li>

    <li> This stuff is really good.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years, and my skin is soft and mostly wrinkle-free, even though I&#x27;m in my early 70&#x27;s.  I use it nightly on hands and arms, and keep getting compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> it is very nice handlotion which I can no longer get in the stores!</li>

    <li> My hands get extremely dry in the winter, to the point where they are cracked and bleeding. I have tried MANY products but St. Ives is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. When I first purchased this, my hands were cracked and bleeding in several spots. I applied the cream about 3 times the first day and 2 times the second day. After the second day, my hands were completely healed and so soft. I now use it about once a day for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many hand creams I have tried tend to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on top of the skin instead of actually being absorbed, but my skin absorbs this right away so I know it&#x27;s working. There is absolutely no greasy residue and I can continue my daily routine without feeling like I have a film of grease on my hands. With cracked hands, most lotions burn or sting like crazy- this hand cream DOES NOT BURN OR STING like some others- even when my hands are bleeding, it does not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works well on my hands and is unscented and that is what I was looking for...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work as well as the first one I purchased.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but I don&#x27;t like that it contains petrolatum.  Shipping seemed really slow; I had 10 different and diverse items in my order and this was the last to get here, several days after the next to last.</li>

For those who don&#x27;t care about scents it is very effective at healing and I would recommend it.

    <li> This is my favorite moisturizing cream. It is completely fragrance free and is easily absorbed into the skin. Especially great if you have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the face too because it is the only product from St. Ives that is fragrance free. They have a lotion that is hypoallergenic but unfortunately is not fragrance free any longer, so I buy this instead. The hand cream is thicker than the lotion, but still works fine in face too.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hand creams for dry skin, especially in the cold winter months.  Most hand creams aren&#x27;t thick enough to make a difference, but this one is.  I was using Aveda hand cream, but it&#x27;s four times the price for the same amount.</li>
    <li> I use this product frequently throughout the day on my hands.This has been an incredibly cold winter in Northeast NJ and the skin on my hands has been very dry. I keep a tube in my purse, on my desk at work and on my nightstand. Odor-free, quick absorbing  and non-greasy, really makes your hands feel good after using the product. I can not find this product in my local stores..</li>
    <li> These pack of 3 came in a ripped plastic bag with words, &amp;#34;sold as is&amp;#34;.  Started to use cream and notice a hard consistency  and rancid smell to it.  I then checked the expiration date and saw that it was past the sell by date.  I threw them out.  I have used this product before from different venders and it was creamy with no odor.</li>
    <li> I just love this wonderful hand cream.  So great on the hands and so reasonable in price.  I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a very moisturing and yet non greasy and smelly hand cream.</li>
    <li> Best non-sticky, unscented hand cream ever!</li>

    <li> Works great on my dry hands. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion ever!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was extremely happy to find this.  They don&#x27;t seem to be making it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a terrible mistake on the part of St. Ives.  It&#x27;s the only kind that works.</li>
