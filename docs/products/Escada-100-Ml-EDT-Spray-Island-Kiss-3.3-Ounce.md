      <li>One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>So many things happened in my life that year, and my original bottle of Escada Island Kiss was used up within that time.  </li>
      <li>I love this scent and am so happy Amazon has this available (not always available in stores) and for $10 cheaper than the smaller bottle at Kohl&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is ok, for me too sweet and –sort of cheap.</li>
      <li>Free shipping and very fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sweet perfume girl and this didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>This is not bad for the price, however, I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
      <li>I feel this is a perfume that is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My first time buying the Island Kiss.. not bad.  </li>
      <li>Very long lasting, fresh and fruity but also very nice after some hours because of the sweet nuances.</li>
      <li>It was a new and exciting time in my life, having just turned 21 and moved to a big city on my own.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that I wish they still sold it in the original bottle!</li>
      <li>The positive reviews pushed me to buy it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>more than I.&lt;br /&gt;the scent is not long lasting.</li>
      <li>Not only does it bring back good nostalgic feelings, but it&#x27;s such a great smell.  </li>
      <li>I tried to fill the void with the numerous other similar perfumes that Escada would come out with each year, but none were as good.  </li>
      <li>Purchase new fragrance every year.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume for the first time back in 2004.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was the first time I use ESCADA, so I cannot compare its quality or even smell with previous purchases.</li>

<li> If you like other tropical perfumes from Escada, such as Rockin Rio or Marine Groove, you&#x27;ll probably like this perfume as well.</li>
<li> But it sounds like other people like it</li>
<li> I was very skeptical about buying perfume online.</li>

    <li> I was very skeptical about buying perfume online. I went ahead and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and the way it smells! It was just as described and smells fantastic, perfect summer scent. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent. Good price. Placed order on a Thursday morning and got it the next day. Free shipping and very fast!</li>
    <li> Love all escada scents!  Purchase new fragrance every year. My husband loves how they smell too.  Great for teens or adults.</li>
    <li> This is not bad for the price, however, I won&#x27;t buy this again. It&#x27;s smells more like great fruits then a sweet smelling  perfume to me. I guess it depends on the person and what the person likes different strokes for different folks. I&#x27;m a sweet perfume girl and this didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> This perfume has always been one of my favorite perfumes. It has a fruity tropical smell that lasts all day long. I feel this is a perfume that is worth every penny.

    <li> I bought this perfume for the first time back in 2004. It was a new and exciting time in my life, having just turned 21 and moved to a big city on my own.  So many things happened in my life that year, and my original bottle of Escada Island Kiss was used up within that time.  I never repurchased it because it was discontinued.  I tried to fill the void with the numerous other similar perfumes that Escada would come out with each year, but none were as good.  I was so happy to find it here on Amazon.  As soon as I misted the first spray on myself it reminded me of the past.  Not only does it bring back good nostalgic feelings, but it&#x27;s such a great smell.  Sugary, tropical, candy... all in one.  But without being too adolescent.  I plan on wearing this all summer.  The only downside is that I wish they still sold it in the original bottle!</li>
    <li> I just love this brand of perfume.  My first time buying the Island Kiss.. not bad.  But not the best either.  Still a perfect perfume for the summer.</li>

    <li> I love love the way this smells it a fruity scent.  I always get complimented when I use it.  The pricing was excellent.</li>
    <li> Very long lasting, fresh and fruity but also very nice after some hours because of the sweet nuances. Perfekt for summer.</li>
