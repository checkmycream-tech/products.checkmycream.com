      <li>I bought this attachment for my wife&#x27;s Hitachi and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>It has intense vibration but the g-spot stimulator didn&#x27;t do anything for them</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a neat toy, and it looked like it woulkd be just the thing to spice up our massager, but the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; dont seem to be in the right place, or at the right angle, especially when compared to the knob.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anybody who wants to shake things up a bit.</li>
      <li>It is firm, yet flexible, and easy to get into the right spot  </li>
      <li>I also lie the texture of the product, it’s very soft!</li>
      <li>again it is not a soft enough or pliable enough  rubber for my happiness</li>
      <li>She and I highly recommend this attachment.</li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t move around since it has a tight, snug fit onto wand.  </li>
      <li>This attachment was soft and flexible.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this for my wife as a surprise and we were both unpleasantly surprised by its size.</li>
      <li>the product is very simple it massages the g spot right away and the clit at the same time.</li>
      <li>My wife loved it compared to other devices we have used in the past!  </li>
      <li>very hard plastic and the nubs on the head would be better if they didn&#x27;t exist.  </li>
      <li>The toy is big and will stim from the butt to the clit, My gf is not a fan of any stim near the bottom hole, so I simply cut the bottom part off for her.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This thing is massive so unless your partner is &amp;#34;Very experienced&amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; fit isn&#x27;t accurate at all</li>
    <li> Wow! This item was shipped very fast.  The attachment is a great fit to my wand.  The attachment itself is very flexible.  Easy to bend.  So far so good.  We are very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Compact design. Hits all the right spots to give me satisfaction. Soft bumps and strong stimulation adds that extra something I love.</li>
    <li> Incredible MULTIPLE ORGASMS</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, just what i needed!</li>
    <li> This is a great attachment for the Shibari Magic Wand Massager .  It is more than just a massager.  My wife loved it compared to other devices we have used in the past!  Very quiet and it did the trick.  When she’s happy I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Wife doesn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> was very hard to get onto the shibari wand my husband would have to stretch it open while i hold the wand and insert, i cannot get it on by myself.</li>
    <li> My wife never knew how it felt until I found it and played with her and she when crazy. We love it and I like to set her off. It make me feel great too</li>
    <li> From what the ladies tell me its not that great. It has intense vibration but the g-spot stimulator didn&#x27;t do anything for them</li>
    <li> Wife didnt like it, she said it wasnt as nice as the Dolphin attachment.  will try it again one of these days, and maybe she will change her mind.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.  This attachment was soft and flexible.  I thought it might be uncomfortable but it wasn&#x27;t.  Overall it fit nicely.  I am happy with it .</li>
    <li> I love it!! The texture, the strength, all of it, goes great with my wand! Oh ya! Oh ya! Get it!</li>
    <li> This is a well designed product. I could tell my wife really was enjoying herself. The construction was great and i think its going to last a really long time. I did notice that it was a little stiff when cold but it heats up quickly and becomes much softer. I think this is a great product for the price and i am looking forward to trying out other Shibari attachments. Thank you.</li>
    <li> the product is very simple it massages the g spot right away and the clit at the same time. It fits right on the shibari wand. My girlfriend loved it and it is easily cleaned.</li>
    <li> The machine feels great and the vibration is on point! I don’t think that I’ll be using any other device than this one. I also lie the texture of the product, it’s very soft! The multiple stimulation points are also a plus!</li>
    <li> So big and painful. The massage points are like a torture device, can&#x27;t think how can someone like this, it is for xl women. Way too rough!</li>
    <li> Super fun design that hits the spot.  Doesn&#x27;t move around since it has a tight, snug fit onto wand.  Clean look and color and so simple to clean up after use.  Every girl could use one trust me.</li>
    <li> My gf had her first ever g-spot orgasms from this attachment, I might add easily and from the first use.&lt;br /&gt;Very strong internal vibes as well as top to bottom external stimulation. The toy is big and will stim from the butt to the clit, My gf is not a fan of any stim near the bottom hole, so I simply cut the bottom part off for her. The attachment has a dimpled texture which can be rough, use lube generously to avoid any irritation or abrasion. We recommend warming lube. Fits the hitachi perfectly Good luck.</li>
    <li> very hard plastic and the nubs on the head would be better if they didn&#x27;t exist.  Just ok, good for some variety</li>
    <li> it is okay, I have better I think.  again it is not a soft enough or pliable enough  rubber for my happiness</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife as a surprise and we were both unpleasantly surprised by its size. It is huge! I imagine it works well for people who aren&#x27;t put off by its size. It was overkill for us and we returned it. I gave it 3 stars because the company did not give me any trouble with returning the unit.</li>
    <li> It fits Original Magic Wand Personal Massager Full Body Massage HandHeld HV-260 perfectly.</li>
    <li> Wife seems to like it. It took some getting used to, but now she likes it pretty well. Like one of the other reviews said, it&#x27;s bigger than expected.</li>
    <li> WARNING: body and sex positive review.  Ladies, this attachment is worth every penny.  On its own, it is a wonderfully shaped g-spot massager.  Had me squirting in minutes and orgasming shortly thereafter.  Then I put it on the wand - Cloud 9.  It is firm, yet flexible, and easy to get into the right spot  Nubbles keep the sensation interesting and varied.  Whether you already love that G-spot orgasm, or are looking to explore  this is a winner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  The build is good, strong and firm, which helps to bring many, many success stories.  Multiple success stories, if you know what I mean. She has other attachments, but this one is quickly becoming her favorite.  She&#x27;s had only a few G spot O&#x27;s prior to owning this, now she&#x27;s had many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husbands, if you want to keep your wife happy, which in my case means, she keeps me happy.  Get this attachment for her wand and if she&#x27;s like my wife, she&#x27;ll make you happier than ever before.  She and I highly recommend this attachment.</li>
    <li> Would never work for me, it is huge.</li>
    <li> I bought this attachment for my wife&#x27;s Hitachi and she absolutely loves it. It fits perfectly, never slides off, and hits all the right spots. I highly recommend this product to anybody who wants to shake things up a bit.</li>
    <li> Not one of my favorite attachments but still a fun addition to any toy collection.</li>
    <li> Bad material. Debris, hair, and dust sticks to it easily and doesn&#x27;t wash off. Recommend going with a softer silicone attachment, not a rubberized one. Never used it and threw it out shortly after buying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a bridal gift so I can&#x27;t really say how it works other than it is a huge item...lol</li>
    <li> Too big. The picture is a little deceiving, check the dimensions before buying.</li>
    <li> Ur Woman will love it</li>
    <li> I personally recommend this item. It attaches easily, it fits snug and doesn&#x27;t slide around and detaches with ease. The material itself was firm yet rather squishy and not hard or stiff at all which is very pleasing.</li>
    <li> Another great Shibari product that I used in combination with the wand that I purchased and needless to say this was very stimulating to use on my wife who has practically fallen in love, with these products!</li>
    <li> My Wife loves it! It Hits all the right spots!  Its one of her favs from our collection. Great product! :)</li>
    <li> I enjoy this wand attachment. As it states, strong stimulation for points of interest. The material is pliable and soft, but sturdy and firm enough for a variety of uses. And it&#x27;s surprisingly bigger than one would think. That&#x27;s &amp;#34;what she said;&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s what I say too.</li>
    <li> Works great on the wife. nice shape and feel. She was surprised by it at first and then really surprised at the end. I&#x27;m glad i got the add on. fits great on the wand and easy to take off.</li>
    <li> the shibari wand attachment fits my adam &amp; Eve massager nice and tight. The attachment works well. However wife said the attachment needed generous amount of lubricant, since it felt very tight..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a neat toy, and it looked like it woulkd be just the thing to spice up our massager, but the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; dont seem to be in the right place, or at the right angle, especially when compared to the knob. Unless you use a lot of pressure, it doesnt hit those magical spots for my partner atleast. neat, but not quite there.</li>
    <li> DID NOT CARE FOR THIS ONE EITHER TO BULKY IF A GIRL CAN NOT BE COMFORTABLE USING IT FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE  SHE BOUGHT IT FOR IT IS USLESS WAS NOT HAPPY WITH IT,.</li>
    <li> wife thought to rough</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a monster it hits all the right places but she&#x27;s a tough nut to crack</li>
</ol>
