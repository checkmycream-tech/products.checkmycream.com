      <li>Wasn&#x27;t too much of a difference, but still OK.</li>
      <li>Thank order came quickly</li>
      <li>Also, I like the new container a lot better.  </li>
      <li>Just using less than a pea size amount can give you a great foamy lather for your face and neck.</li>
      <li>This is the Perfect face wash to give your face a good clean base before putting on toner, essence and moisturizer.</li>
      <li>ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING YOU ONLY NEED A TINY BIT TO WORK UP A GREAT LATHER!!! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different Shiseido lines over the past 15 years or so, they have all been pretty good for my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found the Benefiance  line to work best for me.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s been a long time Shiseido user and her skin looks better than mine!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Almost immediately, it sucked the moisture right out of my skin.  </li>
      <li>Cleansing cream is gentle,  foamy and clean rinsing.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product for people with dry to very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Hands down the best facial cleanser!  </li>
      <li>Does go far, but plenty of other products that work as nice and at a better price.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle on skin.</li>
      <li>Being Asian skincare is very very important to us.</li>
      <li>Highly highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>She is satisfied it is the same product.</li>
      <li>just like soap, but has the exact drying properties of it.  </li>
      <li>A lot of products either leave my face burning bright red or cracked and leaving my skin super dry.</li>
      <li>I have tried every drug store product you can name and have even purchased very expensive luxury skincare products but nothing made my skin more bright, smooth and even toned than this product.</li>
      <li>Tried it with the recommended night cream with no noticeable positive effects.</li>
      <li>Nice cleanser, but not worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job of cleaning my face without making it overly dry, and without causing lots of red blotches everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had tried this product in the past and love the clean and non-dryness feel on my face.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>but since it rinses off anyway, and I don&#x27;t have to continually smell it, it does not bother me that much.  </li>
      <li>My skin always feels so fresh and soft after use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>BUT THEY REALLY JUST MELT</li>
      <li>and it cleanse my whole face.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this product,</li>
      <li>Then wash with gentle cleansing foam followed with balancing softner</li>
      <li>I much prefer the product that is grainier.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
      <li>The delivery was fast as well.</li>
      <li>and I have honestly gotten several comments about my skin just in this last week, unrelated to one another.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this only because the original wasn&#x27;t offered.</li>
      <li>This product was first introduced to me while I was visiting in Japan many years ago, I like to use this cleansing foam especially in the evenings brings softer and deep cleansing.</li>
      <li>Totally addictive to it.&lt;br /&gt;Seller delivered the product quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes skin feels soft.  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser because it isn&#x27;t rough on my skin. I hate it when after you wash your face it feels chapped, I have combination skin &amp; sometimes that happens to me.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it in conjunction with the moisturizer of the same line and I will not likely switch to another product anytime soon. The smell is to die for and the texture is fantastic! It also lasts for a long time (over 6 months) and is definitely worth the money. I have normal skin with a few breakouts every now and then and it leaves my face feeling clean but not overly dry.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used for cleansing my face!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best facial cleanser!  I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product!  You don&#x27;t need the makeup remover before this. Cleases and exfoliates at the same time and  feels so soft and moist.</li>
    <li> Nice, good pricing compared to the ones I get in stores. Wasn&#x27;t too much of a difference, but still OK.</li>
    <li> This is such a lovely product - so smooth!!!</li>
    <li> This is a favorite and I have been using it for years now. I trust that regardless of not being of Asian descent that I can still use this product regardless of my ethnicity. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my mom as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She&#x27;s been a long time Shiseido user and her skin looks better than mine! Best price on Amazon! :)</li>
    <li> MY FRIEND GOT A SAMPLE OF THIS FOR ME AND I LOVEEEEE IT. IT CLEANS SO WELL WITH NO RESIDUE LEFT BEHIND. YOUR FACE TRULY FEELS AND IS CLEAN. IT DOES HAVE TINY EXFOLIATE TYPE PARTIALS BUT THEY REALLY JUST MELT AS YOU FOAM IT UP. GREAT SMELL. NOT OVER POWERING. 125ML IS A LOT OF PRODUCT ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING YOU ONLY NEED A TINY BIT TO WORK UP A GREAT LATHER!!! :)</li>
    <li> This may look a little pricy, but a tube goes a long way. It is wonderful stuff. I have given it as gifts and the recipients loved it also.</li>
    <li> The most luxurious hands down product I have seen and experienced, the 100% best face wash I have ever tried in my life.  You use just a tiny pin size amount and it lathers your entire face, so creamy!</li>
    <li> creamy, cleanser; great for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> excellent face wash nothing is left but  very clean face</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for some time now.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and does a great job of cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy w the product &amp; keep 1 in the shower &amp; 1 on the bathroom sink</li>
    <li> Hello reviewers! Being Asian skincare is very very important to us. I have tried every drug store product you can name and have even purchased very expensive luxury skincare products but nothing made my skin more bright, smooth and even toned than this product. I have very sensitive dry skin with a lot of redness. A lot of products either leave my face burning bright red or cracked and leaving my skin super dry. Never have I used a face wash that strips every dirt and dead skin off my face all while having a very soothing and moisturizered finish. This is the Perfect face wash to give your face a good clean base before putting on toner, essence and moisturizer. Very gentle on skin. Yes the price may be a little steep but a little goes a very long way. Just using less than a pea size amount can give you a great foamy lather for your face and neck. Highly highly recommend!! I got my husband who usually just uses cetaphil to switch over and he now purchases his own bottles.</li>
    <li> Love this Shiseido! I have been using Shiseido products for many, many years. May be alittle expensive but worth every dollar!</li>
    <li> This product was first introduced to me while I was visiting in Japan many years ago, I like to use this cleansing foam especially in the evenings brings softer and deep cleansing.</li>
    <li> Best face wash on the market!  The price on amazon was also very good. Quick deliverly was a bonus for sure!!!</li>
    <li> I can not use soap on my skin, so when this was given to me as a sample, I decided to try it.  This not only&lt;br /&gt;smells just like soap, but has the exact drying properties of it.  This would be great for some one with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately, it sucked the moisture right out of my skin.  I&#x27;m 55 with dry older skin so I need nice creamy&lt;br /&gt;cleansers and moisturizers.  This did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good. Does not leave skin oily and greasy. Noticed my complexion clearing up as well. Little pricy but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Thank order came quickly&lt;br /&gt;and this is what I need</li>
    <li> I love how my face feels after.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, my face feels super clean after I use it. I recommend it, it&#x27;s very good!</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser, but not worth the cost.  Does go far, but plenty of other products that work as nice and at a better price.  Tried it with the recommended night cream with no noticeable positive effects.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does not irritate my skin.  I have rosacea and skin allergies, and it is difficult for me to find anything that my face can handle.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different Shiseido lines over the past 15 years or so, they have all been pretty good for my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found the Benefiance  line to work best for me.  It does a good job of cleaning my face without making it overly dry, and without causing lots of red blotches everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new version of this cleanser came a new fragrance (I wish everyone had fragrance-free versions of everything!) but since it rinses off anyway, and I don&#x27;t have to continually smell it, it does not bother me that much.  It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out. The new version of the cleanser seems a bit thinner than the old version, but it gets just as foamy and works just as well for my skin. Also, I like the new container a lot better.  It snaps open/closed, instead of the top having to be unscrewed.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used.  I have been washing my face morning &amp; night every day since I got it (about a month) and I have honestly gotten several comments about my skin just in this last week, unrelated to one another.  I am over 55 and my skin has lost it&#x27;s &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34;, so I was shocked and extremely pleased that others have noticed.  I had noticed a change myself, but it really feels great when others notice as well.  Honestly you really only need a very small amount, like the size of a dime or even smaller. It foams beautifully and has a nice, very light smell.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I much prefer the product that is grainier.  I like my face to be squeeky clean. This one is too creamy. I ordered this only because the original wasn&#x27;t offered.</li>
    <li> Excellent, product will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been usuing the cleansing clothes for years, so it might not be a fair review.  This made my face feel so clean! I will never go back to just the clothes.</li>
    <li> Great product. I purchase as a gift for my mother and she loves it. She has re-ordered this product several times.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing foam. I don&#x27;t really think of it as a foam, but it works great.  My skin always feels so fresh and soft after use.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. As described.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I dont have to use alot only littile bit and it cleanse my whole face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20 years and I love it. This product agrees with my skin. Thanks for carrying this product,</li>
    <li> I had tried this product in the past and love the clean and non-dryness feel on my face. Totally addictive to it.&lt;br /&gt;Seller delivered the product quickly. Thumb up.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great. Never feels dry afterwards. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> my favor cosmetic brand</li>
    <li> Everything as expected.</li>
    <li> Order came very promptly and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with it because I think it&#x27;s already expired,the box there is a red tag,it&#x27;s already peeled..looks like it&#x27;s already sale..the item price together w/the shipping is the same price in what I got in macy&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleansing foam for years. It is a great product. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much. The delivery was fast as well. Good experience.</li>
    <li> Shiseido is one of the few facial products that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or dry my skin. The extra creamy cleansing foam lasts a very long time; I use it twice a day and this tube lasts about 4 months. It has a great fragrance, too.</li>
    <li> Both me and my daughter have been using this cleansing foam for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is like using a scrub to rid all dead skin from face.  Then wash with gentle cleansing foam followed with balancing softner the treat your face to final moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this cleansing cream, leaves your skin feeling wonderful. I recommend it highly and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is called extra creamy but has the same ingredients as the Shiseido Benefiance Cleansing Foam my wife has been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;It feels and works the same. She is satisfied it is the same product.</li>
    <li> have been using it for 35 years, it is great</li>
    <li> Great product and works well on skin. You only need a small amount around a size of a dime.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over twenty years...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> very nice facial wash -</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, well worth the price. It cleans so well that my face squeaks like clean hair is supposed to. It is slightly gritty - a plus - and my face feels great after a wash. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than stated. Product as stated. Good price value.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and moisturizes skin well. Will consider buying this product online more often to save money.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for people with dry to very dry skin.  Cleansing cream is gentle,  foamy and clean rinsing.  Soft skin remains after using.  Using twice a day (morning and night ) skin will become softer and more supple over time.</li>
