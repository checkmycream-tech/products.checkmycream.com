    <li> This brow kit is REALLY worth the money.  I don&#x27;t use the contour outlines but the colors can be mixed to match eyebrows perfectly.  I&#x27;m blond so I mix #1 and #2 and it looks so natural.  It does not randomly come off throughout the day either!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received my eyebrow stencil!! I used it as soon as I got it! I am very happy with it!! I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be as easy to use as it was!! I definitely recommend it &amp; I would purchase it again, no doubt!! Thank you so much!! :-) Tammy</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, must try!</li>
    <li> Great package but I guess it&#x27;s a hit or miss. The stencils are great in the fact that they are broken up into the main part of the brow and then the second half is the arch, down. So yu can extend if you need to.  None of these matched my shape eyebrows. The powder is great but not dark enough to really fill in. I&#x27;m a bit tan, jennifer Lopez tan and I have dark brown hair. The brown looked pretty dark in the photo but even when I layer it, it&#x27;s still not brown enough. And boy i packedbit on my face! I just use it as eyeshadow now. Stencils are vinyl material with NO adhesive on the back. So yu must hold it in place and keep it still by pressing it down and squeezing the blood out of yur forehead. The brush still goes through the underside of the stencil. My husband must think I&#x27;m a weirdo after watching me try this. So the stencils got tossed.</li>
    <li> Works great included 2 brushes, love it love it love it. I have blonde eyebrows and black hair lol. so I draw them in and than color thtat over with the powder, makes them look more real and full (:</li>
    <li> I love this kit. I hardly have any eye brows but i get them cleaned up and shaped.  I use the poweder to feel them in. I don&#x27;t use the tensile at all that&#x27;s why i rated 4.</li>
    <li> love it!!!ITs my holy grail now!!</li>
    <li> This is even better than advertised and now my eyebrows are flawless.</li>

    <li> Not the best but good enough for the price. It took forever to arrive, I had already forgotten about it.</li>
    <li> Came early and I love it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this kit! The creamy powder goes on like velvet. It has enough subtle, velvety texture that your brows don&#x27;t look painted on. The angled brush that is included works so beautifully to shape the brow that I actually ended up not needing to use the templates. I can&#x27;t put on brows 1/10 as well using a pencil. I am ordering 3 more kits. 1 for my regular kit at home, 1 for work, 1 for my travel kit. Great price, free shipping...and luxury feel. What cha waiting for? Order now, than me later.</li>
    <li> I wanted the brush type, so this is just great.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product. I did not use the contour outlines yet but I found it extremely helpful to test the shape required.  These colors can be combined to match eyebrows color nicely.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s easy and I like the variety of color.</li>
    <li> I love the brow powder. I combine the black and dark brown and my eyebrows come out perfect.  I also like the stencils that came with it. I would recommend the product.</li>
