### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great !</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>and I hope it will help with some issues:)</li>
      <li>This battery operated model is just as powerful, is suitable for travel, and is more compact, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to be a pretty good item and not bad to use</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have enough suction power to be very effective.</li>
      <li>Works well and very powerful for a battery powered unit</li>
      <li>not like the original one I had  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean pores, loosen blackhead or whitehead or anything.</li>
      <li>Works great.. plenty of suction.. be careful ..</li>
      <li>think next time I buy Panasonic with more suction power - EH-2513 model.</li>
      <li>Product stopped having suction even before the battery ran out the first time.  </li>
      <li>it is not strong enough to successfully purge pores....did arrive quicly...and is easy to us.  </li>
      <li>I will say that I was surprised how quick this item was shipped out to me.</li>
      <li>There are effective black heads removers out there</li>
      <li>This little gadget effectively removes this debris and it also reduces pore size.</li>
      <li>You have to be careful to lift the device from your skin at an angle, or you&#x27;ll get love bites.</li>
      <li>and I think it really helps keep my skin clear</li>
      <li>benefits become apparent after consistent use, once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>Turns out it wasn&#x27;t much more than a waste of $35.00!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although it has great suction, it didn&#x27;t extract the blackheads and left a small red circle every where I used it.</li>
      <li>The electric ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past lasted 2 years or more.  </li>
      <li>but I hoped this would clear out pores without blackheads.</li>
      <li>Go to a professional to do your facials</li>
      <li>delivered early...</li>
      <li>If you scratch your face gently just after you&#x27;ve had a shower, white debris comes off.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it left big bruises on my face</li>
      <li>other reviewers have said, gently steam your skin for a few minutes beforehand, and make sure your skin is wet when using the device, or it can&#x27;t create a vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>particular model had instructions in Japanese only, but the illustrations were sufficient to give the general idea, like don&#x27;t vacuum your eyeballs!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, loud as all get out and no variability to the suction which is uncomfortable on some parts of my face.</li>
      <li>The only things I have ever found to get rid of blackheads are pore strips (70% removal), or scraping the affected areas with the fine loop end of a blackhead remover (100% effective, but tedious and uncomfortable).</li>

<ol>
    <li> Not enough oomph to perform as expected.</li>
    <li> I will say that I was surprised how quick this item was shipped out to me. I was slightly disappointed with it&#x27;s performance. Although it has great suction, it didn&#x27;t extract the blackheads and left a small red circle every where I used it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, loud as all get out and no variability to the suction which is uncomfortable on some parts of my face.</li>
    <li> Instructions were not in English.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Works as described...delivered early...</li>
    <li> This has helped reduce the size of the pores after just a couple weeks use. I don&#x27;t know why no one thought of this before.</li>
    <li> it is not strong enough to successfully purge pores....did arrive quicly...and is easy to us.  but not worth the money...</li>
    <li> This product is a horrid waste of money. Do not buy it. It does nothing.. Go to a professional to do your facials</li>
    <li> I use it daily and I think it really helps keep my skin clear (I have moderate acne), but unfortunately both ones I&#x27;ve had have lost their suction after 4-6 months (even after replacing the battery). It&#x27;s too expensive to keep replacing 2-3 times a year, so I&#x27;m going to try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I thought this pore cleanser would be a skin saver. Turns out it wasn&#x27;t much more than a waste of $35.00!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s really not enough power to suck out dirt, much less anything else. I should have listened to other reviewers and I wouldn&#x27;t have been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with something else, this isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a pretty good item and not bad to use and I hope it will help with some issues:)</li>
    <li> Great ! I got everything</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to replace a rechargeable model that I&#x27;ve had for several years, which finally died and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  This battery operated model is just as powerful, is suitable for travel, and is more compact, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said, gently steam your skin for a few minutes beforehand, and make sure your skin is wet when using the device, or it can&#x27;t create a vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits become apparent after consistent use, once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, it left big bruises on my face</li>
    <li> Works well and very powerful for a battery powered unit</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough suction power to be very effective.</li>
    <li> Product stopped having suction even before the battery ran out the first time.  I wasted the $34.99 on this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have enough suction to do the job and all none of the instructions were in English.</li>
    <li> You should open up the pores by steaming your face for 5-10 min.&lt;br /&gt;This device is not intended for use on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think next time I buy Panasonic with more suction power - EH-2513 model.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the same as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Panasonic Pore Cleanser, but it runs on a AAA battery and doesn&#x27;t have the same nozzel for suction.  I bought it 2 months ago and it already stopped working.  The electric ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past lasted 2 years or more.  Very disappointed.  And... Because today is one day after the 2 month mark, I cannot return it.</li>
    <li> Works great.. plenty of suction.. be careful .. used it after having dermatologist treatment and my skin was tender..</li>
    <li> not like the original one I had  doesn&#x27;t do a thing</li>
    <li> If you scratch your face gently just after you&#x27;ve had a shower, white debris comes off. This is the debris that chemical exfoliators remove. This little gadget effectively removes this debris and it also reduces pore size. If you don&#x27;t fancy chucking acid at your face, this is the thing for you. You have to be careful to lift the device from your skin at an angle, or you&#x27;ll get love bites. Initially, there will be a few extra pimples as old muck gets sucked up to the surface. It exposes whiteheads. What it doesn&#x27;t do, or at least not at once, is remove blackheads. The only things I have ever found to get rid of blackheads are pore strips (70% removal), or scraping the affected areas with the fine loop end of a blackhead remover (100% effective, but tedious and uncomfortable). I haven&#x27;t tried a blackhead dissolver gel however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model had instructions in Japanese only, but the illustrations were sufficient to give the general idea, like don&#x27;t vacuum your eyeballs!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean pores, loosen blackhead or whitehead or anything. There are effective black heads removers out there but I hoped this would clear out pores without blackheads. NOPE.</li>
    <li> Its didnt work ! ! ! !  I was disappointed when i saw it you must see the broducts before you sell it :(</li>
    <li> I am returning this, it did not clean out my pores at all!!</li>
