      <li>Got them to use as safe beading needles.  </li>

      <li>It saves so much time and it works!</li>
      <li>Arrived promptly and makes flossing so much easier!  </li>
      <li>The long blue ones are ok, but they are not as easy to use and sometimes too flexible.</li>
      <li>The curved needle like guild is strong enough yet flexible.</li>
      <li>Absolutely met my need.</li>
      <li>thanks.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for those hard to reach bridges in the back of your mouth.</li>
      <li>Great for bridges that are difficult to floss.</li>
      <li>Hi: I&#x27;ve used bridge aid threaders for many years and always had trouble pushing threader through.  </li>
      <li>Even if you use these once a week, say Sunday nights, it is better than nothing and help get those hard to reach</li>
      <li>As an adult with braces, anything that makes my life easier I am on board with.</li>
      <li>Was so much thicker than other brands and really stands up well and makes threading easier than other flimsy ones</li>

<li> Since 50 last for only one and half months, I will need to reorder again soon.</li>
<li> These are easier to handle than other floss threaders and do not cut your gums like the bulkier styles.</li>
<li> Despite the odd feeling that I am sewing in my mouth, this has made flossing with braces slightly less of a dreaded nightly chore.</li>
<li> these little guys have are what I need.</li>
<li> At this price you can buy dozens for the price of one small pack of some of the heavily marketed brands.</li>
<li> I have very tight spaces to get into and the strength</li>
<li> was unable to re-order a larger quantity</li>
<li> This threader has a curve that prevents the end from bumping into and irritating gum tissue.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t remember where I read this tip to give them credit.)  </li>
<li> Flossing with braces or permanent retainers is the worst (flossing without them stinks too)</li>

    <li> I use these as a way to pull ribbon through punched holes in cardmaking.  (This was not my original idea.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t remember where I read this tip to give them credit.)  It saves so much time and it works!</li>
    <li> Was so much thicker than other brands and really stands up well and makes threading easier than other flimsy ones</li>
    <li> Product and sesrvice as described.  Glad to be able to get these through Amazon.</li>
    <li> was unable to re-order a larger quantity</li>
    <li> Oh you have braces? Oh you went to the dentist? Oh they told you you have to floss more and you&#x27;re not doing it right? Yea me too. The Bridge Aid Threaders come in to save the day. Flossing with braces or permanent retainers is the worst (flossing without them stinks too) but this makes it as easy as it can be. I don&#x27;t think I will ever floss every day because you know...ain&#x27;t nobody got time fo dat...but when I do, this does the trick. Even if you use these once a week, say Sunday nights, it is better than nothing and help get those hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus tip: floss with these for the couple days in a row before dentist appointments to REALLY impress your dentist and not feel their judging looks while they say &amp;#34;you really SHOULD floss more peasant&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>

    <li> thank you. I have very tight spaces to get into and the strength these little guys have are what I need. Thank you for the design!</li>
    <li> This threader has a curve that prevents the end from bumping into and irritating gum tissue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d prefer that these be sold in larger quantities.  Since 50 last for only one and half months, I will need to reorder again soon.</li>
