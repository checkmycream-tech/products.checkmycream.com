I am African American with thick hair that is colored I use this product as just the first step to health shinny straight hair with out use of a pressing comb just a flat iron.  I section my hair in about eight pieces and apply a nickel amount to each piece and it comes out very straight and bouncy. Dosnt weigh my hair down at all or leave a resadue. Will continue to make this my blow drying serum.</li>
