<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great while you&#x27;re in the shower and it lingers on the skin. I know I should, but I never put on lotion after I shower, so this is perfect for me. With this product, I&#x27;m not itchy and dry after showering.</li>
    <li> this is ok i love nivea products</li>
    <li> Great product. Really leaves the skin moisturized without the sticky feeling. Shower like normal, apply, rinse, dry off, get dressed, and go. That simple!</li>
    <li> works really great.  And, it leaves my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
    <li> I hate putting on lotion and this is awesome. Rinses off in the shower but my skin still feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I hate putting on lotion but desperately need to do it more often. I use moisturizing body wash but it still doesn&#x27;t do near as good a job as this lotion. I like that if you use a little too much it just rinses off anyway and you don&#x27;t need to wait for your lotion to dry or soak in after getting out of the shower and before putting on your clothes. It leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. It&#x27;s just great for me because I&#x27;m too lazy to put lotion on after my shower but in the shower it works great.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of moisturizing skin without being greasy or slippery.  There are lots of warnings about be careful not to slip in the shower but I have had no problem with that at all.  It has a pleasant and not cloying scent and it is a quick and easy way to take care of lotion application.  I found it much faster than after shower application.</li>
    <li> I hate using lotion but this is great I like it because it rinse off the grease and keep my skin vey soft and moist. I have since bought this product from Local grocery store several times. People with dry skin this is a solution.</li>
    <li> Nivea body in shower body lotion I love how it make your skin so soft and I like the smell too. I will buy more of it. I won&#x27;t go back to what I was using. so if you like soft skin like I do you will love it too.</li>
    <li> One less step in my morning routine when I live in a cold house and hate having to stay undressed a little while longer to lotion up. Really leaves you smooth and smells amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roommate says it leaves the tub sticky, so be cautious.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff As far as lotion goes and it really helps dry skin.  The bad part is if you have a tile shower.  The tile gets real slippery real fast and if you aren&#x27;t careful, you can have a pretty nasty fall in the shower.</li>
    <li> So after a few tries, I&#x27;m happy to say that I love this product. It easily leaves my feeling nice and soft and saves me a step in the day. It really is, rinse off, dress, and get on with your day.</li>
    <li> The feeling of lotion freaks me out. I can&#x27;t stand it. Hate it, hate it, hate it. Tried anything and everything out there. It either felt yucky or left me feeling really really hot .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIVEA in shower lotion is AMAZING! I am so excited that for the first time, I have found something that feels nice, works nice, and is just all around perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sea Mineral smell is divine! I hope they make some body wash in that scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU, NIVEA!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe someone hasn&#x27;t come out with something like this sooner! This stuff is great!  It has a really subtle smell, so it&#x27;s great for men and women.  It&#x27;s a good product. Just lotion on in the shower after using your bodywash and then rinse off!!  It is easy and it actually works.  DO NOT use it on the bottoms of your feet!  The in shower lotion is very slick when applied and you will surely slip and injure yourself by applying it to the soles of your feet.  You will have to lotion your feet post shower- other than that, good stuff!</li>
    <li> I am so lazy and always forget to put on lotion...this product helps a lot.  I just use it like a shower gel after showering...just another minute longer to keep smooth skin.  It&#x27;s a but expensive but hopefully they can offer bulk size for cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is the best!  If your skin is dry try this. My skin feels so hydrated after you towel off and long after, better than anything I have used besides bath oil.  In fact, to equate it to something, it gives you a similar feel to how you feel when coming out of a bath with bath oil.</li>
    <li> It really works and keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating. Good for dry skin. Probably wouldn&#x27;t use it very often but only as needed</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. So easy to apply while in the shower then rinse. Not greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves your skin moisturized after using but is not so thick that it feels greasy. After drying off your skin will feel soft and healthy but not heavy and greasy like when using traditional lotion. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not good to use to shave your legs with. Overall very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product to use at the health club so they clean the shower of the greasy film after I am done.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, a sure cure for dry skin. I love how easy it is to apply in the shower, and how good my skin feels afterward. I would recommend this to anyone, especially for those with very sensitive skin. What a time-saver!</li>
    <li> It makes the shower floor so slippery that I actually fell in the shower, ouch!  I don&#x27;t see how this saves any time either.  When I apply regular lotion, I don&#x27;t have to rinse it off or clean my shower, or go sliding across my shower floor.  After trying my free sample, my bruised body will never purchase this!</li>
    <li> This version of the in shower lotion is unique due to the fact it contains sea salts.  Sea salts are beneficial to your skin as it promotes health and healing properties. Sea Salts contain 21 minerals including magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium. These essential minerals naturally occur in our bodies but must be replenished, as they are lost throughout the day. These minerals are known to treat, detoxify, and cleanse our bodies. Magnesium: Promotes quick healing of skin tissue and provides the skin’s surface with anti-allergic elements. Also essential for cell metabolism.  Bromide: Soothes skin, relaxes body muscles, and calms nerves.  Potassium: Helps balance moisture in the skin and body, aiding in the reduction of water retention and in the nourishment of cells. Potassium also regulates the nervous system  Calcium: An essential mineral, strengthens cell membranes and cleanses pores. Sodium: Relieves stiffness and muscle cramps. Sodium is also a powerful detoxifying agent, helping cells retain nourishment. Zinc: When applied topically, it is known to protect the skin against sunburn and windburn.  The skin is largest organ in the human body and is also the most vulnerable. Continued exposure to the elements, chemicals and aging all take there toll on the skin. Therefore it is important to support and nurture the skin in order to restore health and enhance function.  This product is excellent for taking care of your skin.  My wife is in love with this lotion and swears by it.  It&#x27;s done wonders for her complexion, she has a natural glow.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes your skin feel sooooo soft. I use it everyday</li>
    <li> After using almost the whole bottle, I have not noticed any difference in how moist my skin is. I was really hoping it would help my legs, as I tend to have pretty dry legs, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference whatsoever. I can tell you what it did do, though - make the shower floor super slippery! (On the bottle, it does say to wash the floor with warm water after using the lotion, but even after doing that I found that the floor was still pretty slippery. Be careful!) Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> works as advertised but you have to rinse your shower after use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome, I have normal to dry skin and this just works for me. I bought is because I don&#x27;t have much time to apply lotions and other stuff in the morning so it&#x27;s a big time saver. It has a nice smell and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy but it does leave a tiny amount of slippery in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Skin feels wonderful all day</li>
    <li> I am so happy this product is finaly available in US.  I stocked up when I was in Europe this summer , because I am obsessed with this body lotion.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;It works&lt;br /&gt;My life is busy and let&#x27;s face it, I dont have time to put on body lotion every time I take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand when I have that extra 5 minutes I take super long hot shower and massage this body lotion all over and ENJOY the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the feminine , fresh and quite sexy smell it leaves on my skin&lt;br /&gt;Price is ridiculus : $5.99 , doesnt get any better than that!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had a problem with slipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am such a product junkie and I always have to try new things.  I am so glad I decided to give this Nivea in shower lotion a try. Amongs all of my Chanel, Creed and Tom Ford this one is on my favorite item list.  give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of days now.  I have normal skin so i cannot speak for those with dry skin.I purchased it because it seemed like a good idea. It is nice in that, it saves time. After you rinse off the lather from your shower gel/soap ,take enough of this lotion on your palm considering that its going to spread over your body like oil. Thanx to the previous reviewers, I avoided applying it on my sole. But here is the catch, when you are rinsing it off your body, dont use hot water as you would be tempted to do during these winters. When i washed it off with hot water, my skin got dry a couple of hours later. So, use lukewarm water to rinse this lotion off and you will emerge soft and moisturised from the shower. If you are going to remain covered for the rest of the day, You will not find the need to re apply any moisturiser even after 10 hrs except for hands. Overall, I like the product.Best for those who dont have the time to apply body oil/ lotion all over after taking a shower cause you are in such a hurry.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and undamaged.  I really love the convenience of putting it on while I&#x27;m in the shower!  I&#x27;m a mother of 3 with 2 under 3 so when i get out of the shower sometimes i don&#x27;t have time to put lotion on. It really moisturizes well and keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day. Just make sure to be careful as you put it on the shower becomes very slippery! I like the thickness of this lotion it really feels good on the skin,  sometimes i use it without being in the shower.  I recommend it especially if you have a busy schedule.</li>
    <li> it is ok I guess, does hydrate your whole body but you need to use a lot, then be careful to wash the whole tub because it can get slippery. I think a regular lotion would also have done the job.. I would not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love this in shower lotion. Since I am pretty lazy about using regular lotion after the shower, and also hate in the summer using regular body lotion, since it practically seems to sweat right of. This doesn&#x27;t! Since you rinse it off. And it leaves your skin very hydrated. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Whenever I put on lotion after a shower I would get sweaty, sticky, and I would feel somewhat uncomfortable for a while until the lotion was absorbed fully. I dealt with it, it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. However I found this little neat thing and I was surprised! Just do the same thing you would do after the shower but in the shower. After drying off with a towel don&#x27;t be afraid of wiping off the product It didn&#x27;t seem to really affect the product outcome. Just nice smooth and soft skin. No greasy, sticky, weird feeling at all. Overall amazing product! Definitely recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this because I thought I could be lazy about lotioning - just do a random slather and rinse it off. I love the very light floral/fruit scent. My skin isn&#x27;t very dry, so it worked well for me, and I was surprised how long it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But. The tub slipperiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw there was a warning on the bottle and thought I was heeding it. Nevertheless I took my first ever full-on shower tumble and hit my head on the faucet. I was very, very lucky not to be seriously injured. I can&#x27;t take a chance of that happening again and am throwing this out. For the record, I&#x27;m a healthy woman in her thirties with no balance problems. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Finally, something I can use instead of taking time to rub lotion all over my body!</li>
    <li> Great product, makes it easier to incorporate lotion into your daily routine. Personally I prefer the extra moisturizing but this one has a better smell. I wish they would make scented lotions like this.</li>
    <li> I really like the Nivea Body In-Shower body lotion. It makes my skin feel soft and I like the fact that I can moisturize while I&#x27;m still in the shower.</li>
