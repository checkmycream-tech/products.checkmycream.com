      <li>By week two my sister was asking me where she could buy this stuff :)</li>
      <li>Searching on amazon, I found a lot cheaper products with more ounces that seems to be a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You will be way better off using a whitening toothpaste or whitening gel.  </li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ll be purchasing and recommending to others indefinitely.</li>

      <li>Maybe a touch, but nothing notable...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>Love will recommend to friends.</li>
      <li>but my teeth are not terribly discolored to begin with.</li>
      <li>It works better over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It promotes healthy gums</li>
      <li>, so it may have more of an effect as I continue to use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used over half of this product and have yet to see any results!&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my dentist for regular whitening treatments because I have wasted my money!!!</li>
    <li> Used daily for over a month and didn&#x27;t notice any whitening at all. Plus it&#x27;s very messy, and overpriced. I can&#x27;t recommend this product. After giving up on Magic Mud I decided to get an [[ASIN:B009DNE268 Emmi-dent 6 100% Ultrasonic Toothbrush]] and within a couple of weeks my teeth were noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do wish to try this type of tooth powder, there are now other companies that sell similar products for much cheaper. Maybe activated charcoal will whiten your smile, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for mine.</li>
    <li> The Product was received promptly. It&#x27;s a little gritty and I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it really whitens my teeth. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not quite as effective as bleach but it doesn&#x27;t taste nor does it make your teeth sensitive. Great product!</li>
    <li> its not woth the money at all</li>
    <li> Diet and lifestyle affects your teeth too. So cut out that soda and chips and start smiling brighter!! :D I noticed results in a couple of days. The texture isnt so bad but you can literally hear the squeaky cleanliness after. I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Messy, but I love it!!  I put a pea sized amount of coconut oil on my toothbrush, dip my brush into the black powder, add a couple of droplets of water and brush my teeth.  You will have to clean out the sink after brushing, as it will leave a black residue in the sink, and use a different toothbrush other than your normal toothbrush.  I have gotten so many compliments on how white my teeth are, but the best part was when the girls at my dental office noticed and actually bought it too, after seeing my results....... While they have access to the whitening serum at the dentist, they said they didn&#x27;t like how sensitive the gel leaves their teeth, so they wanted to try this.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is the first whitener that I have ever used that showed immediate results!  I haven&#x27;t whitened my teeth in a couple of years, and it was long overdue.  This took off two years of yellowing in two minutes.  I&#x27;m assuming it may take a couple of rounds to get them this white if you smoke and drink coffee, but my husband that does both will be testing it next and I will post the results then.  Wonderful and safe product!!  Will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Reduce from 5 stars to 3 after using 1/3 to 1/2 of a jar during a 5 month period:  I believe this product diminished stains and lightened my tooth color. However, the powder molded, so I had to throw away at least half the jar.    Go ahead. Try it. What have you got to lose? Here are five Magic Mud tips as you get going: 1)  Take selfies. See before &amp; after for yourself. 2)  Give it time. Don&#x27;t expect pearly whites over night. Keep using. 3)  Brush your front teeth, which people see. 4)  Waterpik afterwards to get stubborn grit gone from between teeth. 5)  Wet wipes take care of any minor messes. One last note: Magic Mud is tasteless. Orange and mint are in the ingredient list, but, as advertised, they don’t contribute flavor.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My teeth feel healthier and cleaner</li>
    <li> This product definitely makes your teeth feel clean and polished. I don&#x27;t use it every night because it can be a little messy, but have noticed an amazing difference!</li>
    <li> This came on today. I used it immediately. Now I am hoping long term use with help prevent decay and cavities cause I&#x27;ve been. Styling with my teeth for years. But I do know after first use my teeth are prolly 5 shades whiter. Immediately. I&#x27;m a believer already!</li>
    <li> This stuff works so great!  I notice a difference even when I just use it once in a while.  Really leaves teeth feeling clean, too.  For the people that say how messy it is, well, yeah, it&#x27;s messy.  It&#x27;s powder.  All you have to do is be careful when you open it.  Duh!  I like to scare my kids with my black teeth while using it haha!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband since he smokes cigars.  He&#x27;s been using it now for weeks everyday. very little has changed with the whitening of his teeth but on the up side he has cut his cigar smoking down to 2-3 per week!</li>
    <li> Well, I used it for a couple months because a family member told me it helps with sensitive teeth. I used it religiously for a couple months but didn&#x27;t really notice the benefit. Now if you want something to brush your teeth with that is all natural then this is the thing for you. There is no flavor to it, you don&#x27;t need very much per use either. It is a little messy but nothing a little wiping with water won&#x27;t wash away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s messy, but it really works!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. Yes, it can make a bit of a mess until you get the hang of it and then not so bad. It is the only toothpaste/toothpowder I have found that removes the plaque along the gumline of my teeth and it does that without hard scrubbing. Pure and simple.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Didn&#x27;t see huge results, but I think it did help some.  Messy though...SO SO black!  :/</li>
    <li> Love it .... you notice a difference with first use.  Take a before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t believe that this makes true magic when it comes to whitening teeth.  I could tell a difference and I don&#x27;t smoke nor drink coffee but wow what a difference on my husband.  He used it three or four nights in a row brushing two minutes, per instructions, and it is amazing stuff.  I highly recommend following the directions to the T, because I was so excited I opened it and made a mess, but if you&#x27;re careful and use the dark towel by the sink as recommended you&#x27;ll be fine.  Even when it splatter everywhere, as I said I didn&#x27;t read the directions to spit out as close to drain as possible, because it is natural it was a breeze to clean up with a wet cloth.  Make sure you floss after use because I cleaned my gums and black residue was still in gums even after brushing so just FYI.  I can honestly say conservatively speaking, this little jar will last me and my husband using once a week for at least a year, you don&#x27;t need a lot.  Comparing the price of whitening treatments and how painful they&#x27;re (if sensitive teeth) this is a no brainer, I didnt feel any difference on my teeth, sensitivity wise, at all.  Love will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Like brushing your teeth with black, Rit dye powder. Unless the benefits included eternal life, this product isn&#x27;t worth its weight.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Quick shipment. Great experience!!!! :D</li>
    <li> This product is unbelievable.  It has done more in three applications than two trips to the Dentist for professional whitening</li>
    <li> Kinda messy, but tastes good, and noticed a difference in teeth in 3 days!!</li>
    <li> i tried this mud and its amazing.  It does whiten your teeth.  The downside is its messy.  label warns consumer to keep a twel or cloth near by when using.</li>
    <li> It really works but it does get everywhere when using it so you have to be careful.</li>
    <li> We heard about this on the Alex Jones show and decided to buy it. It&#x27;s totally worth the money. I noticed a difference after the second day. After a week of use, my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been before.  Yes, it is messy, but I find if you brush your teeth in the shower, it helps with the splatter. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this for teeth whitening purposes, but I can say it does indeed do the job.  I have had several compliments from people on how white my teeth look.  It is a little messy and weird to brush your teeth with a black powder, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal.  I normally use it at night before bed.  I would recommend a separate toothbrush just for this powder.  Rinse well after using and then floss and brush again with regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Wrote a review already on this..not too sure how or why it disappeared...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this about 4 times so far and see a slight difference, but I dont feel that it lasts. I will keep continuing to use it and update my review if I see more of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very expensive for the amount you get though. Searching on amazon, I found a lot cheaper products with more ounces that seems to be a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping of product was prompt.</li>
    <li> The Mud works as advertised. That&#x27;s the best thing about it. The worst is its a little messy. Stay close to the sink or use it while in the shower. It will whiten your teeth with regular ( once a day) use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Use it once and you will be &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34;! What is SO great about My Magic Mud is that it&#x27;s so quick, like brushing your teeth, you don&#x27;t have to be inconvenienced for hours or even 20 minutes like other whiteners require! And, after you use it you immediately SEE AND FEEL a difference! Definitely worth the BARGAIN price!!!</li>
    <li> Before trying it, I thought &amp;#34;man, this is some kinda hippie junk. If it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals in it you can&#x27;t pronounce, it can&#x27;t be any good.&amp;#34; Then I put some of this black magic powder on my toothbrush and set to work. I was scrubbing it all around. It didn&#x27;t taste bad at all--it was mostly tasteless, actually. Once I had rinsed, to my surprise, my mouth felt cleaner than it had ever felt before. It was like I had just been to the dentist for a cleaning. For that alone, I&#x27;d use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THEN I noticed after repeated uses, my teeth started to look whiter. &amp;#34;Wow,&amp;#34; I thought. &amp;#34;This stuff really works.&amp;#34; With my skepticism to bed, I realized I needed to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t have an electric toothbrush -- which makes cleanup a little trickier -- I&#x27;d give this five stars. If you don&#x27;t mind wiping up gray residue, this is an excellent product, proof that sometimes time-tested ways stick around for a reason. Charcoal is definitely a great way to keep your mouth clean and your smile bright.</li>
    <li> Very messy to use. The black powder gets everywhere and doesn&#x27;t clean up easily. Did not whiten my teeth at all.</li>
    <li> I have brushed with this 7 times now since receiving this last week. I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working. Very messy, but I knew that before I purchased. I was using twice a day then switched to once at night. Still waiting for the white. This does leave a clean fealling once you have flossed the black out, and brushed with my sonicare afterwards.</li>
    <li> did not work well. I tried it on my face it worked ok but too messy</li>
    <li> I love Magic Mud! It is the only way I can get my children to brush, seriously! They love the black mouth. If I say &amp;#34;time to brush teeth&amp;#34; my almoat 3 year old will say, &amp;#34;no way, just magic mud&amp;#34; LOL for me, personally, it has helped me fight ongoing coffee stains and in 8 months completely got rid of the sensitivity my bottom teeth had from bleaching them so much in highschool. I no longer need a straw to drink ice water. I also have a cracked tooth that becomes HIGHLY sensitive if I do something like eat ice cream. I brush with mud, packing extra onto that tooth, and the pain is gone as soon as I spit. Yes, with kids it gets messy, I have learned to simply wipe the sink with a towel. I had a real hard mess when I was oil pulling daily and the oil would  stick to the sink and the mud, then I read to spit the oil in the toilet and the problem subsided! I suggest this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> As advertised, remarkable product, that I am using twice a day, with great results, and it is from a &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; business.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT, I AM IN LOVE WITH MY TEETH, I USE THIS POWDER IN ADDITION TO THE CHARCOAL TOOTHPASTE EVERY MORNING AND I BRUSH MY TEETH AT LEAST TWICE A DAY.  THIS PRODUCT IS JUST WONDERFUL AND IT BEATS USING SOMETHING THAT MAYNOT BE WISE FOR ME SUCH AS TEETH WHITENING WHICH WEAKENS THE ENAMEL OF YOUR TEETH, THIS MAGIC MUD IS SOOO MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> This is the best oral care product on the market! I have very sensitive teeth and gums and have tried multiple other teeth whiteners but have never had such quick results! And not to mention my gums are not as red and sensitive anymore! I&#x27;m in love! I recommend My Magic Mud to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Just bought this at a farmers market - great product!  Used for 2 days and my teeth are noticeably whiter..gums are a little sore but probably being over zealous on the brushing. Definitely recommend this product. My 11 yr old son is also seeing amazing results!!</li>
    <li> I love it I really can&#x27;t believe it worked I&#x27;m so happy with my results</li>
    <li> Ok... this tasteless, scentless *black* powder looks intimidating.  But don&#x27;t let the looks fool you... it works.  And I mean works well.  It has helped lessen my sensitivity and leaves my teeth feeling like right after a trip to the dental hygiene chair for a cleaning.  Yes, you will see black when brushing.. and yes... there really is no taste or smell to it (even though it says &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34;)... but the results are absolutely amazing.  NO GMO, NO poisonous fluoride... just a couple of safe ingredients.  The way mother nature intended.  Why support giant corporations and chemical companies when there is someone out there doing it right without all of the things we don&#x27;t need in our bodies?  Try this product.  I believe you will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> My girl has disturbing teeth problems (rotting and decay and yellowing from smoking), but somehow this stuff helped stopped all of it. Much appreciation to the Magic Mud crew.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have used it once a day for about two months now and my teeth have NEVER EVER looked whiter. Not only that, but they just feel stronger and healthier. I also have really sensitive gums and this stuff does not hurt or irritate them in any way unlike other teeth whiteners. Also, I have only used maybe 1/3 of the container...and that&#x27;s everyday use for 2 months! This stuff is amazing. Highly highly highly recommend! :)</li>
    <li> A little intiminating by the black powder, and it can be al little messy. My teeth are sooooooo much whiter and cleaner its like coming home from the dentist everyday :)</li>
    <li> As a regular coffee drinker and smoker, as well as due to some medicine I had to take following a car accident that DRASTICALLY made my teeth yellow, I honestly thought there was NOTHING that was going to even cut back on the yellowing....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife brought this little canister home, and I&#x27;m thinking, good for her, but I&#x27;m just &amp;#34;S.O.L.&amp;#34; with my coffee/nicotine desires.  She had me go ahead and try it anywa, and I&amp;#34;m so glad I did and thrilled that this product proved me wrong.  The after effects of the medicine may never allow my teeth to go perfectly white, but this stuff does work miracles in terms of the improvement of what I do see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product ,and would definitely recommend it for even the heaviest coffee drinker and smoker!</li>
    <li> First time delivered immediate results with a whiter and brighter smile and my gums seemed healthier too</li>
    <li> This polishes up my teeth very well. I feel like I just got back from the Dentist after each application. I do not use it every day because it is black charcoal and it can get messy, but it works very well when I use it. I use it once a week to polish up my teeth. I will recommend it to anyone who wants to whiten their teeth with immediate results. A regular toothbrush works fine.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  Being unwilling to use the concoctions available on the mainstream market, I was happy to give this all-natural and healthy option a try. Glad I did!  It&#x27;s very simple to use, alot of fun and very effective!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> The product works as expected, and it worked really well in polishing my teeth. The problem is it took a small part of 2 of my crowns off. If you don&#x27;t have lots of fillings or crowns then this product will work great for you. I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because I didn&#x27;t see any warning saying it could polish parts of my crowns off.</li>
    <li> You can see and feel the difference on your teeth!</li>
    <li> A different texture to get used to but it works well for me and my wife. I have recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> MAGIC MUD IS AMAZING! I will never go back to whitening strips or any other teeth whitening system :)</li>
    <li> PURCHASED IN LOCAL HEALTH FOOD STORE (not on amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for about a week. Tasteless, odorless and no ill effects so far. Teeth felt polished after 1st use, really smooth like i&#x27;d had a cleaning by hygienist. Not noticeably whiter but my teeth are not terribly discolored to begin with. I brush at night, keep my mouth fairly closed around the toothbrush and spit low into the sink with water running. After the first time I quickly learned how not to get black specks everywhere! I floss afterwards to ensure none of the bits are stuck in teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I still brush my teeth in the morning with a fluoride free toothpaste (periobrite) and brush my tongue with close-up cinnamon toothpaste because I like the taste. I also do oil pulling with coconut oil occasionally. I was tempted to rate it lower due to the price as there are other activated charcoal toothpowders on amazon for half the price, but I haven&#x27;t tried them to compare how many ounces, how long it lasts etc.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it claims. Whiter teeth, healthier mouth, and NO PAIN or sensitivity. This is the real deal!  I just ordered my second batch and will continue to use this product. I have seen my teeth get whiter and stay whiter!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews here are complaining about the price tag. Well how expensive are the alternatives? 100.00? 50.00? And your teeth are in pain for days! Those other whiteners have costs beyond money...like toxic bleach in your mouth and painful days where you can&#x27;t even eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you factor in that this is a natural option, with great results...It&#x27;s a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> It turned my gums black and of course my teeth looked whiter.  Awful stuff.  Turned my toothbrush black and I had to throw it out.  Made a mess of the sink.  I couldn&#x27;t throw it out fast enough..  What was I thinking?!!  I went back to my homemade toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Interesting stuff. It works great.</li>
    <li> This is subtle, so far, but it works. I&#x27;ve also only had it for 2 weeks, and I drink lots of tea each day (which is why I need it!), so it may have more of an effect as I continue to use it. But it definitely brightens your teeth and is obviously gentler than the harsh bleaching products I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, though, so not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again once I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
    <li> There are several reasons I prefer this over other teeth whitening products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No toxic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;2. Much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;3. It promotes healthy gums&lt;br /&gt;4. It works better over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other teeth whitening products. Usually they burned my gums and I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. There is only one slight downside - it&#x27;s a little bit messy. I have developed a routine for dealing with this. I brush my teeth with sonic toothbrush and the mud right before my shower. Jump in the shower and right before I get out, I rinse my mouth in the shower. When I get out, I brush again and rinse until clear. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> In the future I will use activated charcoal, which I can purchase in bulk, to make my own tooth powder. There is nothing special about this product except that it is overpriced for the size and nothing but a powder that must be made into a paste by the person.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Noticeable improved whiteness after the first use!  I love the clean senstation afterwards.  I do not make a paste out of it.  I just dip my dry brush in and then run the bristles under a slow stream (so that the black powder does not fly everywhere).  Removes surface stains very successfully!</li>
    <li> i HAVE HAD SENSITIVITY ISSUES AND HAVE SOME MINOR DECAY ON A COUPLE OF TEETH...HEADING TO THE DENTIST SOON!...HOWEVER, SINCE USING MY MAGIC MUD, I HAVE ZERO SENSITIVITY AND MY TEETH ARE SUPER SPARKLY WHITE!!!  OUR WHOLE FAMILY IS AMAZED AND PLEASED!  AS A MATTER OF FACT, OUR SON&#x27;S FRIENDS LOVE IT TOO!  WHEN THEY COME OVER FOR SLUMBER PARTIES, THEY &amp;#34;GET&amp;#34; TO USE &amp;#34;THE MUD&amp;#34; :)  ONE OF THEM HAS EVEN PURCHASED HIS OWN JAR WITH HIS OWN MONEY!!!...HE&#x27;S ONLY 12!  SMART BOY!!! :)  WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY IT...THE MESS IS FUN AND THE BLACK TEETH, WHILE YOU&#x27;RE BRUSHING WITH IT, IS FUN TOO!  :)  NOT ONLY IS IT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, IT&#x27;S FUN!!!!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend and thought I would give it a try. I like the fact that it was created by a mom trying to solve a problem and created a wonderful natural product that is even safe for kids to use. My husband has damaged teeth from an auto incident which has caused sever discoloration and thickening on his teeth. He told me that after years of trying several different OTC tooth whitening products, this is the ONLY PRODUCT THAT WORKS for him. He has noticed the difference and so have I. In conversations as to whether or not to purchase again, he was all for it due to how well it had worked for him and I am all for it due to how it makes my teeth feel and how fun it is to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice so far, but I will update as I use it more**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I was really excited to get this in the mail. I even took &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; pictures because I wanted to watch the progression to mega white teeth. Also, I love trying any remedy that is weird and natural, garlic for a cold, or vinegar for my mirrors, etc. so I was p\ump\ed o finally find a fluoride-free and bleach-free whitener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, while this is fun to use (isn&#x27;t messy if you follow directions), I really haven&#x27;t seen any whitening results. YET. I used it twice, with 3 days rest in between. Maybe a touch, but nothing notable... like 10-12% whiter. My teeth FEEL great, probably because this is essentially a super fine powder polish, but the whitening really hasn&#x27;t shown up yet. I have only used it for the recommended brush-time. Make sure to floss after. I will post updates as I use it more.</li>
    <li> This is just something I wanted to try out for whiter teeth, since mine are too sensitive for the chemical whiteners on the market or even a good dental whitening. After the first couple days use my teeth were shinier &amp; slightly not as stained. I&#x27;m not expecting dramatic results over night.&lt;br /&gt;One big issues I had with my gum was an abscess that was hard getting rid of with antibiotics (8 days, 1500 mg a day) but after 3 days of packing this on the gum where the abscess was it cleared up (after the antibiotics ran out &amp; the pain was still there). I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to clear out the rest of a gum infection, but it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the others uses I have found for this are as a facial wash (quarter size amount of castor oil &amp; a tsp of charcoal make a good facial), for insect stings (gets rid of the itching), cuts, the list goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price was expensive at first, but compared to some of the other brands this one has less ingredients, also a better quality of them. I&#x27;m not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this as a toothpaste is very messy &amp; I still have not mastered how not to get it all over the sink or myself when brushing, but that&#x27;s ok. It does clean up easy. There is no taste or smell, just a gritty feeling to the charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect miracles over night though, because as with all natural products they lack the chemicals that provide extreme results in a short amount of time. Natural products take time to work with repeated uses.taste to this stuff. It looks ominous, but has zero smell or taste to it, even though it contains mint.</li>
    <li> Free Talk Live Radio was right. This is amazing. The dental trips were about five minutes.</li>
    <li> This is THE absolute worst product I have ever used!  Not only did I not see any results whatsoever, the use of this item is extremely messy.  You will be way better off using a whitening toothpaste or whitening gel.  I find the reviews unbelievable.  This product is a joke.</li>
    <li> Once I got over the shock of having BLACK teeth while I was brushing, I LOVED THIS STUFF.  Hahahaha...  I was panicked for a moment there but once I swished the blackness out of my mouth, all was good.  I noticed whiter teeth within 2 days!  I went a step further and added pelu powder and my teeth got even whiter!  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about my Mud.  Will definitely buy more when this jar is gone!</li>
    <li> It made my teeth very sensitive after only a few uses. As soon as I stopped using it, the sensitivity went away. I had high hopes for it, as it was a natural product and I wanted to stay away from bleaches, but the sensitivity wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Just didnt do much for me.</li>
    <li> No whitening and developed sores in my mouth</li>
    <li> Seems ok.  Understand why you should use at night.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff.  After one use, there was an immediate improvement.  It wasn&#x27;t CRAZY or SUPER white but it felt amazing and my teeth were whiter, especially my K9s (or as my wife says, my fangs). It does make a HUGE mess so hold your breath when you bring the toothbrush up to your mouth.  I also recommend placing a paper towel or kleenex under the container to help prevent a mess. I use it about once a week and I should probably use it more.  I drink a lot of dark things (coffee, soda, and so on) and more regular use would have a big impact.  For a few days after I got it I was using it once a day and the results were really dramatic.  You&#x27;ll love this but you have to be careful of the mess.  It won&#x27;t stain anything but it can be a huge pain to clean up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true what the negative reviewers say: that this product can be messy..but after a couple of month&#x27;s use I can say if you just keep your mouth over the sink when you brush with it and it&#x27;s not a problem - the black stuff stays in the sink and you just rinse it down the drain. It&#x27;s not like it stains or anything. Otherwise, I love the way it makes my teeth feel and it has brightened them. I am loath to use the otc chemical whiteners and this stuff is all natural and non-toxic, so count me in. I use it once a day in addition to my daily oral regimen and I will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This Stuff is truly magic!!!! I&#x27;ve only used twice but already see a difference in my teeth. They&#x27;re brighter and more white. And the best thing its totally natural!!!! Awesome!!</li>
    <li> Sorry. Turned my toothbrush and sink black and I spent too much time cleaning both. Can&#x27;t say if it works or not.</li>
    <li> It is ok but really messy.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! I am a regular coffee, tea, and wine drinker, and my teeth showed it. One use, yes *ONE*, was enough to noticeably whiten my teeth. It seemed a little expensive when I ordered it, but after seeing how little is needed, one little tub should last a long time. The taste isn&#x27;t terrible. My only caution: it&#x27;s messy.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. It did not bright my teeth as expected, but I guess it is because it is not abrasive as regular brightening products. It scrubs my teeth lightly and reach some gum parts that the toothbrush cannot. It has not taste which is good. It leaves the mouth fresh and teeth cleaner than if you used only toothpaste and toothbrush.</li>
    <li> excellent product, worked as well as cited.</li>
    <li> I am always very happy to find products that are pure, natural and do what they say they are going to do. Magic Mud is so unique and works so well, I feel like I&#x27;ve discovered an evolution of what products can be. Yes, it is different from everything out there. Thank goodness it is. I personally think more companies ought to take a look at the approach to product construction that Magic Mud has. Don&#x27;t expect empty promises from them. Expect white teeth and healthy gums. I have perfected the scoop technique. I just wet my mouth a bit, scoop just a dab of magic mud up with my sonic care toothbrush-over the sink, put it right onto my teeth(close my lips) and wala. Clean teeth-gums that feel good. Anything I drop rinses away in the sink when I rinse my mouth. Sometime I follow up by wiping the sink with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend hours of my life researching the products that go in my body. I have found nothing better for my teeth and gums. I feel safe with their ingredients and can save a little bit of that time now. I recommend you do something different and use magic mud.</li>
    <li> If you read all the instructions, read them again because this product is really tricky to use.  That said, it&#x27;s amazing.  I had (notice the past tense!) I had a minor problem with my gums after some deep scaling (cleaning);  sometimes the gums just don&#x27;t want to tighten back up and seal the edges from all that nasty bacteria usually found in the human mouth.  Well, I&#x27;ve been lightly brushing around the gums with Magic Mud and in 2 days, voila&#x27;, my gums were pink and healthy again.  Instructions:  1)  have a separate tooth brush for the mud, it will look dingy;  2)  get the toothbrush wet first 3)  rinse out your mouth with water first 4)  close your mouth when you brush - this is the most important instruction....the mud will splatter everywhere and smear all over the lips if you forget  5)  spit into a cup rather than the bowl, there&#x27;s just no keep it from splattering all over the sink, so spit into a cup, it&#x27;s just easier and flush down the sink with a lot of water  when done.  That&#x27;s it - here&#x27;s &amp;#34;Magic Mud in your Mouth to keep gums and teeth bright and healthy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Kinda makes a mess if you&#x27;re not careful with it.  Really works.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before bed per printed instructions. Saw a difference in just one week. By week two my sister was asking me where she could buy this stuff :) My teeth look &amp; FEEL amazing!! White &amp; bright. Easy to use and cleans right up off of bathroom surfaces with just one swipe of a baby wipe.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works like it says.  It&#x27;s just the thing I&#x27;d been looking for, a natural tooth whitening product that even a very picky hippie can trust!  It is causing my gum infection to go away.  Makes my mouth feel sooooo clean, and for so long.  I can taste the bacteria count is lessening even hours after I brush, it feels cleaner and cleaner day by day.  Visually, my teeth and gums have never looked so bright and healthy.  Even cleaner then a dentist, and with no pain, scraping or harmful chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth every penny and I would buy it for more because it will potentially save me LOTS of money on the dentist, preventing gum disease and keeping the enamel intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Family that owns this business are very conscious people I know, and the product shows this.  They give to good causes, and are addressing and educating people about oral hygiene, which is overlooked in our society.  I&#x27;m very proud to know they are making such a difference in the mouths of so many.  I will be buying lots more for friends and family.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about My Magic Mud after trying it herself. Her teeth looked whiter after just a few uses.  She had the original but I wanted the mint.  I love the product but think it could use a little more mint flavor for freshness.  I love how it makes my teeth feel and look!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really awful.  No matter how careful I am, it ends up all over the counter and my face. I&#x27;m not sure if a better container would make a difference, but this packaging is terrible. In the process of getting it on to your toothbrush the dry dusty powder settles all over the counter and sink, then when it&#x27;s wet it turns into black mud. There is just no way to brush your teeth without spraying and splattering and making a mess.  Plus, I have been ending up with small black granules jammed up underneath my gums that are annoying, ugly, and difficult to remove without tearing up my gums.  Rinsing doesn&#x27;t help, I use a special ultra soft brush with this stuff but have to jam the bristles up under my gums to get it out.  Big mistake trying to use my sonicare with this also.  The residue doesn&#x27;t go away with just a rinse either, you have to completely clean the bathroom sink and vanity every time you use it unless you don&#x27;t mind leaving black mud behind.  If it left me with a sparkling white smile I might be willing to put up with it, but I noticed no real improvement or stain removal.  What a waste, wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It makes my teeth feel so polished and clean, even better than a trip to the dentist. Noticeable whitening results within 2 weeks and my gums feel better, too. The cleanup is not a big deal at all--just a few rinses and maybe an additional brushing, everything washes away just fine. I especially like the fact that this product is all natural and made with love. :) I&#x27;ll be purchasing and recommending to others indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Have noticed a difference. Excited to see how big of an improvement this will end up having.</li>
    <li> WOW!  Buy this now.  And while you&#x27;re at it buy a few more for the people you love.  This maybe the single most impressive product I have ever bought.  I have been chewing tobacco and drinking 2 pots of coffee for 20 years, and this immediately whitened my teeth to almost perfect color.  You dont get any fake looking white, you get natural teeth looking white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you having trouble with the &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; give me a break.  Even if you get a little on the counter, it will clean it better than you would have anyways.  Just put a napkin under the jar.  Tap the top, and sides of rim a few times with your toothbrush and slowly unscrew the cover.  It&#x27;s really not a big deal.  When you are spitting during brushing make sure you get your head fairly low (to avoid splash).  And remeber even if you do splash a bit it&#x27;s no big deal the clay will actually help clean your sink anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is simply amazing.  Please support this product and keep them in buisness.</li>
    <li> This really works ; glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> After a week of using the mud 2 of my friends &amp; my dentist ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Any more questions?</li>
    <li> Ordered this product after hearing about it from a friend on facebook. I would say that it was worked quite well for cleaning my teeth and making them a bit whiter. I would warn that this product does get quite messy around your sink! I did notice some additional sensitivity as well after using this product.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel SUPER clean, but aren&#x27;t whiter. This is after 4 months of use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really messy, but so effective. After only a few uses I saw a major difference in my teeth. I&#x27;ve had problems with the chemicals in whitening toothpastes and my dentist advised me to not use them as they were damaging my enamel. But I&#x27;ve had no problem with this stuff. My teeth are whiter and feel so clean. This product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
</ol>
