      <li>They work great on my tough, old nails - better than anything else I tried..</li>

      <li>As such (they are different than advertised) I will not be able to use them for the purpose intended.</li>
      <li>I had an ingrown toenail removed when I was in junior high school.</li>
      <li>Strong and sharp.</li>
      <li>Tip not quite as sharp in clipping fine hangnails.</li>
      <li>So far, they work well.</li>
      <li>These work as expected and the price made it worth purchasing sight-unseen.</li>
      <li>Strudy pair of clippers but not sharp at all.  </li>
      <li>This was a higher quality then I expected!</li>
      <li>It is to big, not very sharp .</li>

<li> It is to big, not very sharp .</li>
<li> Although you probably know this, if you have thick nails, soak them first to soften them up.</li>
<li> Made very heavy duty, liked it but, didn&#x27;t work as well as expected on thick hard to cut toe nails</li>
<li> Works as expected, seems sturdy &amp; well made.</li>
<li> The angle is unique, unlike clippers, you have a wider range of cutting flexibility.</li>
<li> the only bad thing about this item is the spring in the middle will fall out if spread to far apart</li>
<li> Should return it but not worth it</li>
<li> In a case like that, where the product cuts very close to the skin, it can be dangerous to use.</li>
<li> For the price I can&#x27;t be bothered, but don&#x27;t waste your money or time on these.  </li>
<li> Wasted my money.</li>
<li> Part of the trouble is that I don&#x27;t have a lot of strength in my hands.</li>
<li> The cutiing angle is different (&amp; useless) than that pictured/advertised.  </li>
<li> A small portion of it</li>
<li> But the product is not perfect in two key ways.</li>
<li> The clippers were stiff and difficult to use and were dull - I will be returning them.</li>
<li> They do not cut anything, I tried to get a refund and they wanted me to send this worthless piece of crap back first.  </li>
<li> Not good.  </li>
<li> Gets those tough nails clipped</li>
<li> This product, a pair of toe and nail scissors is poorly manufactured.</li>
<li> I found this very difficult to use.  </li>
<li> Too bad</li>
<li> Horrible, absolutely worthless piece of junk.  </li>

    <li> Works well. Tip not quite as sharp in clipping fine hangnails. Ok for regular nails.</li>
    <li> great value ,arrived very fast</li>
    <li> Excellent quality - like german made - for very fair price</li>
    <li> Strong and sharp. Curved tip is very helpful</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK AS EXPECTD</li>
    <li> Very easy to handle. Cuts very well. I have had to grease it so it is easier to open and close</li>
    <li> This was a higher quality then I expected!</li>
    <li> Made of stainless steel, it&#x27;s just about as sturdy as any pair of pliers. The angle is unique, unlike clippers, you have a wider range of cutting flexibility. I like these clippers.</li>
    <li> iT&#x27;S NOT SO GOOD FOR LARGE THICK NAILS. USE IT ON FINGER NAILS TOENAILS TAKE A LOT OF PRESSURE TO CUT</li>
    <li> Good for someone else doing your toenails.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Wasted my money. Clippers chew the nail, not cut. Wanted to return, but postage would be the same money. Do not buy this product</li>
    <li> They work great on my tough, old nails - better than anything else I tried..</li>
    <li> Gets those tough nails clipped</li>
    <li> Not good.  Too dificult to use on infested toes and I cut my skin.  Should return it but not worth it</li>
    <li> At $5.00 these are a great deal thus I am giving them 5 stars. But the product is not perfect in two key ways. You need to squeeze the handle quite a bit to close the latch and the springs seem to get missaligned. But for the price, buy a pair!</li>
    <li> Nice quality product at a great value! Works as expected, seems sturdy &amp; well made.</li>
    <li> I love this. Does the job very well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These Toenail Clippers work fantastic! They are exactly what I was looking for and will in deed be very useful for a long time, Thanks.</li>
    <li> It does not work.  It will not clip nails because the two edge do not align.  They also do not close, perhaps for the same reason.</li>
    <li> Perfect! the only bad thing about this item is the spring in the middle will fall out if spread to far apart</li>
    <li> Item was shipped and received promptly.Item was more than i expected.I love the  value i got.</li>
    <li> Work great , tool fit in my hands well and easy to use , Good product for the need. Good price</li>
    <li> Thank you for the product. Met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Very good, inexpensive, and does the job.</li>
    <li> These clippers were purchased to replace a &#x27;professional&#x27; pair I had received more than 30 years ago.

    <li> It is to big, not very sharp .</li>
    <li> IT WORKED GREAT, JUST NEED THE  PLYERS TO MAKE IT CLICK TOGETHER</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying nippers I could use for my nails not my horse.</li>
    <li> Part of the trouble is that I don&#x27;t have a lot of strength in my hands. I found this very difficult to use.  It didn&#x27;t seem to cut very well and once locked there were no directions as to how to unlock it.  It took me forever to get it unlocked the first time.  It might work perfectly for most folks, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I gave it to the Goodwill.  I&#x27;m sure someone will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Great strong product!</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. The safety catch is difficult to release, but the clippers work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping just what I ordered</li>
    <li> This product, a pair of toe and nail scissors is poorly manufactured. It sticks and its movement is not reliable. In a case like that, where the product cuts very close to the skin, it can be dangerous to use. It also is not properly aligned for locking smoothly. Altogether this cannot possibly meet Amazon standards. I have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> The cutiing angle is different (&amp; useless) than that pictured/advertised.  As such (they are different than advertised) I will not be able to use them for the purpose intended.</li>
    <li> The clippers were stiff and difficult to use and were dull - I will be returning them.</li>
    <li> Made very heavy duty, liked it but, didn&#x27;t work as well as expected on thick hard to cut toe nails</li>
    <li> I had an ingrown toenail removed when I was in junior high school. A small portion of it still Groselle and these are the only clippers that I can find to Trema</li>
    <li> Strudy pair of clippers but not sharp at all.  Will have to check into getting them sharpened somewhere.  Too bad</li>
    <li> on time delivery. works</li>
    <li> These work as expected and the price made it worth purchasing sight-unseen.</li>
    <li> This works better than a pair of pliers.</li>
    <li> Horrible, absolutely worthless piece of junk.  They do not cut anything, I tried to get a refund and they wanted me to send this worthless piece of crap back first.  For the price I can&#x27;t be bothered, but don&#x27;t waste your money or time on these.  They would pull your nail out by the root before they would actually cut anything.</li>
    <li> Good quality, have not tried them, yet.</li>
