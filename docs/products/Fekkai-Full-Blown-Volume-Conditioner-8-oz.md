      <li>I love this stuff and will continue to buy.  </li>

      <li>Because of that I found my styling products work better when I use this conditioner.</li>
      <li>that and a bag of chips” for me, yet it still proved to be quite an enjoyable experience to use.hink of to say about this product.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also better ones.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use this conditioner with the matching shampoo.  </li>
      <li>that and a bag of chips” for me, yet it still proved to be quite an enjoyable experience to use.</li>
      <li>so both he and I are satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love how shiny and manageable</li>
      <li>After just 7 days of use my hair is beautiful and soft and yet manageable.  </li>
      <li>When used with the full blown shampoo, my hair had a really nice volume and shine to it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very dry and damaged, but when I use this conditioner, it looks great!  </li>
      <li>I have very full hair</li>
      <li>I think most men would be comfortable using a conditioner with this scent.</li>
      <li>This is my first Fekkai product and I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Because this is not as moisturizing as other Fekkai conditioners, if you have oilier hair, I’m thinking it could be just perfect for you.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything volume wise, but the smell is great without being too heavy.</li>
      <li>To keep the volume up and the hair flowy in the summer is not an easy task.</li>
      <li>it has a pleasant citrus scent and leaves my hair very soft and manageable with no tangles.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>The smell is really nice, first off.</li>
      <li>The Full Blown Volume conditioner is astonishing.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t do a very good job of smoothing and hydrating my dry ends.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a fine conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair feels great and it is also not dry after using my hairdryer.</li>
      <li>it really was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Buy like I said I have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>5 star fabulous and</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s a creamy conditioner it is rather light.  </li>
      <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and really enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>I received this product free from the Amazon Vine program.</li>
      <li>, it seemed like I needed more than “normal,” the more time went on,</li>
      <li>First of all, I really like the smell of this product; I&#x27;d say its rather unique, but in a good way.</li>
      <li>Further more, it costs more than most conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is not the original product.  </li>
      <li>so I would have to use more to really give it a 5 star but its close!</li>
      <li>I paired this conditioner with the full blown volume shampoo and it didn&#x27;t make a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s volume.</li>
      <li>Although this item may be a bit pricey, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>As it turned out, I was a bit surprised to find that I needed to use a bit more than I had been using (with my dwindling “back-up” conditioner) but was pleasantly surprised at the delightfully LIGHT fragrance (not overpowering) but potent enough to make the showering experience pleasant and enjoyable, leaving the a light “clean” smell of the hair afterwards, in addition to more than serving it’s purpose.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of conditioners, many of which claim to do so, but this stuff performs as advertised on my fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>I found, too, that it seemed most effective if I left the conditioner in for a minute or two before rinsing out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed using this product and would be more than ready to purchase it again, more so if it were to be more locally sold/distributed.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant but not overwhelming which is nice.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for my freezy hard to manage hair.</li>
      <li>Full volume is what you get.  </li>
      <li>strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how strong and healthy my hair looked.  </li>
      <li>and if one doesn&#x27;t like it, it dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product many times from salons and licensed high end stores, and was trying to save time and money by buying online.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 4.5 for me.  I was shocked when I tried this product via influenster gratis.  I had used previous products from this brand in the past and been less than impressed.  But this volume brand was amazing for my normally limp locks.  I loved it.  It left me with lots of bounce and a full style that lasted longer than my usual brand.  I think I might have to actually buy this and use it on a more regular basis.  I only had a small sample so I would have to use more to really give it a 5 star but its close!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Helps soften hair and volumize but without stripping of my hair color. worth the price.</li>
    <li> i just used the conditioner and it made my hair really silky. As for the volume, it&#x27;s not extreme. The product does smell great. &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the smell of this condition.  I actually like the conditioner a little bit better than the shampoo.  Normally, I have to use a tiny bit of conditioner so my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy.  This conditioner I could use a normal amount and my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy at all.  If you want to smell a tropical paradise and give your hair a little volume, this is the the conditioner for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use all Fekkai products and love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> It creates shine and manageability.....I love it!</li>
    <li> Love all these products.  Best prices on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is not the original product.  I was terribly disappointed.  I have purchased this product many times from salons and licensed high end stores, and was trying to save time and money by buying online.  The conditioner was runny and thin, clearly watered down or replaced.  Not worth the hassle returning, but wont buy this product online again.</li>
    <li> This was not authentic Fekkai conditioner.  The pictured image is not what you get.  The bottle was wrong, and the conditioner damaged my hair.  I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Not the real deal. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair. Best conditioner yet.</li>
    <li> This product works really good and smells refreshing.</li>
    <li> This product softens and conditions my very soft fine hair. For me it is not at all volumizing. Bosley  conditioner and hair thickener gives my hair &amp;#34;teeth” and body - this product makes it limp.</li>
    <li> Same as I said before I love their shampoo&#x27;s, conditioners now they have hair fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it worked great.  This bottle of conditioner was not the same product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but nothing special.  I will probably not buy again.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but my husband hasn&#x27;t looked so good in a long time hair wise.  It last very long since you need so little so both he and I are satisfied.</li>
    <li> This line of products has so far been really great for my hair which is bleached, colored and curled to death on a daily basis. It leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable. I do recommend using an additional leave on for hair ends if you use a flat iron or curling iron as I do.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner.  This is my first Fekkai product and I am very pleased.  It feels very thick and rich but does not weigh hair down.  Made my hair very soft and definitely helps w/volume.  Has a very nice fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> Hmmm, I really like this conditioner because it makes my hair incredibly soft and manageable and even seems to help tame my frizziness. I have lots of baby fine hair, it&#x27;s very healthy but with waviness that turns to curly frizz in humidity it has a mind of its own. This conditioner gives me swingy commercial hair! Even my husband has noticed and commented on it, and how often does that happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But volume, which is the whole premise this product is sold on? Not so much. In fact if you use too much or put it too close to your roots I find it makes my hair a bit limp. Buy like I said I have baby fine hair so maybe I&#x27;m a bit of a freak. But anytime you want to build volume you need to get lift at your root, at least that&#x27;s my understanding. And this shouldn&#x27;t go near your roots, it says that on the back of it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and is easily weighed down by hair products (especially conditioners). This full volume conditioner is just the right type for my hair. I notice a visible difference in body and volume when I use it. I love how shiny and manageable my hair is now.</li>
    <li> Full volume is what you get.  Make sure you use this conditioner with the matching shampoo.  I found I need  a tangle free spray after using the shampoo and conditioner as it can be drying, which is where you get your volume because it is not laden with greasy things to weigh your hair down.  It works really well and you should couple it with the volumizing mousse, to give you fuller hair.  It smells good and I would recommend!</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly short, primarily grey, thin and fine, mostly straight, and limp.  I do not like to spend a lot of time on my hair, nor do I expect miracles from hair products, only some slight improvement.  For two weeks, I used three Fekkai full blown volume products together, the shampoo, conditioner, and aerosol styling whip, and no other products.  I have no allegiances to shampoo or conditioner, but I have used the Paul Mitchell extra-body sculpting foam for over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to concentrate the conditioner at the ends of the hair, avoiding the scalp, so I did not massage in at all, working the very silky lotion from the middle to the ends of my hair.  After applying, the instructions say to comb through hair and rinse thoroughly.  Not being accustomed to keeping a comb in the shower, I did not do this.  My hair really felt soft and silky afterwards.  What I did notice was a somewhat unpleasant smell to the conditioner, sort of chemical, which is not nice after experiencing the great fragrance of the coordinated shampoo.  In my opinion the price at around $14 for 8 ounces is too much, although with my short hair, it will probably last several months.</li>
    <li> The Full Blown Volume conditioner does a great job of conditioning and rinses out cleanly so my hair soft and shiny but it doesn’t leave a build-up to make my hair limp. Because of that I found my styling products work better when I use this conditioner. I also love the love the refreshing citrus, herb and fruit scent. The packaging is great, just the right diameter to easily fit in my hand, has a press to open cap and has a matte finish that isn’t slippery when wet.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this conditioner more than I did. I have long hair and found that while this conditioned reasonably well, it didn&#x27;t exactly give me the results that would made it stand out from the rest. Further more, it costs more than most conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells sort of odd. I wouldn&#x27;t say the smell is a deal breaker, but it also doesn&#x27;t make me want to go out and buy more of it. I found it odd that the conditioner instructs you to stay away from the scalp, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine conditioner. It&#x27;s not great and I don&#x27;t think it really enhanced my volume in any way, but there&#x27;s certainly worse products out there. There&#x27;s also better ones.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally spring for high end shampoo or conditioner, but when I do I usually buy Redken, Paul Mitchell or Biolage...a little more affordable that Fekkai. This small bottle retails for around twenty dollars, which is pretty high in my opinion. Anyway, I used this on my very long, thinnish hair. The smell was incredible, like most luxury brands, and it left my hair feeling nice and silky. But I had to use a lot to get the conditioner to cover my hair because it&#x27;s a pretty thin product. I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t do a very good job of smoothing and hydrating my dry ends. I ended up using this on my roots and then use a thicker conditioner on the ends of my hair. That worked well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a nice conditioner.  it has a pleasant citrus scent and leaves my hair very soft and manageable with no tangles.  However, I did not really notice an increase in volume in my long fine hair.  It didn&#x27;t weigh it down, which is a plus, but I didn&#x27;t feel that I had more volume.  I was not using the accompanying Fekkai shampoo, however, and that could make a difference.  It conditions well and I like the way it left my hair, but I am not real convinced that this conditioner will actually increase hair volume.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from the Amazon Vine program. I really liked the smell, texture and packaging of this conditioner. I was hoping that it really would add volume to my hair, but it did not. In fact, it left my hair more flat than many other volumizing shampoos I have tried.  Unfortunately, I would not buy this product-it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel clean and healthy, and it did seem thicker - it blew out really well and held the style longer than usual, though it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or make my hair feel as if it had &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; in it.. It has an us usual fragrance, citrus and ginseng, which is pleasant and not overpowering. I think most men would be comfortable using a conditioner with this scent. I would recommend this for people who have thin, fine and or limp hair. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for my freezy hard to manage hair. Makes it softer without making the hair look oily or too soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products by this brand and this was my least favorite.  The smell is pleasant but not overwhelming which is nice.  Although it&#x27;s a creamy conditioner it is rather light.  What I didn&#x27;t like is that it didn&#x27;t condition as well as I need for my dry ends and it made my hair a bit frizzy.  Overall, I would say not worth paying full retail.</li>
    <li> I love the product, and would purchase it on my own (my criterion for giving 4 or 5 stars to a Vine product).  But be aware:  you must use this conditioner very sparingly.  It&#x27;s strong, if that&#x27;s the proper term, and too much will render your hair oily and flat.  But in small doses, it&#x27;s strong against the frizzies.</li>
    <li> This conditioner worked well.  It gave my hair some bounce.  I have fine thin hair so nothing short of a wig will give it much volume, but as far as volume conditioners go this product was very good.  It has a nice but not overpowering smell.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, which I hate, although I did do as they suggested on the container, which was to put the conditioner mostly on the ends of my hair.  All in all, I would buy it again and even try their other products.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, more than the “average” person (partially because I have a genetic skin disease/disorder (but nothing that is severe,) which DOES affect my overall skin health) of which my scalp is no exclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the first day I was wanting to try this conditioner and was curious to think as to whether or not it might “optimally” function if I didn’t have the “same” kind of shampoo and/or if it would work [at all.] As it turned out, I was a bit surprised to find that I needed to use a bit more than I had been using (with my dwindling “back-up” conditioner) but was pleasantly surprised at the delightfully LIGHT fragrance (not overpowering) but potent enough to make the showering experience pleasant and enjoyable, leaving the a light “clean” smell of the hair afterwards, in addition to more than serving it’s purpose. I was surprised and almost felt as if the conditioner served as a better kind of “detangler” than the previous conditioner that I have been using. Though, as it turns out, if there is any difference, it’s slight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that while initially – the first few times – I started to use this conditioner, it seemed like I needed more than “normal,” the more time went on, the more I found it VARIED – the amount I needed. Oh: and just a note…I squeezed some out into one hand, and then either used the other to bit-by-bit rub it into my hairline, and practically my hairline only, or, at least, rubbed in into my hairline initially, and once my whole hairline had been ‘covered,’ would then work a little of the conditioner “back” or “up” towards the center of my head/scalp. I found, too, that it seemed most effective if I left the conditioner in for a minute or two before rinsing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed using this product and would be more than ready to purchase it again, more so if it were to be more locally sold/distributed. Nonetheless, I have nothing negative I can think of to say about this product. I didn’t give it a 5-star rating because it just wasn’t quite….”all that and a bag of chips” for me, yet it still proved to be quite an enjoyable experience to use.hink of to say about this product.

    <li> Not so much the product (not worth the money)but the problems with amazon,</li>
    <li> 5 star fabulous and I am very fussy</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and really enjoyed it. My fine, thick hair can get weighted down easily with many conditioners, but not so with this one. I found it light enough to use daily, and made my hair feel smoother. The scent was slight, but nice, and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner. It&#x27;s lightweight, smells nice (not too perfume-y, not overbearing). I have short hair, and I find that this conditioner does a better job than others I&#x27;ve tried in not making my hair get all flyaway and crazy. As for the volume, hard to say, though this doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, so I guess that&#x27;s something.</li>
    <li> unfortunately does not work as well as I thought it would with hard water  in our household ...</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I purchased it on a whim, because it is a lot more expensive than the conditioners I usually buy from Wal-Mart, but I wanted to treat myself. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This conditioner is thick, creamy, and has an amazing smell: lemon verbena! It makes my hair so soft and silky, and my boyfriend loves the way it makes my hair smell! I&#x27;ve decided to invest in the matching shampoo, as well. Although this item may be a bit pricey, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My hair has been a bit abused lately and it&#x27;s been noticeably more flat.  This sounded like the perfect conditioner to try, &amp;#34;full blown volume!&amp;#34;  It did improve the volume of my hair and gave it more bounce, but it feels almost sticky and more stiff as well.  The smell is pleasant, not overwhelming, with some citrus.  It is pretty thin conditioner, so I felt like I was using much more than I normally would with other products.  I have long hair, down to my lower back, and this bottle lasted three weeks of fairly regular use.  I switched to my usual conditioner a few times when I felt the texture of my hair was getting too sticky, for lack of a better term.&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a good one for every other shower or one week on, one week off use.  The extra volume is nice, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very soft after use.</li>
    <li> First of all, I really like the smell of this product; I&#x27;d say its rather unique, but in a good way. It definitely does make a difference in my hair, as I could feel it right away after rinsing it out. Definitely gives more body, and I would continue to use this product. Would recommend to anyone wanted a little more volume in their hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thin and long hair. To keep the volume up and the hair flowy in the summer is not an easy task. Most conditioners I tried would always weigh down my hair. After I started using other Fekkai&#x27;s hair products, I immediately became a huge fan. This one did not disappoint, either! It not only has a beautiful floral smell but also keeps my hair nicely conditioned in the summertime without weighing it down. My hair looks healthy and bouncy all year round because of Fekkai&#x27;s creations! I am such a huge fan!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It&#x27;s nourishing without being too heavy and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it both with the matching shampoo and the Fekkai Apple Cider Clarifying Shampoo and found it to be a great combination with both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed an increase in volume when not heat styling or blow drying my hair, but by the same token, it does seem to add some nice body when I do heat style or blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner smells good and rinses out cleanly.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner. Makes hair fluffy and feeling great. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Although this conditioner is marketed for hair with a fine texture, I ordered it because my hair is long and heavy and conditioner can weigh it down. I like to change it up once in a while to give my hair a break. Plus the scent of citrus and mint had an undeniable appeal.    This is an awesome lightweight conditioner. It left my hair feeling hydrated, but it didn&#x27;t weight it down, especially on top, where some conditioners seem to just sit, no matter how thoroughly I rinse.    What I loved more than the conditioning though, was the scent. The Citrus and Ginseng, with a touch of mint, wafted around me when I wore my hair down. I usually am rather particular about scents, and they tend to give me a headache. This was quite the experience though. It was like having a little bit of aromatherapy every time I turned my head. The scent is light and clean, but so very relaxing. If I could buy it as a lotion, I&#x27;d be all over it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product through Influenster. I tried it the very next day and completely fell in love with it. I love its citrus scent that lasted all day. My hair felt cleaner and softer. I have very dry and frizzy hair. This conditioner definitely added smoothness to my hair&#x27;s texture. I will certainly be ordering the bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells great, and left my hair soft and not weighed down.  My hair feels great and it is also not dry after using my hairdryer. I got a free sample of this, and I am so happy I tried it.  I will now be purchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the Fekkai shampoos and conditioners at one point in time and of the lot, this is my least favorite. Does it make your hair fuller? Yes, actually it does and you can see the results from nearly the first shampoo. Initially I was impressed until I realized that fullness came at the price of drier hair. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with drier hair save for in winter when it could use an occasional moisture boost treatment but this shampoo and conditioner made my hair much drier and less shiny than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is not as moisturizing as other Fekkai conditioners, if you have oilier hair, I’m thinking it could be just perfect for you. You could get some volume but don’t have to worry about a conditioner weighing your hair down. If you hair is already dry then you probably want to avoid it like the plague. I tried after the aerosol version thinking it might be a tad more moisturizing but was disappointed to discover there was no difference in level of conditioning, just in the experience you have putting it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have to mention this but the smell . . . the smell is . . . not . . . good. Imagine melon, with mint, with citrus. Doesn&#x27;t sound so bad on it&#x27;s own, does it? Now add crushed SweetTarts. Yeah, now imagine rinsing your hair, leaving no moisturizing agents behind, but the smell of sickly artificial sweetness following you all day long. It&#x27;s not the worst smell in the world but it&#x27;s definitely not one I want wafting after me. I mentioned it to a friend and she told me she&#x27;d already noticed and didn&#x27;t want to hurt my feelings. Yeah, so it&#x27;s not just me. Maybe you&#x27;ll love it though. Always a possibility. Different scents for different noses. :)</li>
    <li> This allows my hair to bounce!  I have thin curly hair and this conditioner is fabulous!  I look like I have much thicker hair with the volume I can get now.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Don&#x27;t need a lot of this conditioner.  It will leave your hair feeling soft and full, without making is greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I paired this conditioner with the full blown volume shampoo and it didn&#x27;t make a huge difference in my hair&#x27;s volume. However, this is still a great everyday conditioner. Paired with the shampoo my hair was shiny and soft. Plus, these products smell amazing!</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo/conditioner combo smells absolutely amazing.  I didn&#x27;t see a ton of volume difference, but I definitely would buy it again because the smell is similar to a peachy smell and made me feel luxurious.</li>
    <li> This product came at an amazing price, but the conditioner itself was so obviously watered down it ran through my fingers!  I have face wash that&#x27;s a thicker consistency!  All I can say is that I should have known the quality I would get based on the price...it really was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> This product is very watery, and it is fake? My wife said its different from one before. I hope we can returne it or excahge it if its possible</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for volume...even if u hv thinnest hair</li>
    <li> I took off a star due to the high price, but otherwise, I like this conditioner. I do like the scent - it&#x27;s like a citrus-floral-tea tree combination, &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; without being too Eau De Windex - and if one doesn&#x27;t like it, it dissipates quickly. The conditioner is less creamy and more runny than many conditioners, making it easier to use (but be careful it doesn&#x27;t squirt out at you!) and leaves my long straight hair very soft. If I wanted to splurge, I&#x27;d get this again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything volume wise, but the smell is great without being too heavy. Smells lightly fruity, to the point of even making you a little hungry. I&#x27;d get it again just for that. If you&#x27;re purchasing on scent alone go for this conditioner but it isn&#x27;t different from other conditioners in any other way.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and damaged, but when I use this conditioner, it looks great!  I have my hair straightened using a Japanese thermal conditioning method, and also have it dyed, and it&#x27;s very dry to begin with.  So I don&#x27;t expect much from hair care products.  I was incredibly happy after using this product and strongly recommend it.  If it can make my hair look shiny and healthy, I can&#x27;t imagine what it could do for hair that&#x27;s in good condition to begin with.</li>
    <li> The Full Blown Volume conditioner is astonishing.  I have very full hair so I didn’t want it to fluff anything up.  I have 7th grade nightmares, I mean, memories of fluffed up hair that would not stay down.  This conditioner did not cause my hair to get fluffy.  What it did was make it silky and manageable, while keeping its shape and strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how strong and healthy my hair looked.  It felt bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.  The ginseng scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a complimentary sample from Influenster. I love this conditioner! I like the lighter feel to it, and that a little goes a long way.  When used with the full blown shampoo, my hair had a really nice volume and shine to it.  I like that the scent is not overpowering. It is a good price point for a good salon-style conditioner, especially off you want more volume!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner your hair is not weighed down.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I do not use shampoo.  I haven&#x27;t used shampoo for years.  I think and believe that shampoo just strips the hair.  I do use conditioner and then rinse my hair.  I have found that some conditioners are just too thick and goopy and don&#x27;t really do good things to my hair.  This one is far far different.  After just 7 days of use my hair is beautiful and soft and yet manageable.  Still do not use shampoo.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this conditioner for it to work. My hair is past my shoulders and I use a dime size dollop.  I put it in my hair when I first get in the shower.  Then I shower and the last thing I do is rinse out my hair.  I love this stuff and will continue to buy.  This one bottle will likely last me upwards of two months because you do not need a lot of the product to get amazing amounts of results.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great. The smell is really nice, first off. And it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: it leaves my hair full without weighing it down or leaving it feeling oily. I&#x27;ve tried lots of conditioners, many of which claim to do so, but this stuff performs as advertised on my fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I could not get this conditioner at the supermarket I normally shop at anymore, so I was pretty excited when I found it on Amazon (and for a couple dollars cheaper than I usually purchase it for).  When I went to use it for the first time, however, it was incredibly thin and runny.  It appeared as if someone had actually watered down the product.  I have been using this conditioner for years now, so I know how thick it should be when purchasing it from the store.  I am incredibly disappointed and almost feel cheated out of my money.  Would not purchase from this seller again!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this shampoo through VoxBox. I&#x27;ve used it three consecutive washes with the matching shampoo, and I do notice that my shoulder length, thin, curly hair does have more volume. And I love the scent. I&#x27;d buy it for the smell alone!</li>
