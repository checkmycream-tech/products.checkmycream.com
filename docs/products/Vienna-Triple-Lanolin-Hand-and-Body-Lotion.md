      <li>So far so good!!  </li>
      <li>so when I saw this product I thought woww this would be econonical and had ingredients that I know are good for skin like Aloe Vera; since I received the lotion and have been using it faithfully my skin has been normal and no determatitis flareups to date, I am extremely happy with my purchase</li>
      <li>I was always able to find it here &amp; there.</li>

      <li>This is one of my favorite lotions.</li>
      <li>They indicate that this is for more than one bottle, but that&#x27;s a lie-</li>
      <li>Most people who are looking for eczema help/</li>
      <li>I love the thickeness and the smell.</li>
      <li>I tried many famous brands on the market.</li>
      <li>This is much better than Vaseline.   </li>
      <li>I have used it for many years and never</li>
      <li>Glad I bought this and will be ordering it again.</li>
      <li>and it has a nice clean scent about it which i adore</li>
      <li>I had heard that lanolin was best for dry skin so decided to order this.  </li>
      <li>This is the best lotion I have ever used for my dry skin and nails!  </li>
      <li>and oh this lotion smells so nice and fresh smelling</li>
      <li>I am going to order more before winter as it really does treat my crepe paper skin better than anything I have tried in the stores!</li>
      <li>It came very quickly and well packed.  </li>
      <li>A diabetic, my feet are not in good shape, this product keeps the skin soft and more pliable.</li>
      <li>Early during my pregnancy I looked everywhere for a good lotion for my belly, one that had lanolin as one of the top ingredients.  </li>
      <li>This one just doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Either product is Fabulous.</li>
      <li>You can feel the good feeling of soothing and healing, and it is not sticky as Vaseline, and it seems just so natural.</li>
      <li>But this one truly is good at both (and not expensive) and not irritating.</li>
      <li>It is rich and creamy, yet not greasy or tacky.</li>
      <li>Nourishing, rich lotion.</li>
      <li>I was enticed to purchase this at a significant discount when added on to another purchase over $25.  </li>
      <li>Vaseline was the only one that didn&#x27;t (and very cheap), but not so effective on moisturizing or healing.</li>
      <li>It works great on my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Great for my dry skin problem here in Las Vegas</li>
      <li>This lotion is great, really soothes chapped skin, makes it soft, and has a clean scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always been great for the winter months when my hands get extremely dry</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s right!</li>
      <li>I bought on the most famous auction site because of the price, but I want everybody knows this secret great product.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this in stores, sure brought back memories when I first smelled it, and the price was pretty good.</li>
      <li>i love the smell and it works really good when my hands get dried out from summer or winter weather.</li>
      <li>And I was pleased to see they held 25% more than my last bottle!</li>
      <li>is the best thing to condition the skins and keep them lasting a long time.</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY!!  </li>
      <li>I tried using more natural, organic lotions, but they don&#x27;t compare!  </li>
      <li>And it is absorbed into skin well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many other kinds of lotion over the years, but none of them come close to this one.</li>
      <li>This lotion is old school (my grandmother used it her whole life) but is the absolute best for treating dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>Right leg</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Triple Lanolin -- ORIGINAL FORMULA, NOT THE ONE WITH ALOE.</li>
      <li>relief are looking for all natural fragrance free products.  </li>
      <li>Triple Lanolin keeps my skin smooth , soft and supple.</li>
      <li>It does feel a bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; at first</li>
      <li>Most products actually does the opposite - irritates more.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser raves about my skin, as it has stayed soft and smooth all these years, no doubt with the help of this lotion.</li>
      <li>After 24 hours each 1/2 tsp of product  still in original form (not dried out at all)</li>
      <li>and my doctor told me that lanolin (from sheep) is the most like human skin oil and will penetrate better than other oils.  </li>
      <li>It is not oily, soaks in quickly and my skin stays soft longer.  </li>
      <li>If you have extremely dry skin as I do, you will LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years because I have very dry skin</li>
      <li>The original formula is much better, and the only one that works on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Thankyou so much.</li>
      <li>therefore my skin has been absorbing all of it.</li>
      <li>Use it sparingly till you get a feel for how much you need.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for decades because it is simple and basic and effective.</li>
      <li>He has tried other brands that cater more toward men.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the original formula off and on for the last five or six years.  </li>
      <li>I bought the large 20 oz bottle instead of the smaller ones and am still on the first bottle after 6 months of use.</li>
      <li>Placed a 1/2 tsp of each product on nonporous surface to see if skin really absorbed product or if it simply evaporated.</li>
      <li>In the winter time (I live in the northern U.S.)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d found that it was available online, so finally ordered some: THREE big bottles!</li>
      <li>The only other alternative is Vaseline which I don&#x27;t like for many reasons.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this lotion in my doctor&#x27;&#x27;s office and subsequently ordered it.</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t, I get calluses on the edges of my heels that crack and bleed, but with this lotion my feet stay normal and soft.  </li>
      <li>My son uses this every day for his Eczema and it is not greasy  but soft and the skin just drinks it in.</li>
      <li>This has far surpassed those,  in his esteem.</li>
      <li>and it keeps your skin sooo soft and moist.</li>
      <li>My skin becomes so sensitive in winter that nothing can soothe my skin.</li>
      <li>Thick but not greasy with a lovely summery scent.</li>
      <li>Super dry feet/ankles have been using this for one month on left leg.</li>
      <li>When it arrived the cap on it was pretty loose so some lotion leaked out.</li>
      <li>A little truely does go along way</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product of the bomb! I love the thickeness and the smell. This is one of my favorite lotions. I have to hid it from the rest of the family.</li>
    <li> wonderful lotion that hydrates your skin well. The lanolin really is nice.</li>
    <li> This lotion became my very favorite MANY years ago. It&#x27;s effective, not sticky, and has a pleasing smell-- but not overpowering. I was always able to find it here &amp; there. Years later, my sources dried up. Then, a couple years ago, it suddenly appeared at our locally-owned drug store in southern Michigan. Before we moved from there, I stocked up on it. When I was running low this summer, I asked if they still sold some. They didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;d found that it was available online, so finally ordered some: THREE big bottles! And I was pleased to see they held 25% more than my last bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original formula off and on for the last five or six years.  It&#x27;s always been great for the winter months when my hands get extremely dry (they used to crack and bleed).  I tried using more natural, organic lotions, but they don&#x27;t compare!  Now I have just started using this for stubborn eczema on my face and hands.  So far so good!!  I&#x27;m hoping it will continue to work well.  I use this lotion morning and night.  (I&#x27;ve tried the one with mango, but doesn&#x27;t work as well for some reason).</li>
    <li> this is undoubtly one of the best lotions i have ever used. my grandmother has used it probably since before i was born, and i have grown up with this smell. i love the smell and it works really good when my hands get dried out from summer or winter weather. and it has a nice clean scent about it which i adore</li>
    <li> A bit of an old-fashioned, simple scent. Nourishing, rich lotion. After a couple of weeks of using it, I ordered 2 for gifts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Triple Lanolin (original formula) for at least 40 years and won&#x27;t use anything else. I&#x27;ve tried many, many other kinds of lotion over the years, but none of them come close to this one. It must be used sparingly, or you will get a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel and you won&#x27;t like it. If I want just a minimal amount, I will sometimes put a little water on my hands first, which thins it out as I rub it on.  In the winter time (I live in the northern U.S.), I use it all over, no thinning it out. I keep some near my computer, as my hands tend to dry out for some reason while using the computer any length of time. I also keep it by every sink and shower, in the bedroom, in the car and in my purse. I have every size except the gallon size. It is the ONLY lotion that \\&quot;stays with you.\\&quot; All the others, after five minutes I feel like I need to put it on again -- the moisture part evaporates or something. This does not happen with Triple Lanolin. Some people do not care for the scent, but that goes away after a couple minutes. My hairdresser raves about my skin, as it has stayed soft and smooth all these years, no doubt with the help of this lotion. My three sisters don&#x27;t use it, and their skin has aged. Many people are shocked when I tell them I will be 70 in a few months -- they think I&#x27;m 55 or 60 (and no, I don&#x27;t dye my hair, which is still pretty dark). I highly recommend Triple Lanolin -- ORIGINAL FORMULA, NOT THE ONE WITH ALOE. Use it sparingly till you get a feel for how much you need.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion  as I am having problems with contact dermatitis and needed a cream that would help protect my hands from harsh cleaners, I was advised to purchase Lanolin based creams so when I saw this product I thought woww this would be econonical and had ingredients that I know are good for skin like Aloe Vera; since I received the lotion and have been using it faithfully my skin has been normal and no determatitis flareups to date, I am extremely happy with my purchase and oh this lotion smells so nice and fresh smelling, it also wakes up the senses with it&#x27;s scent</li>
    <li> If you have extremely dry skin as I do, you will LOVE this product. I have used it for many years and never (and I have looked just to see what&#x27;s out there) found anything to compare. It is rich and creamy, yet not greasy or tacky. Perfect consistency and very soothing.</li>
    <li> I tried the Aloe Vera one, but it failed. But this time, it didn&#x27;t. The original formula is much better, and the only one that works on my dry skin. The only other alternative is Vaseline which I don&#x27;t like for many reasons. This is much better than Vaseline.   My skin becomes so sensitive in winter that nothing can soothe my skin. Most products actually does the opposite - irritates more. I tried many famous brands on the market. Vaseline was the only one that didn&#x27;t (and very cheap), but not so effective on moisturizing or healing. But this one truly is good at both (and not expensive) and not irritating. You can feel the good feeling of soothing and healing, and it is not sticky as Vaseline, and it seems just so natural. And it is absorbed into skin well.  I bought on the most famous auction site because of the price, but I want everybody knows this secret great product.</li>
    <li> Early during my pregnancy I looked everywhere for a good lotion for my belly, one that had lanolin as one of the top ingredients.  The lotion has a nice consistency and smell.  I use it in conjunction with a bit of Lansinoh (it is thick but rub a bit on hands until it warms up) on my belly to avoid stretch marks and to keep the skin smooth and elastic.  I bought the large 20 oz bottle instead of the smaller ones and am still on the first bottle after 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT. Am diabetic with a &amp;#34;Dermopathy&amp;#34;. Super dry feet/ankles have been using this for one month on left leg. Right leg Triple Lanolin &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; (which is slightly thicker. Night and day difference in both legs from previous condition!!!!! Skin is no longer dry!!!!! Either product is Fabulous. Conducted 24 hr experiment. Placed a 1/2 tsp of each product on nonporous surface to see if skin really absorbed product or if it simply evaporated. After 24 hours each 1/2 tsp of product  still in original form (not dried out at all) therefore my skin has been absorbing all of it. Skin absorbs either product in a few min. I put &amp;#34;super heavy&amp;#34; coat on twice  a day (when skin is wet) so it takes almost 45 min in my case. But in normal use just a few min. No significant difference between products  (only slight difference in fragrance). Will be buying this for the rest of my life. (in the gallon size from Amazon)</li>
    <li> You only need a little bit of this lotion. A little truely does go along way and it keeps your skin sooo soft and moist. Thankyou so much. The shipment/Packaging was wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> My son uses this every day for his Eczema and it is not greasy  but soft and the skin just drinks it in. Also does not burn or irritate like other lotions can. Love the light scent too!</li>
    <li> good quality feel comotable pretty style, unfortunately the color i choose was too dark for me. I am in the process of returning it. I would suggest adding traditional color # to product.</li>
    <li> I could not survive a winter without this product. Triple Lanolin keeps my skin smooth , soft and supple. In this harsh Northern New York weather, I could feel and look like a piece of old leather.</li>
    <li> Great for my dry skin problem here in Las Vegas</li>
    <li> This is excellent quality and an excellent value</li>
    <li> Good product. Bought it for my mom. When it arrived the cap on it was pretty loose so some lotion leaked out.</li>
    <li> Unchanged after ALL THESE YEARS.  Thick but not greasy with a lovely summery scent.</li>
    <li> I am going to order more before winter as it really does treat my crepe paper skin better than anything I have tried in the stores!</li>
    <li> Reactivates the moisture your skin looses.It is also made it the United States. Keeping us Americans employed and proud to be made in America!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years because I have very dry skin and my doctor told me that lanolin (from sheep) is the most like human skin oil and will penetrate better than other oils.  He&#x27;s right! I have never found anything that leaves my skin as moist and supple for hours afterward.  It does feel a bit \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; at first but that goes away in moments and with it the feeling of \\&quot;tightness\\&quot; that dry skin has. I carry the small tubes in my purse to use on my lips and hands during the day to prevent cracking and on my whole body after bathing. If I don&#x27;t, I get calluses on the edges of my heels that crack and bleed, but with this lotion my feet stay normal and soft.  Now I am panicking because the place that used to make it - B&amp;T Labs - seems to have gone out of business.  I usually order by the gallon and my last order was returned undeliverable.  Lets hope this source has plenty of stock!</li>
    <li> I was really happy to find a lanolin based lotion that would absorb nicely.  My daughter has bad eczema and this has helped but the fragrance is TOO much.  Most people who are looking for eczema help/relief are looking for all natural fragrance free products.  This one just doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Lanolin makes all the difference</li>
    <li> If you have dry, cracking hands this product is just what you are looking for. The lanolin is what does the trick.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this lotion in my doctor&#x27;&#x27;s office and subsequently ordered it. It has a noticeable Lanolin odor but I purchased it for its Lanolin content. A diabetic, my feet are not in good shape, this product keeps the skin soft and more pliable.</li>
    <li> This is not what I received. I didn&#x27;t get the yellow bottle, it&#x27;s a white and green, and it&#x27;s not what my mom uses. Horrible experience, buyer beware!  They indicate that this is for more than one bottle, but that&#x27;s a lie- they only sent one.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores, sure brought back memories when I first smelled it, and the price was pretty good.</li>
    <li> This lotion is old school (my grandmother used it her whole life) but is the absolute best for treating dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> Did this lotion meet my expectations? ABSOLUTELY!!  I love it!  I had tried, in vain, to find lotion in our area that contained lanolin.  I decided to look on Amazon.com and found it immediately!  I swim a lot and have issues with psoriasis. This has helped even that. My husband loves it, also. He is a hard-working guy whose hands get chapped and cracked in cold weather. He has tried other brands that cater more toward men. This has far surpassed those,  in his esteem.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Great transaction.</li>
    <li> My mom used to use this lotion years ago and I always liked it. I thought it was no longer manufactures since I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere....then I checked Amazon. This lotion is great, really soothes chapped skin, makes it soft, and has a clean scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for decades because it is simple and basic and effective.</li>
    <li> I have previously been using Balm Barr for45 years as a RN and and it has been sold to another company and I needed a replacement and this worked pretty well. It seems to last quite a while on my hands and I may use it as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I had heard that lanolin was best for dry skin so decided to order this.  It came very quickly and well packed.  It works great on my dry skin.  I was concerned about the scent but it is very mild and pleasant.  It is not oily, soaks in quickly and my skin stays soft longer.  Glad I bought this and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST ON THE MARKET</li>
    <li> I love this product... Very hard to find.... Like the gallon bottle.... Should be sold with pump dispenser..would like to buy more.</li>
    <li> Very good product! I bought this because I am a conga/bongo player and lanolin is the best thing to condition the skins and keep them lasting a long time. Plus it&#x27;s great for my hands too.</li>
    <li> I was enticed to purchase this at a significant discount when added on to another purchase over $25.  It was to be a savings of 92 percent or so for a quantity of 20 of these.  I got one and no return email from Amazon when I complained about the bad deal.  Stay away from this seller!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used for my dry skin and nails!  I can no longer find it in retail stores, so I was very happy to find it here!</li>
