      <li>I first experienced the Peter Thomas Roth soap in the Shanghai Hilton.</li>

      <li>Gosh, if I knew I would ask for more samples at the hotel</li>
      <li>I like the refreshing fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it.</li>
      <li>This was just ok.</li>
      <li>I love the body soap.  </li>
      <li>in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
      <li>As soon as you open the package you get that awesome smell that this soap has.</li>
      <li>Sampled on vacation and love these products.</li>
      <li>Perfect soap; not drying-scent is delicate and good for man or woman</li>
      <li>Like most others, my first experience with this product was at a popular hotel chain.</li>
      <li>Nice bars, just the right size to keep in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I tried this soap at Hilton in Las Vegas two years ago and since then I don&#x27;t use other soaps - this one is the best!</li>
      <li>I liked it so much, I asked a manager if their gift shop carried some I could purchase.  </li>
      <li>As others point out, it does have a nice fragrance, but the shape leaves so much to be desired</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine he was handing me $25 in free soap, but when he handed them to me, he asked \\&quot;Is</li>
      <li>Husband love this soap , makes it worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The price is very good as well compare to other places.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what I was getting.</li>
      <li>great scent, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin....</li>
      <li>A three pack is even better for me; and the massage \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are a nice little add-on for the shoulders.</li>
      <li>and I was so glad to know that it was available to the public.  </li>
      <li>It smells so nice and fresh, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and clean it gently.</li>
      <li>Enjoyed the product immensely, but it broke apart too quickly and was too cumbersome to use afterwards as it was in pieces.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft and gives nice soft lather.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I will buy it for $18 (3) as they are pretty small, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>first used this product at a hotel in austin texas.</li>
      <li>Love all Peter Thomas Roth products and would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>This is not your average bar of soap: unique shape is easy to grasp when wet; doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin; one of the best smelling scents on the market.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and consider it worthwhile as a possible Christmas gift for family and friends.</li>
      <li>Does not have quite a strong enough scent which is what drew me to the product line.</li>
      <li>It really lasts a long time and makes your skin smell fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>It also makes your skin soft and moisturized right out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>This was the complimentary soap  at a hotel where I stayed recently</li>
      <li>That perspective makes it seem reasonable, but it adds up fast enough that I&#x27;ve decided I can&#x27;t justify springing for it.</li>
      <li>This bath bar is easy to grip and long lasting.  </li>
      <li>A better value than the small bars.</li>
      <li>When I first ordered this item, it had a different picture</li>
      <li>They last about a week, maybe a little more.  </li>
      <li>They smelled like they were old and the scent was not &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; at all.</li>
      <li>Excellently, fast and instead of receiving three bars as expected I received 4.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Turns out the bars dissolve relatively quickly -- and they&#x27;re relatively small to begin with.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product but other items I purchased from this seller in this shipment</li>
      <li>It is clear now (and since I finally received my order) that these are bigger than what you had at the hotel.</li>
      <li>It still makes this a little pricey, but I think it is worth it with the pleasing scent that lasts a long time.</li>

    <li> The cleanest of all.  My skin feels absolutely wonderful.  The purest ever.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap at Hilton in Las Vegas two years ago and since then I don&#x27;t use other soaps - this one is the best! It smells so nice and fresh, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and clean it gently.</li>
    <li> great scent, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin....this is a wonderful soap at an affordable price.  My order arrived in great shape and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> After trying the body wash and the body lotion I couldn&#x27;t resist trying the massaging Bar. This was just ok. The bar becomes slippery and falls out of your hand continuously as you are trying to wash. Eventually you massage your wash cloth because it is the only way if doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands. I am also attracted to the fragrance of all the Peter Roth cleansing products but the smell of this bath bar didn&#x27;t impress me. I would not repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> I first experienced the Peter Thomas Roth soap in the Shanghai Hilton. I like the refreshing fragrance. Recommended!</li>
    <li> You don&amp;#34;t want to use this product if you have dry skin. Like my dove products. No problem with dryness.</li>
    <li> Does not have quite a strong enough scent which is what drew me to the product line.</li>
    <li> Husband love this soap , makes it worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but other items I purchased from this seller in this shipment appeared to have been previously opened and attempted to be resealed. The contents of another item I received in this shipment had a broken seal as well spilled over everything in the box which was too large and unpadded. I like the product but would not purchase from here again.</li>
    <li> This soap smells amazing.</li>
    <li> IT is a nice change from a lufer. The bumps on the soap are amazing.</li>
    <li> Perfect soap; not drying-scent is delicate and good for man or woman</li>
    <li> We buy these for my dad who is 85. He has dry itchy skin and when he stumbled on these at a hotel stay, he was hooked.</li>
    <li> Discovered this brand while traveling -- one of the better hotel chains made a great decision. I got home and started shopping. This is not your average bar of soap: unique shape is easy to grasp when wet; doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin; one of the best smelling scents on the market.</li>
    <li> Excellently, fast and instead of receiving three bars as expected I received 4. As soon as you open the package you get that awesome smell that this soap has.The price is very good as well compare to other places.</li>

    <li> I have used this product for years and is one of the best soaps on the market,,, This product shipped to me was old and cracked and yellowed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this bars of soap at the hotel room on vacation. Back then I didn&#x27;t know anything about Peter Thomas skin care. I liked the soap and kept all the samples that were provided. It&#x27;s so soft and gives nice soft lather. When I wanted to get some more online, I was shocked to find out how expensive it was. Gosh, if I knew I would ask for more samples at the hotel hehe.. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it for $18 (3) as they are pretty small, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This was the complimentary soap  at a hotel where I stayed recently and it smelled so wonderful that I immediately ran to amazon and bought the full size bars.  A three pack is even better for me; and the massage \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are a nice little add-on for the shoulders.</li>

    <li> its really a nice soap bar with rich foam pleasant scent and fantastic shape.</li>
    <li> Love this massaging bar!  It has the best scent of any soap or bath wash I have ever used.  It also makes your skin soft and moisturized right out of the shower.  I hope people who commented on the price of the bars realize it is a bigger bar than the sample size the hotels provide.  It really lasts a long time and makes your skin smell fresh and clean.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Def recommend to anybody.  Does a great job :-)&lt;br /&gt;Fell in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
    <li> Nice bars, just the right size to keep in the shower.  Lather nicely, not drying like some soap bars.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth soaps are the best for sensitive skin.  Also have the facial bar at the bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural smelling soap</li>
    <li> Soap is excellent  very rich and creamy. The lotion should be as good a product</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the product immensely, but it broke apart too quickly and was too cumbersome to use afterwards as it was in pieces.</li>
    <li> Like the other two reviewers here, my first exposure to this massaging bar and other PTR products was during a stay at a hotel.  I liked the fragrance -- and I&#x27;m not one for fragrances.  I also liked the nice, soothing lather it produced.  I liked it so much, I asked a manager if their gift shop carried some I could purchase.  He didn&#x27;t think the gift shop carried any, but he went out back and handed me about 5 bars.  I can&#x27;t imagine he was handing me $25 in free soap, but when he handed them to me, he asked \\&quot;Is that enough?\\&quot; and even suggested I come back the next day if I decide I&#x27;d like some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the bars dissolve relatively quickly -- and they&#x27;re relatively small to begin with.  They last about a week, maybe a little more.  So it probably works out to about 50 cents per shower.  That perspective makes it seem reasonable, but it adds up fast enough that I&#x27;ve decided I can&#x27;t justify springing for it.</li>
    <li> When we were staying in Hawaii the hotel used this soap in their rooms.  I finally ran out of hotel samples and found that I could order it through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Sampled on vacation and love these products. Smell good and work,...shampoo and conditioner are great too.</li>
    <li> I got to experience this product at the San Diego Hilton. I had to go to the CVS down the street to buy soap that I could use for the week that I was there. As others point out, it does have a nice fragrance, but the shape leaves so much to be desired that I could‘t use it.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. will buy again</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Peter Thomas Roth products while staying in a well known hotel chain and I was so glad to know that it was available to the public.  This bath bar is easy to grip and long lasting.  Love it, love it.</li>
    <li> Like most others, my first experience with this product was at a popular hotel chain. When I first ordered this item, it had a different picture and I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what I was getting. It is clear now (and since I finally received my order) that these are bigger than what you had at the hotel. Hotel size is 1.75 oz. It still makes this a little pricey, but I think it is worth it with the pleasing scent that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love the bar and pedi feature.</li>
    <li> Great product! I really like this product and consider it worthwhile as a possible Christmas gift for family and friends.</li>
    <li> loved this product. first used this product at a hotel in austin texas. when we got home i had to order it.</li>
    <li> A better value than the small bars. One bar lasts for 2 weeks and I would buy again as its a great product.</li>
    <li> Love all Peter Thomas Roth products and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and pleasant</li>
    <li> I ordered these bars because of a sample I had and I loved the creamy feel and beautiful scent. These were NOTHING like that. They smelled like they were old and the scent was not &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; at all. No creamy feel either. A big dissapointment.</li>
