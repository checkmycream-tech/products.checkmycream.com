<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this mask. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> A very nice product. Refreshing and deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 50 different face masks from a range of stores, including some rather pricey ones from upscale beauty stores.  I honestly think this is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  I smear it all over my face and neck at the end of the day, leave it on about 10 minutes until it dries, then wash it off in the shower, scrubbing lightly with a warm washcloth to exfoliate.  Afterwards, my skin is *extremely* soft, literally baby-soft, and this has never irritated me at all(although I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive). The amazing softening is the most notable aspect of what this does, but it also seems to help a bit with clearing up acne and blackheads, in the sense that it seems to keep stress-induced breakouts at bay.  It&#x27;s also an awesome price.  I&#x27;ve never tried any other Freeman masks, but I certainly plan on it after this fantastic-- and aptly named-- Anti-Stress Mask.</li>
    <li> Bought this to add to my facial mask collection, and I love it! This is now in my regular rotation and I will be ordering this one again for sure!</li>
    <li> i do like this. it made my skin feel soft. didnt help with acne at all. and dont leave on past recommended i accidentally did that and my face was red all over!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it at the publix near house it made my face soft and bright (:</li>
    <li> Applies smoothly, hardens as mask evenly, washes off easily and is very relaxing and refreshing.  Would purchase this product  again.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful and leaves my face glowing, firmer, moisturized, and blemish-free. I use it 1-2 times a week and I love it</li>
    <li> I love this mask and it is great for the price. Its very calming, and easy to put on/wash off.</li>
    <li> Awesome, product applies smooth and gently tingles, very refreshing. Washes off easily and leaves my skin soft without leaving it dry and tight. This bottle is gonna last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This masque is great! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, instead leaves it soft and glowing. It also appears to minimize pores. I love the blue color, it&#x27;s fun and makes it easy to tell if it didn&#x27;t all get washed off. I&#x27;m excited to share this with my friends next girls&#x27; night!</li>
    <li> My skin looks just as nice after I put this on as when I use Murad or other more expensive products.  Love the price.  Love the availablility!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite masks ever! Not only does it smell absolutely wonderful and have a beautiful bright turquoise color when you put it on, it also works fantastically as well. It will make your skin feel smooth and tight and it does a good job of lessening the redness of the few blemishes I had. Keep in mind that this, like most clay masks may make your skin feel tight and slightly itchy as it dries. When you wash it off, its best to apply a moisturizer as your skin may be a bit dry. This mask leaves you with a very nice refreshed feeling and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this one! Just feels refreshing, all the way around. Great color. I keep an extra on hand so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I give this high ratings for fast delivery and great packaging. And how this product makes my skin feel and look. I purchased 3 for myself and my daughters. And will purchased again from this seller in the future. It was price very well and would reommend this seller to others. I am very happy with this product and seller. And I love the fresh clean smell it has.</li>
    <li> This mask makes my skin smoother and it&#x27;s very easy to put on and it wipes off easy after hardened with just a damp cloth.</li>
    <li> This facial mask smells truly amazing. I would recommend. It is very relaxing. So, if you want to just lay on the beach or your bed and have your own spa day, take this with you and experience a world like never before. Close your eyes and you will smell the ocean. It smells much better than you think.</li>
    <li> My face was so soft after using this. Very affordable it I use it once a week along with my routine skin care regimen. And the important that I love the most in this product It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I recommended this item with my friends next girls night out! Lol!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff i usually prefer organic but i really like the deep pore cleansing it does my skin looks cleaner and healthier when i use this 2-3 times a week</li>
    <li> REVIEW by my wife... This product is wonderful! It is very easy to use and leaves your skin feeling very clean, fresh and tightened!! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing. I have finals coming up, but when I put on the mask I was very chill. I calmed down and it left my skin feeling smooth. Really love this product.</li>
    <li> WOW does this mask just make my whole head melt - I instantly relax and feel all the tension leave me.  This is the only mask I have ever felt this with so now this is the only mask I will use.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Use every day and doesn&#x27;t stain my white washcloths!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this product!</li>
    <li> Feel amazing after using this!</li>
    <li> This was very refreshing and left my skin feeling great. I usually prefer the peel-off masks but this is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Very luxurious. My only complaint- the blue color is hard to wash out of white wash cloths.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! I using it 2-3 times a week and I can see that it does work!  I would recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> These people used to put out a mask that actually worked really well.  It was cheap too!!!  Since they have changed their formula nothing they have works if you ask me.  They should go back to the old original formula and they would sell a lot more once word got out.  Why they ever tried to fix something that wasn&#x27;t broke is beyond me.  Go back to the original formula and make us all happy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Received the mask with a week.  FAST Delivery a definite plus! However, I&#x27;ve found that Freeman&#x27;s other masks are much better.  I just don&#x27;t feel a difference in my skin compared to their other products.  I do love all their facial care products but I won&#x27;t be ordering this one again.  .</li>
    <li> This facial cream leaves my face feeling and looking refreshed. I love that its a bright blue color too!!</li>
    <li> I loved this mask. My face was so soft after using this. It had a great smell, went on easily and I got to look like a smurf for a few minutes. The important thing about using any clay mask is to wash it off before it drys completely. Once it dries completely and starts to crack it sucks the moisture from your skin which can leave it dry and irritated. I wash it off when it starts to dry but is still a little sticky to the touch. My routine when using this is that I wash my face with cleanser and dry. I apply a warm damp towel to my face to open up my pores and then apply the mask for about 5 minutes before it dries completely. I rinse off with warm water and a washcloth. Then I use Thatchers witch hazel toner and apply cetaphil moisturizer with spf. I use this mask once a week. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love Freeman products. When I became pregnant with my son I was so dehydrated and oily. Freeman products restored my PH balance and made my skin youthful looking again.

    <li> Always love the way his product makes my face feel. I use it once a week along with my routine skin care regimine. I havent found a better one out there</li>
    <li> I love love love this mask! One of my friends recommended it to me and I am so glad. I use it once a week and it makes my face feeling smooth and clean, deep down.</li>
    <li> I prefer this to the Detoxifying Superfruits mask (same brand). After using this one twice, I can safely say it&#x27;s gentler on my skin, which feels tighter after use but not stretched dry. I have fairly sensitive skin, and this one is remarkably soothing. Whether or not it did more than soothe I can&#x27;t tell. Maybe it nourished/deep-cleansed, maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My primary concern with this mask, and this brand in general, is the ingredients list. I prefer \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (not chemical) products when I can find them, and this definitely isn&#x27;t \\&quot;all-natural,\\&quot; although it does employ natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll probably finish the tube, but I won&#x27;t jump to buy another.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again after I run out, since I&#x27;m still experimenting with beauty masks. Believe me when I say this mask lasts a really, really long time, which was what attracted me to it in the first place. It&#x27;s cheap and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply it after I shower when my face is feeling clean, and the mask makes me feel very refreshed. The results aren&#x27;t immediate, but over time, I feel like my skin has improved slightly from using the mask (mainly in that my skin feels a lot smoother and healthier). I feel like the effects are kind of minimal though compared to some of the masks I&#x27;ve used in the past (such as Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque). I usually use this mask about 2-3 times a week, and then I wash it off after 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I would improve about this mask is that I wish it would also shrink pores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay masque. It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up my acne, but it does clean my skin and leave it soft. I actually like the smell of this one more than the Clay Avocado and Oatmeal masque. The blue color scared my husband and my poor dog must&#x27;ve thought an intruder came in his house.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample pack of this from a retailer and decided to get the larger bottle after that. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It leaves my face feeling smooth and refreshed. I love this mask.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything particularly great about this product; it&#x27;s a pretty standard clay mask. It does leave skin feeling smoother, but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement from using this.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mask for weekly use. I use it before showering about once a week. I like the smell, and it comes out kind of slimy and rubs thin on the face. Its consistency makes it easy to rub around. It then dries quickly, and washes off easily. It leaves my face feeling smooth, but not dried out. (However, it is cheaper on Freeman&#x27;s website or other online drug stores.)</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It works well, I feel very refreshed after I use it and it is a really pretty blue! Freeman are the best masks I can find for a good price I can&#x27;t buy them anywhere around here so with free shipping it&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful replacement for a old mask that I used to use  which is unavailable now, it feels great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool. Makes my face soft afterwards but that&#x27;s what all masks should do. Like that it makes my face blue. Just a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several similar mud masks before, so I expected this one to be like all the others.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  The smell is much more nice in this one, and it squeezes out of the tube and smoothes over the skin so easily!  I wash my face first, then squeeze a quarter sized amount out of the tube and it easily spreads across my entire face - this mask is very fun to use.  I was surprised by how bright green it is! After that, I chill out for a while and do something else.  As I relax, I feel the mask get firmer on my face. It tightens up a lot so that I can feel it working.  I wait about 5 minutes, then I rinse it off with water and a washcloth.  One thing I LOVE about this mask compared to all other like it, is how much easier this one is to rinse off.  After I rinse it off, I apply my usual nightly (Paula&#x27;s Choice) AHA lotion, then moisturizer.  I feel like this mask 1. makes an extra supple, clean, and soft surface for moisturizer to smooth on afterwards, and 2. clears out my pores with regular use.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this face make. It smells gorgeous, it applies nice and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t take long to try so its nice even if you can barely find the time for a mask. I&#x27;ve used several face masks and this is by far the BEST!</li>
    <li> This mask took away my redness and my skin is sooo free and airy! Its so refreshing. BUT I bought this product from an Ulta nearby but could&#x27;ve bought it from Walmart etc. for WAY LESS. I got it for $3.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the color is another thing its so cool! A bright turquoise color, so pretty</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels after using it.</li>
    <li> I like this mask except it is super blue and has artificial colors in it.</li>
    <li> My face is tighhhhht! It&#x27;s smooth and looks healthier. I think it works!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find mud masks anywhere anymore. Needed some stuff for a weekend campout with girls so I bought a bunch of different kind here. Not the best value but I needed clay masks.</li>
    <li> This is so relaxing, and takes up most of my blackheads while being gentle. I love the color, and the container is very nice as well. The shipping was prompt. I am very happy with this!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!! And it works well :)</li>
    <li> not too messy, washes off easily&lt;br /&gt;And leaves my face smooth.</li>
    <li> This made my skin so soft :)</li>
    <li> Liked this mask a lot. its a relaxing different mask color as ususally i hav seen only brown or mud color masks. it smells good too&lt;br /&gt;i like to smear it on clean face/neck when soakin in tub, or when relaxing in a chair. I let it dry for like 15 min and hop in the shower. its bit diffi to remove all traces of mask so i prefer a hot shower. it does make my face more fresh, appear clean ..</li>
    <li> Occasionally felt like burning on the sensitive skin on my cheeks, but overall its a decent product.  I wouldn&#x27;t rave about it, but it does the job.  I never noticed too drastic of a difference in my skin though</li>
    <li> Awesome smell, great for shrinking pores, drying pimples etc. I&#x27;m in love 😍 spa in a tube xD</li>
    <li> This mask smells calming like the sea.  It&#x27;s smooth to put on and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess while taking it off. Your face feels clean, fresh and ready for the morning!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty basic clay masque. It absorbs oil, tightens pores, and feels cool and refreshing on the skin. I like the scent, but something in this burns my face. I have to blow dry the masque once its on because for as long as it is wet, my face feels like it is on fire. Long term benefits of this are minimal for me. I don&#x27;t see improvement in my acne or overall complexion and my skin is as oily as ever the day after. Overall a decent mask, but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and I LOVE it! It smells great, and really leaves my skin feeling amazing. I haven&#x27;t ordered it off of Amazon though, it&#x27;s like 3-4 dollars at Walmart or Meijers</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft after I use it. and it&#x27;s even good to use once a week. be careful with the blue clay though, it can make a mess!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t understand why this product and other freeman products have such good ratings? It made my skin dry and itchy. Also, whenever I was waiting for it to dry, my eyes couldn&#x27;t stop tearing...I must be allergic to some ingredients in freeman products, I tried avocado &amp; oatmeal one, my skin and eyes had the same reaction! I basically can&#x27;t use it anymore, it was just so unbearable to use, very irritating to my skin and eyes (I know i need to avoid eye area, i know the instruction for using this kind of products, it still cause the tearing reaction)</li>
    <li> This mask cleanses the pores inside out and makes your skin feel radiant. The price is affordable too.You wont regret buying this.</li>
    <li> Received in great condition and I love this product. It makes your skin so so soft - it is great!</li>
    <li> PURCHASED FOR MY WIFE,WHO LOVES IT, I INDULGE MYSELF ONCE A WEEK AND USE IT BEFORE I SHOWER. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AND ENJOY.</li>
    <li> ok, i haven&#x27;t actually ordered this stuff out of Amazon yet, but i bought a package of this at Wal-mart. but, i LOVE this stuff!!!!! all the other face masks that i&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t worked or anything, and made my face feel dry and not good. but after I took this on, my skin looked great and FELT great, too! It felt moisturized and everything! when i first put it on it felt weird, almost like i was putting on paint, and it kind of smelled like paint, too. but real pretty color! altogether LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> If your a stay a home mom with a 2 year old this is a must have!! It truly is life changing and super inexpensive!! This does relief all stresses of life. It feels very cool and fresh on the face and comes off so easy leaving your skin smooth and fresh. What sets this product aside from the other mask for me, is you can use this more one then one time a week. It is definitely more cheaper if you just go to your local walmart, cvs, drugstore instead of buying it online and paying for shipping.  Oh by the way, wait until your face mask is completely dry on your skin to wash off to get a better results.</li>
    <li> This face mask smells really nice, applies very evenly, and has a beautiful color. I used a painting brush because I feel like it&#x27;s easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t make a mess. Anyhow, I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars because as soon as the clay dried out, my skin started to feel itchy. This didn&#x27;t affect my Husband. My skin did feel soft after rinsing it out but not as smooth as a peel off or the charcoal sugar mask. This mask was something nice and I will use it again because of the results I got.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling nice and soft after using.  I was a bit disappointed though, as I was expecting it to make my skin feel pleasantly tingly and cool when the mask was on, as other clay masks have.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, most likely.</li>
    <li> Great price works and I use it to help in the control of my son&#x27;s acne</li>
    <li> I love this mask! Its fun to put on, its dries fast, with no mess. It leaves my face super soft, clean and it literally takes that tired look right off my face. It even works for eye bags, if you have any. Great product cheap price. Love it !</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week and love it! Makes me face feel smooth and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> So good I need to reorder soon!</li>
    <li> if youre looking to get your face tighter and feeling really clean this product is for you, i use it once a week and its fantastic.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite of the trio.  I love the charcoal scrub and the cucumber one the best! This one I rarely go to! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great I just don&#x27;t feel like it does anything like I feel with the others. The charcoal one makes me feel like I&#x27;m sandblasting my face and the cucumber peel makes me feel like I&#x27;m peeling off all the dead skin and makes me shiny and new. This one is just nice to put on and wash off.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product a 5 star because it really does tighten and smooth the skin but, it is terrible for people with allergy eyes. The scent is supposed to be relaxing and therapeutic, but my eyes just watered and burned until it dried up.</li>
    <li> Totally love this stuff.  I use it once a week and my face feels soft and lovely.  I did find it at Kmart for 3.99 so if that&#x27;s an option you may want to check it out but it&#x27;s totally worth the money no matter the price.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty Freak! and this product for Me is great! I am mixed oily and dry fair skin. and doing this one every 2 weeks keep my face amazingly glowing. I Should do it one a week but I forget sometimes. jeje. But its great for a Spa Day with the girls.</li>
    <li> I had read a lot of good reviews on this facial mask, so I decided to try it out.....never again! After I rinsed off the mask my skin was ridiculously dry and flaky. (I have combination skin by the way) The extreme dryness caused me to breakout and it took a few days to get back to normal, so I don&#x27;t recommend this mask, the oatmeal one by freeman is wayyyy better.</li>
    <li> This is a great mask. It smells so good and really does help reduce oil and breakouts. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a lot because I love how much better I look after using it! It brightens my face and takes away redness and reduces the size of a pimple. (Great for those who like to pick at their face) If ya just gotta pick/pop/touch your face then wash your hands, then your face, then put the mask on for about fifteen minutes, wash it off with warm water, either use a tool or your clean fingers and do what you got to do.  (I found it useful for blackheads, they were practically falling out themselves). Now the key is to put the mask on AGAIN! Put the mask on again and it takes away any leftover dirt in your pores and gets rid of the redness and inflamation. Follow with your gentle face lotion. I will use the mask in the mornings befor make up or befor a shower at night. The smell is really fresh and I always get that one &amp;#34;I&#x27;m blue&amp;#34; song stuck in my head but best of all my consistent breakouts have cleared up since using this product for a month, but I am about due for another bottle I&#x27;m almost out. Hope this helps a few people.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  Immediately after rinsing off and for two days afterward my skin felt great.  It does remove any tiny blackheads as well.</li>
    <li> Nice mask. Doesn&#x27;t dry my face afterwards.</li>
    <li> I really liked this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get a little itchy after the first five minutes of having it on but i guess thats how it is suppose to be. Regardless it is really nice and makes my face a little smoother</li>
    <li> I like this mask, it is very good, it clarifies and brightens problematic skin types and it is very delicate to the all type of skin, i recommend you to try it , it is very safe</li>
    <li> I was looking for peel off mask, but just before buy it, I changed my mind and got this one, and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1X7WNC3EKR8Q2]]I wish things had worked out better! I took this video so you could see the redness of my face after using this product.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this from the Freeman web-store, I was never a face mask user.&lt;br /&gt;What made me decide to purchase this was that it was said to both unclog congested pores, while leaving skin moisturized. I have sensitive/combo skin so, this sounded like just the mask for me, and boy was I right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the blue colour of the mask put you off. Just apply a nice thin layer all over the face, make yourself either busy or comfortable while the mask dries completely, rinse off well, and enjoy skin that is super clean and feels so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this face mask once or twice a week, and it keeps my face from getting any dry/flaky patches, and helps keep oil/shine under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube container is great, because one can squeeze out only the amount they need, and it&#x27;s easy to tell when you have to buy more. Freeman products are difficult to find in stores in some areas, but their web-store stocks a great selection!</li>
    <li> Maybe it is a wonderful product for other people, but not for me. I got sensitive skin, which my face turned red after using it. I love the smell, but I will not use it again.</li>
    <li> I use this anti-stress mask about 1-2 times a month. It is particularly helpful for areas of my face where I tend to have enlarged pores (the triangle area around my nose and chin). I leave it on for 20 minutes and I do feel like I am pampering my skin and myself.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my acne but it make my skin feel tighter after using for a day or so.</li>
    <li> With an almost ocean blue color and no scent  that I could find this is a good mask. It dries fairly quick ,comes off easily , so if you have delicate or sensitive skin this should work for you.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s great for your skin it tightens the skin and keeps it soft too you should try it.</li>
    <li> When you first apply this product it feels amazing, it is instantly cooling and you are already feeling calmer. The consistancy of this product is thin but it does work wonderfully and i dont hace acne prone skin but it keeps my skin feeling tight and fresh and i would buy this again but not for what it does to my skin, just because it has a relaxing feeling.</li>
    <li> All of the masks you will find from Freeman are great, this one is especially handy for controlling acne. I hate to break it to those who actually thought they derived dead see minerals and packaged it at this low price, but the ingredients are very basic, but very effective. Kaolin clay, bentonite, lavender oil and burgamot oil. A very effective way of detoxifying your skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and it works well for me.  It unclogs my pores and makes it feel refreshed and smooth.  I love all of the Freeman products; they have something for every skin type.  I&#x27;ve been using their products for years, and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I Love the Freeman mud masks! Arrived Quickly and Works wonders.</li>
    <li> I think that I purchased the wrong mask, it is too dry for me, it maybe very good if you have oily skin. I did not notice any changes after use it, of cause each of us have different skin, we just have to keep trying to find the one is work for yourself!</li>
    <li> It makes your skin softer and makes pores smaller. I had huge pores on my cheeks and after one use they were significantly smaller. Also helped a little with blackheads but didn&#x27;t completely erase them. Very soothing and I would definitely recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> I love all things freeman, I have almost every  mask I can get my hands one because they work. This is nice, it really tightens my pores and seems to refresh as well. Really sucks out all the oil and the color is fun too.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone sensitive skin and have had no problems with this mask irritating my skin. I like to use it when I have acne flare ups, it decreases the redness and inflammation after the first use. .. not comlpletly gone but greatly improved. I put a thick layer all over my face and leave it on about 20min. It goes on smooth,  smells good and is a beautiful blue color. I highly recommend this product and any other freeman masks. Forever a fan</li>
    <li> I really like the thickness of the mask! It goes on more like a mud mask and has a beautiful blue color! I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all! It seems to even out my skin tone as well. I would definitely get this product again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a 16th birthday party. It was a hit! Since then, I&#x27;ve used it for any type of movie/makeover party the team I coach has. It&#x27;s fun and tingly!  It doesn&#x27;t really help acne or a dirty face. It just makes it feel smooth for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> One of there best masks!  Smells great and works well.  Since using all the Freeman masks, my face is smoothe, soft, and free of blackheads!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK- I&#x27;m not very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom of toddler twins and try to take a moment every day to do something for myself. I bought a few of these face masks thinking I could do one every night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;At first I liked putting the masks on, thinking that it might make me feel better about myself, but it doesn&#x27;t actually make me feel better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it until it&#x27;s gone but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;I do however like the pineapple face mask all the other ones are just okay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask several times, but only found it in the 1-time use packets at a local store. I was glad to finally see a larger amount offered. This mask is one of my favorites and I will be ordering again once I run out of product.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy this on amazon and I only bought it from a store one time because they were on sale, I haven&#x27;t found them again so I turned I amazon . Lo and behold they are here so I will begin to purchase off of amazon along with others because I really like this mask out of all tr other expensive brands I use and I usually only prefer peel off masks because they don&#x27;t burn like clay or just plain old facials but I love this one and my bottle is almost empty so I&#x27;m going to buy more to stock up on them!&lt;br /&gt;This mask makes me feel refreshed and calm and cleans up any acne/breakouts/blackheads/etc.... Immediately after letting it dry and it feels wonderful&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is cleaning it off because it&#x27;s annoying and stains the towel if you don&#x27;t immediately wash the mask off the towel but other than that I love this mask and will alway use it!</li>
    <li> its fake smell and color is disgusting  fake chemicals and poisins i threw it out i should have asked for a refund i didnt bother my fault for being stupid  always order real natural bodycare products  supporting this stuff only encourages more  buy organic and all pure 100%  demand it and prices will drop due to competition thats how we can change things</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It works as promised, does not take too long to dry and is not tested on animals. All of Freeman&#x27;s masks are great but this is one of the best. Highly recommended, yes it does smell a bit but it is not that bad.</li>
    <li> I would probably get this just for the smell. But it does actually work great for my face. It isn&#x27;t greasy or anything like that. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help my acne either, but it *does* moisturize my skin really well for about a week. Then I have to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I use lotion on my face every day, but it just seems to get soaked up better after having used this. Not sure how or why it works, but it does, and I&#x27;m going to continue using it as I&#x27;m really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mud mask I&#x27;ve ever tried. Makes my skin feel so clean!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, but this product was watery and not as thick as tubes I have purchased in the past... Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Freeman line of products and decided to try a variety.  This mask is rich and soothing.  Most mud masks are the same, and this one isn&#x27;t all that different, but the price is nice and the quality is up there with any other more expensive brand.  I just wish Amazon help their full line and offered free Super Saver Shipping</li>
    <li> Love this simple mask :) fresh face...fresh me</li>
    <li> burnt my face dryed it out stick to clinique soap</li>
    <li> Love this mask for my combination skin type! it really helps balance my skin from excess oils and purges the pores. Also lasts a LONG time, seriously! I&#x27;ve been using this 2 times a week for 6 months and there&#x27;s still a lot left. Also love the smell, texture and the turquoise color!</li>
    <li> I want so badly to like this mask... I LOVE all of the other Freeman&#x27;s products that I have purchased throughout the years! I don&#x27;t consider my skin super sensitive, but... every time I use this mask, I BREAK OUT ALL OVER MY FACE!! At first I thought that maybe it was just a coincidence... but I&#x27;ve used it several times, spread out throughout the last few months. It only happens after I use this mask.  :(  Bummer!!</li>
    <li> Keeps skin clear when used regularly.  It is messy and has to be washed off.  More trouble than a mask that dries and will peel off.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the color! Makes my skin feel great.</li>
</ol>
