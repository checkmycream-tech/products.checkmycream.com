      <li>so I figure its OK.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good product i did notice a difference in my blemishes.</li>
      <li>My skin looks more radiant and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts which is amazing!</li>
      <li>All you have to do is take them with a glass a warm water right before you go to bed.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to take (just one per day) and does not give me any side effects nor upset stomach.  </li>
      <li>These pills are easy to take.</li>
      <li>Super value for a one month supply!</li>
      <li>Yes, I&#x27;m writing this review to get the free bottle, but I wouldn&#x27;t even want a free bottle if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I am 100% satisfied and couldn&#x27;t be more greatful for a clear face:)</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 2 months and my face has completely changed for the good.</li>
      <li>First I love this product.</li>
      <li>After I finished the bottle, my face improved significantly.</li>
      <li>i used to have so many breakouts on my face - mainly on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I have went through one bottle of this and my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
      <li>My face seemed to clear up and not have so many bumps.</li>
      <li>It took about two weeks to start working, so don&#x27;t be worried if they don&#x27;t work right away.</li>
      <li>This came at the right time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s counter intuitive, but just letting my face keep more of its natural oils and treating instead from the inside with this product has really helped.</li>
      <li>and I gained almost 5 pounds in the first week after beginning this.  </li>
      <li>My face is definitely clearing up better since I started taking these pills.</li>
      <li>The pain and redness went away the day after I took the first one.</li>
      <li>I tried these supplements for an entire month, and I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
      <li>i am definitely buying more of these pills.</li>
      <li>but it seems to really work!</li>
      <li>The first two weeks I broke out</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking what do I have to lose and after a good 11 days of religiously taking this at bedtime, my major acne spots on my cheeks are clear.</li>
      <li>I am going to switch to pure burt&#x27;s bees acne line though if these pills continue to work.</li>
      <li>I got it as a gift--and the recipient has noticed a great improvement already, and it has only been used for a few days.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t do much for oily skin</li>
      <li>At the beginning I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>My skin is better with less inflamation and pimple.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that has this need.</li>
      <li>But all in all made it look  a little better.</li>
      <li>It was easy to swallow and did help clear my skin up  a little better but not completely or the new forming acne for me.  </li>
      <li>First Month: Reduced about 30% of acne, didn&#x27;t see much progress until the third week.</li>
      <li>They are normal sized.</li>
      <li>Seller, please reply to my review and let me know this is normal.</li>
      <li>No more acne:)</li>
      <li>my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
      <li>Along with keeping properly hydrated, and properly cleansing, this product is a significant help for anyone that has issues with acne.</li>
      <li>After taking it a few more times, the acne spot became barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>i can hardly wait for the month to end so that i can see even better improvement.  </li>
      <li>A couple days before these arrived, a cystic acne spot developed on my jawline.</li>
      <li>I am 28 yrs old and have struggled with acne since age at age 22.</li>
      <li>My face is soft..</li>
      <li>At first i started to break out more, but i think that is because my black heads and small zits had finally come up because now i don&#x27;t have as many small bumps and the acne</li>
      <li>My ever present cysts have reduced about 50% in a short amount of time and my skin seems a little more soothed.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any new cystic acne develop since starting it, so</li>
      <li>I used this product in combination with topical&#x27;s :Clear Skin Aloe Cleanser, Clear Skin Cleaning pads, and spot</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping this next month will make it clear if this product is truly working for my skin.</li>
      <li>Not only am I not recommending this product, I am also seeking it to be removed completely.</li>
      <li>Forewarning, I think possible my skin got a bit worse before getting better.  </li>
      <li>but when you are a full grown adult, its even worse.</li>
      <li>It was very painful and very bright red.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First Month: Reduced about 30% of acne, didn&#x27;t see much progress until the third week. I have sever acne on my back too, it seems to have reduced minutely. But hey, I&#x27;ll take it. I used this product in combination with topical&#x27;s :Clear Skin Aloe Cleanser, Clear Skin Cleaning pads, and spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Month: My second order. The pill is now white instead of red... anyone else have this happen? I&#x27;ve seen this done with other vitamins so I figure its OK.  I guess I&#x27;ll be the guinea pig and find out. Seller, please reply to my review and let me know this is normal.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for such a long time that it feels as though it now defines me. I have cried many tears because of my acne suffering and frustration having had tried everything. However since I have started using acne advantage my acne is almost completely gone! Now that my problem of acne is over because of this  product I now only need to concentrate on fading my past acne scars! I had never had such an improvement until now.</li>
    <li> I actually think this has helped!  I don&#x27;t have the skin of a model, but it is looking better</li>
    <li> First I love this product. I am 28 yrs old and have struggled with acne since age at age 22. I went to the dermatologist and was diagnosed with cyst acne and received creams and antibiotics that didn&#x27;t work. I bought this thinking what do I have to lose and after a good 11 days of religiously taking this at bedtime, my major acne spots on my cheeks are clear. I can&#x27;t wait to see after taking this product will do after 30 days.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after a couple weeks. My face looked smoother, less blackheads, less red. I was really skeptical at first but it seems to really work! Even if I take it every other day it works well. I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks. My skin is better with less inflamation and pimple.</li>
    <li> It is not helpful for me.</li>
    <li> I tried these supplements for an entire month, and I am thoroughly pleased. It took about two weeks to start working, so don&#x27;t be worried if they don&#x27;t work right away. After I finished the bottle, my face improved significantly. I am going to purchase another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I really love this, because it works!  I am on my 3rd month of this.  I ran out and my face started breaking out after a week.  I had also tried out a lot of other supplements too, none of them worked as well as this one,</li>
    <li> I have been taking these acne advantage pills for about 2 weeks now and I am already starting to see a difference in my skin. My skin looks more radiant and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts which is amazing! I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference in my current acne breakouts but it has only been two weeks since I started taking it. Overall I&#x27;m quite impressed and I&#x27;ll definitely be adding this to my skin care regiment. I received this item at a discounted rate in return for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good product. It contains stuff that should minimize oil production. Definitely saw an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Super value for a one month supply! So easy to just take one capsule per day, and keep the acne away! Along with keeping properly hydrated, and properly cleansing, this product is a significant help for anyone that has issues with acne. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has this need. I got it as a gift--and the recipient has noticed a great improvement already, and it has only been used for a few days. Thanks so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic seller! Excellent communication, and Super fast shipping-got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!! Thank you!! :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product changed my acne at all, however, there were good vitamins in it. Worked better as a multivitamin than an acne supplement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it for a month and it has not made any difference.</li>
    <li> I have went through one bottle of this and my face has cleared up tremendously. At first i started to break out more, but i think that is because my black heads and small zits had finally come up because now i don&#x27;t have as many small bumps and the acne is clearing as well as the dark spots from them! will definitely keep using considering I have had acne since middle school and I am currently in college. To note: i am also using x-out and burt&#x27;s bees spot treatment and lotion. I am going to switch to pure burt&#x27;s bees acne line though if these pills continue to work.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical since it is not a cream that you put on the acne . It was easy to swallow and did help clear my skin up  a little better but not completely or the new forming acne for me.  But all in all made it look  a little better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a little it of difference. My ever present cysts have reduced about 50% in a short amount of time and my skin seems a little more soothed. I will keep using and update if there are any more changes! I like that they are a healthy alternative to all of the junk out there!&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discount in exchange for my review.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product...Only change in my diet and I gained almost 5 pounds in the first week after beginning this.  I stopped taking, and lost the weight...</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  But this stuff works. Literally 90% of my acne is gone. The remaining 10% is 90% less severe. Incredible.  Yes, I&#x27;m writing this review to get the free bottle, but I wouldn&#x27;t even want a free bottle if it didn&#x27;t work.  Right!?!?!?  If you have difficult acne, get this stuff.</li>
    <li> No result, nothing! Do not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> This product is easy to take (just one per day) and does not give me any side effects nor upset stomach.  I think it is helping my acne, although I have only been taking it for 4 weeks.  Forewarning, I think possible my skin got a bit worse before getting better.  The first two weeks I broke out and I think my skin was cleansing.  The last two weeks my skin has been way above average and I have ordered more.  One other things I have tried which also seems to be helping are using less products on my face such as toners and spot treatments that dried out individual blemishes.  I also stopped washing my face unless showering.  It&#x27;s counter intuitive, but just letting my face keep more of its natural oils and treating instead from the inside with this product has really helped.</li>
    <li> At the beginning I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. It says once a day but I did it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. My face seemed to clear up and not have so many bumps. I finished my bottle and now that I have had it for a few days, my face started to break out again. So I am going to continue a longer trial this time and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical I&#x27;ll admit but my acne has actually started healing up and not breaking out since I started use of this product. I&#x27;m really happy. I was hesitant to try it after seeing some reviews from customers claiming you&#x27;ll gain weight or it will lower your sugar levels- I haven&#x27;t had any of that happen, thankfully. I recommend this product to anyone suffering with acne so they can start to feel better about themselves and their skin. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!! It&#x27;s make me happy! No more acne:)</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps my face at bay from acne.  My skin looks nice and smooth.  My face is soft..it doesn&#x27;t do much for oily skin</li>
    <li> Son is taking these and have noticed less redness in his face. No new breakouts since he has been on this. Cant wait to see what it will do for him in a months time! I received this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product i did notice a difference in my blemishes. I had a few minor pimples but nothing drastic.</li>
    <li> This product dropped my sugar levels to dangerous levels. Not only once but 5 times in a 2 week period. I almost had seizures because of it. Not only am I not recommending this product, I am also seeking it to be removed completely. It&#x27;s dangerous, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This came at the right time. A couple days before these arrived, a cystic acne spot developed on my jawline. It was very painful and very bright red. I started taking these the night they arrived. The pain and redness went away the day after I took the first one. After taking it a few more times, the acne spot became barely noticeable. My face is definitely clearing up better since I started taking these pills. These pills are easy to take. They are normal sized. All you have to do is take them with a glass a warm water right before you go to bed. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last month and I haven&#x27;t had any new cystic acne develop since starting it, so that&#x27;s encouraging. I&#x27;m hoping this next month will make it clear if this product is truly working for my skin.</li>
    <li> i have been battling with bad acne for 3 years... acne is always embarrassing at any age but when you are a full grown adult, its even worse. i started taking these pills about 2 weeks ago and i can already notice the difference with my acne. i used to have so many breakouts on my face - mainly on my cheeks. now, i&#x27;m getting almost no new break outs. my family and friends have noticed this improvement. i have tried antibiotics and many o.t.c products; i have also tried changing my diet but none of those things worked for me. i love the fact that you only have to take one pill at night and also that these pills have basically good vitamins and ceramides that i have read about to be great for the skin (all in one pill). i can hardly wait for the month to end so that i can see even better improvement.  i am definitely buying more of these pills.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a miracle product or anything but it has definitely helped minimize the amount of acne I get. I&#x27;ve also noticed a little less redness around the acne. I plan on continuing to use this product and will submit an update in another month!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 months and my face has completely changed for the good. I am 100% satisfied and couldn&#x27;t be more greatful for a clear face:)</li>
</ol>
