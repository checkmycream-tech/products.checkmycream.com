      <li>It helps clear up my skin, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave soapy residue.</li>
      <li>You easily get accustomed to the way this face wash leaves your face</li>
      <li>Years ago i tried many cleansers including clarins, clinique, OCM and many others without success.</li>
      <li>I bought a full size bottle and love it.</li>
      <li>my face looks and feels great, it leaves your face feeling fresh and not tight like most others do.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for about six years and it has been wonderful for sensitive skin--left it feeling clean without being drying and so gentle that I could use it to remove mascara.  </li>
      <li>The products are precisely described.</li>
      <li>this is no longer my primary wash.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product and brand.  </li>
      <li>is amazing for clean the face gently.</li>
      <li>great facial wash that rinses clean.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is very gentle to your skin, I love it.  </li>
      <li>After about two weeks I saw a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, it smells great</li>
      <li>/&gt;This prevents any extra oil build up from the start, being a clear not creamy face wash, and my makeup always stays on perfectly placed and not caked.</li>
      <li>There is nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin oil free throughout the day which has really helped with my breakouts!!  </li>
      <li>Love this product has really cleared up my pores</li>
      <li>My face feels clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t believe how lucky i&#x27;ve been to find this product on the shelves of a chemist.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 32 weeks pregnant</li>
      <li>will definitely buy more!</li>
      <li>It leaves your face, clean, very smooth and not dry.  </li>
      <li>, I just love how refreshing and soothing it feels and the bottle has a fabulous little Sci-Fi / fancy opening which is neat</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s proven worth</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this in my ipsy glam bag and loved it so much that I actually cancelled my proactiv membership and switched to this product instead.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s one of the rare face washes that does not contain soup.</li>
      <li>This keeps my face clear better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>This really makes my face feel as if I dunked it into a cool, tranquil and mineral rich turquoise sea and it washes out any bits of morning slept in impurity while still maintaining very soft and comfortable skin which is rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>best thing about it is that it also works on my body acne and it has helped my back and buttocks to be less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more than I wanted to spend initially</li>
      <li>I have used it for about a week and really like it!  </li>
      <li>I really recommend it and definitively I will buy it again!</li>
      <li>Exactly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a face cleanser made in my country for the last 10 years, however we are going through severe shortages of many products and i couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
      <li>It has become my favorite and the only face wash</li>
      <li>Perfect for my difficult, oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even use a moisturizer after I wash my face because this really feels like it cleanses and moisturizes all in one!  </li>
      <li>I saw a difference in the first week.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is very good to clean your skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> Very gentle but cleans really well.  I also love the way this spells like chanel products.  But WITHOUT the irritation.  Its an awesome cleanser.  I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> A few things about my skin before I review the product... I have combination skin. As the day progresses the oil gets worse... It also dries every time I wash it and I usually follow up with a moisturizer. I also have occasional breakouts and light acne on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product... After using it for a 2 months, my acne is still the same, my skin still gets oily as the day progresses, and still dries out after every wash. What I did notice though is dry patchy skin begin to form in my cheek area as well as next to my nose. Once I realized that it was from the lack of exfoliation, I went back to my old cleanser (Neutrogena oil free acne wash pink grapefruit scrub- it has exfoliating beads).&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is smooth and washes off my eye make up nicely (concealer, mascara, eye liner, brow powder).&lt;br /&gt;So this is no longer my primary wash. There is nothing special about it. I just use it at the end of the day to wash off my make up before I go to bed. Honestly, this is comparable to a bar of dove soap... Exactly. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Really nice product, gentle and good. I really recommend it and definitively I will buy it again! It is water-based and recommended by a bunch of dermatologists!</li>
    <li> This is the best face soap ever, it&#x27;s so thick you only need a few drops each time, and it cleared my teenage daughters skin like nothing else,and its not really designed to control acne, absolutely recommend it</li>
    <li> excelent product for the face</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now and I like it very much.  It leaves my face feeling clean without leaving a thight, dry sense.</li>
    <li> Overall a great product and brand.  I bought this brand of lotion a while ago and decided to give the face wash a try.  I have used it for about a week and really like it!  Skin has cleared up a bit, but it does seem to be a little drying.... Fairly common issue for me with any face wash though.  Just added some moisturizer and seems to be working out perfectly.  I will definitely buy this product again.  My new go to face wash!  I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is our family&#x27;s face soap!  We don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> For someone with dry skin this is perfect for a gel type cleanser. I prefer cream or oil cleansers, but for a gel type this is good, not too drying and does a good job on mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and this cosmetic brand \\&quot;Avene\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Since 2011 i&#x27;m buying creams, gel cleaner and everything is&lt;br /&gt;working for \\&quot;10\\&quot;...  i totally recommend this product for&lt;br /&gt;person with acne disease!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about six years and it has been wonderful for sensitive skin--left it feeling clean without being drying and so gentle that I could use it to remove mascara.  However, my recent order was drying and I could no longer use it on my eyes.  I compared the ingredients on the new bottle with the old one and found a slight change.  I will enjoy what&#x27;s left of the bottle with the original formula while on the search for something new...</li>
    <li> great facial wash that rinses clean. i use it as my second wash after i use an oil cleanser to remove all my make up. my face is left fresh, soft, and make up free.</li>
    <li> I think I bought the wrong product cause this seriously dries out my skin. Also, when I first bought it I broke out a little..but I think that was cause I used my moisturizer too soon after...but of course I would seeing as it caused massive dryness. Beyond that, it&#x27;s been a month since I bought it and I AM seeing improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s softer/smoother and my acne is clearing up little by little. I will buy from them again once it&#x27;s done, but the one for dry sensitive skin next time. I&#x27;ll give it three star for the massive dry-spell it casts on me. For the next product if it works better I shall increase my rating. If this begins to turn on me halfway through like other products I&#x27;ll come back and lower my rating.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It helps clear up my skin, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave soapy residue. Not super overpriced, either.</li>
    <li> Alright, I have heard many &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; things about this product and I read the reviews. I ordered it and payed, etc, and after just 3 days of using it, it has dryed my skin, my sides have begun to peel, and it leaves everything dry. My skin is prone to be both oily and dry depending on the weather, but it was NOT peeling until I started using this stupid product. It met none of my expectations or the expectations it was supposed to meet. Thank god I have long, thick hair, so no one can notice the sides of my face PEELING. My chin, on the other hand, is going to be harder to hide. All in all, if I could rate this product a 0/5, I would. Don&#x27;t recommend for anyone, especially if you have my skin type</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders for my skin. I was having trouble with acne and a friend recommended this product along with the clarifying lotion. After about two weeks I saw a significant improvement in my skin. High recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! Great for my oily/ blemish prone skin but doesn&#x27;t leave a sheen on my skin after using like some acne washes. Face is much clearer and smoother after using this for a couple of weeks. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product works very well for my 16 year old daughter. It has cleared up her acne and she is very happy.</li>
    <li> This is really great product. A friend of mine who is a Dr. had suggested this cleanser to me and it does work best for me. 1 week into using this product i can see some great results. Fast shipping from this seller too. Thanks you.</li>
    <li> I GUESS I HAVE BEEN MISTREATING MY SKIN ALL OF THESE YEARS WASHING IT WITH SOAP CLEANSERS.  THEY LEAVE MY SKIN RED AND IRRITATED.  THIS CLEANSER CLEANS BEAUTIFULLY, CUTTING THROUGH MAKE-UP AND DEBRIS WITH EASE.  AND IT LEAVES MY SKIN CLEAN BUT CLEAR WITH NO IRRITATION.  AFTER TRYING IT I ORDERED ANOTHER FIVE BOTTLES.  I NEVER WANT TO BE WITHOUT IT.  WOW!  I THOUGHT WASHING YOUR FACE WAS JUST IRRITATING--NO MORE.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smooth to the face but a deep cleanser at the same time. Using twice a day gives you the impression of clean face all day long.</li>
    <li> Love it for my face. It lasts for almost one year. Will definitely buy it again. For mixed skin type.</li>
    <li> I think I have finally found my holy grail cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and it really does a great job. I doesn&#x27;t strip my skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and is gentle enough to use around the eye area for scrubbing off eye makeup. Love!</li>
    <li> you only need a couple of drops.  It leaves your face, clean, very smooth and not dry.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast and reliable delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this company. The products are precisely described.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product in Paris. Forgot my face wash and picked this up at a pharmacy. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in my ipsy glam bag and loved it so much that I actually cancelled my proactiv membership and switched to this product instead.  This keeps my face clear better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I can&#x27;t really say, why it works so well. There really isn&#x27;t anything fancy in the ingredients, but it works. I&#x27;m 30 and have mild adult acne, I have used hundreds of different products trying to keep my skin clear. This stuff does the trick. I got a sample in an Ipsy box and it cleared my skin up in a weeks time. I bought a full size bottle and love it. My skin is normal, not oily, not dry. I hope it keeps working!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very gentle to your skin, I love it.  I use it at night to wash my face and it makes my face very clean.</li>
    <li> Lovely cleanser, does not dry out skin, soft on my sensitive skin, but deep cleansing! Long lasting clean feeling. Definite reduction in break-outs. Love it!</li>
    <li> Super amazing product it&#x27;s one of the rare face washes that does not contain soup. Make sure you use moisturizer afterwards, it won&#x27;t dry you out but It&#x27;ll leave your face feeling firm and tight. This is great for acne and oily skin. Love this product has really cleared up my pores</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product consistently for several years. I took one star off for the price, but this is the only face wash that keeps my face clear. It also seems to cut the oil, without overly drying out my face.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, it works as advertised, helps you clean your face and maintain it nice. I would really recommend it if you have some sort of acne problem.</li>
    <li> This is the cleanser I have been searching for since I was a teenager!  Perfect for my difficult, oily skin.  No more break outs!  I saw a difference in the first week.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Soap-free, but with wonderful scent and pleasant foaming qualities. Not overly drying for my combination skin. I use it with my Clarisonic about 4 times a week and my skin has never been better. I got hooked on this when I lived in France and am happy to be able to order it in the States.</li>
    <li> my daughter and I use this every day to control our acne. great product.</li>
    <li> Ill likely never use anything else</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser and you only need a small amount - a bottle lasts me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for at least 8 months and I am only on my second bottle, only because the last of the first bottle got spilled. It seems a little pricey but a tiny drop goes a long way and lasts a very long time. It deep cleans my sensitive, acne prone skin without drying and is a very gentle gel. I use this instead of the acne cleanser in my 3 step system because it cleans much better. Amazing! A+! Recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> The product is ok.  Really didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> This face wash is fantastic especially in the summer. I remember reading so many beauty articles that said how important it is to wash with a clear face washes ( as opposed to creamy, thick ones) in the morning especially when it’s warm to help combat perspiration, oils slicks etc. This really makes my face feel as if I dunked it into a cool, tranquil and mineral rich turquoise sea and it washes out any bits of morning slept in impurity while still maintaining very soft and comfortable skin which is rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This prevents any extra oil build up from the start, being a clear not creamy face wash, and my makeup always stays on perfectly placed and not caked. My boyfriend also likes to use it so it’s for anyone really, I just love how refreshing and soothing it feels and the bottle has a fabulous little Sci-Fi / fancy opening which is neat and it lasts quite a bit. This wash is thicker than it looks so I get to enjoy it for a few months per bottle. I adore Avene and I haven’t used a product yet that doesn’t impress. The mineral rich thermal waters that their cosmetics are based on are truly healing and wonderful for the skin, I’ve been a fan for a bit now, can’t wait to see what else they come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff can be used in the morning or at night, it’s a very versatile and soothing product with wonderful purifying and calming qualities and it smells divine and not fake, like a raging sea in a bottle full of skin loving nutrition, one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Kasia S.</li>
    <li> Really great cleansing option if you prefer a gel wash. It helps reduce oil build up and breakouts but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. It&#x27;s taken me a long time to track something down that works well for combination skin. Sadly, I am going through it quickly. With twice daily use, the bottle is lasting somewhere around 2 months or less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a face cleanser made in my country for the last 10 years, however we are going through severe shortages of many products and i couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. Years ago i tried many cleansers including clarins, clinique, OCM and many others without success. They&#x27;ll all break me out and give me huge pores, oily face and dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how lucky i&#x27;ve been to find this product on the shelves of a chemist. It was the only face cleanser i’ve seen in months and it had an affordable price so i decided it to give it a try. I had some acne and horrible huge pores at the time (from using a cetaphil soap bar i found). A few days later my pores were back to normal and my face was not so oily anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to make sure you don&#x27;t over do it though. I started washing my face 2-3 times a day with this product (we&#x27;ve had very hot days lately +40C so my make up literally melts) and i ended up with very sensitive dry skin, i then reduced the frequency and quantity i used (you just need to use a tiny bit) and voilà! perfect again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about it is that it also works on my body acne and it has helped my back and buttocks to be less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say i went back after 5 days and bought all the 6 bottles they had in stock, just in case i don&#x27;t find it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recomended!</li>
    <li> Excellent item, I used everyday. One of the best out there in the market. It works and it does what it says.</li>
    <li> all the thing is prefect about this product</li>
    <li> For those who have oily skin like me,&lt;br /&gt;This soap is very bom.Deixa facial skin clean and suave.Nào lather.&lt;br /&gt;When I go I get a feeling of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Best face cleaner I&#x27;ve ever used. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very nice effective cleanser. Isn&#x27;t excessively foamy. A little bit goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin either too dry or with that feeling of a slight film left behind. It&#x27;s a bit more than I wanted to spend initially but it&#x27;s proven worth it so will buy again.</li>
    <li> Recomended by my dermatologist, soap free and it never leaves my face feeling dry. I believe this is meant for acne, but I don&#x27;t have acne.</li>
    <li> Mi medico lo receto para seguir tratamiento topico contra el acne y ha funcionado muy bien en combinacion con algunos otros productos. para limpiar el rostro es muy bueno!</li>
    <li> I just love this product. I doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, it smells great and I feel refreshed every time I use it! I think that this is the best product I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> It has become my favorite and the only face wash I use now. It is gentle and takes off make up completely. At first I was a bit skeptical because it has no exfoliating beads &amp; I am a someone who used to exfoliate every day with a facial puff and well...now I don&#x27;t see the need to scrub off 2 layers of skin every day lol. I just use this &amp; my face looks and feels great, it leaves your face feeling fresh and not tight like most others do. I can even skip moisturizer if I really wanted to. It helps out with my occasional breakouts too, I left behind a bottle of this stuff and tried some other face wash...oh no biggest mistake! You easily get accustomed to the way this face wash leaves your face (you think that all face washes will too) Had to buy another bottle asap!</li>
    <li> This is the best face cleanser/wash I have found. Soapless and non-oily. Works really good with my skin.</li>
    <li> I have combinnation skin and this product works great.  My face feels clean and fresh.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out.  I use this everyday.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Takes very little to cleanse and is extremely concentrated! This product produces results!</li>
    <li> It is the second time i bought this, and with that i say a lot. is amazing for clean the face gently.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this face wash in my Etsy bag and LOVED it!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to order it.  I had tried SEVERAL expensive brands from high end retail stores and I didn&#x27;t get the results that I had with this one!!  Im 30 years old and I have oily/combination skin and big pores. I&#x27;m 32 weeks pregnant so I&#x27;ve been dealing with excessive oiliness along with some hormonal breakouts.  I use this face wash with my clarisonic and LOVE IT!!!  After I use it my face feels so smooth and clean with no residue or over drying!!  It helps keep my skin oil free throughout the day which has really helped with my breakouts!!  I don&#x27;t even use a moisturizer after I wash my face because this really feels like it cleanses and moisturizes all in one!  If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable face wash that gets the job done you have got to give this one a try!!  Not to mention,it takes such a small amount because it&#x27;s a gel. A little goes a long way!  I probably use a dime size when I was my face!</li>
    <li> Miracle wash... never going back to my old cleanser again.</li>
    <li> I thought my face was oily, but I guess it&#x27;s not oily enough? I get normal stress pimples every now and then, usually around my chin, and this did nothing to clear those up. It also totally dried out parts of my face, especially around the bottom/sides of my nose. I used Cerave moisturizer and that still did nothing. It seems to work for a lot of people, but was a total miss for me.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th bottle!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Last a year each one. I used just a little bit to clean my face daily x 2&lt;br /&gt;Avéne is not very popular here in US but is an excellente brand/ product&lt;br /&gt;Also I use the solar protection line and always the best results&lt;br /&gt;My dr. Dermatologist recomend me the brand. Since then i start trying other products.</li>
