<li> I admittedly didn&#x27;t do that because I desperately wanted to clear up some spots before an upcoming interview.</li>
<li> After at least two days of this the pimple is almost gone!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and I apply a small amount to each angry pimple I have in the morning before work.</li>
<li> This product helps to mask even the worst pimples within hours.</li>

    <li> Picture makes item look bigger and it really is</li>
    <li> Better than Proactive!</li>
    <li> Best acne treatment around! Works very quickly on problem areas and on all types of skin! Our family info girls - ages 11,  15, 16, and 27 couldn&#x27;t live without this product! Great line!</li>
    <li> This product made my face itchy. I must have had some sort of reaction to one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> It works for my acne! But sometimes my face get red and hot, and it causes peeling, seems like allergy. So make sure you are not allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide!</li>
    <li> It works  but in 3 days</li>
    <li> Murad product always pass the test. Purchased this for my young teenage son, I&#x27;ll just say it cleared his face and he&#x27;s face is looking lovely. I was kind of upset when they changed the formula but this works. I got this and the face wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Murad system for years to great results. Ordered more of the spot treatment and noticed that the packaging was different along with the scent of the liquid. Every time I use this I wake up with red, warm splotches on my face exactly where this was applied - essentially like getting sunburn without even going in the sun! Don&#x27;t know exactly what they changed, but something is very wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage son and it works really well.I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well &amp; it smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! I&#x27;ve also had the same little bottle forever, because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am always glad to grab it for less than in the store.</li>
    <li> Works you just need to apply it on 3 times daily on your problem area! I would only suggested to some one  that has occasional break outs! But overall great product.</li>
    <li> Murad advises testing this on your skin (like on your arm) before using the product on your face. I admittedly didn&#x27;t do that because I desperately wanted to clear up some spots before an upcoming interview. What this product did was bring my submerged blemishes to the surface so that they could be released. It did this fairly quickly, too. For those blemishes that were on the lighter and smaller side, however, it actually burnt my skin - the product left red marks on my face that went away after 3-4 days after I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I noticed that this product tends to cause my skin to toughen up wherever its applied - like dry, hardened leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff might work well for folks with hearty skin, or perhaps for teenagers who need stronger doses. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have pretty sensitive skin. This one wasn&#x27;t the product for me, but I hope it helps others!!</li>
    <li> So I have been using Murad for over 16 years now and LOVED their Acne Spot Treatment (2 % Sulfur treatment). This is made with benzyol peroxide which has NEVER made a difference for me in my acne treatment. It really saddens me that Murad doesn&#x27;t give you the option to choose. While the bezyol peroxide might work for some it will NOT work for all.</li>
    <li> did not make any difference at all</li>
    <li> This product is so perfumie it makes me sneeze just to wear it and that&#x27;s just only a dab.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin and acne</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Will keep in my list always!</li>
    <li> i RECOMMEND ANY MURAD PRODUCT, HOWEVER, THIS ONE IS EXCEPTIONAL. IT WORKS. IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ----  A CLEAN BEAUTIFUL FACE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this one OVER the &amp;#34;sulfer&amp;#34; based other &amp;#34;acne spot cream&amp;#34; by murad , that actually made me break out after the Murad system had cleared my face. I&#x27;ve added this &amp;#34;fast fix&amp;#34; cream, pink exfoliator (every other day) and the &amp;#34;post acne spot treatment gel&amp;#34; 7 days ago and my skin looks like a baby&#x27;s soft face!!! get this! and be patient!</li>
    <li> Very good and the price is good also</li>
    <li> So far, I think it is working. I&#x27;m in the middle of a break out so I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m reacting poorly to it or not. Will update</li>
    <li> As another reviewer put it...your search is over! I received this product as a gift and I love it.  This product helps to mask even the worst pimples within hours. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and I apply a small amount to each angry pimple I have in the morning before work. When I return home at the end of the day, the pimple is much smaller and less red. After at least two days of this the pimple is almost gone! Keep in mind this is a spot treatment - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend covering your face in this because its so strong. For individual pimple use though it&#x27;s magical!</li>
    <li> I am in my 40s and somehow have developed worse acne than when I was a teenager.  The Murad acne products are amazing at keeping the acne manageable.  This particular product is the best at keeping individual pimples under control.  Since mine is hormonal, that&#x27;s a plus.  When my teenager or another person in my family uses it for acne that isn&#x27;t hormonal, the pimple dries up and goes away almost immediately.  Its a great product!</li>
    <li> This product does not work miracles, but it seems to help with big tough acne bumps...I use it as a back up for big pimples, along with suki moisturizer balancing oils. Both combinations seem to work for me. I will be ordering this item again.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!  Quick fix and not drying.</li>
    <li> Love this product it works quickly.</li>
