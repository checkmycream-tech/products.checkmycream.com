      <li>Visually, the clippers are a beautiful piece of machinery.</li>
      <li>amazing, straight out the box</li>
      <li>With a few adjustments out the box these puppies are my best buy yet!</li>
      <li>Precise cuts everytime.</li>
      <li>Just wish my husband could have used them to enjoy.</li>
      <li>The body feels smooth when held in the hand.</li>
      <li>They add a whole new dimension to my haircuts and are a perfect match for the smooth blending fast feeds.</li>
      <li>course..I sanitize and clean the used clippper</li>
      <li>and i rarely have to go over section more than once, its clean from jump, it does get hot after 20 mins or so but what to do what to do?</li>
      <li>Although they were supposed to have been “New&amp;#34; We sent them back and our money was refunded immediately, so that was a good thing.</li>
      <li>Looked liked a 5 year old packed the box.</li>

      <li>Gets very hot quickly     4.</li>
      <li>These clippers cut sharp fast clean and accurate in the experienced hand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>when I first got it!</li>
      <li>shipped complete or just a couple bucks more for some of you</li>
      <li>This is very important:  there appears to be no combs/teeth below the 1/4 inch that fits properly, therefore, you are likely to make a huge mistake because combs lower than 1/4 inch fall of very easily.     </li>

      <li>Eventually, I had to open up the inside and mess around with some more turning and twisting of some more screws.</li>
      <li>It cuts through hair very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So the bald portion of the haircut I will use the fademaster to completly remove the line, and the rest of the blend is done with the fast feed.</li>
      <li>Ultra close cutting for perfect fades...</li>
      <li>Thanks for the propmt delivery and the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>Cuts hair very well     2.</li>
      <li>My only issue is that there is a flange that stops them from adjusting to a true &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; setting for bald fades.  </li>
      <li>but then as my fades started to get more skin tight, I realized that these could really take out any line you put in.</li>
      <li>Has a decent length of power cord     3.  </li>
      <li>I learned to love these clippers, and pick them up for every haircut that requires those skin tight blends.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
      <li>highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these clippers only problem they get really hot after a little use.  </li>
      <li>but buy a new blade with (w/)</li>
      <li>I ordered something that clearly read NEW!</li>
      <li>I would not recommend using them for everyday cutting, the improved masters are better for that with the only difference being the top guide, which on the improved master is a lot thicker and better for use with the guides.  </li>
      <li>Your better off getting the regular black one.</li>
      <li>This does work great for cutting close and fading.  </li>
      <li>Vibrates and clicks vehemently and is loud     5.</li>
      <li>I bought the clippers for my boyfriends birthday because he is a professional barber.</li>

<li> I am not a professional barber but these help me cut like one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s heavy and not a close trim as my old one.</li>
<li> Being that I was using these clippers in a foreign country, adjusting was necessary.</li>
<li> At first as a novice with these super sharp, close cutting masters, I found myself snagging heads every time I was cutting too fast.</li>
<li> Highly recommend these clippers if your about the fades especially tight ones.</li>
<li> Smooth cutting clippers that stay cool while cutting.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t want any other pair of clippers no matter what</li>
<li> The clippers are a little heavier than other clippers I&#x27;ve held.</li>
<li> so when it gets down to tedious and meticulous work, I highly recommend the fade masters.  </li>
<li> Now the functionality of the clippers is where I had a slight problem.</li>
<li> This rating is probably not fair to the actual product because the product was sent in a used condition.  </li>
<li> Sadly, as soon as he turned it on to use it, it made a very loud noise.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re heavy duty clippers that do well with any grade of hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and it works just as well as</li>
<li> Almost tried to save a few bucks by getting the wahl seniors.</li>
<li> To heavy didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
<li> All the combs available are very painful whenever they make contact with the head because they are so sharp     3.</li>
<li> I barely used mine, started making weird noise.</li>
<li> Not sure why.</li>
<li> Not sure if its for safety or what.</li>
<li> I love Andis products but these clippers are terrible with biting and pulling the scalp.</li>
<li> I need to figure out a way to dull the blade.</li>
<li> He told me these clippers have taken his cutting to the next level.</li>
<li> I hated them at first</li>
<li> The bottom blade was crooked on the device which makes it nearly impossible to fix all the way... idk.</li>
<li> I go very slow with these clippers, when doing my fades, but they still pull the heck out of my scalp.</li>
<li> 2 of the teeth on the blade were broken.</li>
<li> I have dropped and broken a pair already.</li>
<li> The machine came used and broken.</li>
<li> I purchased these because I was tired of buying and re-buying inexpensive clippers over and over.</li>
<li> Turning the adjust screw unfortunately did not fix the noise.</li>

    <li> I barely used mine, started making weird noise. Learned to fade without these</li>
    <li> I do my own fades and this work really good.  It cuts through hair very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it didn&#x27;t come with the combs.</li>
    <li> I was prematurely impressed. The bottom blade was crooked on the device which makes it nearly impossible to fix all the way... idk.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to try them, they came late, but when they arrived packaging was terrible, the item was missing parts and damaged.</li>
    <li> Great clipper gets hot quick though</li>
    <li> Was bothered by the condition of item</li>
    <li> I purchase this over a year ago and below are the pros and cons:    Pros     1. Cuts hair very well     2. Has a decent length of power cord     3.  Appears to be very strong    Cons     1. This is very important:  there appears to be no combs/teeth below the 1/4 inch that fits properly, therefore, you are likely to make a huge mistake because combs lower than 1/4 inch fall of very easily.     2. All the combs available are very painful whenever they make contact with the head because they are so sharp     3. Gets very hot quickly     4. Vibrates and clicks vehemently and is loud     5. Is heavier in comparison to some of the name brand competitors who do a similar job</li>
    <li> These clippers cut sharp fast clean and accurate in the experienced hand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m vey happy with them and would recommend them highly.&lt;br /&gt;As just a precaution ,on some clients, these may get hung up on the up stroke so becareful.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I was tired of buying and re-buying inexpensive clippers over and over. I decided to purchase a professional set of clippers and I don&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;m not a professional barber. I used them to cut my son&#x27;s hair, but the results I get with these clippers have people asking where we take my son to get his hair cut. In my case the tools made a world of difference on the quality of hair cut I could give my son. I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought the clippers for my boyfriends birthday because he is a professional barber. These are the ones he requested. He told me these clippers have taken his cutting to the next level. They were a good price and he does not want use any other brand than Andis. Thanks for the propmt delivery and the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Andis makes some of the best products out there. This clipper is perfect for professional barbers with experience. The only fault is the teeth, they are really fragile so if you put this in a drawer you need to protect the blade teeth with the plastic cover it comes with.</li>
    <li> i love these clippers. now cutting hair is a breeze. they&#x27;re really powerful.the only trouble with them is finding the right guards to match them. i definitely recommend these to anyone who&#x27;s trying to be a barber or stylist. :)</li>
    <li> Great clippers.Very nice looking body.Smooth cutting clippers that stay cool while cutting.I am not a professional barber but these help me cut like one.</li>
    <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
    <li> amazing, straight out the box i didnt want it at zero but its close enough for the bald fade and i rarely have to go over section more than once, its clean from jump, it does get hot after 20 mins or so but what to do what to do?</li>
    <li> so mad, this is what I opened and you should hear them when they are turned on sounds like something&#x27;s broke inside !</li>
    <li> I love these clippers only problem they get really hot after a little use.  About 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
    <li> At first as a novice with these super sharp, close cutting masters, I found myself snagging heads every time I was cutting too fast. I hated them at first but then as my fades started to get more skin tight, I realized that these could really take out any line you put in. I learned to love these clippers, and pick them up for every haircut that requires those skin tight blends. They add a whole new dimension to my haircuts and are a perfect match for the smooth blending fast feeds. So the bald portion of the haircut I will use the fademaster to completly remove the line, and the rest of the blend is done with the fast feed. I highly recommend these clippers, just be careful on your initial usage.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper....Ultra close cutting for perfect fades...highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Close cutting of 00000 to 000. Perfect match for the improved master for clean clean fades. Mater blade can be also used with this clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none</li>
    <li> The Teeth needs rounding.  Snaggs your skin while shaving.</li>
    <li> 5 star the andis fade master are the mf truf. I wouldn&#x27;t want any other pair of clippers no matter what</li>
    <li> The clipper came as if it was used. Looked liked a 5 year old packed the box. The air cushion was never pumped up. Amazon handled the refund very well and it was simple. They recommended to purchase another clipper from Amazon. I received the second clippers and im very happy with them.</li>
    <li> bought these also for my son who is attending barber school loves them so far</li>
    <li> Visually, the clippers are a beautiful piece of machinery. The body feels smooth when held in the hand. The clippers are a little heavier than other clippers I&#x27;ve held. But this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.     Now the functionality of the clippers is where I had a slight problem. The instructions said to simply twist the volt adjust screw to fix the \\&quot;clacking\\&quot; noise that might emit from. Being that I was using these clippers in a foreign country, adjusting was necessary. Turning the adjust screw unfortunately did not fix the noise. Eventually, I had to open up the inside and mess around with some more turning and twisting of some more screws. Then it worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> It heated up too quick while using it</li>
    <li> Clean Cutts everytime love them !</li>
    <li> I love Andis products but these clippers are terrible with biting and pulling the scalp. I go very slow with these clippers, when doing my fades, but they still pull the heck out of my scalp. I need to figure out a way to dull the blade. I recommend the Wahl 5 Star Seniors as they give the same type of fades and tapers WITHOUT pulling your skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for a Christmas gift.  Sadly, as soon as he turned it on to use it, it made a very loud noise.  He took off the blades to do some adjusting, and the noise was still present.  There was even hair inside when he took the blades off. Although they were supposed to have been “New&amp;#34; We sent them back and our money was refunded immediately, so that was a good thing. The item shipped and was received promptly.  Just wish my husband could have used them to enjoy.</li>
    <li> I am a barber all about his fades so when it gets down to tedious and meticulous work, I highly recommend the fade masters.  The way they have the notches for the lever makes it so you will never have a line in your fade, and the moving teeth come dialed in at 000!!! Thats about as close as my edgers (Wahl Peanut).  Highly recommend these clippers if your about the fades especially tight ones.</li>
    <li> Zero stars. The machine came used and broken. 2 of the teeth on the blade were broken. See picture. Returning item asap for a refund.</li>
    <li> This rating is probably not fair to the actual product because the product was sent in a used condition.  I ordered something that clearly read NEW! The product was not packaged well and there was some hair still sticking out from inside the blades.</li>
    <li> Received them in timely fashion, followed the adjustment instructions and haven&#x27;t had a problem.  They&#x27;re heavy duty clippers that do well with any grade of hair.  My only issue is that there is a flange that stops them from adjusting to a true &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; setting for bald fades.  Not sure if its for safety or what. There are ways around this, but it will prolly void out the warranty.  I would not recommend using them for everyday cutting, the improved masters are better for that with the only difference being the top guide, which on the improved master is a lot thicker and better for use with the guides.  Most barbers I know have one or both clippers.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Some people dont understand that this is specifacally just for fading thats why its called the fademater. This should just be used for the fading portion or where you want your hair to be cut #000-#00000 this is a very good product that continues the master series</li>
    <li> This does work great for cutting close and fading.  The only issue I have with this product is that after only a few uses it vibrates and loudly buzzes like it is about to explode.  Not sure why.</li>
    <li> Save your doh.&lt;br /&gt;Used masters on eBay all day&lt;br /&gt;Fade master blade too&lt;br /&gt;And you can it get it all used&lt;br /&gt;.. but buy a new blade with (w/) some new back screws&lt;br /&gt;  [If you like]&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems w/ my fade master since I&#x27;ve owned it, July &#x27;11)&lt;br /&gt;And I do my own weeekly military fadeeeees.&lt;br /&gt;......So I got irritated w/ my master 4RM getting hot,&lt;br /&gt;(takes some timeeeee to get too that part).&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 2nd pair of masters&lt;br /&gt; w/ a fade master blade around&lt;br /&gt;$45 shipped complete or just a couple bucks more for some of you viewer(s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All masters have the same body,&lt;br /&gt;when all these blades are interchangeable;&lt;br /&gt;phatmaster,&lt;br /&gt;fademaster,&lt;br /&gt;or your standard triple 000 blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course..I sanitize and clean the used clippper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor fades just got easier w/ the profoil shaver&lt;br /&gt;especially when you do this on your own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked it up as a hobby,&lt;br /&gt;beeeen doin&#x27; this for couple yrs now,&lt;br /&gt;but not for a livin&#x27; in Tracy bAybee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q&#x27;s?&lt;br /&gt;dewdruspunn@gmail.com</li>
    <li> Great product came on time</li>
    <li> Your better off getting the regular black one. It&#x27;s heavy and not a close trim as my old one.</li>
    <li> To heavy didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Slippery... so you might want to buy something to add a grip to it. I have dropped and broken a pair already.</li>
    <li> Almost tried to save a few bucks by getting the wahl seniors. But you get what you pay for. Best clippers I&#x27;ve owned! With a few adjustments out the box these puppies are my best buy yet! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> they are awesome simply put  , the different levels and the precision cuts are awesome i wouldnt use any thing else  i would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and it works just as well as when I first got it! Just keep it well maintained by oiling and cleaning. Precise cuts everytime.</li>
