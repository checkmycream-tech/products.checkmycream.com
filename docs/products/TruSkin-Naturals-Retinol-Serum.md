<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have loved how Retinol by TruSkin Naturals has helped in conjunction with the he best organic Vitamin C Serum for Face with Hyaluronic Acid | 20% C + Vitamin E | product.  I use it at night only, first allowing the Vit C serum to dry.  The combination has helped to reduce fine lines and improve the overall appearance of my skin.  The TruSkin Naturals company is exemplary in its service to their customers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking the serums and plan to keep up with both the C and Retinol.  I am now using it on the backs of my hands too to combat signs of aging.</li>
    <li> I like the serum because it&#x27;s easy to apply to my skin. With the combination of drinking more water and making sure to wash my face twice a day I do notice there is a glow to my face. Also I noticed that after applying the Retinol and the Vitamin C serum to my face that skin becomes tighten, as for moisturizer I apply a shea butter mixture which has  almond oil and coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please refer to picture for ingredient list</li>
    <li> I followed TruSkin&#x27;s advice and have been using both the Vitamin C Serum (A.M.) as well as the Retinol Serum (P.M.) and they appear to be working together beautifully! Not so long ago, I wouldn&#x27;t go out to my mailbox without makeup on. Now, I feel  confident that my skin looks better without it!  I&#x27;m very thankful that I found TruSkin&#x27;s products. I also admire their customer service.I asked a question and was advised that the use of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum  would help with the deeper lines above my lips. I just started using it and will post a review as soon as I can determine how successful it is in turning back time.....so much to ask!</li>
    <li> My face is looking good and feeling good. In my forties, and face has never felt better. Not drying on the skin.</li>
    <li> All of TruSkin serums are amazing! My skin looks and feels perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Great results. Reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I use this serum as my night routine, great, all the wrinkles under my eyes are fading &amp; great product, I see my face is very smooth and even, I will but again</li>
    <li> Tru Skin makes quality products that are just as effective as most prestige brands. Crows feet and laugh lines are significantly deminished.</li>
    <li> For some reason after using this product for a week or so, my face broke out in several hives.  I thought perhaps I am allergic to retinol, but I have it in my night cream, and that product has no effect on my skin whatsoever.  I discontinued use, and the hives receeded, (although it took a long time for them to fade).  Since I waited past the 30 day deadline for returns, I am stuck with this serum.  So I decided to try it on my hands only now, just in case I was allergic to something I ate originally, and blamed it on the serum.  Having said all this, I have to say that I am a huge fan of the vitamin c serum as well as the hyalauronic acid serum made by truskin.</li>
    <li> Product was great quality. I just didnt see much difference using it with my C that i use from this same company.  Im sure if i started with the Retinol first i might of had the same results as the C.</li>
    <li> One word AWESOME!!!! Best stuff I have ever tried my fine lines and circles under my eyes are almost completely gone no lie!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my face. I was not expecting miracles, but I never did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do much for me...my skin feels and looks the same as before.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The serum is great and my skin has improved in the month I have used it. The product goes on easily and absorbs quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love love this product and use it everyday!!. Have noticed my fine lines under my eyes and forehead diminish. will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I love these products.  I&#x27;m starting to see a change in the fine lines around my eyes just after a couple weeks! I love that it has NO perfume or smell. So clean feeling and absorbs quickly. I have tried a lot of very EXPENSIVE products but I have found something that finally works! These products are now on my \\&quot;Must Have\\&quot; list! I have already recommended these to friends!  Megan Schnall</li>
    <li> This is a great product. No need to buy expensive retinol. My face is soft and fresh looking. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> TruSkin products are the best!!! I&#x27;ve tried them all, and will continual ordering, as I appreciate the compliments on my youthful looking skin....thank-you!!</li>
    <li> Excellent service, great product!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle reduction as of yet.  Maybe it&#x27;s too soon, or maybe I&#x27;m a lost cause.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seriously loving this product. I tried lots of retinol, this one is mild but still works great.</li>
    <li> Love it, does what it says.</li>
    <li> Must try, results and my friends are now using!</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Love this retinol serum. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation with this product and I think my skin has already improved! I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love the TruSkin Retinol. It will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; retinol product from now on. Started using it 2-3 times per week because of cold winter weather, and not sure if it would be too drying. But no problem! My skin looked brighter after two weeks of use. Also, great customer service to answer any questions about product.</li>
    <li> I love this product have been using it for a week and people are already seeing results on the mini fine lines and ask what I&#x27;m using that my mom even wants to try it. Great product.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Retinol from my dermatologist, but with a much higher price tag! TruSkin Retinol and Vitamin C are working so well that I&#x27;m going to add their hyaluronic acid to my routine!</li>
    <li> This product is very soothing on my skin. I have had no bad reactions to it and I generally have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> 2.5 content is too low- have not noticed improvement</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell.  I used the c ream Retinol for years but now do not have a dermatologist to prescribe it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have every used for my skin and comes at a wonderful price. I stared with the Hyaluronic Acid and love how it immediately showed a difference in my skin. I then without a doubt had to turnaround and purchase the Retinol and my face has never looked smoother. The customer service is superior and after you purchase the owner will reach out and communicate to you by email to see how you like the product and is quick to respond. Not many companies offer great customer service today with the little added touch and I think it goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I can see a difference in my skin already. My skin is so soft and clear and I am getting compliments from my co-workers.</li>
    <li> I am a man in my early 40s and have been using the Retinol and the Vitamin C serums regularly for about 2 weeks. I am starting to see brightened skin and an improvement in pore size. My main goals are to reduce the appearance of fine lines and to help keep clear / smaller pores. Still not fully there yet but I will keep going with the serums. They are light and absorb easily into clean skin.   Update. After multiple purchases, I will be discontinuing use of this product. Unfortunately the container leaks severely during air travel and this product is too expensive to be spilled all over inside my toiletry kit. This was not always a problem but something has changed with the pump bottle. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it so far! Have been using it for a fews weeks now and have seen quite a bit of progress. My skin is already more smooth and radiant and that has been with using this serum 3-4 nights a week - and skipping face washing entirely the other nights (tsk tsk, I know). Looking forward to watching my skin continue to improve and trying more of TruSkin&#x27;s products - adding the Vitamin C serum in next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this product being outstanding, TruSkin&#x27;s customer service has also been fantastic! If you are debating between this and another brand, stop. You&#x27;ve found what you are looking for here!</li>
    <li> I purchased this recently and have been using it for about a week now.  What a wonderful product!!!  I&#x27;ve tried Retinol from my dermatologist&#x27;s office but did not have the same good results as i did with this product!  This product will not dry out your face the way regular retinol does.  It is infused with Vitamin E and Hylauronic Acid.  It is a smooth gel consistency and spreads easily over the face.  All you need is a tiny drop to cover your whole face.  It sinks into your skin right away.  I usually follow it with a moisturizer (like marula oil or something else) and in the morning i wake up without one single line on my face.  That number 11 lines between my eyes is completely gone!  And my entire face is smooth and plump.  It evens out skin tone somehwat as well though i think that&#x27;s from using the Vitamin C Serum (also from this company which i will review separately).  With continued use i can see this being even more effective.  The price is very fair for this product and a little bit goes a long way. Truly this is the absolute holy grail in skin aging reversal.  I highly recommend this serum!  And ordering it from this company on Amazon was a breeze and it came super fast and perfectly packaged.  Overall amazing experience! !</li>
    <li> Excellent costumer service and amazing products!</li>
    <li> Very good product :-)</li>
    <li> I recently became a TruSkin Naturals VIP because their products are amazing and they deliver on their promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the retinol in conjunction with the vitamin C serum &amp; Hyaluronic acid and the results have been wonderful. I&#x27;m a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes. So far, I love it.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! My skin feels great and my wrinkles actually diminished!!!</li>
    <li> Just started to use it thus I can&#x27;t say for now if it&#x27;s helping diminishing the wrinkles. I like the feel of it though. Seems to make my skin feels softer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much change ... used it every day until the bottle ran out and at most my skin looked slightly brighter (could be one of the other products I use too though...). I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> At first I wanted to buy a hyaluronic serum, but then I saw the Retinol 2.5% serum and decided to give it a shot! I have to say the first few days I felt like nothing changed. I was a bit diasspointed and thought I might&#x27;ve made a mistake, but I kept on using it because I bought it already. And then about a week or so later, I realized my (facial) skin looked really good! and I was like &amp;#34;omg...my skin looks really good!&amp;#34; I have old acne scars and bad uneven skin tone and after continuing using this product I feel like my skin has improved! Ofcourse my scars aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; but it looks smoother. But my uneven skin tone definitely got more even! It&#x27;s the first time, I saw improvment on my uneven skin tone! :)&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I skip a night (of not using the serum) I feel like my skin is &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; LOL like it didn&#x27;t get all the things it needed throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a good serum to have and I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love it, my skin feels and looks better!!!</li>
    <li> Best retinol serum is an excellent skin rejuvenation. My complexion is much brighter, my skin stays moisturized and so soft! I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I put it on and night and by morning, my skin looks healthy and refreshed. It has also helped reduce redness.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle and I will not be found without this. As we age, retinol is an essential and TruSkin&#x27;s Retinol is very effective for my sensitive skin. This product is easily absorbed, gentle, yet effective. My skin looks luminous. I will not be without this serum!</li>
    <li> I bought it because online feedback. I have used for one month and have not felt different. I guess I have to use it more than one month.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I recommend it</li>
    <li> So far....very good product. See improvement on my eye area. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have found it to be a great product ! It works right away I thought it would take longer as the label read, but no! it works fast. I am a person that uses expensive products on my skin, so I don&#x27;t care about others opinions. I am also a herbal person . I read the ingredients and look at all the herbs , vitamins, and if organic % and than I decide . My skin is bright and youthful. The price is great!!! and I was shock after all the expensive companies I buy from with the small jars and the big price tags.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin feels good after using it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I use it right after washing my face in the morning, let it dry, then put on my favorite moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face and stays firm all day long. I will continue to buy it as I try to keep three on hand, so I don&#x27;t run out!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying products for years serching for something that actually does what it says. I am 39 and have hormonal acne breakouts, and the start of fine lines around my eyes. This product is amazing, I can honestly say it works. My skin feels softer more hydrated, lines have diminished, light spots are fading, most importantly....no breakouts during my monthly hormonal change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the C Serum and will update my review after a month or so of trying it. Great product, love supporting a small business that puts out great products. Best thing is it&#x27;s affordable. I&#x27;ve spend hundreds on Le Mer, Lancome, Clarins this product blows them away.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, VERY HAPPY with purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Skin is looking so much better! Delivers what it promises!</li>
    <li> This works great excellent</li>
    <li> Excellent! Even my mom purchased it after she noticed the difference on my skin. It is a light serum. Your skin will absorb it asap. It is not oily but rather a watery consistency which I personally don&#x27;t mind. So follow by a moisturizer at night. It will exfoliate your skin nicely. If you have sensitive skin or dry skin I would start by using it every other night or every two days until your skin can tolerate it. If using during the summer, SPF is a must!,</li>
    <li> i use a micro needle pen and use this product after to help with the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Good quality and good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old and bought this product along with the Vitamin C serum to combat fine lines and sun spots. Before the first application, I took a close-up picture of my bare face for reference. I want to be able to accurately document whether these products are improving my skin in a few months. After two days of usage, I could tell my face, especially my cheeks where my skin was slightly rough and bumpy, felt smoother. This was not wishful thinking on my part as I was surprised at how much softer my face was while applying my regular moisturizer (both serums advise applying moisturizer afterwards). This was not a result I had anticipated. My cheeks have had a rough feel for over a decade. I have experienced no drying or redness of any kind after three weeks. It definitely helped my usual once a month breakout because I only had two bumps this time, rather than ten. Both serums are odorless and have not caused me to sneeze, which I have experienced with other products that contained perfumes. Customer service with this company is stellar. I will update this review later with how/if my other skin issues have shown improvement. I&#x27;m pretty excited to find a product that lives up to its claims!</li>
    <li> good stuff give a try and wait for a month to see result. it&#x27;s amazing product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TruSkin products!  Great quality &amp; terrific customer service</li>
    <li> I tried it out for a few months and it didn&#x27;t do anything, no change at all. I also should have paid closer attention to the ingredients (Sodium Benzoate, even though it&#x27;s low on the list, is not good).</li>
    <li> I have been using the TruSkin Vitamin C and TruSkin Retinol serum combined with my favorite all organic moisturizer - the Face Cream by Belle Aglaia (www.belleaglaia.com) every day for a week so far. Without telling my good friend - a licensed beautician - about my newly discovered skin care recipe, she immediately noticed the overall improvement of my skin. I am truly impressed myself and excited that my face looks radiant and glowing, my skin is super smooth and soft, deeply moisturized, pores are visibly smaller ... I would even say that my wrinkles have been smoothed out ... as if time and the signs of aging have been turning back! I love the combination of these products, as they really work together for visible results!</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS WITH THE VITAMIN C SERUM, I DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY WRINKLES, I SWAP IT OUT WITH VITAMIN C SERUM TO HELP CONTROL ACNE AND REDUCE BLEMISH SPOTS. BUT MAINLY ITS THE SILKY FEELING IT GIVES TO MY FACE AFTER i CLEAN IT AND JUST USE THE SERUM, NEVER FELT IT FEEL SO SMOOTH BEFORE.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Highly recommend! I have sensitive skin and this feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m throwing everything else out of my bathroom carbinate! I have Malasma and used this for 2 weeks now. I see a difference in my skins brightness and feel. It was delivered in time for my Vegas trip and I took it with me. It was 115 degrees everyday During my entire trip from June 26th to July 1st. This product really made a difference!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> instant results and helps your skin retain it&#x27;s moisture.  I can now use less lotion and my makeup has a fresh dewy appearance for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I turned 34 recently and I have been using the retinol serum and vitamin C serum for four months now. My skin is beyond amazing! For the first time in my life I have stopped wearing foundation. My skin is soft, glowing, and youthful, this gave me back that dewey young appearance. I went out for drinks with some of my friends from high school and out of the group I was the only one who was asked for I.D.! I even forgot my liscence in the car one day and the supermarket clerk refused to sell to me because she wasn&#x27;t sure I really was 21!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what these two products did for me:&lt;br /&gt;-Softened my skin&lt;br /&gt;-Evened my skin tone to the best it has looked in my life!&lt;br /&gt;-Kept my skin hydrated and healthy even though this winter was bitter cold&lt;br /&gt;-Shrank my pores (honestly)&lt;br /&gt;-Minimized my fine lines&lt;br /&gt;-Softened the deep wrinkle I have across my neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I got used to using this occasionally I found my skin would start to dry out a little. I simple took a day off from the retinol and just used the vitamin C serum. My skin was never red and painful like with other retinol products. I cannot explain how much I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a month now and I love it...I will reorder.</li>
    <li> This seems to help keep my skin smooth . I also noticed fewer breakouts and a more even tone. Also easy to apply.</li>
    <li> AMAZING STUFF.  I have sun damaged skin and when I hit 40 I noticed how blotchy it was getting.  I did some research and got a derma roller but it didn&#x27;t really work until I started using this after rolling and twice a day.  Six months later the dermatologist who recommended a 5k laser treatment said it looks better than laser could ever do.  This is great stuff…. but I can only attest to that using it in combination with a good 1.5 or 2 derma roller.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery of products.  Products are exactly as described. Love the thickness of liquid, applies well.  Can see results within first 3 days.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I was skeptical nut after reading reviews I thought Id give it try! Love it!</li>
    <li> &#x27;m really enjoying the retinol cream. I&#x27;ve noticed that my post acne dark spots are going away a lot faster. I haven&#x27;t had any redness or peeling which is nice. Also I noticed that the creases on my forehead seem to less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer and glows in the morning when I&#x27;ve put the retinol cream on the night before. All in all, I&#x27;m really pleased! The only downside is that the pump on the bottle is sort of all or nothing on the amount it puts out, but not a big deal!</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and non irritating.  I have used retin-a every since I was a teenager, I was skeptical to try this one because I alway experienced flaky dry skin. Not with this product. I use it at night with Vitamin c serum and by morning my skin is soft, supple, and clear.  I will definitely keep using it. The best part it is excellent for aging skin.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Great night time serum</li>
    <li> This is amazing Retinol Serum.  It is thick enough not to run down your fingers, and the pump dispenses exactly the right amount for use.  The morning after I used this I could see a difference in my skin already; it was smoother and clearer.  I was completely taken aback by this because I have used another retinol product for several years and never got this result.  This TruSkin Best Retinol Serum absorbs completely and that has to be part of the reason.  The other part, of course, is that it is obviously a better serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 stars are for the pump being so precise, the serum being easy to apply and absorbing so well, and for the results.  My skin must have needed this serum as a finishing touch.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> So far I like the results....but is too early to tell how well it is going to work in the long term.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I am so impressed! I have had terrible bags under my eyes for years. I have tried so many products through the years and absolutely nothing has helped until I started using this retinol serum. My bags are gone!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My skin feels amazing.  I have received any compliments since using this product.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the service i received. Very happy with the product. The prices are great. Over all i will use this place again. Great !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Love this new product. It is the right balance of refreshing the skin at night and yet providing a moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt; The skin is not dry. Billie Cash</li>
    <li> I use this serum along with Vitamin C and Eminence face cream.  As a result, my skin has been soft and smooth even after being stuck inside with the heat constantly on, or facing the cold temperatures when I venture outside.  This is the first winter my skin has felt truly hydrated.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the C Serum. Retinol at night and C during the day. Really does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, my skin looks and feels better. People are noticing and commenting positively. My skin tone is more uniform in color. It&#x27;s lightened some dark spots on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried that Nerium product which worked well at first but I noticed a bunch of bad reviews and it stopped working after a while, including making my eyes red all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no negative issues with this serum, however and it works better for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I have never seen my skin so clear and so smooth!!! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i love this serum my skin is greatly improved my facialist is impressed with the results she sees and so am i the serum goes on easily dries quickly and accepts application of makeup flawlessly this is now my go to serum my skin tone is evening out dark spots fading fine lines filling in...I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> fantastic. I see and feel results already and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Best Retinol serum..  My acne scars are disappearing!  I have very dark skin</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Retinol is a good product.</li>
    <li> Work amazing and non irritating. I apply Retinol Serum in the morning and then I use C-Serum and before bedtime then Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I love these products and it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my face. It absorbs quickly. I use the TruNaturals Vitamin C serum first, then follow it with the Hylaronic Acid and Retinol Serum, then moisturizer. The included instructions were appreciated: I have reordered and will continue to order this product. People have commented that my skin is &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;, in a good way. I am almost 55 and my skin looks great!  I just ordered all 3 serums for my husband because he is jealous of how good my skin looks.</li>
    <li> This is a great product (I also use their Vitamin C serum ). Noticeably smoother texture on my face. Great price and fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> Good product. I cleanse my face of all make-up in the evening, and then apply tretonin and vitamin C. My last step is applying the Retinol 2.5%. It does not dry my skin out like some products do. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Still on the fence on this one.  I think its working but I will have to continue to use it until its gone to know for sure.  Only use at night as it is drying to the skin even though you put moisturizer on after the Retinol.  Gave it a 3 as I need to finish up the product.  BTW  the seller is great to work with my product arrived during a blizzard and below zero temps and it was frozen.  I threw out the product as I did not feel that it would work up to its potential.  I contacted the seller and they replaced the product without question.</li>
    <li> This retinol serum is wonderful! It absorbs quickly (especially if you use the Derma Roller before). It makes my face look and feel great. Love this product and plan on using it for a long time!</li>
    <li> Just have had it a couple days...so far so good!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other Retinol products but this one is the BEST by far! It is the perfect thickness so it doesn’t drip through my fingers and get wasted. It absorbs quickly so I don’t have to wait forever to apply my makeup. My skin looks to good that on some days I don’t even wear foundation! This saves me so much time in the morning. I am so happy with all of the Tru Skin Naturals products that I have thrown out all of my other skin care products and I only use their products.  “Tru”-ly a 5 STAR product!</li>
    <li> I used the c in the morning and the retinol at night but my skin got too dry.  Now I&#x27;m just using the retinol and can see a difference!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I must have sucker wrote all over me!!!  I bought this product hoping it would do half of what it claimed.  I was so excited by the good reviews that I in fact, bought TWO bottles.  Well, 4 weeks into using this product faithfully, I have nothing to show for it except a bottle that the squirt dispenser is clogged and I have to try to pour.  No-one wishes more than I that I could have given this a 5 star review; I would have been a customer for life!!!</li>
    <li> Another fantastic product from TruSkin Naturals. I am a devoted user of both the vitamin C serum and the Hyaluronic acid serums and I decided to try their retinol,acid as well. I was sceptic so because I have sensitive skin and retinol products have irritated my skin in the past. This is smooth and gentle. I use it 3 nights a week over my Hyaluronic acid serum. On top I wear me night cream. I feel my skin smoother more hydrated and overall brighter. I love this company and their products. If they keep their quality high and their prices affordable I will be buying for long time!</li>
