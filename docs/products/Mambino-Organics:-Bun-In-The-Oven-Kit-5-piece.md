      <li>Happy with my purchase</li>
      <li>And the body wash smells great, but doesnt lather well.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the variety of wonderful body products included!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that i love the smell!  </li>
      <li>Best gift for a pregnant lady!</li>
      <li>I loved how it felt on my skin.</li>
      <li>and I am confident has great results.</li>
      <li>I love the toning oil and belly butter!</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>This product smells amazing</li>
      <li>any kind-</li>
      <li>gave it as a gift, my niece did call to say she liked it</li>
      <li>Face oil is nice.</li>
      <li>They smell nice and are not greasy.</li>
      <li>However, it still smells nice.</li>
      <li>Great products and quick delivery</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, I have found that the facial glow serum is the best thing ever.</li>
      <li>but I love the belly butter.  </li>
      <li>Not my favorite lip butter.</li>
      <li>I look forward to using all these products as I&#x27;m sure each one will be just as wonderful as the last.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve been thoroughly pleased with the belly butter alone.)</li>
      <li>My favorite things are the face oil, the belly butter and the lip product.  </li>
      <li>This one smells amazing feels light but still super moisturizing!</li>
      <li>It has a great smell, easily &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; as you rub it into your skin, and keeps skin hydrated and feeling good for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I break out easily</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to let skin-care fall by the wayside or use the products that you always do.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I started with the set first.  </li>
      <li>It smells just like fresh mandarin!</li>
      <li>I ordered full size products of each and plan to keep using them postpartum.</li>
      <li>the kit is smaller than it looks on the screen, but it is good quality.</li>
      <li>But this doesn&#x27;t; it smells real, and isn&#x27;t terribly strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most \\&quot;normal\\&quot; soaps, shampoos, and moisturizers, so I always use natural and organic lotions, shea butter, and jojoba, but the Mambino products smell dreamy!</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural and safe for mom and baby.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s even a lotion that doubles as a lubricant, for what that&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>I used Lemon Oil in a diffuser often as I first was pregnant.</li>
      <li>First and foremost let&#x27;s talk about the yummy Belly Butter.</li>
      <li>For the money I had hoped it would be a smidge bigger, but that&#x27;s what you get when you don&#x27;t read the fine print.</li>
      <li>Very uplifting.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products!</li>
      <li>Belly butter and toning oil moisturize very well and absorb after an hour.</li>
      <li>The subtle aroma of citrus can pep you up more quickly than the cup of coffee which you shouldn&#x27;t have!</li>
      <li>and I was so excited to open it.</li>
      <li>She was pregnant with our second child, and had very understandable concerns about stretch marks and the like.</li>
      <li>The body wash didn&#x27;t leave your skin soft, but with a funny texture.</li>
      <li>I purchased the kit as a way to sample each thing, and I will probably start giving these as my new &amp;#34;congratulations on your pregnancy&amp;#34; gifts for others!  </li>
      <li>This set was on my holiday wish list and was lucky enough to receive it!</li>
      <li>It was a very adorable gift to get from my husband, but overall not worth the price that you pay for the product that you get.</li>
      <li>It has the same dreamy smell as the belly butter and leaves my lips smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>face complex is a lightweight, fast absorbing serum that is supposed to awaken your skin into having a healthy, youthful glow.</li>
      <li>Even though I&#x27;ve only used two out of five products I still consider this buy well worth the money.</li>
      <li>the belly butter alone is 33 dollars why not spend a few more bucks for a few more products&#x27; you might wanna reconsider.</li>
      <li>Acidic, fresh and down right orangey.</li>
      <li>Also, I see nothing new on my already well lined stomach, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my belly, hands and breasts feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>The smell is a divine citrus that is closely related to that first squirt of orange rind.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love any of these products and the samples sizes were really small.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m currently 22 weeks pregnant with my second</li>
      <li>The wash is my least favorite, since it doesn&#x27;t lather at all.  </li>
      <li>From the scent to the way it made me feel pretty when I was getting bigger and bigger.</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that this product, however great, is small in size.</li>
      <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been itchy and I don&#x27;t have any apparent stretch marks</li>
      <li>The bottle is half empty, everything else was secure except for the oil.</li>
      <li>These products carry over those soothing citrus notes, but in a more mature way that goes beyond mere scent.</li>
      <li>so I need all the help I can get) for three days now and while I don&#x27;t see a drastic improvement it has certainly helped with that pulling tight skin feeling.</li>
      <li>The moisture body toning oil is supposed to banish dry skin while the body wash promises a soap-free lather that won&#x27;t strip the skin of its natural barrier.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> There are five Products plus a hemp like bag included with this kid. First and foremost let&#x27;s talk about the yummy Belly Butter. It comes in a 2 oz container and is so delicious feeling that I never want to be without it again. I&#x27;ve been using it on my stretch marks (I&#x27;m currently 22 weeks pregnant with my second so I need all the help I can get) for three days now and while I don&#x27;t see a drastic improvement it has certainly helped with that pulling tight skin feeling. Also, I see nothing new on my already well lined stomach, so that&#x27;s a plus. This product leaves my belly, hands and breasts feeling very soft. The smell is a divine citrus that is closely related to that first squirt of orange rind. Acidic, fresh and down right orangey. The only other product I&#x27;ve used is the kissable lips. It has the same dreamy smell as the belly butter and leaves my lips smooth and soft. Even though I&#x27;ve only used two out of five products I still consider this buy well worth the money. The youth glow face complex is a lightweight, fast absorbing serum that is supposed to awaken your skin into having a healthy, youthful glow. The moisture body toning oil is supposed to banish dry skin while the body wash promises a soap-free lather that won&#x27;t strip the skin of its natural barrier. I look forward to using all these products as I&#x27;m sure each one will be just as wonderful as the last. As the pregnancy progresses I will comment on the battle of the belly butter. The only complaint I have is that this product, however great, is small in size. I was a bit shocked at how small the belly butter jar was. For the money I had hoped it would be a smidge bigger, but that&#x27;s what you get when you don&#x27;t read the fine print. LoL. (Basically, if you&#x27;re like me and thinking &#x27;hey the belly butter alone is 33 dollars why not spend a few more bucks for a few more products&#x27; you might wanna reconsider. I would&#x27;ve been thoroughly pleased with the belly butter alone.)</li>
    <li> I received these products as a surprise gift. If you know a mommy-to-be out there send her one! I took a lux shower and pampered myself and I feel so good! At 16 weeks I need help in that department. It&#x27;s so easy to let skin-care fall by the wayside or use the products that you always do. I&#x27;m allergic to most \\&quot;normal\\&quot; soaps, shampoos, and moisturizers, so I always use natural and organic lotions, shea butter, and jojoba, but the Mambino products smell dreamy! The subtle aroma of citrus can pep you up more quickly than the cup of coffee which you shouldn&#x27;t have! Citrus essential oils are usually recommended as soothing for nausea and internal disquiet associated with pregnancy. I used Lemon Oil in a diffuser often as I first was pregnant. These products carry over those soothing citrus notes, but in a more mature way that goes beyond mere scent. It&#x27;s comfort in a package. I&#x27;m eager to continue using the belly butter and the nipple cream as time goes on. Good luck, and give this a try!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my niece and I am a hero.  She lives several hours away, so I haven&#x27;t touched a smelled it myself, but have received rave reviews.  If you know someone who is expecting and you want to make their day this is it.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and believe the recipient is very happy with it!</li>
    <li> These smelled wonderful. The body wash didn&#x27;t leave your skin soft, but with a funny texture. It is a tiny travel sized set for the price that you pay. It was a very adorable gift to get from my husband, but overall not worth the price that you pay for the product that you get.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t have any chemical additives!!  I really enjoyed the variety of wonderful body products included!</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and I am confident has great results. I got mine yesterday and I was so excited to open it. Upon opening, I discovered that the body toning oil was open and leaked all over the box. The bottle is half empty, everything else was secure except for the oil. I am not sure if it was supposed to be sealed shut or not, but it was not sealed when I received it.</li>
    <li> So this is all hearsay, but I got nothing but rave reviews from my wife. She was pregnant with our second child, and had very understandable concerns about stretch marks and the like. This worked, I can tell you - the body wash, the lotion, everything. There&#x27;s even a lotion that doubles as a lubricant, for what that&#x27;s worth (I&#x27;ll keep this family-friendly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my perspective, it smells wonderful. Made a great gift and was a hit all around.</li>
    <li> It is a great sample. I loved how it felt on my skin. I will definitely get this product again.</li>
    <li> Great products and quick delivery</li>
    <li> gave it as a gift, my niece did call to say she liked it</li>
    <li> Best gift for a pregnant lady! I received this from an awesome friend and adore all the products! The belly butter especially! I have tried a bunch of different belly butters, oils, creams, etc. This one smells amazing feels light but still super moisturizing! I will be buying this throughout the rest of my pregnany and probably after baby too!</li>
    <li> I received this kit as a gift from a friend when I was expecting and loved every product! From the scent to the way it made me feel pretty when I was getting bigger and bigger. I highly recommend these products! I still use them post baby!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, I have found that the facial glow serum is the best thing ever. I break out easily but I use this as a night cream and I wake up with my skin looking so great, no breakouts! I wish I had ordered a bigger supply!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size. Seems very small for the price.  It was a gift so I probably won&#x27;t get feedback myself.</li>
    <li> This was wonderful to use throughout my pregnancy and I&#x27;m glad I started with the set first.  Now after I&#x27;ve had the baby I still continue to use the oil and the butter but not the other products.  And....no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> This set was on my holiday wish list and was lucky enough to receive it! I began using the products at the start of my 3rd trimester. I use the toning oil, belly butter and lip balm on a daily basis. I love the toning oil and belly butter! They smell nice and are not greasy. Neither product has stained or left any residues on my clothes. My skin hasn&#x27;t been itchy and I don&#x27;t have any apparent stretch marks (though I&#x27;m doubtful that any product can truly have any impact on stretch marks). These gift set size toning oil and belly butter used together both lasted 1 month. I ordered full size products of each and plan to keep using them postpartum. The lip balm is just alright. I wish it was in a stick form, not in a tub that requires using your finger or lip brush. Occasionally I use the face oil and body wash. I like both a lot, so I’m trying to use them sparingly. All these items are packed in my hospital bag!</li>
    <li> She said that it was an awesome product. I like the fact that it&#x27;s natural and safe for mom and baby.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love any of these products and the samples sizes were really small. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic product as a supplement to the Mustela product I use, and this is perfect! I purchased the kit as a way to sample each thing, and I will probably start giving these as my new &amp;#34;congratulations on your pregnancy&amp;#34; gifts for others!  Not sure if it prevents stretch marks yet, but I love the belly butter.  It has a great smell, easily &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; as you rub it into your skin, and keeps skin hydrated and feeling good for a long time.  I usually use coconut oil, which is much more difficult to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s hard.&lt;br /&gt;When I read other reviews before purchasing, one reviewer didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  I&#x27;m happy to say that i love the smell!  It smells just like fresh mandarin! I hate the smell of &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; orange of any kind- it makes me sick! But this doesn&#x27;t; it smells real, and isn&#x27;t terribly strong. My favorite things are the face oil, the belly butter and the lip product.  The wash is my least favorite, since it doesn&#x27;t lather at all.  However, it still smells nice.</li>
    <li> My sister has 2 buns in the oven and she loved it! Beware......the kit is smaller than it looks on the screen, but it is good quality.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Very uplifting. Belly butter and toning oil moisturize very well and absorb after an hour. Not my favorite lip butter. I think its the container. Face oil is nice. I apply it before bed. And the body wash smells great, but doesnt lather well.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Smells Great! Wonderful sample set!</li>
