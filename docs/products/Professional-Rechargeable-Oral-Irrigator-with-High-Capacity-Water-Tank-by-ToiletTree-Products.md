<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After only two months it doesn&#x27;t hold charge anymore. Very disappointed with this product. When it does work it&#x27;s pretty good but only two months it&#x27;s to little time</li>
    <li> Bought one for my son and it was so wonderful I had to buy one for my husband too!  Next, will be my turn!</li>
    <li> Pro: compact for travel; water tank large enough for decent cleaning; battery charge good for at least 9 days (based on recent trip); pulsating water jet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: not as powerful a water jet as plug in (no battery) irrigator for home use; but I have the home model cranked up to full strength and it&#x27;s too large for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this product for travel and so far I&#x27;ve been happy with it.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it.  For me it was to strong and actually hurt my gums. Could be that my gums are still to sensitive after radiation.</li>
    <li> I really did not like this product and could see no advantage in owning it.  Traditional tooth care accomplishes the same or better results.</li>
    <li> I was expecting constant action from this irrigator, but water comes in pulses. I thought it could massage my gums, but it is rather ticklish. Maybe I am not fair, as this is the only irrigator I ever tried, maybe I expect too much, but have to say that I hardly ever use it after first week.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of food caught between my teeth.  I like to use an irrigator rather than floss or toothpicks to get it out.  Comparing this product to the similar Waterpik device, this one is superior.  The device is light and at normal setting it delivers a stronger jet of water than the Waterpik.  Also works on 110 and 220 volts, which makes it more convenient for travel.  I have only had it for a couple of weeks so I cannot comment on the durability of the battery or the device itself.  I hope the battery can be replaced without difficulty, when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for some 3 months and it is excellent.  It is easy to hold in the shower, easy to charge and holds its charge for several weeks.  It is a little hard to fill because the fill opening is small but this is a minor inconvenience.  Overall I really like the product, would buy it again and recommend it to anyone looking for a cordless oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> I love using every night, I feel like mouth is extra clean. Easy to assemble and use, excellent price. I love the three different setting and the position of the controls.</li>
    <li> I never used such device until my Dentist strongly recommended it for personal hygiene. I looked up several reviews in Amazon before ordering it. it arrived nicely packaged. The setup instruction is absolutely dummy proof. Once I started using it, I immediately felt the huge change in feeling more fresh and clean in my mouth. I got hooked onto to using it on a daily basis and it made a huge difference in my overall dental hygiene. I&#x27;m glad I bought this unit. Couldn&#x27;t have made a better investment for my mouth. Amazon shipped it pretty well packaged and on time. The price was best at this site as well but that&#x27;s not a surprise there. Overall, give this product a try. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I like the portability of this product. Doesn&#x27;t need to be hooked up with a plug/electricity to use like my larger WaterPik requires. The charge lasts for at least a week. Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works well. I have no experience with an oral irrigator, so the first few tries were messy, but I&#x27;ve learned to keep my lips sealed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great power, and enough tank size when full, to go around and hit everything twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it! And it was a good bargain here.</li>
    <li> It worked great while it worked. 5 weeks after daily use it simply stopped. It was never mishandled, dropped or moved off bathroom counter- it just didn&#x27;t work one morning.</li>
    <li> The irrigator works pretty good, and it is easy to use it, but I wish it could be more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Update: After one month of using, the irrigator stopped working. I contacted toilet tree customer service on Wednesday, and on Saturday I received new, generation 2nd, improved irrigator with more powerful with larger tank from them.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service with excellent artitude to their customers.</li>
    <li> I bought this irrigator when my gums were swollen and irritated due to having a partially impacted wisdom tooth. Food would get stuck in the space between my gum and partially exposed tooth. Whenever I tried to manually remove the particles, my gums would become inflamed and would ache for a length of time. That is when I got the irrigator. It worked great. The pressure was just right and it was able to clean my gums and my teeth. My gum actually started to heal up rather quickly once i started using it. I was very happy with the irrigator and experienced no problems with it. I avoided posting a review because I wanted to see how if it would last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward 3 months. I tried to use my irrigator yesterday and it was not working. It kept indicating that I needed to charge my irrigator. I thought that was strange because I had just recently charged my irrigator and had used it just once prior. I decided to charge it again and did so for 9 hours. I tried to use it again today, and it did not work. Once again my irrigator was indicating to me that I needed to charge the appliance. I feel like i have not used the irrigator frequent enough to have the battery die on me so soon. I mean, it&#x27;s been about 3 months since I have purchased the product. I am a bit disappointed because I really did like the irrigator, as it was a powerful and convenient. However, having the product break down in such a short span of time made that satisfaction short-lived. Perhaps I will try contacting customer service, and see if I can get any resolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** I contacted customer service regarding problem! Wow customer service is AMAZING! They got back to me, and offered to provide me with an improved product no questions asked. I provided them with my address and I got a new irrigator THE NEXT DAY! That is quality service. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed, hoping that it will last longer than the first.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Works better than other similar ones on the market that I&#x27;ve had.  Product stopped working and is being replaced by the manufacturer.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was using the original irrigator (battery powered), and then these guys shipped me--free of charge--a new model, which has a rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the original one, and even more happy with the new one.</li>
    <li> About 9 months ago, I ordered the older version (battery powered), and it failed after a few weeks. Returned it for credit, then bought a Water Pik. A few months ago, Toilet Tree mailed me the new version (rechargeable), free. I love it - perfect size, variable intensity, long lasting battery. I use it exclusively - the Water Pik is in \\&quot;mothballs\\&quot;. Great to buy from a company with integrity - the older version was flawed, they solved the problem, and sent a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; to those who were inconvenienced by the older product.</li>
    <li> Bought this product a year back. Really liked it, but the battery has started giving problem now. Would be great if I can get this fixed. Not sure if its the battery or the adaptor issue. Have to charge it daily now.</li>
    <li> I did a bunch of research before ordering this gadget. I have two bridges now, and am just not able to get that funny little dental floss thingy underneath to clean under my bridges. Decided that I needed to find an easier way to do this, and started researching oral irrigators. I finally selected this particular device, based on reviews on it, and the company&#x27;s reputation for standing behind its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been VERY impressed with this gadget! My mouth has never felt better, and after the initial use, and flushing out a ton of crap from underneath my bridges, I feel very confident that my mouth is now properly cleaned after brushing. I tried the plain water first, then decided to add a small amount of my regular mouthwash. Everything is amazingly clean now, and my mouth is wonderfully refreshed after a round my new toy.  *grin*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a device like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-4-2015:  UPDATE!  A couple of months ago, my irrigator stopped holding a charge, no matter how long I charged it.  Overnight charging would result in a &amp;#34;buzzing&amp;#34; sound from the irrigator when I turned it on.  Last week, I decided to call ToiletTree and find out what to do about the problem.  I was very happily surprised; they promised to sent a replacement immediately, as I evidently received a defective device when I originally purchased it.  The new irrigator arrived three days ago, and it is a great upgrade to the one that died!  They finally have a little plug to protect the charging slot, and I feel that&#x27;s a really important protection for any electronic device.  The container for the fluid is larger, and the filler location has been changed to the bottom instead of the top of the device itself, another major improvement.  I charged it overnight per the instructions, and tried it out the next morning, and it works even better than the original device.  I have to say that I am totally and completely impressed with the level of Customer Service at ToiletTree!!!  I fully expected to have to purchase a new irrigator, and was blown away when they sent a replacement after advising me that I originally received a defective device.  You don&#x27;t see that kind of service and support very often, so hats off to ToiletTree for such awesome support!!!  :-Dice at ToiletTree!!!  I fully expected to have to purchase a new irrigator, and was blown away when they sent a replacement after advising me that I originally received a defective device.  You don&#x27;t see that kind of service and support very often, so hats off to ToiletTree for such awesome support!!!  :-D</li>
    <li> got 2 of them.  both lasted about a month.  won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Good for the time it worked, which was under a year.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a $50 product that you have to replace each year.</li>
    <li> Very fast review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The irrigator worked very effectively during the time span it was functioning. My wife has braces and this product definitely helped her clean where bristle or floss would could not get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The irrigator worked for only 4 months. (Hilarious story): It turned on at 2:15 AM on its own, and drove everyone in the house mad. It would not shut off, so they moved it to the barn where no one could hear it. Now it does not run, and when on it just makes a high pitch noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Good product, while it worked. Seriously disappointed at how quickly it failed.</li>
    <li> I initially liked this product and based on the reviews bought it over the competition brands. But after about only 2 months of use, the battery seems to have died. The thing won&#x27;t turn on. The light turns on as if it is charging, but even after charging two nights in a row, all day and all night, it still doesn&#x27;t work. So I gave up. I liked that it was small and took up less space on my counter. Initially it worked fine and I liked using it and didn&#x27;t even have to charge it often. But then the battery started losing it&#x27;s charge faster and faster until it no longer takes a charge. I guess you really do get what you pay for (i.e. it was not expensive). Although, it still should have lasted longer than 2 months!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday after I brush my teeth. It performs well, holds plenty of water and has a great battery life. I would recommend it to anyone. This is a great deal and easily improves oral health and hygiene.</li>
    <li> I have replaced my ToiletteTree Irrigator twice, both times with identical results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the first unit April 4th and the second on May 27th, after the first stopped functioning for no apparent reason.  The second unit lasted only until the date of this posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the many of the features of the unit, i.e. size, tank capacity, rechargeable cordless design, multiple operating modes, and rotating interchangeable nozzles, are quite well designed, the BATTERIES and MOTOR/PUMP are SERIOUSLY deficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the BATTERIES: the units would not hold a charge for more than a one or two weeks at most.  I know enough about rechargeable batteries to first them discharge before recharging.  Nonetheless, even when fully charged the units became significantly less powerful after each recharge cycle.  The batteries are not easily removed as indicated in the Operating Instructions and cannot be be replaced since the are soldered in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second the MOTOR/PUMP: both units stopped functioning for no apparent reason after less than 2 months use.  Neither unit shoots water in any mode and just produce a buzzing sound.  I confirmed that there was no buildup in either units&#x27; filter or nozzle by easily blowing water through the units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these units operated correctly they work as advertised.  But I expected these units to be reliable and to last LONGER than SIX WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fool me twice shame on you.  Fool me thrice, shame on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely an inferior product.  DO NOT BUY this product under any circumstances until the design deficiencies are corrected.</li>
    <li> Stop working in a less than a week.  So, it was waste of my money and afford.  I am extremely sad.</li>
    <li> Terrible product stopped working after 6 months. Save your money and buy something else. There must be better products out there.</li>
    <li> Our unit died. Will only make funny noises and will not pump water. I see that there were defects and they are sending out replacements. How do I request one? Only gave 2 stars because it died. We really liked it and would rate much higher if it lasted.</li>
    <li> Love the product but had trouble with the battery not holding a charge...Contacted the company and they replaced ...Best customer service ever...Highly recommend toilet tree products..</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this item originally.  She liked hers so much that she got more for the whole family.  I love that it is so compact (being that I have a small bathroom) and easy to use.  Would be great for travel too!  My gums are loving the morning massage.</li>
    <li> Worked so great but broken in short period of time so we had to return. Lost my shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy at the Costco.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I bought it and after 1 month using, it stopped working . I contacted service support and they replaced it for a new. Service support was excellent, just hope product follows the service quality level . Unfortunately, after 3 months, this product is facing another problem, it has been turning on alone...it happens several times already. I will through it away in order to avoid a major risk. Hope new version solves the technical problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several WaterPik units and they always die after a few months or just after the one year warranty.  Then I got the Panosonic which lasted the longest and still works however it&#x27;s battery so you have to replace the batteries or use rechargables which isn&#x27;t always convenient.  Anyway this one seems to work well so far, good power etc.  The only thing that is horrible is the refilling.  The refill area is WAY to small and so it gets air bubbles and is just an overall pain even when you pour very slow.</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase. Battery lasts realy long. Very impressed</li>
    <li> This item stopped working after one month of receiving it!  I tried to return it but was told the return policy expired one month after purchase!  Do not waste your money on it.  I had read previous reviews that stated the item was faulty, but I also read where the manufacturer had &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; the initial problems.  The DID NOT FIX anything!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item over six months ago.  It worked great and was very beneficial to use after brushing my teeth.  I feel like it worked better than floss, but I still used it in conjunction with floss.  Unfortunately, it broke after a month or so of use. I believe I was given a full refund from Toiletree.  Several months later, I received a brand new irrigator.  That malfunctioned as well.  I contacted Toiletree again after receiving a request to review the new product I received.  I didn&#x27;t want to leave a bad review for a good product that malfunctioned and the company took responsibility for.  They, in fact, sent me a third oral irrigator.  Thus far, it works fine and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember receiving customer service like this where the company takes such responsibility for the product and they want to get it right.  On top of that, it&#x27;s rechargeable with several modes with differing power.  Thanks to Kelly Parisi at Toiletree for helping me out.  I&#x27;ll definitely look to use this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the super fast response from Toilettree and their excelent service. I was I guess unlucky to happen to have an issue with my irrigator, which happens with just about anything. I wrote them with the explanation of the issue and got an immediate reply &amp;#34;no problem we&#x27;ll replace it&amp;#34;. No hasle at all. I received another one in the in just a few days. The irrigator is very nice, just the right size to take it anywhere. The battery charge lasts very long. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Thank you Steve!!</li>
    <li> This thing started out good.  Nice and powerful water stream.  Had to use the low setting...but now, even with a fully charged battery, the stream is weak and it takes minutes to even empty the tank where it use to take less than a minute.  I&#x27;ve cleaned all the tubes and used the spare tip but nothing has worked.  This is going in the trash unless I can fix it some how.</li>
    <li> Short version of my experience: Bought first irrigator, after three weeks, stopped working. Contacted Kelly from Toilet Tree Public Relations or what not and she politely sent out another one at no cost. Worked perf for another three months then stopped working. Sent another email to Kelly and was send the new generation of irrigator at no charge. Also received a personal letter from their CEO (?) about apologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, they have excellent customer service A+++++++++++++++++++++++ and the irrigator does what it says as long as you keep it dry. Because the power insert is directly below the sprout, it will get wet and messy. As long as you try not to utilize it while shower (you know, multitasking) and try to avoid water from getting inside the insert, it will help prolong the life of the product. &amp;#60;&amp;#60; I say this I think that may be the reason why my first two irrigators stopped working.</li>
    <li> We were bringing our full-size water pik on our camping trips until I found this on Amazon.  It&#x27;s compact yet has a large water reservoir and is very powerful.  Takes up a lot less room.</li>
    <li> I use this product combining a mouthwash and water and I really feel the freshness of a deep cleaning every time I use it. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Works good. I had a problem with a bad battery, toilettree replaced unit without any hassle . Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I simply cannot live without this product!  After careful brushing and flossing, you will be amazed at how much more thorough the Oral Irrigator will clean your teeth.  It&#x27;s fast, convenient to use, and easily rechargeable.  It&#x27;s especially important to own for children&#x27;s dental care, particularly for braces and for older adults with permanent bridges.  This product has become so important to me for several times daily use.  It&#x27;s lightweight - no cords - portable for travel.  I am introducing my entire family &amp; friends to Toilet Tree Products.</li>
    <li> I bought the old one which uses 3 AA batteries. I didn&#x27;t like it, returned and got full refund.&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year later, I received a free new design rechargeable irrigator from Toilettree as a trial gift.&lt;br /&gt;This time, it works very well. Here what I like:&lt;br /&gt;- the jet is powerful, flushes out food debris&lt;br /&gt;- battery lasts 5-7 days between recharges&lt;br /&gt;- large water tank contains enough water per use. (However, It is a bit hard to fill the water. ToiletTree, please fix it!)&lt;br /&gt;- looks nice with the led, buttons.&lt;br /&gt;- ToilletTree&#x27;s customer service is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars and will buy the new design when the current one stops working. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually send in comments on product but I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve had with this Toilettree oral irrigator. I have had receding gums for years creating many issues. I have tried many other \\&quot; water piks\\&quot; and have been repeatedly disappointed with the results,not powerful enough or battery dosen&#x27;t hold the charge etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the 3 pulse modes for my sensitive gums, the water reservoir is large enough yet pratical for travel. More importantly I can see and feel the difference after each use. I&#x27;m ordering two more for my adult children.</li>
    <li> I am nine years old and have a palette expander and braces which makes cleaning my teeth really hard.  But ever since my Mom got me the Oral Irrigator it&#x27;s easier to clean my teeth and I can do a really great job!  It makes cleaning my braces easy and it&#x27;s fun to use!  I even won a prize at my orthodontists office for the best cleaning and it was because of the Oral Irrigator!</li>
    <li> 1.  Don&#x27;t like the units with HOSES - - get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;2.  My DOCTOR said I need to have one (small) drink of alcohol a day for my health.&lt;br /&gt;3.  My DENTIST agrees that - using VODKA in the unit - BOTH cleans my gums, AND gives me just-enough of the alcohol (I don&#x27;t swallow it all!).&lt;br /&gt;4.  As far as problems with the unit? - so far so good - - and - - the MORE I use it, the FEWER problems I notice!</li>
    <li> used waterpick before.  Compare to waterpick-yes ,it is less bulky, but it produce  far less pressure and has smaller water capacity. In general- Ok product ( better for traveling use) , but next time  I would rather buy bulky waterpick ( I want/need more water/jet pressure )</li>
    <li> You are going to think I am weird, but I love flossing my teeth!  I usually carry floss picks with me everywhere I go and have a supply of them stashed in every conceivable place.  After reading that using an oral irrigator was more beneficial than flossing alone, I was intrigued to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was fairly easy to use my oral irrigator right out of the box with minimal effort.  Just snap on a nozzle, add water to the reservoir by either opening the top or by sliding it from the base, and select your operating speed (normal, soft, and pulse).  The instructions suggest charging the base for 8 (eight) hours before first use, but I was too ready to try the product to wait.  After I used it the first time, I did plug it in to charge for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions suggest you leave your mouth slightly open when irrigating, but I found that I got water everywhere when I did that.  Instead I softly closed my lips around the nozzle and systematically worked along the gumline.  Once my mouth was slightly full I would release the water into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to use the irrigator after a meal, so that I could really test its abilities to get in the hard to reach places between my teeth.  Given that I love to floss, I also wanted to judge if using the irrigator was a necessary step to be added to my oral care regimen.  My first step was to actually floss like normal to remove food particles.  Secondly, I filled the water reservoir and turned the irrigator to soft.  Once I felt confident that the speed would not irritate my gums, I chose a higher speed and begin to work through my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I released the water into the bathroom sink, I could see food debris floating in the water.  Success!  The irrigator removed what my floss had left behind.  How crazy is it that I was celebrating the fact that I was able to get more gunk out of my mouth?  I guess for me it was validation that the product could and would live up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You think ToiletTree will produce a pocket size product that I can stash in my purse?</li>
    <li> The different modes take some getting to used to.  It is noisy, as expected, so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it with someone sleeping in the next room.  So far, it holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> Just went to have my teeth cleaned at the dentist the other day and she said in 10 years she&#x27;s never seen my teeth and gums look this good.  The only thing I&#x27;ve been doing differently is using the Oral Irrigator.  Brilliant!</li>
    <li> When I got this \\&quot;Oral Irrigator\\&quot; I was very happy with the price and it worked great. Two day ago it start to malfunction and now will not turn on (fully charged). I&#x27;m one week past the 30 day return for refund policy - so I now have a brick (Thanks Amazon). The way it started to malfunction after I fully charged it was the device lights started flashing and would turn on, they I got it to turn on but I could turn it off for several minutes as I kept pushing the on/off button. Bad electronics - Just avoid this product at all costs. Really save your money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as my Water Pik was on its last leg after 2 years of use. I must admit -  I was surprised with the quality of this irrigator. The power is awesome! With the first use, my teeth felt super clean. I also like that it has different settings. The charge lasts a while too (definitely longer than my old Water Pik did). I have braces and while my dentist has always been amazed at how clean my teeth are, I feel like they&#x27;re even more clean now. This is a must-have product for anyone with any kind of dental appliances.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for one week, but so far, I like it better than the handheld water pik.&lt;br /&gt;The real test will be how long it continues to take a charge, which was the problem with the water pik.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: three easily controlled settings, water reservoir stays open after use to dry inside.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: this is minor, but the unit is white and blue and the cord is black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after using six months, I have the following additional comments:&lt;br /&gt;The soft setting is too soft.&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge for several days.&lt;br /&gt;Tank is hard to fill. The small opening at the top tends to form a water bubble, and prevents water from going in, causing a lot of waste and mess.&lt;br /&gt;Unless I blow dry it inside after every use, it has a slight musty odor and taste, even if I leave the lid open to air dry. Yuck!</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this unit. I especially like the ergonomic feel in my arthritic hands. The variable speeds are powerful, yet gentle enough to be effective on my dental bridge and it has been holding its charge for over two weeks now.  After spraying the bathroom mirror a few times, I finally got the hang of it. It is easy to use and easy to fill and stores away compactly. It is also perfect to take while travelling.</li>
    <li> To begin with I&#x27;ve used WaterPik Plus for years now and the only complaint I had there was that the Batteries failed after about a year or so. I thought I&#x27;d try this unit to see if it fared any better. No joy there, it failed after about a month. I have extensive bridgework, so I look to the unit to replace the awkward floss threaders the dentist gives you. My critique will be a comparison between the ToiletTree unit and the comparably priced WaterPik Plus. (I&#x27;ll assume that the quick failure was a luck of the draw MTBF glitch and go on its functional merits)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Gets the job done (though I think the WaterPik does it better).&lt;br /&gt;-Smaller footprint than the WaterPik if your shelf is crowded.&lt;br /&gt;-Charge light is bright enough for a Nite light.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Reservoir fills from the top and is too tall to fit under many Bathroom taps, so you need to keep a fill cup handy.&lt;br /&gt;-Fill hole is small and unvented so you have to pour slow and steady (just a minor pain I guess).&lt;br /&gt;-Looses power quickly after charging , I had to charge about every 3 days to keep it working to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;-Power button is stiff and not very prominent. Hard to find and click off while using the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I found the user experience of the device subpar and probably would have replaced it with another WaterPik even if it hadn&#x27;t failed. Sorry ToiletTree (Seriously, who picked that name? The visual I get from it not very flattering).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who just started wearing a pair of Herbst.  It is hard to reach under the device so his orthodontist recommeded to get a water floss.  After reading many reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with this product.  Well, it is now sitting on the bathroom&#x27;s counter and collecting dust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it was difficult to make it work; I had to reassemble the unit a few times before it stopped leaking.  After a few trys, I finally was able to make it work.  I tried to show how to use it to my son!  Oh my; it is powerful; I read someone said her daughter can&#x27;t use it because it hurts.  I am an adult and thought it hurts. But the pain was nothing comparing to the mess.  The water splashes everywhere!  His bathroom floor, mirror, and counter was soaked by the time we finally finished one cycle.  Then, he looked at me and said, \\&quot;Mom, I will start using a regular floss now.  This is too much.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hoped it would work. The concept is good but not the product and its design.</li>
    <li> We have owned several battery operated water tooth cleaners and this is by far the best in terms of battery life and ease and comfort of use.  We each used it twice a day for a full week and it is still fresh and ready to go.  The different strengths are great for all needs.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. It does not take up a lot of room on my sink. When charged the battery life last a long time. When using it does not feel like my gums are being hit with pins.</li>
    <li> AMAZON should yank this product as it is DEFECTIVE. Many of the one and two star reviews are written in the last 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and happily order this product.  Within 2 weeks I ordered another for our second home since I loved this item.  But then the trouble started.  The unit would go off in the middle of the night spraying the bathroom walls and I couldn&#x27;t turn it off.  Once I got it off it would start back up a few minutes later and do the same thing again, again and again.  I eventually had to move it downstairs so we could sleep.  Not fun in the middle of the night.  Our dog gets up and leaves the bedroom when he hears it starting up on its own.  Other times I can&#x27;t get the product on or the flow speed changes between the three settings.  Something is truly DEFECTIVE with this product.  One of the units blinks all the time regardless of the charge level and no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the 1-800 number and the customer service person is very pleasant and quickly offered to mail a replacement.  The first three units (I ordered two and 1 replacement) are not working after a month or so.  Two more replacments came in the mail yesterday.  I am not too hopeful.  It is a shame as I really loved how this product worked.  My gums felt great and I looked forward to using it.  Maybe they can get the problem fixed, but not in time for me I am afraid.  My advise:  Stay clear of this product for the time being.</li>
    <li> I bought this product before going on vacation since it is compact for packing.  I didn&#x27;t want to bring my Waterpik that I use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works just as well as the full size WaterPik.  I do need to fill it twice to complete the task.  Took a couple of tries to find the sweet spot as to where to position it during use.  It is easier to fill when I remove the tank.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oral irrigator to replace a WaterPik model that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  This oral irrigator works very well and only has to be charged every three weeks.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the fact that it has three different settings. I also like the fact that it shows when it needs to be charged and then shows when it is fully charged.  My WaterPik did neither.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Worked ok for less than 2 months. Now it will not take a charge. Already disposed of the packaging so I guess I&#x27;m out of luck. Also got one for my wife and its still working for now. One out of two only rates 1 star in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Steve from ToiletTree products contacted me very shortly after I reviewed the product. He is sending a replacement right away. I must admit that I am very impressed with his attitude toward customer service. I am changing my rating and will consider raising it again if the replacement seems to last. My wife likes her unit and she had hers a little bit longer than I had mine. In fact I bought the second one as we were so pleased with the first.</li>
    <li> WORKED FINE AT FIRST, BUT DIED IN LESS THAN 2 MONTHS. NOW WHEN YOU TURN IT ON IT JUST BUZZES.&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED. I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK AT MY EXPENSE TO TOILETTREE TO GET IT REPLACED.&lt;br /&gt;HOPE I HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH THE SECOND ONE. I AGREE WITH THE REVIEWERS WHO SAID IT IS&lt;br /&gt;DIFFICULT TO FILL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: THE DAY AFTER POSTING THIS REVIEW I WAS CONTACTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF TOILETREE.&lt;br /&gt;THROUGH AN AMAZON EMAIL HE SAID HE WAS SORRY THAT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE IRRIGATOR&lt;br /&gt;AND WOULD SEND A NEW ONE RIGHT AWAY. ALSO HE SAID HE WOULD PAY FOR THE RETURN OF THE&lt;br /&gt;DEFECTIVE UNIT.&lt;br /&gt;A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED A NEW IRRIGATOR BY PRIORITY MAIL.  GREAT SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;HE ALSO SAID THAT THEY HAD MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE IRRIGATOR.</li>
    <li> The charge on this portable has lasted for a couple of months now without charging.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for travel.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Irrigator about 1 year ago before a 1 month trip. The product worked as expected and was a blessing during my trip. It is relatively small and light, simple to pack. It did not require re-charging. Occasionally I had to fill it up twice, no major deal. The jet is strong enough to remove food remains. I researched a lot before buying it and I am very happy with it. Just recently I wanted to recharge it for another trip and I could not find the charger. I was very annoyed and called the company wanting to order a replacement. They offered to send one immediately at no charge. Great customer service. Based on my experience I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs a travel water-pik.</li>
    <li> Used it often enough for a year. Does not pump anymore. Unscrewed the bottom to try fixing it. No dice. It&#x27;s not coming back to life. I was happy when it worked though.  Light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Loved the way this product makes my teeth feel after use. Squeaky clean.  Will continue to used.</li>
    <li> Very hard to fill.  Even when I keep it open it smells mildewy. However it is convenient and fits in my suitcase easily. I use it for travel only.</li>
    <li> First of all it never really worked that great. Second, I bought in February 2013 and it stopped working in September of 2013. Don&#x27;t waste your money just spend the extra $10-$15 and get a Waterpick!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in August 2012. It worked great for a few months. I only recharged it when it was fully discharged. Then in December it would not charge at all. I called the company (Toiletree) and they promptly apologized and sent a replacement. Six months later the same thing happened. Again another notice to the company and they replied that they have improved the model with a larger reservoir and would send me a replacement. I was glad that they improved their product and was positive that this new and improved model will last longer than the last 2. Wrong. Now it&#x27;s December 2013 and the oral irrigator will not turn on after it&#x27;s fully charged. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in the buttons or the charging. I expect this product to last longer than 6 months, are my expectations unreasonable? I&#x27;m tired of contacting the company over and over. Very disappointed. Looking for another manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Great for travel, but doesn&#x27;t spray as well as the home version. Better than nothing. Have to keep charged. Wish it held more water. The company has excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> This seems to work fairly well to remove food particles, feels good on the teeth and gums, and holds a charge for quite a while.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GREAT FOR SHORT BURST, BUT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE POWER OF A ELECTRIC POWERED WATER PICK.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD FOR TRIP&#x27;S OR CAMPING, I JUST PERFER MY LARGE SIZE ONE.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, but there is a build issue with the power button that can cause the unit to turn on independently and sometimes will not turn off.  ToiletTree has been great with their customer service however and new production units are expected this month.</li>
    <li> I have always had bad gums. I guess it&#x27;s just genetics because try as I may, I always seem to have issues. Gum disease can be very dangerous and so it&#x27;s just as important to keep them healthy as it is your teeth - actually more important! Without one you can&#x27;t have the other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygenist suggested a water flosser because it would help get anything left behind below the gum surface as well as stir up any bacteria so it doesn&#x27;t settle there for better gum and teeth health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the Gurin rechargeable water flosser was good because when I tested it, it actually had rechargeable batteries in it and already charged. That never happens! It comes with a charger so you can just plug it in to recharge but I haven&#x27;t had to do that yet after a couple weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with three operating modes: normal, soft and pulse. I figured I&#x27;d start with soft until I got used to it. It&#x27;s easy to fill with water and then just make your selection for mode and turn it on. Here is where I learned lesson number one the hard way. You have to put it IN your mouth FIRST! I turned it on and it shot water all over my mirror. In retrospect that one was obvious but let that be a lesson to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned it off, put it in my mouth and then turned it on. It takes some getting used to so there is a learning curve and it puts out more water than I expected so you can just do a small section, turn it off, spit and repeat. After a few uses I had it down where I could do it more quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an appointment coming up in a week with my hygenist so I&#x27;m curious to see if this makes a difference. Good dental health is important to me so I&#x27;m glad the Gurin Water Flosser can help maintain and support my gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> When my daughter got braces this summer, I started looking for a product that would help her with oral hygiene. This oral irrigator had good reviews so we purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have children with braces who don&#x27;t want to floss, this could be a great product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, tonight, just about 3 months after she started using the product, it has stopped working. The motor makes a buzzing sound, but no water comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is inexcusable and I will try to contact ToiletTree products tomorrow to see if I can get a replacement. As much as I would like to recommend this product because it really works well for kids with braces, I cannot recommend something that breaks after only 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the customer service at Toilet Tree. I called to let them know about the problem and they immediately sent out a replacement unit. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s now been another 6 weeks and the tip of the unit will not stay in place during use unless you hold it. If you don&#x27;t hold it, you can injure your teeth. Hopefully the motor in this new unit will last a while.</li>
    <li> I bought the irrigator from Amazon about a month ago.  It arrived well packaged.  It seems very well made.  It only took a minute to figure out how to use it effectively.  I started on the SOFT setting because even that has good pressure if you are not used to these.  In the past week I have switched to NORMAL and wouldn&#x27;t want a stronger stream.  I can usually get through my entire mouth on one tankful, occasionally I need to refill it if I feel my teeth/gums need an extra heavy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as recharging - I haven&#x27;t needed to yet!  I did the initial charge after receiving it, and used 5-6 days a week it&#x27;s been going strong 3 or 4 weeks now.  No need to pack the charger for vacations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!!  Worth the price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know if there is any difference between the tip with the blue on it vs the tip with the green? They seemed the same to me on visual inspection, but I haven&#x27;t tried both back to back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 6/18/2013&lt;br /&gt;So far so GREAT.  It continues to work perfectly.  I have not had one issue with it.  The tank size is great, now that I am efficient at its use I can easily get my whole mouth very clean on one tankful.  The battery continues to last a nice long time, I only charge about once every 10-14 days.  My last dentist checkup was excellent and the hygienist commented that my gums were looking good.  I hate flossing, so many days this is done instead of flossing (yes I realize irrigating and flossing isn&#x27;t the same exactly, but this does get little food chunks out from between teeth).  One of my favorite purchases EVER.</li>
    <li> I used this product once per day for about two months. However, it soon stopped working. The on/off button seems to be the problem. At first it would start after I pressed the button more than ten times, and now it just won&#x27;t turn on. Obviously, I cannot recommend this product</li>
    <li> My wife and I share this product.  I find that one fill is sufficient, while she finds that she needs two fills, which is a bit of a pain.  When the unit is fully charged it works very well, but after two days of use (4 iterations or 6 fills for the two of us), it needs to be recharged to be as effective as we want.  That is the only disappointment - we wish the recharge life was better.  All in all we find it much easier to use than flossing and just as effective.</li>
    <li> This product I bought due to my dentist&#x27;s request. I have had gum problems and this seemed a good buy due to cost and efficiency. Upon using it for a couple months I have to say it was a fantastic buy. It has built up my gums sufficiently to be flossed normally. Additionally, when I don&#x27;t have time to floss, I use the Oral Irrigator for a quick job. I highly recommend this product, word of advice: don&#x27;t set it to pulse. There is no real advantage to having it at that setting (just my opinion though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Oral Irrigator for 8 months and it died. However, this was due to a malfunction that had occurred amongst most of their Irrigators. During those 8 months, the function of the Irrigator was great and has greatly improved my gums. Once the Irrigator died, I emailed the company about the problem and they sent me a new one free of charge. They have great customer service and I highly recommend buying from them. (They remain at 5 stars in my opinion)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short. It works awsome, battery last a for a week or more on a single charge. Strong motor and large water tank. Yesterday it randomly started to turn on and cant turn it off, recharged and still the same. Hope i get a replacement cause i really liked it.</li>
    <li> I have had this Toilet Tree oral irrigator for a year now.  It is a very good product.  It has great battery life and a very powerful stream. I have had a similar sized WaterPic brand irrigator and this is a superior tool with a better price!</li>
    <li> The unit was working very well. Then I had trouble with the battery: it just stopped charging after three or four months. I called customer service and received immediate attention. I just received the new unit ( with no charge for replacement or shipping), and I am pleased so far. I am very happy with the customer service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sleek and well styled, and easy to use.  The water tank capacity is a bit small for me, and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long (it won&#x27;t work while it&#x27;s charging) but it&#x27;s effective and compact.  I like it better than the bulky water piks, but it is kind of messy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this irrigator in March of this year (2013)... Today, September 22nd, it died...it simply stopped working..it will not charge at all. Actually, it never did have great water pressure to begin with...I definitely do not recommend this product. in my mind it is a waste of money.  I had a WaterPik for years [close to 20] and got rid of it because it got ratty looking...but it did work. I still don&#x27;t know what possessed me to buy a different brand.  You have a chance to learn from my mistake... I&#x27;m going back to WaterPik.</li>
    <li> Not much power, Water Pik spoiled me. I don&#x27;t care for it, save your $$$. It does not clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> stopped working after a few months.  I now have one that sits on the back of my sink and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this irrigator for over 6 months and it still works great. It&#x27;s very effective and well worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator worked great for me for about 6 months.  I used it 3-5x/week and It would only need charged every several weeks.  Unfortunately, the battery seemed to give out and it refused to hold any charge at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the customer service to be outstanding.  I emailed them, nearly a year after I purchased the device (I procrastinated getting it returned), and they immediately sent me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that the new device has a slightly different cord that is incompatible with the old cord &amp; socket.  I&#x27;m hopeful that this means the issue has been fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the device 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t stopped working, or 3 stars if the company hadn&#x27;t replaced it.  Given the great service, I think 4 stars is appropriate.  I don&#x27;t know of any similar device, and it has really works well until it doesn&#x27;t.  It seems to me that although rechargeable batteries have come a long way, none of them seem to last forever and devices like this are probably doing well if they work for a year or two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it about 2 years ago. After one year it broke, but customer service was amazing and they sent me not just new, but a new model. Another one still works like new. Powerful enough, tank is even bigger than I need.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I got braces. It&#x27;s powerful, holds enough water to finish every space in my teeth, and gets food out from between my braces that brushing my teeth wont do! It&#x27;s also less messier than using my electric toothbrush which is great to use after meals.&lt;br /&gt;This flosser is probably better than flossing despite my super crowded teeth, but after the first few weeks, the water stopped shooting out despite the motor running and the charge being full.&lt;br /&gt;I asked for a replacement but the company just refunded my money. Now the price on Amazon is higher so I guess I either pay more or do without a flosser.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but my unit died after about 2 months. I called their toll-free number, and it was answered by a real person after 2 rings. That in itself is amazing. They were very apologetic and said they would send a replacement out right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that sometimes there are problems, but great, personal customer service is a wonderful thing in this world of being on hold or disconnected after touch-toning your way through 15 layers of menus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the company for that alone!</li>
    <li> Very good product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the water runs out very quickly. But this is my first water pik so this might be normal. I have nothing to base it from. But very powerful and I love how its chargeable.</li>
    <li> This irrigator exceeded my expectations - the initial charge lasted 3 months! (daily 20 second use). I had two Waterpiks before which had to be recharged after two weeks and only worked for one year each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great. It is compact and made with quality. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> 1st one, it stopped one day &amp; would not work, bought 2nd and same thing happened.  Emptied it out after using&lt;br /&gt;It , let dry out and all of a sudden it started to work again.  Is this reason ? I had trouble?&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it works well now!</li>
    <li> My experience with oral irrigators in general is very limited given the fact that I have been only using them for 2 years now, nonetheless I felt compelled to write a short review regarding the ToiletTree Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator. I bought this ToiletTree product after using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. Although the Waterpik worked well, eventually it stopped working. I chose not to go with the Waterpik because I couldn&#x27;t stand the fact that I could not use it while I was taking a shower. In other words, it wasn&#x27;t cordless. So I decided to try the ToiletTree Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator after reading some of the Amazon reviews. When I received it, I held it in my hands and played with it for a while. Compared to the Waterpik, it felt bulky and awkward. At that point I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like using it. Fast-forwards 5 months later and I am used to the bulky and awkward ToiletTree Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator and I am sold on its ease of use and functionality. I am also sold on the affordable price of this product and I am not sure I would want to try anything else knowing that this one meets my expectations(and almost exceeds my expectations. More on this later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three issues with this oral irrigator. It looks cheap and I wish it was made here in the good old USA. I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more if I knew it was made here. The third issue I have with this oral irrigator is the charging capacity. Unless I have a faulty unit, I can only use it once between charges. I would expect the charge to last longer considering that it takes 8 hours to fully charge. It is annoying that I only get one use every time I use it. When I try to use it again off the same charge, the water pressure is dissapointingly weak. Hence, the reason for my 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> Just like the title says this waster glosser feels like your power washing your teeth! It&#x27;s great so far... I always had a difficult time remembering to floss- it was annoying and painful... Now I floss at least once a day. I have only had this a few weeks so I cannot say whether or not it will die-- I hope it will last!</li>
    <li> Loved this Oral Irrigator was very convenient but quit working after only three months.  My last Waterpick brand lasted 10 years.  Would not buy from this manufacturer again will go back to the Waterpick Brand.</li>
    <li> My husband used this waterpick about 3 times a week and it already has conked out! The water no longer comes out the tip and the battery is fully charged! Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> My mom mentioned in passing that she missed her cordless Waterpik, which died a while back.  Ding, ding, ding!  Christmas gift idea.  I ended up getting her an Airfloss by Sonicare, but that didn&#x27;t cut it.  You have to push the button every time you spray.  What&#x27;s up with that??  So, I had her send it back and started researching cordless oral irrigators more deeply.  I found this and was impressed by the good reviews. Yes, there are some bad ones, but the customer service to fix/replace them is amazing so I decided to order one for myself and give it a try before telling my mom.  I have used it for a few weeks now and love it.  If I want to do a quick rinse, I can do it on one fill.  The usual is two..one each for front/back or upper/lower (whatever my mood!).  If I want a really good workout, I&#x27;ll fill it a few times and just clean away.  I have used all power levels and like them all.  At first the strongest was a bit much but it&#x27;s fine now.  So, I had my mom check it out on Amazon and compare it to Waterpik and see what she wanted me to get her.  She decided this one was the way to go.  So, she has one now, and word is that she loves it as well.  We are both confident that if a problem arises, the company will back their product and make us whole.  My mouth feels so clean after use and then I use a good mouthwash afterwards.  I love how clean my mouth and gums feel.</li>
    <li> I used to be a fan of Waterpik since they were the first brand of oral irrigators I&#x27;ve ever heard of but after the last Waterpik I had to replace because the rechargeable battery life was so short, I decided to try something different. I ordered the Toilet Tree rechargeable oral irrigator in Sept. 2012 and was impressed by how much it removed from between my teeth. It&#x27;s more powerful than the Waterpik design.  However, in Feb. 2013, it just stopped. Fully charged and just stopped working.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed that the unit only lasted half a year and just ordered another brand on Amazon.  However, when I called Toilet Tree I was left speechless at how accommodating, polite and nice customer service was!  I explained what happened and I&#x27;m to receive a replacement in a few days time.  WOW!  I will be canceling my Amazon order for the other brand and will give Toilet Tree another chance.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about six months ago.  Was very satisfied with it until about a week ago.  Since then I&#x27;ve had to charge it up every day.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why until it woke me up buzzing one night.  I had to push several buttons to get it to quit. It&#x27;s done this repeatedly now for the last several days!  It will turn itself on and buzz until it runs out of charge.  I&#x27;m reluctant to buy another one for fear the same thing will happen!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this irrigator long enough to really give the product itself a definite thumbs up or thumbs down, but the seller was prompt in sending the item and it was securely packaged. Had no trouble getting it charged up overnight, and after using it a couple of times it seems to have enough \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; to do the job. Now I just have to get the hang of using it without splattering water all over the place. If any issues arise with re-charging or burning out, I will update this review, but it seems fine thus far.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. However it stopped working after few months using. According to the policy, you have one month to return the product. This is really unfair. I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> nThe Toiletree irrigator worked great for about  6 weeks and then it simply stopped working. It would charge at all or sometimes would take a short charge, work for 10 seconds and then just die again. Next time, I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and get a better made, reliable product. I do not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> This was delivered fast, works as promised, holding a battery charge for over a week now.  My wish is that the water still pumped out when you are holding it upside down for hard to reach areas in the mouth .... when the water is halfway drained and you hold it too sideways or upside down the motor revs up but no water comes out until you switch positions. Perfect strong force but I find myself filling up the reservoir twice in order to complete a cleaning.  Good for travel.  Nice to have no wires on the countertop.</li>
    <li> Very effective and I love the high capacity water tank, I had a stand model and it was a hassel when traveling dragging it all over being so bulky but now I just use this daily and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work. The idea of irrigating with a portable device like this that i could use in the shower, rather than flossing was very appealing to me. The product worked fine initially. After about two months it had electrical problems with intermittent charging or no charging at all or sometimes it was charged but just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I just couldn&#x27;t count on it working properly every day and this was quite frustrating. I sent for four more new replacements and all ended up disappointing me. So now I&#x27;m back to using my stationary water pic next to my sink that&#x27;s connected to an electrical out let. Maybe I should try the Water pic portable model to see if they&#x27;re better made.</li>
    <li> It has made my flossing so much easier.  An amazing product all the way around.  Battery life is excellent.  For those who complain that it&#x27;s messy and splashes everywhere, I&#x27;m sorry but you are really clumsy.  I use this over the sink and have zero issues with messy splashes.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention I love this product? ....well I do!</li>
    <li> I have previously had Water-Pik devices both the tub kind and the portable, and although the irrigation provided was good, both of them were not durable and failed after a year without recourse to get a replacement under warranty.  So I was looking for a good replacement that was reasonably priced and had a good history of durability and customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Toiletree irrigator here on Amazon and based on the reviews and excellent price I decided to give it a try.  I have used it now for almost 2 years with excellent results -- I am much happier with it than the Water-Pik products.  Unfortunately a few days ago the electrical input to the device overheated and fried the connection.  This was disappointing, but I was cautiously optimistic about getting a free replacement under their &amp;#34;no questions asked&amp;#34; replacement policy.  Sounded too good to be true, but nothing ventured, nothing gained.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got off the phone with them and it was probably the BEST customer service experience I have had in a long, long time.  First of all --  A REAL PERSON ANSWERED THE PHONE .  Secondly, I was NOT transferred to another department or another person -- she took care of everything right then and there -- very pleasantly and competently.  I explained the problem and said I would like to get a replacement sent out.  She apologized and said it would be no problem.  She asked for my Amazon order number to verify purchase and simply asked where I would like the replacement sent and I gave her my address.  I said I assumed it would take a week or so --  and another surprise -- she said the order would be processed today and shipped priority so I&#x27;ll have it in a few days!!  She apologized once again for the unit failing and asked if there was anything else I needed.  I thanked her very much and said I would write a very positive review.  She was thrilled to hear it and thanked me again.  AMAZING experience overall.</li>
    <li> I love using and discovering new products from ToiletTree Products. And their new Rechargeable Oral Irrigator did not disappoint me. I love the fact I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive batteries to use this device and that the rechargeable irrigator stays charged for over a month(45+ days), so no need to have a cord all over my bathroom everyday. AND it comes with two interchangeable nozzles, so that my husband and I can use the same device. The nozzles come with different color rings on them, making it easy to know which one is yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;But how does it feel? Does it work?\\&quot; I&#x27;m sure those are some questions you&#x27;d like answered. I love the feel. There are 3 setting and all three feel nice on the gums, like a Pulse. I could also see a lot of grim come out of my teeth (not so yellow after using), so I would say it works too. On top of that I have very very crowded teeth and I love that it gets in between them all.&lt;br /&gt;I do warn you though, it takes a while to get use to using it and I had many a water mess in my bathroom the first few times. But now it&#x27;s all great and I love using it every chance I get.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend the NEW Rechargeable Oral Irrigator by ToiletTree products. Great for your teeth and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;* Disclaimer / Disclosure: I received a free sample to facilitate my review.

    <li> Great product so far!  I&#x27;ve bought a few different ToiletTree products over the last year and continue to be really happy with them.  Another great product.  What will they come up with next?!</li>
    <li> This product does a very good job.  I would give it five stars if the water reservoir was larger.  On \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; pressure the water lasts about 50 seconds.  This setting is probably more pressure than you would want, almost painful.  On \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; the water lasts just short of 2 minutes.  This is a good pressure but it would be better if the water lasted longer.  The good news is that it is easy to refill the unit so the small reservoir is mostly an inconvenience.  Otherwise it does a great job of cleaning everything between the teeth.  The battery arrived with a charge that has held for several full uses plus some test runs.  The rotating head means it can be pointed at any angle.  This is of somewhat limited advantage since you can simply hold the unit in the direction you want.  The head does not rotate on its own.  I have no regrets for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 1, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product August 10, 2012 and was very impressed.  Within about three weeks it died.  It would buzz but not pump water.  I called ToiletTree and they sent a new one, I believe overnight and I didn&#x27;t even need to send the bad one back.  Great service!  The new one worked for about a week then stopped.  This time it didn&#x27;t buzz and didn&#x27;t pump water.  I thought maybe it needed recharging but that didn&#x27;t make any difference.  I guess I should have called ToiletTree again but I just left it slide.  I keep looking at the two dead devised sitting there and thinking I should just through them out.  It was great while it worked but $40 for two paper weights is too much.</li>
    <li> i HAD BEEN USING THE ORAL B IRRAGATION SYSTEM FOR MY GUMS, AND IT HAD BROKE.  I WENT ONTO AMAZON AND FOUND TOILETTREE IRRIGATOR AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY.  WELL LET ME TELL YOU -MY GUMS HAVE NEVER FELT BETTER.  THE SWELLING THAT I USUALLY EXPERIENCE IN THE FOOD POCKETS IN BETWEEN MY TEETH ARE NORMAL - I DON&#x27;T EVEN THINK THE FOOD POCKETS ARE THERE ANY LONGER.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED MY ORDER IN THREE DAYS (JUST AS THEY SAID I WOULD) AND IT ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  I WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND AGAIN.  I WOULD PURCHASE THEIR IRRAGATION SYSTEM AGAIN AND AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIVE IT A TRY - YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I bought three of the ToiletTree Irrigators for my family because of the favorable reviews. However, mine stopped working after bearly a month of use.  The power light comes on but it won&#x27;t propel water out.  I would like to receive a replacement.  Please respond.</li>
    <li> Out of the box this product worked great. After 29 days of use it was time for a recharge. After 8 hrs of recharge, it worked perfectly. When I turned it off after using it, I left some water in the tank. I stepped out of the bathroom and a few seconds later I heard it go back on. I ran back to the bathroom and found it sitting on the sink, spurting water all over the room. I turned it off and sure enough it went on again. I contacted Amazon and they authorized me to return it. This morning I sealed it in a box and took it to the UPS store. As I was walking into the store, it turned on inside of the box. I explained to the clerk that not to worry, there was an oral irrigator inside with a mind of its own. He smiled and gave me a receipt for the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the manufacturer can solve the problem, as I really liked the product, when it worked!</li>
    <li> My dentist advised me to get ahydro floss system and recommended the Hydro floss system.  Since i also travel, I wanted one that could be portable.  This one works VERY welll.  Easy to use.  Easy to clean. And since seeing my dentist he likes the change</li>
    <li> My first irrigator and I love it. It replaced floss for me, and works better. It is a little brisk on the gums, though you can turn it down. I like to run it across the tongue too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ran a little short of a week on a charge, but then the battery died so maybe it lasts longer. It uses a plug and not the stand that I would prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit stopped charging after 31 days (no kidding), and so I emailed toilettree, and they immediately offered to ship a replacement. Rare these days. No hassle. They even say on their site that they&#x27;ve redesigned their old model, and just send yours in for a free replacement! Who does that?</li>
    <li> This unit was great while it worked.  Within 25 days of receipt it stopped working, the on/off and mode button became unresponsive, even though the unit was fully charged.  Toilettree promptly offered a replacement unit.  If the replacement lasts, I&#x27;ll change this review to a 4 or 5 star review because, when working, this seems effective and is VERY convenient.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on August 25th, 2012. At first it worked fine, although I felt the water reservoir was a little difficult to fill. By the beginning of October, it was having trouble maintaining a charge as evidenced by a weak output. I found that I had to leave it plugged in. Last night it wouldn&#x27;t start when I pushed the on button. About an hour later it started on its own and I was unable to shut it off. The device is rather noisy so I had to stick it in a kitchen drawer so we could sleep. It eventually shut off. This thing lasted less than 3 months, wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 12/8/12- After receiving an email from the president of ToiletTree, I was hoping to to give this product a higher rating. Here are our emails (I removed my email address and name, otherwise copied as sent to me)-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From: \\&quot;ToiletTree Products - Amazon Marketplace\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Sent: Thursday, November 08, 2012 11:47 AM&lt;br /&gt;Subject: Information from Amazon seller ToiletTree Products (Order:&lt;br /&gt;105-7058857-6484260)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good morning&lt;br /&gt;I just saw your review on Amazon and I wanted to get right back to you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sorry for the issue with the irrigator. I want to make this  right. We have made some changes/improvements to the irrigator to avoid the problem you spoke about and would like to send you a brand new unit at no cost.

What at first seemed like great customer service, is really false. I would not recommend this product or the company.</li>
    <li> Just right for me. I do not have much space in my bathroom. I had a previous water pick that worked well, but took up room, had to be plugged in and was too large to travel. This item, I admit is a bit limited in water capacity, but is sufficient and all the other features are \\&quot;just right\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Mine went bad after a few months, but the company let me trade it in for the bigger edition, which I&#x27;m very happy I have. Does a great job!</li>
    <li> Just got my braces off a few days ago, and was looking to replace my water irrigator. At the time, whilst I was shopping around, I thought waterpik was the only choice available. That&#x27;s when I found this water irrigator by ToiletTree. It&#x27;s lower in price, and higher in value by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the two systems is so great, I&#x27;m going to give you a review line by line. I really wish I would have known about this when I started, instead of after, but it will help me with my retainer. So those with braces, retainers, or just like water irrigator&#x27;s listen up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik:&lt;br /&gt;I currently have (throwing out soon) the waterpik that you plug into the wall with the full tank. This should be a reference point for those reading, as I did not have the portable waterpik, because it didn&#x27;t produce the same amount of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspects the TolietTree Irrigator produces, compared to Waterpik:&lt;br /&gt;1. Easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Yes,it is portable, but that isn&#x27;t the reason I am saying this, it&#x27;s actually because of the grip, and the lack of spill. Waterpik&#x27;s system is difficult to use on maximum power, without creating a flooding water mess of your sink. And for those of you who recently purchased a waterpik, you might want to know that the handle that holds your device to the water tank, is going to brake off. Happens everytime, with all of my friends too, and it isn&#x27;t because we are rough. Waterpik just uses cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Nicer design.&lt;br /&gt;This may seem like a vanity point, but it isn&#x27;t. The materials this water irrigator is made from, isn&#x27;t as cheap as the waterpik, and doesn&#x27;t mold. Yep, that&#x27;s right mold. Unless you thoroughly wash your waterpik out once a week, even if you aren&#x27;t using it for a while, it will form mold in the top pockets of the lid that covers the tank. Think I&#x27;m lying? Try it out, it&#x27;s disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Better choices for irrigation.&lt;br /&gt;This device has three motor options, a regular high function irrigation, I&#x27;d compare to a 9 on the waterpik, and then a pulse setting, which is perfect for those of you whom have braces, and need to work around the brackets, and then the third setting which is a soft, which I&#x27;d say would be meant more for newbies in the first week, and even those with retainers. (You can use this to hose off your retainer whilst washing, instead of using all hands, which will reduce the likliehood of you breaking your retainer and spending $150-600 to repair or replace it.) Plus the soft setting would be awesome for those who have dentures, areas around crowns, veneers, and those with mild gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The charge quality.&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to get a water irrigator, it may seem like a good idea to get the kind that always needs to be plugged in, but I promise you will regret that decision. It always stays in my bathroom right? Wrong. The one time you need to use it for travel, or need to move, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about the hard way. They have the same amount of power regardless of what the box tells you. I&#x27;v used both back to back, and they are putting out the exact same amount of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips that might make you puzzled when the ToiletTree water irrigator arrives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The fill tank is very small. I&#x27;m a traveller, and because of this, I have a portable iron. With the portable iron, came a small cup, that I could use to fill it with water, and I use that to fill this. You can either go the same route and pour water slowly from a cup, as I would not suggest you use hardwater from a tap, or you can remove the tank from the drevice, and then snap it back into place when full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does take time to charge, and you can&#x27;t use it whilst on the charger. I believe this is a good safety feature, as the water if being used whilst charging would have the potential to run down to the charge plug, which is located in the front of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It comes with a replacement head, so use it. Don&#x27;t necessarily use one until you cannot any longer and then throw it away to use the other. If you do this, you run the risk of loosing the spare head in the meantime. Instead trade off every couple weeks, for instance, when you are cleaning the system out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing, it&#x27;s cheaper than waterpik, and I&#x27;m glad I finally learned about it! :)n&#x27;t necessarily use one until you cannot any longer and then throw it away to use the other.

    <li> When my water pik broke I was seariously thinking of replacing with the same model. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. This irrigator is much, much better. We have limited space in our bathroom. This unit is compact and I like that there is no wires to watch out for. The water tank is adequate and the different speeds do a good job of cleaning between the teeth and stimulating the gums. My dentist highly recommends using and irrigator. Can&#x27;t wait to tell him about about this product from ToiletTree.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well and is worth the price. I&#x27;ll use it after brushing and my teeth and gums feel so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> Bought this about two month ago. It worked fine for 4 weeks. Then, one night, it started operating on it&#x27;s own. Couldn&#x27;t stop it by it&#x27;s on-off switch and finally had to open it and cut off the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that this happened because of a short circuit caused by water or bad quality. I expected that an irrigating product should be a little waterproof.&lt;br /&gt; It is a bad quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Naf&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007ZRZSR6 Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree Products]]</li>
    <li> I had the Waterpik brand rechargeable tool and it lasted a little less than a year.  I then thought I&#x27;d look for what else was on the market and found the TouletTree product with far better reviews.  I gave it a shot!  I&#x27;m not too impressed.  The unit could not hold a powerful charge.  After 25 days of use, even after being fully charged it had the power and pressure of my Waterpik unit after 8 months of use - very low and borderline pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the hole to fill water is way to small and has a tiny door to open to fill it that wasn&#x27;t designed with usability in mind.  It has the tiniest of lips to catch with your fingernail to open it.  The water pic head also didn&#x27;t shoot as directly as the Waterpik unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was something better than both this product and its competition.  Niether holds a charge for more than a use or two.  I&#x27;ve tried both, and found the Waterpik product to be superior; easier to fill, more powerful and higher pressure spray heads allowing access to clean inside rows of teeth.</li>
    <li> I now have two Oral Irrigators from ToiletTree Products -- one in each home! That bitch gets stuff out of my teeth that even the dentist might have trouble finding.  Makes my teeth clean and shine and perfect for my RGYC grills.</li>
    <li> Keeping in mind that this is a portable waterpik-style irrigator, I think it works quite well.  I do have to refill it once, but it doesn&#x27;t take up room on the counter as larger versions do.  It&#x27;s great at removing food particles and plaque and I recommend it. Only problem with mine is the charging light doesn&#x27;t go out when fully charged, but it seems to charge fine.  Must be a glitch in mine and I may call the company about that.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my traveling. It works great. The water pressure is good, not as good as a stationary unit, though, but does the job. the amount of water is OK....just enough for a quick rinse. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was quite pleased with this product.  I only wish the reservoir could hold more water, but then it probably would be too cumbersome to be portable.  It takes more than one filling to do a complete cleaning.  It does a good job of getting particles removed that are missed with a toothbrush and since I&#x27;m not a faithful flosser, this does the job.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about one week and I notice that my teeth feel cleaner and look less yellow. Seems to work fine. Good price.</li>
    <li> Aside from the fact that the reservoir is too small (requires a minimum of two tankfuls to floss all teeth), that the unit is under-powered (unable to dislodge food caught between teeth, only loose food under the gumline), and that the unit requires constant recharging (unit will be totally discharged the next day if left uncharged), the unit conveniently stopped working just past its 1 month anniversary. Even at $40, I expected a slightly better product. Very poor value and not worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer claims my product was defective and has offered to replace the broken unit free of charge with a new unit that will have a stronger pulse.&lt;br /&gt;I changed my review from 1 to 3 stars given the outstanding customer service. Will update this review after having a chance to use the new product. Stay tuned....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final update 11/16/2012&lt;br /&gt;Having used the replacement unit now for a week, I can tell this is how the unit was designed to work. Not quite as strong as a wired unit but strong enough. The reservoir is still on the small side but workable. If not for the outstanding customer service, I would have written this product off and left my original rating as is. Now I am changing rating to 4 stars from one.</li>
    <li> We were very happy initially. This seemed like a great product for kids with braces. However, our first issue was that it would randomly turn on by itself. Now, we have had it two months and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. we are very sad. It was a better solution than the traditional water pick that seemed to get water everywhere. Dang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - WE ARE SO PLEASED WITH COMPANY. I emailed them and they responded within minutes and are sending a new one. Very kind and efficient. You go, Toilettree. What a refreshing change and so nice to have someone care about their customers happiness. Thanks Kelly.</li>
    <li> The motor works, we followed the instructions for care. But now after 2 months you hear the motor running and no water coming out... what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the oral irrigator. However, in less than a month, the charge would not hold for long and then it would only hum when turned on. Amazon is sending me a return mailing label. I will not be charged shipping and will be refunded my money.</li>
    <li> Great product, I wish the tips were a little more flexible. Battery charge last a long enough for short trips without recharging.</li>
    <li> Had item for 4 months used about 5 times.  I have an nonportable one that I use all the time, I Just used the portable  for travel which just stop working. I do love the idea of a portable oral irrigator see if I can return it to the company!</li>
    <li> Hi all, Well like most other people here I had a lot of trouble with this machine.  The first one just stopped working.  I called the customer service folks who were great and they replaced it immediately.  I got the second one.  the second one must have had a demon in it because it kept turning itself on in the middle of the night and scaring me to death.  I called customer service and they gave me my money back.  Nice folks but the product is bad.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-good quality&lt;br /&gt;-water shoots out well&lt;br /&gt;-portable&lt;br /&gt;-removes food particals really well&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;-water chamber needs to be refilled too frequently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product.......great value</li>
    <li> The oral irrigator does what it is advertised to do. My teeth are clean, I use to this in the mornings after I brush and it makes my mouth feel even fresher.</li>
    <li> works well, until it stops working.</li>
    <li> I had a WaterPic and it died so I decided to try this one. The tank is much easier to remove and holds more water than the WaterPic. While the pressure isn&#x27;t quite as strong, it absolutely gets the job done. The first one I had developed a quirk after about 6 weeks, like other have mentioned, it started operating on it&#x27;s own and/or wouldn&#x27;t turn off unless I plugged it in. I sent ONE email and received an immediate reply. With in 3 days, I had a free replacement which I have been using for a while now. I disagree with the comments that&#x27;s it hard to fill, the hole is not huge but can be filled easily if you don&#x27;t have the faucet on full blast. Thank you Steve!!</li>
    <li> the oral irrigator stopped working in about 6 to 7 months and never was as efficient as they claimed. very poor</li>
    <li> It also took 1-2 days to fully charge. After light use for 4 months, it will not charge at all. $40 wasted.</li>
    <li> The Oral Irrigator lasted less than a year. Will not charges. Light comes on to say it is charged but as soon as you turn it on the light starts to blink as in needing recharging. SAVE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> This is a good product for getting material out from between teeth. Water container has to be refilled each use, but it is relatively easy job, so it still beats flossing for me!  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Because of the tiny reservoir which makes the use of this machine limited. It seems to this non-engineer that a faucet hookup would be so simple, or a larger reservoir, that I&#x27;m very disappointed I don&#x27;t have the choice. Went back to my waterpik.l</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product fool me twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one works great at the beginning. However, the battery only last for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we got another one, last for another 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stupid design... How come a rechargeable battery can only last for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a choice, I would rate NO star.</li>
    <li> This came and it was perfect, not only for me but my son with his braces!  It is really hard for him to floss with his braces and although his dentist still wants him to floss as well, they were super excited about him using the oral irrigator.  The oral irrigator has different settings which is perfect, it has a soft setting which is what we have been using and is very comfortable to use.  I love that it is rechargeable so that there are no batteries to replace and no cord to hassle with.  The water tank holds a lot of water and you don&#x27;t have to refill it in the middle of using it.</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator works great. It is powerful and it is amazing to see how much junk is still in between your teeth after you&#x27;ve brushed.  I would recommend this to a friend because it&#x27;s an inexpensive version of the higher priced oral irrigators, and is just as efficient. The oral irrigator is not bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter. The charge also lasts a long time.  My only recommendation to people who purchase this item is that when filling the water reservoir, just slide off the reservoir to fill it instead of trying to use the hinged cap. My dentist recommends 3 parts warm water to 1 part peroxide. It is a great replacement for flossing because you can get to the back teeth much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you do have an issue the customer support is fantastic and they have a quick response to any complaint. I bought two at the same time. They worked great at first and then about a month later they died. I contacted the manufacturer and within two days of my call I had a replacement. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving a five star is because the first items I received appeared to be defective.  However, so far I don’t have any issue with the replacements and I’m going to purchase another one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> after sparingly using it for a month this thing stopped working. at first i thought it could have been out of charge but that wasn&#x27;t the case. it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, then it wouldn&#x27;t shut off and then it started just going off by itself at all times of day and night.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I researched WaterPic and this one, and purchase this one because of the positive reviews. The unit holds a charge for a fews days usage, and the pressure is very good.</li>
    <li> After talking with the periodontist, there were several drawbacks to the Water-Pik rechargeable - didn&#x27;t hold much water and needed recharging frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after completing my thorough (as usual) research, there many positive comments on the ToiletTree unit.  And I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds enough water for a thorough effort and the battery charge lasts many uses.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I loved it at first and it seemed to do a good job but after only a few weeks it completely jammed up and would not work at all anymore.  I am returning it to Amazon and will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased to have and use this &#x27;water pick&#x27;. It is easy to use, works well and it doesn&#x27;t take long to use. I have incorporated into my daily oral hygiene program.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in September and it STOPPED WORKING in January! What more do I need to say? Not happy!!! All it does when I turn it on,is make a buzzing sound, and the blue light is lit. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Toilettree oral irrigator for a few months.  Worked great, until today when it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.  Just makes a low whirring noise now.  Disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> I bought this product around end of october and it was working so well but after 2 months it just stopped working.  It just turns on and makes the buzzing sound.  I bought it because it has good reviews but then i was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: great customer service, they sent me a new replacement!  I hope this time this one will work.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before my purchase and also read the user guide when it arrived. Armed with all this knowledge I must say I am very pleased with the product. I purchased one for each bathroom and a spare. The batteries are lasting very long. I followed the suggestions in the  user guide for first charge. The pressure is more than enough without hurting gums and now our gums do not bleed when we floss. This product more than lived up to my hopes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even try, didn&#x27;t have enough water capacity for my needs. Might be great for travel.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the packaging when it arrived.  Everything was packed securely in the box with no chance of anything getting lost or crushed during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with 2 interchangeable tips with different colored rings on them, to enable us to sort out which tip belonged to which one of us.  The water tank is a high capacity tank that holds a good amount of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the fact that the rechargeable battery lasted through several uses.&lt;br /&gt;My all time favorite snack is popcorn, I absolutely LOVE popcorn, what I don&#x27;t love is trying to get those annoying little kernels out of my teeth after I&#x27;ve eaten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toilet Tree Rechargeable Irrigator solved that problem. It&#x27;s powerful enough to get the kernels out of your teeth so you don&#x27;t have to spend 30 minutes with a toothpick.  I also loved the fact it could easily reach areas of my back teeth that I couldn&#x27;t get to very easily with a tooth pick or even floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three settings on it, Normal, Soft and Pulse.  I use the pulse for tough to get out stuff, like popcorn kernels, (and it massages your gums, which feels really great!), and for everyday use I usually just use normal.  It works really well and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I liked best about it:&lt;br /&gt;The battery can last up to 45 days before recharging&lt;br /&gt;They recently upgraded the motor for longer use&lt;br /&gt;Rotating, color coded, interchangeable heads&lt;br /&gt;Powerful enough to get just about anything out of your teeth&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;Removable water reservoir makes re-fills super easy&lt;br /&gt;High quality construction</li>
    <li> I really love this rechargeable  oral irrigator. I works great. It stays charged for a long time and is very powerful. It has several different settings. I had a Water Pick before and it only lasted a few months. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought the non-rechargeable battery operated model over a year ago, based on the reviews. Worked great as far as cleaning, 3 different cleaning options--I like that. But like someone said, it devoured regular batteries like candy. I tried it anyway, but yep, the battery issue was bad. Sent it back to Amazon and got a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I called the company told them the problem. They said they they had received numerous complaints of the same nature and were pulling the product to redesign it, didn&#x27;t say specifically how. So I just wrote off getting another one for a while and went back to strictly a toothbrush and floss. I didn&#x27;t want to buy another brand because most of them had their own problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month it suddenly occurred to me the ToiletTree cleaner might be back on the market. And lo, and behold, it was! And the reviews were just as good especially now that they have made it  rechargeable. So I ordered one and am completely happy with it (so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;so far\\&quot; is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  It has been my experience with all consumer electronics that they need to be re-evaluated down the road, like right after the warranty runs out.  What may have been a sterling product initially suddenly turns out to be shoddily constructed and/or unreliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hopefully, that won&#x27;t be the case for this one. So stay tuned for a second review in a year or so.</li>
    <li> I recently had a bridge done on 3 molars in my upper mouth.  Cleaning my teeth in that area was very difficult and when I asked my dentist how  to better clean my teeth, he reccommended an oral irrigator.  I researched all the oral hydrators I could find and decided the TolietTree Oral Irrigator was the best for my needs.  I LOVE IT! It does everything the company said it would.  It was a little messy learning how to best use it, but after only three uses I am very comfortable using it and no longer make a hugh mess.  It is also very convenient that it is cordless.  My daughter uses it in the shower (being carful not to submerg the machine).  I use it leaning over the sink and that is my husbands method also.  It has been great for all of us.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, received item in less than two days after placing order.  Great product, adequate water container, unit very user friendly - not bulky or hard to hold.  Really does a great job on water flossing. ToiletTree you have a good design on this one.  Had other brand and it worked less than six months.  Will order from ToiletTree Products again.</li>
    <li> I bought this and thought it was the best thing ever. A week later it&#x27;s broken. I tried charging it and letting it rest by not using it for a few days, but it just didn&#x27;t come back to life. A good product- if it works. Don&#x27;t really know what happened...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 2 months ago and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.  The one thing that continues to surprise me is how long the charge lasts. I&#x27;ve only charged it once since purchasing it.  Also, the water jet is gentler on the gums than the water pick I had.  The water reservoir is larger too which really is a benefit.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews of WaterPik (not too good), I searched for another product and was very happy to find this one.  It does the job well and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all on the counter.  It&#x27;s easy to use, which is good because otherwise I might not use it!  One \\&quot;fill\\&quot; for me is enough to do my entire mouth.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ToiletTree irrigation system to clean the food from in-between my teeth clean on recommendation from my dentist. It works great, has 3 settings. I like the soft one the best, but the pulse makes your mouth feel really clean and fresh. I have used it with mouthwash and a small amount of peroxide. My teeth look and feel much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I need to do is because of sensitivity I heat the water a bit, cold just hurts my gums. Thank you Toilet tree for making such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:::&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with the irrigation system shutting off. I contacted the company and I must say the customer service at Toiletree is fantastic. They replaced the system immediately. Thank you for such wonderful service, I appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator is perfect for traveling!  I absolutely love it and I think it holds just enough water to do a great job.  You will really like this.  The charge lasted 3 days for me but I normally just keep it plugged in!&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I had a problem with this (after 5 months) but the company sent me a new one in 2 days!  No questions asked...great company!</li>
    <li> Product worked great but only for 7 weeks and was not even used on a daily basis. It&#x27;s fully charged but just makes a buzzing noise. Somehow water must have got into the motor. Re design, the water container is difficult to fill, the hole is too small. It&#x27;s bothersome, but manageable. The bigger issue is that the unit is not working at all.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write negative reviews, but I have to say I am extremely disappointed with this product. This was my first oral irrigator and I chose this model bc of the convenience and the fact that it was portable. It worked great for about 2 months, now it doesn&#x27;t even turn on. A complete waste of money in my opinion. would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> After years of waking up with a fuzzy mouth that neither mouthwash nor brushing would make much improvement, I finally found a solution. My ToiletTree oral irrigator leaves my mouth feeling as fresh as right after a full dental cleaning. The battery lasts about a week or so, using it once a day. The pressure is good, the amount of liquid (water + mouthwash) it holds could be more but I&#x27;m OK with it in this size, Great product. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have had this for two weeks and am very satisfied with it.  The water well doesn&#x27;t hold allot so you may need to refill it but after the first couple of uses, I have been able to finish the job in just one fill.  I generally use lukewarm water since I don&#x27;t care for the shot of cold against my teeth.  I dry it off after each use to keep the water from accumulating in the charging port.  I have charged it twice since I got it and my initial charge was overnight to ensure that it was completely charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I really liked this product.  My husband has a Waterpic version and I didn&#x27;t like it as well as the Toiletree version.  The price is right and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  If I was going to make any suggestions for improving it, I would have liked the water well to hold about an extra four ounces of water and a rubberized charging port cover to keep the water out.  I still give it five stars even without those improvements.  I chose this model because so many of the reviews sited the company&#x27;s excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace another type that hooked to the shower head. I like to use this in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to wipe down the bathroom from all the spray. Works well, easy to use, seems great so far. Not too hard of a water stream, but not too soft either. I see my dentist next month and will find out if it really makes a difference. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The first time I received this product it failed after only 3 months. I contacted Toilettree at the email address on their web site. I had a reply within an hour, and a replacement unit was in my hands within 48 hours! What wonderful customer service! I&#x27;m not used to such great service from consumer product companies. Toilettree has outstanding customer service. But sadly this product is not one that they should continue to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been just over 4 months since I received my replacement unit, and now it too has failed. This one not only failed, it managed to damage my bathroom in the process. While I was briefly away from the housoe at the market the unit decided to turn itself on. It emptied its tank onto a \\&quot;popcorn finish\\&quot; drywall ceiling, washing away the popcorn and soaking the drywall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard the product still running when I arrived home from the store but of course I was too late. The tank was empty, the battery was running down, wet popcorn compound was all over the bathroom floor, fixtures, towels, etc. The ceiling looks awful and will need to be professionally repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no chance that I somehow left this thing turned on -- that&#x27;s impossible because water really shoots out of it with force. Nonetheless I recharged it just to see if it was possessed by demons and sure enough it is. It has decided to randomly switch itself on for no apparent reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poorly made, unreliable product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use for travel.  We haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and it does exactly what we need it to do. It is a reasonably priced irrigator that fits comfortably in a suitcase.  It&#x27;s great for what we bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted the company by e-mail about six months after purchase with an issue we were having.  Within minutes I had a reply back and the problem was solved promptly and efficiently.  A lot of other companies could learn about customer service from this firm.  Extremely well handled, thank you.</li>
    <li> I was so excited by and pleased with this product at first. I have had it since late September, 2012, and recharged it once. It continued to work well, then suddenly quit working. I recharged it again, thinking that was the problem. Alas, no. When I turn it on, it&#x27;s clearly on, but there&#x27;s no jet of water. I tried switching \\&quot;heads\\&quot; to see if the original one was clogged, but that did not help. I&#x27;m very disappointed, as I really liked this product as long as it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up: Following the lead of another reviewer, I contacted the company by e-mail. I received an almost immediate response, indicating that this must be a defective unit. They&#x27;re shipping a new one out today! GREAT customer service, causing me to add a couple of stars to my original review.</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit and dont want to drag around my water pick. I checked Amazon and ordered and received quickly the Oral Irrigator from ToiletTree Products. I have tried it out and I like it and shall eagerly take it on my next trip.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily since the day I received it, over three weeks ago.  It is still running on the initial charge and I can really feel the difference in the cleanliness of my mouth and gums.  I just had a dentist appointment and the tech and dentist were both complimentary of the condition of my teeth and gums, especially since it had been almost a year since I&#x27;d had a cleaning (I know, not good!)  Great product, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Having used several WaterPik models that were either too bulky or held too little water this ToiletTree irrigator is a total hands down winner!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to refill and holds 3x water, three modes of water pressure cleaning (hard, soft, pulse) and lightweight with good charge capacity also. I&#x27;ve got two areas of fixed bridgework, and some hard to floss well teeth, and the TT irrigator leaves my mouth and teeth feeling super clean. Highly recommend and wish it was sold in retail stores but don&#x27;t let that stop you ... Amazon will get it to you faster than going shopping for it!</li>
    <li> After several weeks of daily use, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the device and its results.  The company seems very conscientious about packaging and customer service.  I&#x27;ve found the simple solution is to use this in the shower where splattering and mis-directed spray is not a problem.  It is also simple to refill the reservoir from the shower head.</li>
    <li> I ordered the ToiletTree Rechargeable Oral Irrigator from Amazon in mid-September 2012. It arrived shortly thereafter, and I put it into service. It worked exactly as described by Amazon on a twice-a-day basis, needing a recharge about every three weeks. After about four months, though, its performance became fitful, and by late January it stopped working altogether. Encouraged by the experience of other purchasers, I sent an e-mail complaint to the company: no response. I called the toll-free number and left information as directed: the company did NOT get back to me. I am therefore rating the item with two stars out of five, which is roughly proportionate to the four months&#x27; use I got from a product with a one-year guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;27Feb2013: I am happy to revise my earlier review, since ToiletTree has recently answered its phone, promised a replacement unit, and as of two days ago had it delivered to my door. It is an effective device, as earlier noted, when it is working. I hope that the replacement unit(identical to the original one) will continue to perform as intended through its warranty period of one year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written an Amazon review, but now I feel compelled to write one because of the excellent customer service this company offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has had a lot of dental work done, so food frequently gets lodged uncomfortably between her teeth.  She&#x27;s gone through various oral irrigators over the years (oral B, Waterpik), but after the last one broke, I wanted to try a new brand.  After reading the great reviews for Toilettree, I ordered this model for her several months ago and she loves it!  She was so eager to try it out when it first arrived that she used it without even fully charging it, and she immediately told me how much better her mouth felt.  The pressure is just right and the reservoir holds enough water for a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, her helper accidentally threw the reservoir away.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could order a new reservoir or if I would have to purchase an entirely new irrigator so I e-mailed Toilettree and received a reply just minutes later: they said that they would ship me a new reservoir free of charge.  Wow!  I was already really happy with the product itself, and now I have to say that I&#x27;m extremely impressed by Toilettree&#x27;s customer service as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, now I&#x27;m interested in checking out the other products they sell!</li>
    <li> Received quickly with good packing. Works as advertised or better. My wife prefers this to flossing and is very happy with this. Very simple to use unless you remove it from your mouth with the on button still on, and wave it around a while, then you may get to spend some time cleaning the bathroom mirrors. After a very short while we learned to turn it off first! Not a design defect, just our not paying any attention.</li>
    <li> I rate this is a 3 possibly 4 star for the following reasons. Somewhat difficult to load with water because of small orifice . Total volume slightly less than optimal but sufficient. Strength slightly less than optimal but sufficient. Nice travel unit</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist suggested that I purchase and use an oral irrigator as I absolutely hate to floss my teeth.  This product is exactly what I was looking for and meets my need and expectations perfectly.  The company sent the irrigator to me the very next business day!  You can&#x27;t get any better service than that.  And the price was much better than CVS or Target.  I would recommend ToiletTree and this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I use this product at home and it is also excellent for travel cause of its size and handiness&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product to indorse try it</li>
    <li> My product does not work at all. (No lights even go on when I charge it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the company will replace it. No luck yet.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. It has worked well thus far and the battery holds charge for a long time, approximately 1 use per day/2 users for about 4 days..not to bad. The tank has enough capacity if you move fast and is not difficult to re-fill in any case.</li>
    <li> I never had a product doing this bad! DIED AFTER FEW USES, and I cannot send it back, save your money for something else! I don&#x60;t believe the positive reviews about this terrible thing!</li>
    <li> This product does have good power for a rechargeable but the water tank started a small leak within a couple of days of using it which then turned into a large leak after less than a week! After procrastinating about the effort of return/replace I am now a few days past my return deadline!  Disappointed to say the least and WHAT a WASTE of money!</li>
    <li> It stopped working.  Too bad because when it was working it was great. It had great power and a good size tank.  I thought it was a slow charge but after a week off charging and then hopefully turning it on...but nothing,  it just stopped working.....very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It was good when it worked, but it stopped working after about 2 months... unless you want to throw your money away, look for another brand</li>
    <li> When I first received this item from Amazon, the reservoir had water inside it, and the paperwork that came with was water-stained.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the company and they sent a new one *immediately*, which arrived at my door in two days. This in itself was impressive, and I was&lt;br /&gt;most appreciative of their swift and genuine responsiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new one (I&#x27;ve had it about a week) is fantastic. I do need to fill it twice to get my whole mouth, but I don&#x27;t mind this at all and greatly&lt;br /&gt;prefer it to a ginormous countertop unit. It does a great job cleaning my teeth, and for a person who *abhors* flossing, is a godsend in that department. What my electric toothbrush leaves behind (which is a lot in this old mouth) this little gem takes care of really well, without all the grossness, awkwardness, and finger-painy hassle of floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put a dash of natural mouthwash (Weleda) in with the water. I feel this not only introduces antibacterial action to my gums, but also helps deter mold build-up in the unit, which, no matter how vigilant you are, will always remain a little damp inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am really glad I made this purchase, and wish I had gotten one sooner. Floss-haters everywhere--celebrate!</li>
    <li> I loved this portable product until it quit holding a charge. Currently it does not work at all. I have owned it for 3 weeks. I think it had been recharged 4 times. Other reviews talk of exact same problem.</li>
    <li> This little water \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; is the very best thing I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve had others, of course, but not with the battery efficiency and power that is Toilet Tree irrigator. I love the ease of filling, it takes little space on my limited size countertop, it fits comfortably in my hand,(the thumb button is in the \\&quot;right place\\&quot; for on, off and increasing the intensity of the flow.) It&#x27;s fun to watch the little particles that appear in the sink when I \\&quot;floss\\&quot; and know I am experiencing thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one negative comment and that is that I haven&#x27;t learned how to get direct flow to the inside lower front teeth. What am I missing ? I thought I saw a comment about a different shaped tip, but when I tried to track this down, I couldn&#x27;t find it (and if there is one, it should have been included.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product as I had read so many complementary comments about how they treat their customers. Thank you, Toilet Tree, for making a great product and standing behind it.</li>
    <li> Great travel tool, though understandably the tank does not really hold enough water to complete the task.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> PLEASE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU SELL THE CABLE FOR THIS Professional team rechargeable oral spray with water tank high capacity Products ToiletTree</li>
    <li> I only used this product twice, and then the battery just stopped recharging. I thought this problem had been fixed, since many people complained about it in the reviews, and the page specifically said that a problem is fixed. I also emailed the seller this problem, however nobody responded. I hope other people who are looking into this product won&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> This product is good to travel but I would not recommend using it every day at home.  It doesn&#x27;t have as much power as a water pik that uses an electrical power source.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for vacation,  tried it out at home first,  not fanatastic but will be ok for the trip.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great speeds and so easy to use! This is my second one and I even got a colleague to purchase it after getting her braces off, she also loves it!</li>
    <li> I had hoped to replace my water pik at home and have a travel unit,  I was not impressed by the unit for home use but I did take it with me on my last trip and was happy with it.</li>
    <li> ...And I mean it&#x27;s not close. Moreover, my Waterpik 360 completely failed after 7 months of once a day use. When I tried to invoke the warranty I got the runaround and now they have gone silent. This unit is FAR superior in every way. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using a similar Waterpik brand irrigator and have been disappointed about its battery life so I tried this one based on the strong customer service that is apparent.  So far this has more than met my expectations.  I fully charged it and used it for a week, was away for 2 weeks, used it for another 5 days, was away for 2 weeks and now have used it for 12 days all on the same first battery charge.  Therefore it has lasted on one charge for well over 3 weeks of use and a month of just sitting unused.  When I use it it is usually about twice a day and one half to a full tank worth.  By contrast my Waterpik lasted for a few uses at most when new and drained when sitting unused for  more than a week.  After a year the Waterpik barely holds a charge through one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for functionality, the irrigator does a great job.  I use only the strong main function and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered another for my wife.</li>
    <li> Buttons reverted to different function from that selected, which rendered it nonfunctional.  I&#x27;ll be checking out other brands.  Advise against it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and my Dentist noticed and said she agrees. Be sure to use the correct water temperature for best results. The battery life between charges is very good.</li>
    <li> After reading the ratings posted for this product, I was a bit hesitant. Having had mostly good luck with everything I have purchased from Amazon, I thought I would take a chance. Received it, charged it up and used it for a good month. Charged it up again and it would not turn on. Contacted the company and they sent me a new one, free of charge. Charged it up but it never took the charge. Contacted the company again and they are sending me a refund.</li>
    <li> I have had two Waterpik&#x27;s - recharable and both of them lost ability to recharge very early. They never lasted more than 3 days. This item, however, lasts well over a week. It is smaller, which, for me, makes it much easier to maneuver and much better to pack and take on trips. And, I can leave the charger behind if I am going away for a week or less!!!! that is a great plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that there are not 5 stars designated is because it is not that easy to fill. A lot of water is wasted filling the little tank. Because I live in the southwest where we are very conscious of water going down the drain - this does not make me happy.</li>
    <li> This is a very well thought out and designed product.I owned a water pic rechargeable and this has it beat. It has a charging LED- No guessing on how long to charge. Multiple setting for intensities with coresponding LED&#x27;s. It&#x27;s compact, Holds a charge a long time (uses Ni-MH Batteries).Great Customer Service!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oral irrigator about a month ago and have been using it since.  It does work and when it is working it is loud. Although the product is described as a \\&quot;high capacity\\&quot; water tank, I find that I must fill the tank at least twice to complete the process.  This leads me to three design issues/suggestions that should prompt the product designer/manufacturer to rethink some elements of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The aperture to fill the tank is small so that you must be very careful to adjust the water flow.  If the water pressure is too high, it creates vacuum and the water does not flow in.  The water flow has to be very slow in order to fill the tank. If you have to refill the tank a couple of times during each session, this can be tedious and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The flashing light never stops! I always keep the product fully charged. The cord is connected except when I am using the irrigator. So when the battery is fully charged, the light continues to flash.  This means that the door from the bedroom to the bathroom must be closed because the flashing light is very bright.  Maybe the battery is not working right? Maybe this is a fixable design flaw? I do not know, but it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The recharging electric cord is black.  Really? This is Product Design 101--major flaw. The entire device is white with turquoise elements, as is most electric toothbrushes and other personal grooming devices.  This product has to be on the counter in full view. Is there not a product designer on staff? Did the manufacturer save a few pennies by ordering up black electric cords instead of white? Not OK.  Thinking about returning.</li>
    <li> This was a ok product until it stopped working. Low water pressure, and required multiple use to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This product just stopped working. Tried recharging for more than 8 hours, but it will not even power on. The available action through Amazon says it has past the return period.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how a company can get a way with building such a crappy product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that I have to give it at least a one star.&lt;br /&gt;shame on you people.</li>
    <li> After going through two waterpicks in 12 months from a competing brand, I tried Toilettree. At first it was really great!  The pressure was wonderful and offered different settings. But then, after less than 30 days it just stopped working. I was hoping it was only a charging problem but after a full 8hr charge it still would not turn on. I immediately went back to Amazon for a return.  My only given option was a full refund once I returned the item with free shipping. That was nice but I&#x27;m still waiting on my refund. I&#x27;m hoping that the Christmas holiday is the only hold up. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m trying to decide if I want to give Toilettree another try or go with yet another brand. After reading previous reviews of orders within 60 days if mine seem to say the same thing as my review.  Perhaps Toilettree is a brand to revisit in the future if they get the problem fixed.</li>
    <li> I got this oral irrigator a little over a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It works very well in cleaning my teeth - I have had a hard time flossing since I got braces. I would love to say my oral hygiene is excellent, but flossing with braces is time consuming and I don&#x27;t have time to do it after every meal. This does a great job until I can get home after work to do a proper flossing at night.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery has a pretty impressive run time. Shortly after purchasing this, I went on vacation for a week and used it for a few minutes, twice a day, and it did not run out of battery during my trip.&lt;br /&gt;- The unit is fairly powerful. I&#x27;ve used a WaterPik plug in unit years ago, and although this is not as powerful as a large plug in unit can be, it can definitely make your gums bleed if you have sensitive gums. It&#x27;s impressive for the size of the device and the battery life you get out of it.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve noticed some mentions of it being hard to fill in other reviews, before purchasing. I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that at all. The easiest way to fill it is to remove the blue water reservoir and fill the bottle, then reattach it. There is a flip cap near the top of the device which allows you to fill without removing the water reservoir, but in my experience the hole is too small to easily fill it. If you have a small sink in your bathroom, this might also be difficult. I do flip open the cap after using the device and emptying it out so the reservoir dries out, but I don&#x27;t use that hole to fill the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It takes a long time to charge, around 8 hours or so. This isn&#x27;t too much of a problem if you just charge it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;- My unit stopped working after a little over a month of use. The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, even though my unit stopped working, I got a same day reply after emailing ToiletTree. They sent out a new unit the same day I replied back to their email. The customer service from ToiletTree is excellent. I&#x27;d be a little more upset if they were unresponsive. I would have rated this product higher, but because it was defective, I will only give it three stars for now... I&#x27;m hoping the replacement holds up, which will make me change my rating of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting a replacement from ToiletTree, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product. It&#x27;s been about two months of daily use and the battery seems to have held up fine this time. Bumping up one star due to excellent customer support.</li>
    <li> The water pick worked as advertised. I&#x27;m not really sure how effective it is compared to using floss etc. but my teeth feel cleaner at least. And its fun to use!</li>
    <li> I had seen this on another &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; site from an email, so I figured that I would compare with Amazon prices.  No comparison at all!  I wish I had done that on other things that I had purchased.  Amazon has great deals, and this is used without much effort at all.  I just wish that the &amp;#34;tank&amp;#34; was a bit larger.  I would definitely recommend this to all households.</li>
    <li> Initially, this product worked great for about a month.  The water pressure was very good for a rechargeable unit and it definitely cleans out a ton of gunk from between your teeth even after a thorough brushing and flossing.  You do need to be careful to aim the water jet at the gum line and between the teeth.  The water tank is also a bit small, but relatively easy to refill so it&#x27;s not a huge problem.  Sometimes you might need to do a refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month, the pressure started to drop off quickly and the battery didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  At first, it would last me about a week of once a day use.  After less than two months, it is now completely dead even right after pulling it off the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to contact their customer support ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED (2013-01-15): Customer Support was very supportive (added 1 star) and shipped out a replacement immediately saying I might have gotten a unit with a defective battery.  The replacement unit seems to be much more powerful straight out of the box so hopefully the original unit just had a bad defective battery.  Will update in a couple months...</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing this Toilet Tree.  The reviews for this product were the best and I was hoping that the two negatives were just \\&quot;those type of people\\&quot;.  While it does some time to fill it is not difficult or problematic to me.  It holds enough water to get around your complete mouth one time without having to refill.  It is cordless and recharable and can go in the shower with you.  My old waterpic... was sent with the trash.  Good buy, good price.</li>
    <li> This is a great little machine - the best parts:  easy to fill, 3 different settings, easy to take apart and travel with. I have used other brands before and this one is fantastic.  No leaks, no power issues - big fan and will buy more products from this company.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an affordable product that didn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.  This works great, is affordable and the charge lasts for quite some time.  Perfect for me</li>
    <li> Good points about this water flosser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s rechargeable. No need to purchase batteries. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s compact and does not take up too much counter space&lt;br /&gt;- no long cords to get in the way&lt;br /&gt;- when fully charged, lasts approximately a week&lt;br /&gt;-the price is very reasonable compared to other models&lt;br /&gt;- water pressure is adjustable and quite good&lt;br /&gt;- it appears well made and should last a while</li>
    <li> I was searching for a dental care pressure spray that is rechargeable and easy for my wife and me to take with us when we travel. This is the perfect solution. It is obviously well designed and is of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;We tested it a few times at home and it worked perfectly. But now, on our first trip since we got it six weeks ago, it stopped working after eight days. I was aware before I ordered it that others had a similar problem {I think it might be the on/off switch) but the commenters praised the company&#x27;s customer service and one even said that the President had contacted them and said they had made changes in the manufacturing process, so I ordered confidently. Maybe I got one that was manufactured before the changes were made. In any event, when we get home in a few days, we will see how good their Customer Service is. Hopefully, they will repair or replace it well before our next trip, which starts May 1st. I&#x27;ll let you all know how it works out. We still like the product so we are not changing our rating.</li>
    <li> The unit worked fine for the first two months until it suddenly died. As per the November 2012 statement from the company, I emailed them regarding the unit. It&#x27;s been three weeks since that time and I&#x27;ve yet to receive an acknowledgment of the email, much less the promised free replacement. I had hoped I wouldn&#x27;t have to leave a bad review but I felt compelled to warn others who are contemplating this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the unit itself, while it worked, I liked it very much. The battery lasted for weeks without a charge and I thought it was an improvement over my previous portable Water Pik.</li>
    <li> Stopped working within weeks.  Water leaked all over.  So unimpressed it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to send back or request replacement.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this because I was told it can replace flossing, maybe good replacement it you have braces, with no appliances in my mouth I don&#x27;t see me replacing flossing.  I&#x27;m obsessed - I brush my teeth twice as long as recommended with my sonic care toothbrush (which I love), floss, use go betweens and now I just added to my dental hygiene this irrigator!  I love the way it makes my gums feel - the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five was because, the way I use it, I have to fill it twice, but if the reserve was double the size i suppose it would be difficult to handle.  I have never used a similar product before but I&#x27;m sure cordless is the way to go for this.  I have used it 4 times, with each time twice and the charge is still as strong as the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> This thing works pretty good. Decent power. The first one died on me, but they sent me a new one super quick, with no hassle. So far so good with the new one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product so much; it iscomfortable, usefuld and a must-item for maintaining my implanted teeth. But it is not rechargeble any more after 4 month use. I already threw away my package box because I gave my trust to this product. Can I still return it and get back a new one? Or should I buy this product every 4 month??? It&#x27;s a dillemma. The problem is that this product is too good to give up! So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing this review. Please solve my dillemma!!!</li>
    <li> This is so much better than our old (20 yr.) water pic. We have very little shelf space, so this item is so easy to put away and take out.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of water could be greater, but it would be nit-picking. Plenty of force to clean nicely. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Good spray pressure.  Sure like having it on trips, my mouth seconds that.  Lightweight, portable, and seems like it will last.</li>
    <li> I bought one back in November.  I knew ahead of time about possible problems, but it looked like Toilet Tree was doing its best to resolve issues.  When my irrigator died after two weeks, I sent an email.  They promptly responded and sent a replacement unit.  The replacement has been working great for four months of about twice daily use.  It produces a strong jet of water.</li>
    <li> Works good. However, it takes 2 fill-ups to complete the job. And because it is not quick &amp; easy to refill the \\&quot;tank\\&quot; it becomes tedious.</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded the performance of what I anticipated it would be. I have tried many oral irrigators and this is the best product so far. First, the other oral irrigators were battery operated and went through two batteries a month. I am so pleased I no longer have to add those batteries to the local landfill. I simply recharge the product which I only have to do every week for eight hours . The actual irrigation performance is excellent and far exceeds the other products. I use the oral irrigator for a mouthful of implants and find that procedure so much more effective than flossing or only brushing. If you have implants I would highly recommend this product. I get only rave reviews from my dentist for keeping my implants free of mouth and implant disease. I also knew if I dropped one of the other products the oral irrigator would die. I have dropped this one three times and it marches on with a great performance (what can I say I am clumsy). You can not lose on giving this product a try, the price is right and the performance is superior!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it cleans my teeth well...this is definitely the cleanest my teeth have ever felt. BUT, it is kinda messy unless you put your face in the sink, which is not a big deal, however this \\&quot;large capacity water tank\\&quot; is anything but that. It probably holds enough water for about 75 secs of cleaning. So if you&#x27;re planning on using it for longer than that at a time, you&#x27;ll have to keep refilling the tank. There&#x27;s 3 settings. Normal, Soft, and Pulse, each setting works by itself and can&#x27;t be combined with the others, (ex: you can&#x27;t use the normal setting with the pulse setting). Also, comes with only 2 piks. It&#x27;s about the size of a large flashlight, in case you need a size comparison. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this. Glad it&#x27;s portable so I can take it with me. I have yet to charge it after multiple uses.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.  i took it when we went to the beach.  i&#x27;ve only charged it once and so far the charge is working fine.  i just got it recently!</li>
    <li> This product quit working after approx. 4 months. When I press the button it will just buzz and no water comes out. I am very disappointed. The hole to fll the tank is very small so that water gets all over the unit and I think it may have caused the problem. The tanks is small so you have to fill it twice to get the job done and it takes too long to fill such a small tank.</li>
    <li> Read all instructions and followed directions and worked fine for about 1 week, then that was it, It no longer works! What a big disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;Joyce</li>
    <li> this is my first oral irrigator (recommended by my hygienist) and i love it !  the cordless feature and small size make it perfect for my small bathroom and it works great.  my gums have never felt better, i highly recommend this for anyone</li>
    <li> I quite like the product, but I had to return it because a defective switch would turn it on when not in use. The reason I have given a 5-star rating is that when I (promptly) received the replacement, the marketing director (Kelly Parisi) sent a charming hand-written note of apology.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the irrigator for about two weeks and am pleased with it. I have several implants and bridge work, so I really need to floss thoroughly daily. If I floss after using the irrigator, there&#x27;s never any debris like there usually is. Now I only use the irrigator.  It takes awhile to get it right...I had some difficulty getting spray on the bathroom mirror at first!</li>
    <li> I bought this about two months ago.  After about 1 month, I noticed the battery / pump was incredibly weak.  (Think gargling).  So, I called the company and they sent me a new one.  I&#x27;ve been using the new one for about 3 weeks and now it too is incredibly weak in it&#x27;s flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told by the company NOT to charge the unit after each use.  Instead I should use it for about 10 days and then charge.  What a hassle that is.  Am I supposed to write down when I charge it?  I suspect they are using the cheaper batteries that have a memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is onto Panasonic or Water Pik for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m really impressed with the results.  I got this mostly to help fight off gingivitis.  Some of my gums were swollen &amp; sensitive.  After a visit to my dentist, the hygienist recommended trying one of these. The first day I tried it, my gums bled a little and felt sensitive. This also would happen when flossing.  Now, after several weeks they don&#x27;t feel sensitive anymore or feel swollen!  I can also feel the difference when flossing.  Before they were real sensitive and now they feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I find it easy to use. As long as you wipe the irrigator after use, I believe it will last a long time.  I like it so much I bought one for a gift.</li>
    <li> The Irrigator works well, but I wish the tank was bigger, I have to refill at least 3 times.  Otherwise It works very well, I&#x27;m amazed at how strong the pressure is on high.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this because I did so with a Groupon...but I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!  Although it&#x27;s pretty compact in size, it works incredibly great!  My mouth feels so good after using it that I don&#x27;t want to eat and spoil it!  I highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to use while on trips and at home. Pump quit working after 6 months. Just long enough that the return policy had expired. I would not recommend this product. The pressure when it did work was not very strong and it did not hold a charge for very long.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was having gum problems.  I used it twice.  When the wand accidentally hits your teeth....it feels like you have either chipped your tooth or knocked it out.  It&#x27;s kinda scary for me to have my teeth bashed in by an electronic device.  I&#x27;m sure this is a good product for those who know how to use it properly.  I don&#x27;t.  I also flooded my bathroom vanity, mirrors, and floor.  After 2 trys.....I gave up.  My gums got well on their own.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed, this is my first negative review after buying more than one hundred items on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;When the Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator ToiletTree arrived I loved it and coulnd think to live without this stuff anymore, but unfortunately after 4 weeks the irrigator stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I dont want to buy another one to see if this time it will last more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad and really disappointed.</li>
    <li> EDIT:  I&#x27;ve had to change my review, because this irrigator only lasted a couple of weeks.  After 2 and a half weeks, it started turning itself on in the middle of the night, and I couldnt turn it off.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> i recently purchased the toiletTree oral irrigator even though it had 26 bad reviews because the company said the problem had been fixed.&lt;br /&gt;people seemed happy with their improved replacements.  However, mine has already stopped working and as much as i liked it, i prefer to have my purchase price and shipping fee returned.  Obviously the problems have not been corrected.  It&#x27;s a pity ,because when it worked, the flossing action was really helping my teeth and gums.  i was planning on giving these as christmas gifts, but not now.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband so he can keep up his gum care even when we are traveling.  This has a good-sized tank which is easy to fill.  It&#x27;s good for travel and small enough to bring along.</li>
    <li> Have had this barely a month and can hardly get through one small tank of water for irrigating as the battery quickly runs down.  Then it takes many hours to recharge.  Do not buy this product.  Find something better.</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator replaced a \\&quot;tank type pik that I was never sure was clean enough!  I never emptied the tank fully after use.  This irrigator is always empty when you are finished, I leave the top open so it can dry out.  Its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Gerryjo</li>
    <li> I bought second one for my wife....I liked it so much!!! I started out buy using soft seting and now use all 3 setings as I choose.</li>
    <li> Worked fantastic when it came..... needed it for a trip....&lt;br /&gt;used regularly for about 1 month, then motor broke.&lt;br /&gt;Useless crap now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the plug in one, mine has been working great for many months</li>
    <li> I purchased this product less than 5 months ago, after 4 monthd of daily use ( only once a day) this product just died . I have thrown away the box and I do not know if I can return it. It was good in the beginning but this product does not last long. I still have the cordless panasonic that I used at work and I have been using it for years and it is still working. I bought this toilet tree to use at home and it easily broke down. I regretted buying this product.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for myself and hubby, excellent product. Works very well. We did have an issue with my husband&#x27;s, Amazon warranty was up and I e-mailed the company, they responded immediately and sent a new one, no questions asked. Some of the best customer service I have ever gotten.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my trip to the UK in December of 2012. Dual voltage so was able to recharge it during my trip. About as powerful as my home one. Size of water tank was fine for me. Great for travel!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using a water pick again, after I had problems caused by previous usage but this product is great, gentle yet efficient; snaller fooyprint and easy to use and sanitary to boot.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed it and then it just stopped working after about 2 months. Not sure what happened. Still holding a charge, nothing comes out.</li>
    <li> After my dentist recommended I get an oral irrigator I research the product. A while back I had purchased the Panasonic travel oral irrigator and was disappointed; so I didn&#x27;t want to purchase that product again. After receiving the ToiletTree and using it everyday within 48 hours of using my gums improved significantly. Since I travel quite a bit this unit is easy to pack in my suitcase. This is a powerful irrigator and is easy to travel with. I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> The use of after evaluation, easy to use, very good use, a charge but use for a long time, is a very practical things.</li>
    <li> I received the Oral Irrigator as a gift. One of the best gifts ever! My teeth feel so much cleaner then when I used floss. I love the fact that I can take it in the shower or use it at the sink. This product is a must to maintain healty teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> It arrived in 2 days and so far works perfectly. I had a waterpik originally, but having to change tips to change pressure is a poor design choice. The TT has 3 positions, so just push a button to change pressure. I need the higher pressure for an upper bridge, but the lower pressure for the natural teeth, so the TT works much better for me. Size and weight are good, and the water reservoir size is good for me, too. Usually 2 tanks per cleaning. Take the blue tank off for refilling, it&#x27;s much quicker and easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on the original charge for 2 weeks now, and I use it for 5 minutes twice a day, so the battery life is great. I also like the dual voltage, as I travel a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives would be the difficulty to get the head to turn. It does, but it&#x27;s stiff. I think this will loosen up more with use. Also, the black charger with a white device is strange, but the cable is usually in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TT contacted my twice already, once on shipping, and again today to make sure everything is okay with my device. So I think customer service will be a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This product worked great right out of the box. It has three settings  high, low and pulsating. I would recommend to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE *** After 3 weeks the unit stopped working. I contacted the seller via email, received a reply immediately and was advised that they would send a replacement no questions asked. The replacement worked for approximately 3 weeks as well at which point it stopped for no apparent reason. After contacting the seller again he wrote the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;We have actually done a complete redesign of the irrigator and will have new inventory in about 30 days. We have 100% fixed all the problems that some customers were seeing. We also increased the size of the water tank which is a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s your choice. You can either wait for a new model or get a refund now. Just let me know and I&#x27;ll make sure it gets done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your patients. As you can probably imagine, the issues we were seeing with some of the irrigators was just as frustrating for us as it was for our customers. But we are happy to finally get this fixed once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Parisi&lt;br /&gt;President&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree Products\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed by how well this product worked that I would be willing to wait to wait for the improved model to be delivered. This seller stands behind their product!</li>
    <li> I use to own 2 waterpiks and they were made very cheap.. don&#x27;t drop the waterpik by mistake they will break.. this irrigator has a soft plastic bottle so it seems to take more pain if it were dropped. It seems to be quieter too. It works great. the water spouts are nice too..  I just wish the button was softer to the touch unless it needs to break in.. but thanks I really like it.  ;o)</li>
    <li> Product works great.  Forceful enough for me on normal mode.&lt;br /&gt;I do hope it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;I liked it enough to buy one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been great to read in the product description that it is bisphenol A free, but I called and ToiletTree told me so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this irrigator, and so far it works well to massage my gums and to remove food particles that even careful brushing doesn&#x27;t.  The reservoir is easy to fill even in an ordinary (not very deep) bathroom sink.  The irrigator is easy to hold while using, quiet, and easy to clean after use.  The only improvements I can think of are to supply a little hood to cover the tip when the irrigator is not in use (to keep it clean on the bathroom counter, since it&#x27;s a little too tall to fit in a normal medicine cabinet) and to make the curved part of the tip a little longer (to make it easier to direct water flow to back teeth).</li>
    <li> This seemed like such a good idea — a portable, rechargeable dental irrigator that would work both for home and travel — that I had to buy it. At first, I was pleased but soon realized that the filling hole is totally inadequate — too small to fill without using an eyedropper. The blue water chamber does slide out but replacing it is a real challenge. Worst of all, just two months after my purchase, it simply will not take a charge. It is dead — and gone from my household. What junk. Stay away.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I bought 2 of them, one for me and one for my husband.  He loves it too.</li>
    <li> Unit worked great for about 8 months....now it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied as I just start using and the tank is empty. I don&#x27;t know how it is expected to work properly</li>
    <li> I like it so far. Time will tell.  So far I really like it ,have to see how long it lasts ?</li>
    <li> Did a good job cleaning under my 18 crowns and 3 bridges.  Yes, that is quite a lot.  I had to practice in the shower and learned to never ever lift it off your gums before turning it off.  Doesn&#x27;t feel very good hitting the inside of your mouth.  Would highly recommend for the price and good job it does.</li>
    <li> just as the title said, was a nice product, but it died after using it few times... first time it happen to me with any electrical product,&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t drop it or transport it anywhere, and used it only few times... it just decided to die :-/&lt;br /&gt;kinda sad, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> I recommend this portable water pik to anyone that has been encouraged to get one.  Son has braces and it was a battle to get him to floss.  He does this without me asking!  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with ToiletTree products and I am very happy so far.  It is lighter and seems to be better engineered than the brand I used previously.  If it lasts more than a year and a half I will be committed to this new-to-me brand.  This is light enough to be used for the frequent traveling I do.</li>
    <li> Just got braces put on as an adult. Bought this based on the reviews. I use it once or twice a day to get rid of that gross \\&quot;always something stuck between my teeth\\&quot; feeling. It&#x27;s amazing what leftovers this thing washes away. Much better than simply just flossing and brushing. I highly recommend it. There is a learning curve though... you will make a mess your first few times.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good solution. This wasn&#x27;t it. Anemic water flow, not great cleaning. It died after just 7 months of daily use.</li>
    <li> I received the Oral Irrigator for Christmas.  I really Love this product.  Really helped improve my gums and also improve my Dental visits.  It just stopped working the other day and ToiletTree Products is going to replace this item as no cost.  Their Customer Service Team is the Best!!!</li>
    <li> Took this on a 2-week trip to Europe. Bought it for its compact size. Worked great, but started to malfunction by the end of the trip (would spontaneously turn on/off). Problem was due to short in the circuitry. When using this, it is very difficult to keep water from running down the side, where it can then work its way inside the product. To prevent this you&#x27;d have to put your head down in the sink and hold the product pointing down which is very awkward. I did always disassemble (i.e. remove the water tank) and dry the product off thoroughly right after each use, but If I had known that the water was still seeping into the crevices and causing corrosion in the circuitry I might&#x27;ve made it a point to use the product in this manner from the get-go. However by the time I realized what had happened it was too late.</li>
    <li> It worked okay at first, but then it stopped working.  Called the vendor and they sent out a new one, and like the first one, it worked for a while and then stopped.  Bought an AC Waterpik and it works great.</li>
    <li> Only one speed, needs less pressure. I would not recommend this product. That is all that I have to say.</li>
    <li> After 4 of the other brand, all of which died sudden deaths ... this model seems to be what I have looked for all along:  powerful enough to do the job. I like the hard stream it delivers.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Makes flossing so much more exciting and easy! The product was delivered on time, nice package. Water tank could be too small, but honestly, I don&#x27;t mind refilling it once or twice. My gums and teeth will thank me for this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, great size, great pressure and easy to keep clean.  It keeps it&#x27;s charge a long time so if you go on vacation and bring it with you, you won&#x27;t need to bring the charger too.  Overall I am glad I chose this product over the many others I reviewed.</li>
    <li> A compact piece of equipment that works great.  Slight learning curve on how to hold it to clean certain parts of my mouth.  I like the options of different speeds.</li>
    <li> Over two months use, the Irrigator works well; most often, I use it in the shower which avoids creating puddles around the sink.  However, it runs out of power without any warning; the low battery light flashes during its final seconds, which I find rather irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Soon after this review, the irrigator was having difficulty holding a charge, until it quit charging.  I eventually called ToiletTree, who cheerfully replaced the unit without even asking for the old one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the issue is plugging in the charger while the unit is wet.  I&#x27;ve been waiting overnight to do so, and the unit has been working like a charm.  I lasts weeks on a charge!  They should stress this point within their documentation.  If you get a replacement, throw out the old charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the problems I&#x27;ve had, I still give it 4 stars, mainly for the effort that ToiletTree has made.  Products like these seem to have charging issues (I&#x27;ve read reviews for other irrigators).  Hope they can perfect them before too long.</li>
    <li> Toilet  Tree Oral irrigator is perfect ! I am so happy with my choice: It&#x27;s the perfect power to clean between your teeth without hurting your gum, it&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I first charge it and its still working perfectly well. And finally it&#x27;s easy to fill, and you can hold it perfectly well in your hand. I just don&#x27;t  know why there are not more well known, because they deserve it!&lt;br /&gt;I had another very known brand (Waterpik)  before and was not very happy with it : Very bulky, not very powerful and did not hold the charge very long. it gave up after just one year ( after being already replaced once under the guaranty for the same reason) So I did not want to take the same</li>
    <li> I love this item. This did exactly what I needed it to do. The battery life lasted pretty long, as well. One negative is that water does tend to splash while you get, but I had no issues with that. This item is very powerful and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product could be 5 stars if it lasted. I&#x27;ve had this product for 5 weeks and the on/off button became stuck. It took me a minute to finally get it to the off position and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. When it worked the only slight drawback it had was the battery needed recharging every 4 days or so. That I could have lived with. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Got this irrigator as a gift and never realized how well it could clean between your teeth as well as massage your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I put a little mouth wash in the water and really refreshes my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;After 1 month of use my gums stopped bleeding and my dentist even commented how good my gums looked.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had gum problems for years and this is definitelya great step forward in resolving that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the battery is rechargeable. Great product and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star all the way for my new great smile</li>
    <li> I have never used an oral irrigator before but was up for the challenge when called upon to do so. I got the above oral irrigator from a company called ToiletTree, which I am sure all of you are familiar with by now. As you can see from the above picture the nozzle can rotate at a 360 degree angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of the most important details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Recharageble cordless design powered by rechargable batteries&lt;br /&gt; **Extra large reservior is removable and easy to refill&lt;br /&gt; **Three operating modes for varying oral care needs: Normal Soft and Pulse&lt;br /&gt; **Rotating interchangeable nozzles great for mutltiple users&lt;br /&gt; **Provides and easy and effective way to suuport proper teeth and gum health at home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised at how easy it was to learn and use once I got into it. Like anything else, you really need to read the instructions, or things won&#x27;t go so well. So, I had that nipped in the bud and went about using the irrigator and was quite surprised at how much cleaner my teeth felt once I was done. Come to find out, they had revamped a few things and now their Oral Irrigator has some much needed improvements done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**They have converted the unit into a Rechargeable Irrigator eliminating the hassle and high cost of changing batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**They re-engineered each unit so that it will last 45 + days before you have to plug it in for it to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**They have upgraded the motor in order to enhance itâ(tm)s performance</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;m a \\&quot;power flosser\\&quot;.  I floss A LOT.  Well, I should now say that I USED to floss a lot.  Since receiving this ToiletTree Oral Irrigator as a gift, my flossing days are a bit behind me!  I&#x27;ll still carry floss around for \\&quot;emergencies\\&quot;, but only because I can&#x27;t carry this oral irrigator quite so easily (it won&#x27;t fit in my pocket!).  Second, let me say that I am very particular about my gums and keeping them clean. My dentist always says that I am his \\&quot;star pupil\\&quot; when it comes to keeping my mouth clean. So you can believe me when I can say - without question - this irrigator WORKS! I use it twice a day and my gums are so very happy.  I am thrilled that I got this as a gift - what a great surprise!  It&#x27;s something I can use, that works extremely well, and I love it.  Isn&#x27;t it great when a gift works out that way?  Of course, now that I know how much I love it, I&#x27;d buy it for myself in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I have now had experience with four irrigators that Amazon sells.  They were made by 4 different manufacturers.  This is the only one I have not yet had a problem with.  I love the pulse and the variable speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post again once I have used it for a few months.</li>
    <li> I am writing a review for this article mostly because the company is amazing. I have never experienced a customer service like that.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 1st generation of Irrigators and I have to say it was good to use, but it broke pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I received the second generation for free from ToiletTree Products, which is really impressive in my opinion. Now the 2nd one broke as well (which is not really impressive), but they send me their 3rd generation product, which has a lot of new features that I thought were really bad on the older versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Lithium Ion Battery.&lt;br /&gt;Second, you can refill it from the bottom now and don&#x27;t need to rip it weirdly apart any longer.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the nozzle comes easily off now, since they added a release button.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, they added a seal plug where you insert the recharger, in order to keep it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this company really wants to improve their product. And I like that. Obviously it is produced in China and the quality so far has not impressed me (it broke two times), but once they figured all their quality issues out (which is hopefully soon), they will have a great product, build for customer satisfaction that it worth the margin they are properly asking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add a full review about the third generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, this one is also available in black. Looks quite sharp actually.</li>
    <li> We were hoping this product could be used in the shower, but it cannot be.  Otherwise, quite a good product.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly - for exactly five months - and then inexplicably died. A roll of floss lasts longer, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I purchased this irrigator since it was small and compact and had a rechargeable battery. It works awesome, it has 3 settings and the charge lasts for a long  time. I used to use Waterpik, but they are terrible compared to this product. The Waterpik was more expensive, takes up too much space on the counter and has to be plugged in. The Toilet Tree product is small and compact for traveling and the adjustable waterflow really works well to clean and massage the gums. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and even my dentist has commented on how good my gums look, so I&#x27;ve bought these for my kids also, so they will have healthy gums too. ToiletTree continues to make well made products that work way beyond expectations. My husband loves his Toilet Tree fogless mirror, so we tried this irrigator and yet again we were pleasantly surprised at what a good quality product this is. If your looking for a high quality irrigator, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> I contacted customer service about getting a replacement battery door because the hinge was broken.  To my surprise, I was told that the old model has been upgraded with a new rechargeable version (no batteries needed) and I was offered a free replacement.  WOW.  I must say this type of outstanding customer service is rare.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my new model - perfect water pressure, holds charge well, small and compact.  I prefer this model over Waterpik because the nozzle is longer, no cumbersome cord, takes up less counter space and is not noisy.  You&#x27;ll need to fill the tank a few times to get a good cleaning but that&#x27;s a small nuisance for such a GREAT product.  Thanks ToiletTree for an awesome product and awesome customer service!</li>
    <li> There are lots of oral irrigation systems out there that claim to be professional quality, but this one stands by it&#x27;s claims!  The interchangeable nozzles were perfect for both my daughter and myself, and the three operating modes were what we needed for our varying degrees of sensitiviy.  My 10 year old hates flossing and this was the perfect, no bleeding, alternative!  Love it!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Am so pleased with the Oral Irrigator ordered. I have needed something like this for my dental hygiene. It is easy to use and I am already seeing improvement in my oral health. The information left by the seller was thorough and there were no unpleasant surprises about this product when I received and opened the package. It was shipped quickly and packaged well. I am now using it and am glad to have purchased this oral irrigator. I highly recommend this product to all who care about oral health.</li>
    <li> This tool is so easy to use; just fill the reservoir with water, choose your setting and press on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that while a full charge takes 8 hours, It last for a long time. I have only had to charge it once and myself and my family have been using it for over a week now. I can&#x27;t get over how clean my whole mouth feels. I actually use it several times a day because it is so easy to use and I love the feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the ToiletTree Professional Oral Irrigator takes up very little counter space and could easily be taken on vacations and trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite setting on the irrigator is the soft setting. I have sensitive teeth and gums and this one worked best for me. Other settings include \\&quot;normal\\&quot; and \\&quot;pulse\\&quot;. I found that it works good if you use lukewarm water for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say this beats competitors! With it&#x27;s compact design, portability, effective cleaning, and ability to be re-charged, I highly recommend this! I find the price to be very reasonable as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free product in exchange for my honest opinion on it. Although I was given a free product, this in no way changes or influences this review.</li>
    <li> The irrigator is compact and easy to use.  It does a great job cleaning between my teeth and massaging my gums.  The rechargeable battery has quite a bit of shelf life and makes it readily available for use.</li>
    <li> Real nice product. The only problem is getting to the back of the bottom teeth. If there was a flexible tip so it could be bent to get behind the teeth, maybe it would make the task easier. Even when tipping the Oral Irrigator upside down you still feel like your missing some areas of the gums.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get the ToiletTree water pik and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out --- with a 5 star rating I expected wonderful things BUT the very first time I used it and within the first 30 seconds the power from the spray had knocked a cap off my tooth causing a unscheduled trip to dentist and an unexpected bill of $125.00 to replace it ---- the dentist recommeded a water pik the has multiple setting in which to adjust the power of the spray - and I also found the spray to be very painful to the gums ------- it arrived quickly and in good condition and is well built but I did have to return it .</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Toilet tree oral irrigator. It is easy to use and store in my medicine cabinet. I also think it will be easy to travel with.  Customer service was great when I contacted them to ask about how to dry it, they said as long as I empty it and shake out excess water that is enough. So I was happy to hear back so fast from customer service on my question.</li>
    <li> I love the ToiletTree Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator because it makes my mouth feel clean and fresh after I use it. It is very easy to use and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to take charge of their own oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> The three settings give you a nice combination of sprays to clean every tooth in your mouth.  The Waterpik that I had been using had two settings.  The hard one worked well, but made my gums bleed sometimes.  The soft setting on the Waterpik didn&#x27;t clean well enough for me.  This irrigator removes all the crud that the toothbrush and dental floss don&#x27;t get and it doesn&#x27;t make my gums bleed.  It works so well that I use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to fill at first, but now I know that you either have to blast the water into it at full speed or just take your time and let the air get out of that small opening in the top so that the water can get in.  I hold it so that the opening is between 30 and 45 degrees from vertical and is lower than the part that goes into your mouth.  It would be a lot easier to fill if the top opening was a little larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had at least five Waterpiks.  None of them lasted for more than a few months.  I finally complained about them to Waterpik and they sent me a free one.  That one only lasted four or five months.  I hope the Toilet Tree lasts longer.  By the way, I hate the name Toilet Tree as a name for something you put into your mouth, but I&#x27;ll probably never forget it.</li>
    <li> After using the clunky waterpic portable I bought this based on reviews. This is more powerful and effective while being much more portable. I travel a lot and this device is worth packing. Things I&#x27;d change are the fill process to avoid wasting water and the charge hold as others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> Ordered it after the dentist recommended that I use such a product due to gengivitis. Went with the reviews and I am very pleased with the product: simple, efficient, easy to use and quick. I am now immediately doing the water \\&quot;floss\\&quot; after washing my teeth in the evening and my gums are not bleeding any more. One small victory over another annoying problem.</li>
    <li> Had issues with unit on first day it arrived, a Friday. Unit turned on but would not turn off. Had to fully drain battery to shut off. Wrote a negative review on Saturday. Received an e-mail from ToiletTree, same day! Company will make everything right if unit is not ok after full recharge. Maybe I got a bad unit, it happens. But any company that gets back to you on a weekend from a review not even a direct communication is aces in my book and gets the benefit of the doubt and possibly a customer for life if all works out in the end.</li>
    <li> Okay, in principle this is a great product. But over the past year I have been through FIVE of these (!) and the ALL work great for a while, then either fail altogether or suddenly lose power. The BEST one lasted three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but even the company&#x27;s excellent customer service cannot make up for what clearly is a design flaw. Toilet Tree, to their credit, acknowledged an early production problem, but clearly there is something faulty in the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unhappily must downgrade review from 5 stars to 3 -- at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Toilet Tree will introduce a new &amp; satisfactory product, even at a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEREWITH IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW (before the extreme unreliability of it became apparent):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fabulous---I have for years wanted a good, rechargeable, universal voltage irrigator, and this, finally is it. Powerful, long life between recharges, and superb customer service should you need it (I did, hence the revision to this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous portable irrigators (Panasonics) were plagued by two issues: [1] tempermental \\&quot;O\\&quot; rings, and (especially) [2] NOT RECHARGEABLE. Okay, there was one unit on the market that was rechargeable, but it was useless because it was only 120 volts, not 100-240, so you couldn&#x27;t ... really ... travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went through several Panasonics, with their finicky O rings and BATTERIES AAGGHH! The problem with regular batteries is that irrigators ONLY work adequately at full battery power, so you end up going through endless AA batteries quickly and find yourself with a truckload of slightly used but still good batteries. A constant aggrevation -- you can&#x27;t replace batteries every other day, but that&#x27;s what it would take to always have it working well. I would delegate the post-irrigator batteries to my wireless mouse and other applications where full voltage is not important, but there are only so many you can use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minor comments about the T-Tree irrigator:&lt;br /&gt;The contoured shape was clearly the result of careful ergonomic thought, but I&#x27;ve never quite figured out how the contour was meant to fit into the hand. (This is not a complaint -- just an observation.) And the lid that one lifts to drain the reservoir after use is sometimes a bit tricky to open because the little \\&quot;lip\\&quot; that protrudes that your finger is supposed to catch is just a tad small. Just another 3 mm and it&#x27;d be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend the ToiletTree irrigator. To top it all off, it is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I needed an oral irrigator since I do a lot of business travel and carrying around a larger piece of equipment was not convenient.  I had purchased another brand a while back and it just did not work out well.  I am happy to report that this unit has enough power and capacity to do the job well.  I am quite satified with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item instead of the better known Waterpik brand based on other reviews as well as my own positive experience with another ToileTree product (shower mirror). After a month or so of use I know I made the right choice. Operation is simple and battery life between charges is excellent - I&#x27;m still on the initial charge. As other reviews pointed out, the fill opening is a little small but I have found that to be a very minor inconvenience. I can either adjust the faucet to a trickle or remove the tank (easy to do) and fill it faster. The size and shape of the unit is very ergonomically adapted for easy use and minimum mess.</li>
    <li> I researched various oral irrigators based on my dentisits recommendations (daily string flossing wasn&#x27;t sufficient for getting my oral health in 5-star range).  I looked at a lot of comparable products and reviews.  Based on price, customer satisfaction, and reliability, I chose this product.  It does an excellent job \\&quot;water flossing\\&quot;, and I cannot believe the difference compared to string flossing:  gums are in much better condition and I also can&#x27;t blieve what this product \\&quot;irrigates\\&quot; that my toothbrush and string floss didn&#x27;t get....astonishing.  I really like the 3-level flow pressure control.  My only complaint is the resevoir isn&#x27;t that large, so I have to fill it twice each night (no problem with the fill, it&#x27;s simple when you remove the resvoir).  But if the tool is going to fit in my hand and be portable, the resevoir can&#x27;t be too large.  The compromise is worth it.  I also like the fact that I can use it several times before it needs recharging.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts, but if I get one year of nightly use, I will be very satisfied, and happy to buy another.  Oral health has a big impact on our whole body health....it&#x27;s worth the spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree Products was top notch with respect to on-time delivery, product as described, well-packaged, problem free transaction .... got to love those reliable and professional Amazon store owners.  Thank you ToiletTree :)</li>
    <li> I am very glad with this purchase. Here&#x27;s my comments in detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The strength of the water jet is just right -- very powerful. For the first few times, I needed to use the gentle mode to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The capacity of the tank -- for the first ten times or so, I needed to fill it twice or more to complete cleaning my mouth. After I got used to it, I became to clean my teeth more efficient, and the initial filling is just enough. Regardless of some reviewers comments, filling the tank is quite easy to me -- I pull out the blue tank from the body, and place it under the running water to fill it. It takes less than 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The battery requires long hours to charge it full. But I don&#x27;t have a problem using it twice a day, morning and night, even the indicator is still blinking (meaning, not charged fully.) I leave it connected to the charger when not in use. As some reviewer mentioned, the blinking indicator is quite bright. My bedroom is several yards away from the bathroom but the blinking light was bothering to sleep if I left the bathroom door open. But placing the irrigator facing the corner of the wall, and placing a bag or something in front of it to block the light, solved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It takes not much space while charging. You can charge it upright, so it takes about the same size or smaller than a electrical tooth brush charger does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Keeping it clean is very easy. I worried this most. But after using this for a few months, it still looks brand new. After getting used to using it, light wipe of the body and rinsing the detachable top part is enough.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 Waterpic brand oral irrigators in the past.  They were very disappointing because the batteries were short lived.  This product seems to be much better.  It has more options and the water force is stronger.  The batteries hold a charge longer.  I anticipate it will provide a longer battery life.</li>
    <li> I have been absolutely delighted that ToiletTree Products have produced a product to compete with other oral irrigators on the market, of which, there are few. This product has proven to be an excellent purchase.  I have been using this product for about a month and am thoroughly satisfied with its quality and performance, thus far.  The key, of course, is whether the quality will sustain itself over time, but judging from the reviews I read prior to purchase, this company stands behind their products and provides superior customer support.  Based on my current satisfaction, I highly recommend this product to anyone who values their personal dental hygiene.  In closing, the water force of this product is selectable to three different levels at the push of a button, but I didn&#x27;t find any of the three selections to be excessive, resulting in any discomfort.  Personally, I am grateful to ToiletTree Products for marketing this product and their interest in providing quality products and service.</li>
    <li> I received the item September 28th &amp; its just November 10th and this irrigator is no longer functioning. It charges but the buttons to start/stop it and to change the settings don&#x27;t work. Will check to see if there is a warranty. Extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> The irrigator was as described and was delivered on time.  I think all irrigators are a bit messy if you don&#x27;t remember to keep your head over the sink and the irrigator pulsor in your mouth.  The charge lasts for quite a few uses/days and it&#x27;s good for travel as it accepts input of 100-240 volts, so it works in the US and Europe and other foreign countries.  The water tank holds enough water for one very good use and is easy to refill.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the irrigator.</li>
    <li> stopped working within the year.  contacted the manufacture (toilettree) and they are sending another unit.  I don&#x27;t even need to send in the defective unit!!  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I have gone through 3 battery water picks. This product appears to have been engineered much better.&lt;br /&gt;Battery charge low and full charge indicator LED, battery replacement possible, positive on off response of switches. Yes the water inlet hole is small, so run the water slower and so what if it takes a few more seconds to fill.&lt;br /&gt;Now to see if it lasts more than a few months.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work after a month..... what a waste of money and time and mailing! i would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this thing really works.  I hate flossing, but my dentist has been stressing the importance, not to mention the link between heart disease and gum disease.  I figured, why not?  My first two uses were pretty messy - you have to learn how not to spray yourself in the face, the mirror, the floor, etc.  But my mouth feels like I just visited the dentist.  Plus, I hate to admit, I have seen some food particles flushed out AFTER I&#x27;ve brushed with my sonicare toothbrush.  I am a convert.</li>
    <li> My wife already bought the Sonicare Airfloss and we were pleased with it.  However, I wanted a less expensive version to take on business trips and purchased this Oral Irrigator.  Off the bat I realized that the pulsing power to clean food particles between the teeth was nowhere close to the effectiveness of the Airfloss - however it was adequate as an irrigator.  But after 2-1/2 months of operation, it suddenly stopped working with no warning signs.  This is my 1st Amazon review and I just wanted to make sure that no one else wastes their money on this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> We have had our ToiletteTree Irrigator replaced three times.  So we are now on our fourth irrigator and this is the last.  We have spoken with the President of ToiletteTree and the VP of Marketing and they have been VERY helpful but at the end of the day, great customer service is trumped by a product that simply does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had three issues.  First one was the tip would fly out of the unit during operation.  Made a mess.  The unit that replaced that one had two problems.  First it would not hold a charge for more than a couple of uses.  And even fully charged it was not nearly as powerful as the first unit.  And the second issue with this one is that it would start operating with no one around.  This was quite scary the first time this happened as it was at 3AM!!  This happened several other times and then I just let the battery completely discharge, called the company and they replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third unit was also a wimp that couldn&#x27;t hold its charge, like the last unit.  Called the company and they replaced the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth unit arrives with a redesigned power cord, so I am thinking they got the charging issue resolved.  And for the first month or two that proved to be correct.  We charged it last night and now today it ran for about 10 seconds then stopped.  And cannot be started again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this unit works correctly it works well but I need an irrigator that is reliable and after four units I cannot say ToiletteTree&#x27;s units are reliable.  So I am going to look at other brands and place an order in the next few days.</li>
    <li> Really nice way to floss the teeth and avoid the threads cutting and bleeding. it is so awesome that even my kids love it.. we plan to buy more units and extra heads so that we can share the units with different heads in the family.</li>
    <li> The implement would not take a charge, shortly after we purchased it.  To their credit, ToiletTree promptly replaced it.  The second irrigator lasted about 3 months and also became unusable.  It would not start when turned on, but would start spontaneously at inconvenient times.  It had a mind of its own.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 months ago. The product was awesome as described by amazon or by other reviews. Unfortunately, my product stopped working after 3 months. I contacted ToiletTree customer cares. They said my problem has never been reported before, however, without asking me any question or asking me to return the defected product, they sent me a new one immediately during new year times of 2013. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy their product as their products are great. Plus they satisfy their customers 100% and you don&#x27;t loose anything.</li>
    <li> After researching several waterpik&#x27;s, I chose this one, even though I had never heard of the brand.  After using it for several months, I have became a fan of Toilettree Products.  Not only is the waterpik a product of quality but the customer service is exceptional.  Several weeks ago, I was replacing one of the Nozzles and it broke inside.  I contacted  Toilettree and they offered to ship me a replacement without any hassle.  I am very pleased with my experience with this product and this company!</li>
    <li> Perfect when rushing in the morning, it&#x27;s compact, powerful, easy to use and gets the job done. I was surprised at how well it works. I hope that it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The irrigator started buzzing on and off suddenly after a month, (just after the amazon return period!!!) and now doesnt even turn on...should have listened to others with this issue..really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Waterpik with this, primarily due to the good reviews it received.  I have to concur with the positive comments that others have given this product.  The tank seems to be just the right size to complete the task in an appropriate amount of time; not too big to make it unwieldy, and not too small to require a refill mid-way.  The water force is stronger than my previous Waterpik when on the high setting (there are high and low settings), and seems to do a better job of cleaning between my teeth.  I&#x27;ve had it for just over a month and am very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Never owned a Oral Irrigator before, so I have nothing to compare this item with.  What I have found however is this:  I have to fill the water tank often; even with 3 modes, I can&#x27;t seem to find the mode that is comfortable on my gums except for the normal mode.  The soft mode isn&#x27;t that soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Unit stopped working 6 months after owning it.  Called Toilet Tree &amp; received a brand new irrigator which I was told, was better and longer lasting...something about correcting manufacturing issues.  Now, almost a year to date after receiving the second irrigator, it stopped working/charging.  After reading the brochure&#x27;s troubleshooting area, all I get out of it is that the battery has reached the end of its life cycle!  1 - I am not about to contact Toilet Tree once again, state my issues, and then just maybe receive a replacement.  2 - I don&#x27;t want to own an appliance that only works for one year OR own one that I cannot replace the batteries easily.  I also TRIED to follow the instructions on how to remove the \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; battery for recycling but it&#x27;s impossible to do without destroying the irrigator.  And when one reads \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot;, one would think that you could take the battery out and recharge it.  Good luck with that.  Done with Toilet Tree.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The product idea behind this item is great, but the design is flawed.  It took 24 hrs to charge it the first time and then 8 hrs the second time.  After that it won&#x27;t charge at all.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for 5 months and the battery is already not holding the charge.  Worked great when it was fully charged but now it is useless.  I can&#x27;t even get one use out of a fully recharged battery.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased for the first week but then the battery would not hold a charge. I am in the process of returning the item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my parents who are in their late 60s.  They love it.  We all tried it out and now I am purchasing one for my husband.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and water reservoir is very large which is convenient so you don&#x27;t have to keep filling it.  2 thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Does a very good job. Saved a trip to dentist to get trapped food from  teeth. Use it all time.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that works great, cleans teeth better then any dental floss. I would highly recommended this product to anyone who is looking for a product better then any dental floss.</li>
    <li> I wanted a portable device to clear impacted food after meals during my hours away from home.  I now also use it at home after meals instead of flossing after every meal (what a pain that used to be!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now floss before bedtime, brush, and use the Hydrofloss for my ultimate water treatment.  The combo is very nice!!!</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator is superior to any I&#x27;ve used before. The extra large water tank is easy to fill and holds more than enough to get your teeth clean. I also like that it has two speeds and a pulse setting. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After my last dental cleaning, I confessed to the dental hygienist that I was feeling guilty about not flossing on a regular basis. She suggested using an oral irrigator.  Since I was already a fan of ToiletTree products, and I follow them on Facebook, I was excited to see one day that they had an oral irrigator.  I own two other TioletTree products (fogless mirror and face/body brush system) and have been happy with the quality of their products. I used Waterpik years ago, when I had braces, and this oral irrigator far exceeds what I&#x27;ve used in the past!  I love that it&#x27;s small/compact, cordless, holds the charge for days, has a nice grip, and the size of the reservoir is perfect for each use. There are two ways to fill the reservoir tank and I find it easier to just remove the tank and fill it that way.  Although I didn&#x27;t floss regularly, I felt my teeth were very clean after brushing, until after my first use of this oral irrigator! Now I know my teeth are cleaner than ever!  You can immediately see and feel how clean your teeth are.  I no longer feel guilty about not flossing daily, because I definitely know my teeth and gums are healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> i bought this model to replace another rechargeable oral interrogator that was less than 1 year old and would no longer hold a charge.  So far, so good with the ToiletTree product.  I like the removable water tank.  It is easy to fill.  The 3 pulsing speeds are also a plus.  It came already charged up and ready to go.  I can&#x27;t judge yet how long it will last between charges, but I am very pleased so far.  The product does a great job, seems sturdy, and well worth the (reasonable) price.&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 3 months the battery stopped recharging. I have given up on portable models and have gone back to one that plugs in.</li>
    <li> The product is OK but has some shortcomings. I bought it as a replacement for my Waterpik that fell apart after three years. The Oral Irrigator does not have as much power and holds much less water so I have to fill it up 2-3 times per use. Since it sucks the water from the bottom of the cartridge, if you turn it upside down to get behind the lower front teeth and the water is low it will not be able to pump any water. I give it 2 stars since it is light and easy to use. But I will by another Waterpik at some point in time.</li>
    <li> Product came in perfect condition and was a definite asset for my oral care while traveling.  It is a little noisey and the water compartment is on the small side.  I had to refill it once before completing my cleansing routine.  It worked very well and I would recommend this item particularly when traveling.</li>
    <li> My husband has been happy with ToiletTree&#x27;s fogless mirror, so when he saw the oral irrigator added to their product line, he decided to order it.  I was curious when it arrived, so I opened it and gave it a try before he could.  Now, I&#x27;m hooked; and I can&#x27;t believe that all these years I&#x27;ve been just flossing and brushing to keep my mouth clean.  Not only am I satisfied with my TMF (total mouth freshness), but I am also impressed with its sleek, manageable design.  It takes up little room on the bathroom counter and fits easily in travel cases.  And it&#x27;s so easy to use with a simple, refillable water reservoir and rechargeable battery. For me, convenience with a product is directly related to how much I&#x27;ll use it, so I know this will be long term.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and great value. I have used a competitor&#x27;s water floss and this ToiletTree Oral irrigator is definitely a superior product. It has more power and multi-mode whereas the competitors product had anemic power and limited to one power mode. One cannot go wrong buying this irrigator.</li>
    <li> I have tried compact versions from both Panasonic &amp; Waterpik and have found this product to be the best.  The Waterpik is bulkier and the charging socket broke after a few months and I had to go in and wire the power supply directly.  Once I was fed up with this, I moved on to Panasonic and was happy for about six months, then I noticed while replacing the batteries that they appeared to be wet.  Sure enough, there seemed to be leakage in the battery compartment and decided to just purchase another one.  The newer version had some design changes and what appeared to be better gaskets.  This unit worked well until the irrigator  nozzle continued to pop off during use and spraying me with water.  I was able to take it apart and noticed that the locking mechanism relied on thin metal rods (the diameter of 22 gauge wire)to fit in a groove in the nozzle, which obviously does not maintain enough tension over time to keep the nozzle in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now on to this unit.  The first thing I noticed was the form fitting design with a soft plastic grip that made this unit very easy to manipulate.  The second was the use of actual LEDs to show charging and water pressure.  Plus, the dual usage of the power LED to show when the battery needs to be recharged.  Much better than finding out when the water pressure peters out. Third, was the easy fill reservoir requiring only seconds to fill.  Finally, a slim charging power supply with a secure power connector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews that they feel the reservoir is too small, but I found the capacity similar to the other brands only requiring me to fill the reservoir twice during the irrigation process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems to be a very well made unit that hopefully will not join my broken irrigator collection anytime soon.</li>
    <li> First I was not sure how this was going to work. I recv&#x27;d my Toilettree oral irrigator and WOW !  I always had a hard time flossing and now with the Toilettree Oral Irrigator I can get the hard to reach areas so much better.  Also the Toilettree Oral Irrigator helped alot with having a cap on my tooth.  The Oral Irrigator was able to clean that area so much better then flossing as it always got stuck.  It was so easy to use my New Oral Irrigator from ToiletTree all I had to do was charge it and fill it and Bamm I was ready to use it.  The ToiletTree Oral Irrigator was even better as it is cordless and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about plugging it in and using it around water.  My mouth and teeth feel so much better since using the ToiletTree Oral Irrigator.  I would tell my friend&#x27;s to give it a try and they will be so amazed on what a difference this makes.&lt;br /&gt; TolietTree Oral Irrigator it works AWESOME!</li>
    <li> It has been said that this Toilet Tree oral irrigator has some small issues, such as it takes a long time to charge, and isn&#x27;t powerful enough. Well, I find it to be just perfect. Plugged in at bedtime, it&#x27;s fully charged next morning and the charge lasts for a long time. It flushes so much gunk from my supposed gum pockets- even after brushing and flossing- that I feel triumphant! It&#x27;s small and lightweight; to fill the tank I do as others have mentioned and remove the tank to fill direct from the tap, after which it slides back on the unit easily. Admittedly, I do cheat by adding ten drops of myrrh extract to my water tank, and I don&#x27;t use distilled water. But I love this device, would highly recommend it, and only hope it won&#x27;t need replacing earlier than necessary if the myrrh extract eats away at the water feed tube! A+++++</li>
    <li> Its true that the tank doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water, but I found it to be just right for my needs.  However, approx 30 days after I received it, it no longer functions!  The lights flash as if needing to be recharged, but recharging it to full does not help.  It just makes a low \\&quot;beeping\\&quot; sound when turned on and doesn&#x27;t propel the water.  Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> My WaterPik&#x27;s batteries failed to hold a charge after only six months of use.  I did not want to purchase another WaterPik if, based on my recent experience and my belated reading of reviews, I was, probably, going to have to replace it again in six months.  The Toilet Tree (awful name) has a stronger water stream than the WaterPik and came with instructions on how to replace the batteries, if needed.  My only regret is that the water reservoir does not hold more water.</li>
    <li> I loved this irrigator at first, and maybe I got a defective one, but it seems to be losing battery power.  Fully charged the pulse is pretty weak and seems a little irregular, unfortunately I will return mine.</li>
    <li> This irrigator totally fits the bill as a light weight but powerful fliosser.. It&#x27;s much better than the travel Water Pik that I have at home. Good price, good value!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this to irrigate my gums, I was head-over-heels in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t realize that its intensity was just too much (even on the soft setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week-and-a-half, my gums hurt terribly, and it took many days of applying clove oil and stopping brushing to recover from the extreme pain caused by this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, one of my teeth has had root resorption (which fortunately was stopped by dental surgery) and was one of the two places most affected by this device. But there was no reason -- i.e. inherent sensitivity -- why my lower gums were so impacted by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please be careful with this and set it on soft to begin with, and I hope that you have a better experience than I did with it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an irrigator for decades, but halfway through the implant/crown process I suddenly learned (because I asked) that an irrigator was really necessary for cleaning thoroughly around the base of my crowns. Okay. Seems like \\&quot;WaterPic\\&quot; has become the generic for oral irrigators, so I looked at those first. Didn&#x27;t like the reviews AND didn&#x27;t care for the looks and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I looked at this ToiletTree rechargeable. And before I go into specifics, I&#x27;ll say that what tipped me off the fence and into purchase was the customer service response here in the Amazon reviews. I think these people are 100% behind their product and that made me take the chance on a product I had never heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product itself: I LOVE that it is pretty small, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on my sink vanity area. The tip swivels so I (you) can angle it in a way that works for how you hold the tool. I love that it&#x27;s got 3 settings: Normal, Soft, Pulse. It&#x27;s easier to pack along when I travel, not at all clunky or messy. I just take off the tip and bag it all together with the charger (just in case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any irrigator is going to make some splashes and drips when you use it. Some people might consider that a downside but it&#x27;s the way it is. I learned quickly to lean over the sink ... I can&#x27;t downgrade this for having to do that. Because the only other option would be the professional dental equipment vacuum system! :D Besides, I think I am part duck; I don&#x27;t mind splashing a bit. And it&#x27;s just water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned the &#x27;hard to fill&#x27; aspect ... that also doesn&#x27;t bother me; I have been filling from the tap with a very small stream, and since we need to dry off the tool after use anyway, that also doesn&#x27;t bother me. However, since we have treated well water and I often have to use a vinegar solution to clean the electric kettle and the shower head and faucets, I will switch to distilled as that reviewer suggested. And perhaps invest in an itty bitty funnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is a little small, but that&#x27;s also part of its compactness, which I consider a benefit. One tankful is sufficient for my needs but since I don&#x27;t have an issue with filling, if I need a second I&#x27;ll just fill &#x27;er up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as slow charging ... I used this for a couple of weeks without needing to recharge. And then I just charged it overnight after my evening session. I&#x27;ve gone 3 weeks now without recharging, but honestly, sometimes I use it just once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT: I find this easy to use, a good tool for my needs, easy to aim at different places in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my review incorporates both item specifics, and my own willingness to accommodate to them. Bear these in mind when you are considering your purchase:&lt;br /&gt;* smallish tank&lt;br /&gt;* overnight recharge&lt;br /&gt;* splashing (you&#x27;ll get that with any irrigator)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me the benefits outweigh any inconvenience:&lt;br /&gt;* fits my hand&lt;br /&gt;* compact&lt;br /&gt;* easy to use&lt;br /&gt;* adjustable power&lt;br /&gt;* powerful&lt;br /&gt;* easy to pack up and take with&lt;br /&gt;* does the job!!&lt;br /&gt;* customer service stands behind product (although I haven&#x27;t had to contact them yet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I bought this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one more thing to say:&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t floss, DO IT. DO IT  EVERY DAY. If I had, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be writing this review right now. FLOSS, MY CHILDREN!! and make your kids floss too, if you have &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a solution to my deteriorating oral health.  I am over 40 with the typical receding gums, and all of my molars are crowns.  It seems as though every time I go to the dentist things are worse.  I call it my race to the gumline.  I floss, use the highest end Sonicare toothbrush, use mouthwash, but it&#x27;s still not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist put me on perio-maintenance. She did a deep cleaning/scaling and then wanted to put antibiotic on each molar for another $360.  My budget forced me to draw the line there.  Instead she prescribed Chlorhexadine and gave me a syringe with which to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the prescription filled the directions said to use with a Waterpik. Well I didn&#x27;t have one, and really oral irrigation is the only thing left for me to try, so I decided to go online to Amazon and see what they had.  I didn&#x27;t want a full-blown Waterpik with the separate basin since I have a small bathroom with a pedestal sink. I had no idea that they were available with an on-board reservoir.  I compared the Waterpik rating to this Toiletree irrigator and decided this one had better ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four weeks later I visited my hygienist and am very pleased to report that I have improvements in all of my problem areas. Some improved from a 5 to a 4.  Others remained a 5 but now have no bleeding.  In fact there was no bleeding at all anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say this item is my new best friend. And at this low price point I&#x27;m pretty sure my savings at not requiring another scaling at this dental appointment has already paid for it!</li>
    <li> This was the highest rated water pick on Amazon so how could I lose? Please see all recent reviews on this product for November. This product stopped working for no reason after less than 2 months use, just like the other posters have indicated. It does not shoot water anymore, just gives a buzzing sound. Inferior product. Do not buy under any circumstances.</li>
    <li> I used this product once per day for about two weeks. I started to see good results with my gums and was very optimistic.  However, it soon stopped working. The on/off button seems to be the problem.  At first it would start after I pressed the button more than ten times, and now it just won&#x27;t turn on.  Obviously, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Evidently, judging from other reviews, there was a bad batch sent out around Oct 2012. Mine did the same thing, worked great for about a month, then died (after charging). But I really loved it for that month! So I just called Customer Service and they are sending me a replacement. I will update my review about a month after I get the new one. Their Cust Svc is really good. You get a real person immediately. That&#x27;s worth a second chance in itself.&lt;br /&gt;Update as of Jan.2013. Its been well over a month and I just had to recharge it. So now we&#x27;ll see if it does the same thing as before - starts and stops on its own. Sorry to see that many people reviewing in January 2013 are still having the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;Feb 3, 2013 - I&#x27;ve had the new one for a couple months. Very happy with it. Changed my rate from one star for the old one to 5 stars for the new replacement. Good company. Good product.</li>
    <li> My daughter just got an palatal expander put in and this product has been a lifesaver for cleaning food that gets stuck in it.</li>
    <li> My wife had bought an earlier version by either this manufacturer or a competitor (not sure) and been very disappointed, so she advised me to get the bigger, bulkier type with the separate reservoir. But wanting a handheld, self-contained unit, and reading all the positive reviews, I held my breath and ordered this one. What a pleasant surprise how well it worked, how convenient, easy to re-charge...the works. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this small appliance.  It seems powerful enough to do the job, and once I learn to not take it out of my mouth while it&#x27;s running, I&#x27;ll like it better!  I like that it isn&#x27;t a big monster sitting on the counter.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery, wonderful product, easy to use, makes your teeth and gums shiny. I highly recommend this version of oral hygiene over the countless other Water Piks, and lesser products.</li>
    <li> I am an avid flosser, but floss could not reach food particles that were getting stuck on the side of my tooth due to gum recession.  I could not get the food out and it was driving me crazy.  I thought a water pik might be the perfect solution, but I have a pedestal sink and did not have the room for a cumbersome model with a large reservoir.  This model solved my problem.  I absolutely love it.  I can&#x27;t believe all of the particles it removes from my teeth and gums.  My whole mouth feels so much cleaner.  There is plenty of water to clean my teeth without a refill.  I like the 3 power setting.  I use this all the time and am very happy that I have it.  I would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I initially purchased the older Toilettree product, that used three AA Lithium batteries, but was shipped originally with three AA alkaline batteries that did not last more than a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I am afraid my review of this original product was the straw that broke that configurations back.&lt;br /&gt;Toilettree removed the product from Amazon right after my review and sent me three lithium batteries, and the unit has been working without a problem for a year now.&lt;br /&gt;In talking to Tolettree, I mentioned my thoughts on the power supply problem as Lithium batteries are very expensive and recommended they go with rechargeable Li-ion batteries if there pump motor would take it.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like they actually tried to go one better by including an AC to DC (wall wart) adapter and an internal rechargeable battery for Rev B, (called a GSI unit) but the battery and charger did not match each other, (and still don&#x27;t as it is still for sale at $10.00 less, but don&#x27;t buy it) and all hell ensued.&lt;br /&gt;ToletTree sent me (at no charge) Rev C that you just plug in to recharge and I think they got it right this time.  The unit works great and lasts a very long time on a charge and you don&#x27;t need batteries (No Rev, and Rev-A), or a wall wart (Rev-B), just plug it in (Final Rev-C).&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the easiest to use irrigator I have used and does a great job of getting to those spots that should be gotten to.  The fluid container can be a bit of a pain to slip on, but you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Liked the size and shape and that it was rechargible. However, for me, i didn&#x27;t think it was all that powerful. I was like &#x27;is this it?&#x27; Other Reviewers indicated it was so strong on normal that you should start on &#x27;soft&#x27; speed, maybe because my gums are pretty healthy and others indicated theirs were too sensitive -or maybe mine was a defective model as it stopped working after a month. I didn&#x27;t like that  in the directions it instructed not to keep it plugged in but to recharge it when it feels like it&#x27;s slowing down - I&#x27;d rather have a meter or light or something than to have to subjectively notice when it needs it. As it was, I went out of town for a week and when I came back it didn&#x27;t turn on, which made sense, then after I recharged overnight it just  never turned on again.&lt;br /&gt;In the packaging, they have a big notification to call them with any issue before returning the device, but because I was dissatisfied with the flow strength I was happy to have an excuse to return it, because returning it used was not an option with amazon unless it was defective. When I was initially wondering about the flow strength, I emailed the mfg about what the PPM (pulse per minute) was because I noticed that other brands had that specification listed, they said they would get back with me but never did.</li>
    <li> Great product. Light, powerful, easy to fill, easy to clean, can see the food flush down the drain. Wish I had bought one earlier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 3 water pick,etc type irrigators over the last15 +years. So far I like this on the best. I don&#x27;t mind filling it up twice.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased to replace an old dead rechargeable waterpik, which never held enough charge to last more than 1 session At which point it became too weak to work effectively.  Figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit works for about SIX evenings before I have to charge it again which is great when i travel.  In addition the charging port is much sturdier than the one on the WaterPik, which eventually gave out on me.  On the WaterPik, the thin center metal prong broke off inside the charger plug after becoming rusty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Item comes with two mouthpieces, and it has three different strengths or vibrations which I like very much.  Works just as well as the WaterPik!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  in addition to the quality of this product, the company that backs it has FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I sent an email stating that it seemed my charger wasn&#x27;t working with my order number about 3 months after I got it, asking who i needed to contact.  But i didnt get an email answer because instead i had a new charger at my door within 2 days!!! insanely awesome!!!!!  They didn&#x27;t make me send the broken one back or anything!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to those who say its hard to angle it to refill, just use a lower flow of water (where it&#x27;s not bubbling out) and it fills up in 15 seconds, it&#x27;s only when the water is at a high rate of flow that the back-flow stops water from going in the smaller hole.  But really it&#x27;s not an issue at all, it&#x27;s easy and fast.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  I use it all the time after meals.  I wish they made one to carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> At first this irrigator was awesome. The charge lasted longer than a portable waterpik I have and the output is stronger. I travel for a living and the ability to take the unit without carrying a charger is very nice. Everything was great for about 7 weeks and then it quit working. I emailed the seller and received a reply the same day. He explained he knew of this problem with some of the units recently sold and offered a free replacement. Yes! I received the unit within a week and it&#x27;s been working fine. As long as it keeps working I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Well, this Oral Irrigator worked fine for a while...but it leaks and the tip is very hard to remove....also, takes a while to charge...&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a better easier more efficient  Oral Irrigator....&lt;br /&gt;I use this only when I travel...which is what I purchased it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for one to take its place..</li>
    <li> Good product, but wish it was a bit more powerful. Haven&#x27;t found a cordless one yet that works any better though.</li>
    <li> This product is designed to clean debris, plaque and bateria from between your teeth and along the gum line. AND it works. WAY BETTER than floss! Works 100x better, and works better than EVEN the floss picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never had the experience of using an oral irrigator before (Except at the dentist, of course). So I was extremely excited to try this! It is battery operated, so you aren&#x27;t stuck to cords. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting the cords wet or Adam breaking his neck clotheslining himself on it while we both getting ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral Irrigator is amazing! It is lightweight and compact, and the charge on it lasts for 45 days! How amazing is that! I love that I can store this in my bathroom cabinet and reach it when I need it, it takes up such a small space!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two color coded nozzles, so that Adam and I can each have our own without accidentally getting them confused (if they were the same color). If you haven&#x27;t ever used an oral irrigator before- BEWARE: You will fall IN LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had never used one before- I turned it on and accidentally sprayed my stepbrother AND the ceiling. It was pretty hilarious. You might also want to consider not putting it against your teeth AND closing your mouth. You don&#x27;t want to end up with a wet shirt before work! LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works in ways that floss never could! The pressure from the water goes through the spaces and cracks between teeth to push out stuck food, plaque, and everything else! My mouth feels so healthy and my breath SO fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Oral Irrigator is super simple. The Blue part (on the back) detaches and you can fill it up with water OR mouthwash. You push the on/off button and then can choose which mode you want. It comes with 3 different modes; Normal, Soft, and Pulse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use normal, but if I have eaten something that has stuck between my teeth- I use the pulse. It pushes the water or mouthwash with an even harder force to get that hard to reach. AND I don&#x27;t have saliva all over my fingers (as I would have using floss)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be perfect for taking on a trip. It is so compact that It could fit into my travel bag and because the tips come off- it&#x27;s an even bigger PLUS! I have been using this after every meal and snack. I just LOVE how refreshed it makes my mouth!! &#x3D;Pharder force to get that hard to reach. AND I don&#x27;t have saliva all over my fingers (as I would have using floss)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be perfect for taking on a trip. It is so compact that It could fit into my travel bag and because the tips come off- it&#x27;s an even bigger PLUS! I have been using this after every meal and snack. I just LOVE how refreshed it makes my mouth!! &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> I got the Oral Irrigator a week ago and i love it. I love the battery life on it and the fact that its rechargeable. It comes with two interchangeable nozzles which is nice that way someone else can use it. When i use it my teeth actually feel clean and it has 3 different settings on it,normal,soft and pulse. My favorite is the pulse. The only thing that was a negative was getting use to using it at first i was very messy. so overall i give this product 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I received the ToiletTree oral irrigator just a day or two after ordering it, even though I opted for the slowest shipping option.  That was a pleasant surprise.  The irrigator is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now (twice a day), and haven&#x27;t recharged the battery since the day it arrived.  It works well, but is so powerful it stung my gums a little when I first started using it.</li>
    <li> Purchased on September 6, 2012. During the following months charging got progressively worse. It got to the point where it had to be charged every three days. Now it quit working altogether, motor runs, no spray. Checked for clogs, none found. Reading other reviews, the same issue comes up. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased three of the ToiletTree Rechargeable Oral Irrigators.  The good: We are very happy with the effectiveness of the irrigators.  They have plenty of water pressure and a choice of how the water pulses.  The well holds enough water to do the job.  The bad:  One unit went dead after less than a month of use.  It was definitely the unit and not the cord.  However, it was easy to return and we like the units enough to purchase a new replacement.  As long as our current units keep running for a reasonable period, we are very happy with the purchases.</li>
    <li> Worked well. I loved it when it worked. Unfortunately it stopped working after a couple months. It stopped charging - I see the blue light when I plug it in but it would just not turn on.</li>
    <li> I have used both the Waterpik and Panasonic oral irrigator products for years on a daily basis. I decided to replace my Panasonic model with the ToiletTree product and both times I gave it a try it injured me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle on the tip of the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; does not seem to be bent enough and was very difficult to direct between the teeth without making my gums bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The force of the water through the tip on any of the settings was too intense and make the inside of my cheek bleed and put two holes in my lip that gave me a fat lip for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have returned this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience...it is not safe and causes injury.</li>
    <li> Ordered this so I can get a nice refreshing clean before bed. Piece of s*** broke on me a week later. Needless to say my mouth is no longer fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product as she has an expander and it helps dislodge all the food particles.  We mostly use this for travel.  It is small, compact and easy to pack.  The reservoir is small but my daughter will fill it three times for use.  Has a charger and hasn&#x27;t failed us yet!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I used this daily for a month. A couple of nights ago, it just turned itself on (at 1am, and it was LOUD) and wouldn&#x27;t turn off. Tried to get to the battery compartment, but no dice. I just sort of stared at it, horrified, for about 5 minutes until it (I guess?) ran itself down and turned off. I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to work again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, so much for that! It&#x27;s about a week past the 30 day return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: In the month that I had it, I only charged it a few times. I felt that it held the charge well. This was my first oral irrigator, and I enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a pro or a con: At first I felt like there wasn&#x27;t enough water in the tank to do my whole mouth, but I was able to get it down to a science and get my whole mouth done without having to re-fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It stopped working after a month. It&#x27;s very loud. I HATED filling the tank. The opening was very small and it was really hard to fill. I had to put the water on a tiny trickle (and even that was too much, sometimes) and sit there for a looooong time while the tank filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> Worked great while it worked but now it&#x27;s dead.  Only had for 3 months and then it just died.  Plan n calling customer service to see what they can do.</li>
    <li> This Rechargeable Oral Irrigator is very good. I hate flossing and my dentist has been all over me about the probable gum damage that will result. This irrigator should aleviate a lot of those issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it. He told me it cleans between his teeth much better than flossing.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it is so easy to use and can be taken in the shower so no mess with water to deal with! And so compact!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It works better than water pik so far.  The different settings is nice.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, mostly. Needed a rechargeable irrigator because we live in a house that house a grand total of one outlet for two bathrooms (which I imagine was a luxury in 1927, when the house was built). My wife loves it and the few times I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s been great. Holds a charge well, has enough capacity for doing its job, and looks nice by the other 5 appliances when it&#x27;s sitting by the outlet.</li>
    <li> This has decent pressure and changable heads, but I always have difficulties filling it up which is a pain because I have to fill it up 2 to 3 times when I used it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oral irrigator in December and it really loved how it worked and for it&#x27;s ease of use, that is until the third week. The blue charge light just kept blinking and it would not recharge or work again. I returned this product to Amazon and was very disappointed. My original review gave it a one star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I complained to Toilettree, they contacted me and sent me a new oral irrigator at no charge. They told me there was a batch of them that had an electrical problem and it had since been corrected.&lt;br /&gt;So far this one is working well without the problem of the original one I purchased. I will update this review in a few months. I still very much appreciate that it is very easy to use, easy to fill and I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been reliable. I just wish it were stronger. For travelling purposes, the job gets done well enough. I haven&#x27;t really had a travel irrigator that was terrific. But again, this one works fine for temporary purposes.</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid attention to the previous negative reviews regarding this product. It worked well--for three or four days! Then, although it was fully charged, it stopped working. Attempts to troubleshoot a problem have been unsuccessful, so the product remains unusable and was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Easy grip, easy to use, lightweight in case of travel, good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to suggest any changes, I would expand top opening and would expand water tank capacity as I currently need to reload it at least one more time in order to correctly clean my teeth. I mean: at present, I load it, use it, reload it and use it once again.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if adding water capacity would also add weight to the device. If so, better leave it as it is.</li>
    <li> The oral irrigator is great so far and only time will tell the rest. It was inexpensive and it was exactly what I was looking for. I like the multiple settings and the fact that it has two interchangeable heads for different people to put their dirty mouth germs on. I use it as a form of flossing and to get stuck on grime on the top of my teeth. All that lovely stuff. I even tried it on my cat. He got sprayed in the mouth while trying to eat a stink bug and he was drooling from the taste. I tried to wash his mouth out with the oral irrigator, however, I don&#x27;t suggest others using the product in this way.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time and in very good condition. The customer reviews were very useful and turned out to give me a good description of the performance of the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this irrigator to use at work, since my dentist had dire predictions for my dental health and I am determined to do everything I can to make my teeth and gums healthier (I have a full-size one that I use at home).  The product was received the day after I ordered it, to my amazement - a day before promised (2-day shipping from my Amazon Prime membership).  The irrigator works as well as the full-size one, with a strong water flow, which does a great job of cleaning between teeth.  I am very happy with this product and with the company&#x27;s customer service in filling the order so quickly.</li>
    <li> Your oral irrigator works as you said it would. I like its compactness and ease of use. It occcupies very little space on my vanity and there is no cord. Good design.</li>
    <li> Works great.  No mess.  I&#x27;m always in a hurry in the morning and this is fast and very easy to use.  Gets the food out of all the nooks and crannies that really cause a lot of pain if I don&#x27;t use this daily.  Can&#x27;t live i without it.  It goes on every trip with me!</li>
    <li> I have not used an oral irrigator or water pick before.  When I was offered a chance to review this Oral Irrigator for Toilet Tree Products, I accepted the challenge gladly.  At first I was not thrilled with water being sprayed in my mouth and all over my face as I attempted to learn to use this new device.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or not, but determined to give it a fair trial.  I have used it off and on now for over a month, and I have noticed a difference in the cleanliness of my mouth in the mornings.  I usually use it only at night before bed, and after already brushing my teeth as usual.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like best is that I feel that my mouth is cleaner and fresher than usual in the mornings (morning breath is much less offensive - lol).  Another thing I really like is that it is rechargeable.  The battery seems to last for quite a while before needing recharged.&lt;br /&gt;One other positive I have to mention, is that the water tank is easy to fill.  It can be removed to fill, or there is a lift-top lid where water can be added while the tank is still attached.&lt;br /&gt;Things I do not like, is that the head does not swivel to aid in getting between the back teeth, or back of the mouth, so I end up spraying a bit more water outside my mouth and getting a bit wet in the process.  I do not know if this is a usual occurance with all water pick type devices or just this one, but it is a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I have is that on high setting, the water is too rough on my gums, but the low setting is not quite strong enough.  I&#x27;d love to see a medium setting included.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this Oral Irrigator from Toilet Tree Products as an addition to my oral care regimen, and although I feel it needs a bit of improvement, I did like the overall results enough to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample of this product for this review.  All reviews are my personal and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday to replace an old Waterpik. It is a step down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:The tip does not swivel, so you have to maneuver the entire unit around to reach all teeth-it&#x27;s awkward.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;high capacity\\&quot; tank has to be filled several times to complete a session.&lt;br /&gt;Once I saw it in person I felt it was overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:Handy for travel.</li>
    <li> I was searching an alternative for 6 broken Waterpick that I had.&lt;br /&gt; I found the \\&quot;Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree Products\\&quot; and bought.&lt;br /&gt;When I received, a good surprise, everything that I missed from Waterpik, I found in this one.&lt;br /&gt; So far I am very happy with this product and the price is a good deal comparing with others.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent battery reserve for a full vacation. Tank is about half what is needed so two tanks per use but that is not bad for a cordless. I&#x27;ve had two waterpik cordless and this one is much better and strong.</li>
    <li> I received this product about two and a half months ago.  I was very happy with its operation, but it quit yesterday and is inoperable. I have read the other reviews on corrosion problems, but I am not a repair shop and am unwilling to pay forty dollars for a time fuse.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in mid-August, and it worked great.  I even bought a second one a couple of weeks later for the office.  (I have a bunch of dental work that HAS to be kept clean.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light, easy to refill, charges within an hour or so, keeps its charge, very very effective at gently cleaning around a bunch of difficult dental work/teeth/gums.  Love the product and recommended it to my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;When it stops working, it stops working dead.  The first one I bought turned itself on in the middle of the night.  I figured \\&quot;OK, fluke\\&quot;, so I popped the water compartment out and put it on the charger.  Next day it worked fine, but in the few days after that, the on/off button became sporadic, and it turned itself on at least once more in the middle of the night.  It doesn&#x27;t start at all anymore.  My one at the office is working like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to do here. I don&#x27;t have the warranty card, and I&#x27;m out of the return period, but I really like the product.  My recommendation: buy the irrigator, but keep your paperwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[edit: I&#x27;m completely amazed.  I posted this note, and the company voluntarily reached out to contact me and replace it.  Great product and its backed up by amazing customer service.  Changing my 1 star review to 5 stars.  Many thanks, guys]</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this water pic everyday, it makes your gums tighter and we are amazed at how much food particles come out even after brushing. The price was so much lower than the one at costco and they are the same power. We are happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> After using this item for a couple of weeks, I am equiped with the experience to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The battery is good. One change is good for about 2 weeks daily usage by me and my wife. This is quite impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The water tank is poorly manafuctured with cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is no cover to shield the muzzle, leaving it open in the air.&lt;br /&gt;3. After usage, the water can easily enter the hole to charge the device. I guess that may damage the device for short-circurt when you charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The unit stopped working after about 2 months usage. Either quality is poor or I got a defective unit. Will contact the CS</li>
    <li> Just bought this to replace my Water Pik.  What an improvement!  So much easier to use.  Easy to hold, reservoir holds a good amount of water, charge lasts longer than Water Pik did, 3 settings to choose from.  Good price, fast delivery.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased the \\&quot;Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS\\&quot;, but was greatly disappointed because it stopped working after one year.  I took a look at the reviews and found that a lot of people were saying the same thing so I decided too move on.  Enter the ToiletTree Irrigator and its 4-star reviews!  Well, needless to say, I was disappointed.  I purchased two (one for the wife) and mine stopped working 30 days on the dot.  Hers stopped working about 37 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, maybe pumping a stream of water is way harder than I imagine and making one that lasts is nearly impossible.  Water flossing is (normally) part of my nightly routine (floss --&gt; brush --&gt; water pik) so I&#x27;m going to get another one, but I&#x27;ll be going back to the Waterpik and accepting that it&#x27;ll probably die a year later.  However, under no circumstances should anyone get this ToiletTree flosser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an oral irrigator for over 20 years, and have previously owned a portable Panasonic and WaterPik. I have a counter top irrigator at home, and like to take one when I travel. Bought this when my portable WaterPik went out. Let&#x27;s start with the pluses: It has good power, recharges quickly, and holds its charge for 6-8 uses. It&#x27;s easy to operate and hold while being used. It does have to be refilled to completely clean your mouth, but it is a portable and so some size must be sacrificed.&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad: My first issue was that it&#x27;s very difficult to fill. You can either slide down the reservoir, remove it, fill it, then replace it - which I find clumsy, or you can try to fill it thru the small hole at the top. It does not fit easily under many hotel sink faucets, and if you manage to get it under the sink faucet, the hole is so small that air bubbles form and prevent the water from entering the hole. I&#x27;ve found filling a glass and pouring slowly works, but it&#x27;s VERY inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;The BIGGEST problem is that after about 25 uses over 4-5 weeks IT JUST STOPPED WORKING! I&#x27;m trying to reach their service organization, but apparently they only take calls during the day. Not a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Don&#x27;t expect any portable to work as well as the counter top models, but they are better than just flossing.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the ToiletTree oral irrigator I purchased a few months ago.  I purchased this because I have permanent retainers on both my upper and lower teeth (behind my teeth), thereby making it impossible to floss near the gumline of the covered teeth.  Not wanting to promote decay in those spaces, I decided to try an oral irrigator to aid in removing food that was stuck in and around the affected teeth.  There are three options of cleaning - normal, slow and pulse.  All three do a fabulous job at loosening any stuck particles of food between your teeth.  The water receptacle provides a more than generous amount of water to be able to get the job done.  I can usually do my whole mouth twice around before I run out of water.  (And to those other reviewers who complained that the water tank was not large enough - HELLO!  just refill the tank!!  To me, that is not something to complain about!).  As with any oral irrigator, the process can be a bit messy, because water does tend to spray out of your mouth and around the sink area, and then has to be mopped up.  Again, not complaining, just pointing that out.  The device holds a charge well.  I can usually get about three days out of it before I notice that the device is slowing down some.  I would definitely recommend this device!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of a recommendation from my dentist. It was suggested as a good alternative to flossing. I&#x27;ve had this water-pick for a couple weeks now and have been using it pretty regularly (and have only charged it once so far). I must say it is MUCH more comfortable for me to use than attempting to fit my fist in my mouth to floss, that and I&#x27;m not spending extra time trying to get a piece of floss unstuck from between my teeth. Having said that I use this while in the shower as it can get you and the area around you soaking wet fairly quickly. I use the pulse setting so it doesn&#x27;t use up the water in the reservoir too fast and I can get my whole mouth done in one pass. Filling the tank isn&#x27;t difficult but it can be annoying to have to stop and refill it to continue and I always make sure to dry it off completely when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> This is one great tool. However, check the price before you purchase. I paid about $35 but see that some vendors are selling at much higher prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small. The charge lasts for a long time. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem when the small plastic hose that fits in the water tank broke. I called the company and they sent me a new one at no charge. I fill the tank with a mix of mouthwash and water and this may have contributed to the problem with the hose. What I now do, is rinse the tank after each use and hold the hose under a running faucet for a few seconds with the unit on, to clean the internals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I found the tank a bit small but as I refined my technique, I have found it more than large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recharge on weekends - this takes about 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, using this product has improved my dental health and at an exam, the dentist commented that my oral hygine was excellent. Keeping your teeth healthy requires that you keep your gums healthy and this tool works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely designed and good customer service. A winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this lasts a long time but when it breaks I will replace it.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the last make of this item and after a year or so, the battery compartment just did not close anymore.  I went on here to purchase another one and they had stated that they took the customer comments and improved on the newer model AND that if you had the older model they would send you one for free.  AND THEY DID!!!!  I love this thing and it is def more stronger than its predecessor.  It is so strong that it actually takes off grime on my bathroom tiles, I actually use it in the shower and sometimes clean it now with it.  I do refill it at least once to really get a thorough cleaning but that is no issue for me.  Not only is the product is great for me but the customer service is IMPRESSIVE.  They responded right away to my email request and sent me the irrigator within a few days.  They are awesome.  It is worth buying it knowing that it will do the job but also they stand firm behind their product and really are in tune with customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over a month now and LOVE it. Read some of the other, earlier reviews and you will definitely be convinced to purchase from ToiletTree. I&#x27;ve had 4 (four!) Waterpik oral irrigators within the past 2 years and when they wouldn&#x27;t replace (under warranty) the last one, I threw it out, did some homework on the ToiletTree company and was convinced to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I decided to go with distilled water (another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion) in order to extend the life of the parts from sediment build up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use while traveling, as I have a countertop model for home use.  I have tested this unit only once to be sure it would fit my needs and am very pleased.  The unit holds adequate water and is easy to handle. Although the water bursts are not quite as strong as my countertop model, it does an adequate cleaning job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this oral irrigator is so poorly designed that I refuse to subject myself to the annoyance of using it.  I&#x27;m returning it and will look for a better designed product.  The problem occurs with the water input opening.  First, the opening is located at the top of the irrigator so you must hold it upright under the faucet. Since bathroom sinks tend to be shallow relative to the height of the faucet spout, this makes filling unnecessarily difficult.  If the water input was located on the base of the irrigator, you could tilt the irrigator to the side and easily fill the body of the irrigator with water, but this design doesn&#x27;t permit tilting to fill.  Second, the water input site is more than 50% blocked by a plastic piece that reduces the size of the opening to such a degree that trying to fill the tank results in only a very, very small trickle actually entering the tank. The vast majority of water running from the faucet above splashes all over the sink and the top of the irrigator. It takes a long time to fill, wasting water in the process.  It&#x27;s aggrevating to use and not worth the effort. I can&#x27;t imagine that the designers ever tried to use this product as it would be immediately clear that the design makes pleasurable, easy filling impossible.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was intrigued enough to buy this handheld device for it&#x27;s portability. What I discovered, this is not just a portable oral irrigator, it&#x27;s a great product, period. Lightweight, rechargeable and gets the,job done! Also, for the price, it is an absolute bargain.</li>
    <li> i used it for about a month before it lost power and broke down. :( it charged but didnt work</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I have owned two other oral irrigators in the past--both countertop units with small tubes to the handpiece. This product is superior in every way.  The little tube on one of the others broke after a short amount of time and the button on the handpiece would stick in the pause position half of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree product works perfectly.  I like the self-contained design--so that you are not tethered to the countertop watertank and pump. The three modes of operation: normal, soft, and pulse are sufficient.  It is easy to fill from the tap. I am happy to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I suppose it does what is intended.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping would be more powerful&lt;br /&gt;Good for those with weaker gums&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove plaque</li>
    <li> Update: The manufacturer saw my posting and sent me a new water reservoir.  Appreciate the customer service response. (The bottom of the water reservoir cracked and now leaks water.  Not sure why I need more words than that? )</li>
    <li> My dentist loves that I use this. Not every night but approx 4 times per week and it has made a huge difference in my gums.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely non-plussed. I ordered this (older version?) in September and it works exactly as advertised, so I am very pleased. Now, 6 months later, I&#x27;ve got to recharge it and I just don&#x27;t remember where I put the cord. Luckily, I found the tel. # and I explained my problem, as a result I was immediately offered a replacement cord, for free. I didn&#x27;t even have to ask. How can you top this kind of service?</li>
    <li> Very happy with the cordless irrigator that I can use in the shower. Just enough of tank to do my whole mouth</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I had always wondered if it would make a difference in the cleaning of my teeth.  I can honestly say that it has.  My teeth feel much cleaner.  Also, I received this item quickly from the seller.</li>
    <li> I have Ben meaning to write this review for several months  the product has as much force as the fill size teledyne water pic and is much easier to use. The battery holds a charge for a long time.  Most impressive is the fact that the original product I purchased sometime ago stopped working and would not charge. I called the company and tey sent. E a new irrigator--no questions asked. I highly recommend this product and this company</li>
    <li> Strong enough stream of water. Good light weight. Batteries stay charged.&lt;br /&gt;Update: the first one that I bought died after a few months. I contacted the company and they IMMEDIATELY replaced it with a new model that they said fixed the defect in the original. No questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;How nice to see a company that actually backs their product and is serious about customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I am a customer for life and I highly recommend this product and the company that sells it.</li>
    <li> For travel, it&#x27;s fine, but would not recommend for home use.  I have not used other portables - this one is a bit loud but easy to fill and use, just not as powerful as my WaterPik - the only at home irrigator I would use and which gives me great dental checkups!</li>
    <li> This is much easier than using the standard model where you have it sliding on the sink. The only con I can see is that they could&#x27;ve made the water tank easier to fill. I just plug mine back in when I&#x27;m done with it- so don&#x27;t know about the battery life. Enough water and battery to clean my entire mouth. Works good for non removable bridges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an oral irrigator for several years, because even after flossing and brushing, it&#x27;s amazing how much more debris this type of device removes!  When I was going to be out of town for several weeks and discovered I hadn&#x27;t brought mine (a well-known brand that no longer makes this kind of product).  I did a lot of research before making this replacement purchase about a year ago, finding the reviews were much more favorable than more commonly recognized brand names.  I have been very pleased with it - no problems at all - so when my husband&#x27;s oral irrigator, the one I had left at home a year ago, would no longer charge, I purchased one for him, too.</li>
    <li> This thing shoots water so fast and strong that it hurts and makes a mess! When I used it on my gums it was very painful. But when the stream hit my tooth water splashed all over the room! I got water on the wall, the ceiling, and in my eyes! It was actually sorta funny. My husband joked that we should each get one and have a water gun fight lol. Maybe this one just had too much punch, but I had to return it!</li>
    <li> I have had the item since the beginning of November.  Was a 5 star  for 6 weeks. Now it is a 1 star. Despite keeping it fully charged, it now has weak power, so weak almost not worth the frustrating effort of filling it up. A water bubble always forms when filling it up and it takes a lot of manipulation to fill it up.  This was a minor inconvenience when it worked properly,now it is another pain for something that is not working properly. Too bad it had such a short life span. I realize it is probably just a defective one of many that work properly, but such an inconvenience to have to return or exchange and ultimately be without it during the process.</li>
    <li> good irrigation with different modes to choose from...love the wireless feature.&lt;br /&gt;Mine stopped working after 2 months but when I reached the customer service department of the manufacturer, they sent me a new one without questions and apologized for the defective unit I might have gotten.</li>
    <li> I brought the first one for my self and ended up buying&lt;br /&gt;2 more for the family. Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> I bought the irrigator after reading many positive reviews.  The product has lived up to those reviews.  It&#x27;s a funny name but it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought the ToiletTree oral irrigator for my sons, ages 11 and 13.  They both have braces and I just wasn&#x27;t sure they were getting everything with just a toothbrush.  I bought the extra replacement tips so I could use it too.  The reservoir is just the right size for one use, but the charge holds through all 3 sessions.  This worked so well I bought one for my husband and one for my parents to use.  My parents previously used a water pik that had a cord to a small tank.  This got so cumbersome for them that they just put it away.  I&#x27;m glad the ToiletTree irrigator is so compact and easy to use.  I couldn&#x27;t have designed it better myself!</li>
    <li> I bought this same oral irrigator for myself and appreciated so much the job it does that I ordered one for my husband.  He is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My mom loves her portable irrigator. She does have to refill it a couple times to get it all clean but loves the flexibility of taking this with her when she travels.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t bear to be without my water pic when I travel but find the counter top madel too cumbersome to pack.  This portable one is perfect.  It&#x27;s light, packs easily without leaking a drop of water and most importantly does the job.  The water tank could hold a bit more if I had my way but considering the ease of packing I think it&#x27;s well worth the give up.</li>
    <li> Works well but I would like it better if:&lt;br /&gt;1. the water inlet nozzle was larger allowing quicker fill-ups.&lt;br /&gt;1. warmer water was permitted for users like me that have lots of metal in their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;3. the mode button was designed to prevent inadvertent  pressing when shutting it off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on 1 January 2013 and after only 8 months, the unit will no longer charge.  It is completely dead.  I still like the performance; however, for $40, it should last longer than 8 months.</li>
    <li> I had bought another brand that has a more popular name, $10 cheaper but the materials used for this product were so defective. I had to change the nozzle 3x because it was clogged, and then suddenly the battery stopped charging. The water capacity was not enough to do a thorough job. With this ToiletTree irrigator, everything is sturdy, including the nozzle, very solid, and the water pressure is much more effective for cleaning. I have been promised that the battery will not collapse or the product can be replaced. Who could ask for more??</li>
    <li> This ToiletTree irrigator failed after 3 month&#x27;s use.  This unit would no longer respond to any button command or to the charger.  In a word, dead.</li>
    <li> Works great, arrived fast. First of this kind I&#x27;ve purchased, can&#x27;t imagine anything better! Tank is big enough for me. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> As far as the performance of your product:  Excellent!  I happen to be a civil engineer.  At least semi-intelligent...my suggestions after having used the irrigator for a while:  Remembering that this appliance is being used in most people&#x27;s bathrooms; the size of the transformer be reduced;  white transformer and white 12 v cord be used (both look much nicer on a light colored vanity top).  Please change the loction of the plug socket on the unit so it plugs in from the rear.  Such a pain in the ass as designed.  One must constantly rotate the apliance to plug it in, and then the cord has to wrap back 180 degrees to plug into the duplex outlet.  It sure does work much better than the WP model, though!</li>
    <li> Perfect for small spaces and for traveling.  The charge last for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service fantastic.  The first one I received didn&#x27;t work properly.  Within days, I received the replacement.</li>
    <li> This is the first oral irrigator I have used and am pleased with this one I picked out. It is easy to fill, handy to hold and leaves my teeth feeling like I have had a dental cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have had this water flosser for over a month now and use it every day.  I have only had to charge it once since the original charge after I bought it.  It really helps to clean my teeth and gums and is so easy to use.  Much easier than the Waterpic flosser with a reservoir that I have used for years and just as powerful.  Thank you for making such a high quality product.  Your + customer service in the reviews of others and product quality is what influenced my decision to choose this product and I am happy I did.</li>
    <li> This item worked for a couple of months before giving up the ghost. The speed control froze making it impossible to switch between speeds and finally, it stopped functioning altogether.  Flogged as a &amp;#34;Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator?  Any professional using this should lose his or her license. Just a terrible waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have a Via-Jet which I use on occasion should there be an issue that flossing doesn&#x27;t handle. I realized I needed something that didn&#x27;t clutter up the counter top, and most importantly I would use on a daily basis. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many gadgets you have if you don&#x27;t use them consistently. This fit the bill for both issues, as it is streamlined enough to fit into our vanity drawers and we will use it because of it&#x27;s convenience. I was a little concerned it would not have enough power or enough settings to please everyone. This water pik/oral irrigation is gentle enough for my wife and has enough pressure for myself, who likes it more forceful.&lt;br /&gt;We tested it out after we flossed and brushed, what an awakening when you realize what is still left behind in your gums that flossing and brushing just doesn&#x27;t remove. We find the filling of the unit to be no problem as some have stated, there are two options for this but the flip top is very convenient for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had the unit long enough to test it&#x27;s endurance however, it&#x27;s a tight unit, no floppy/loose parts. This is a quality made product. We bought two one for home and one specifically for travel. Advised our daughter who&#x27;s away at college to grab one also, she loves it AND uses it, which I&#x27;m sure will save us $ on the dental bills.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon 2 months ago. The received product had a problem and did not re-charge. Even though the voice mail to customer service was not answered, the email was responded with in 2 days. They sent a new piece that works great. You can really feel that the tooth is super clean. The feeling is the same after a dentist cleans your teeth. In the recent dentist check-up, my dentist was very impressed with the cleanliness of my teeth and asked me how I am keeping it so clean. I wish all dentists recommend this special to folks with gum issues.</li>
    <li> I like the small size.  Easier fit on hard to reach back teeth.  Like long battery life.  Shocked tho at the price for replacement tooth brush heads  over $30 for 4.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to do a better job will weight for dentist opinion</li>
    <li> Nothing is &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with this product, but if you are used to a bigger bowl then it will seem like its too brief and you may want to refill the tank for a second rinse.  But it&#x27;s great for traveling and it is very functional.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B007ZRZSR6 Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator with High Capacity Water Tank by ToiletTree Products]]Great product.  A minor problem is that it&#x27;s difficult to refill.  Holds a charge for two weeks.</li>
    <li> The item arrived within 3 days of when I ordered it.  It was very easy to follow the clear instructions. I used the oral irrigator without any problems.  I feel that it does a thorough job of water-flossing my teeth.  I like the size and that it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Oral Irrigator top rated; it replaced a Portable Waterpik, whose battery failed after 1 year.  Battery failure must be common with this Waterpik unit, as this was the third failure.  Calling Waterpik the third time resulted in &amp;#34;out of luck&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I purchase this in early November. I used it for a one week vacation since it&#x27;s too difficult to travel with the large sink top style.  The battery looses juice fast and needs to be constantly charged.  It worked okay, but does vibrate alot compared to a base (waterpik) model.  I never used it again after that trip until two weeks ago I went on another vacation so pulled it out of the drawer and charged it up.  I got to my destination and it wouldn&#x27;t work.  Now I&#x27;m beyond the 90 day return policy.  I only got 7 days of use from this and it failed on me.  I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buy this product, look into other brands.</li>
    <li> quit taking a charge after 2 months of intermittent use right after warrenty period ended.&lt;br /&gt;waste of time and money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a week but quickly discovered it lacks a trigger switch. You must turn it off and on.  Otherwise it continues to irrigate everything in site which is somewhat annoying if you fail to get it turned off.  I expected it to have a push button control where if you removed your finger from the switch it turned off.  Not so:(</li>
    <li> I bought the older version of this product a month before the improved version was released.  Six months later I complained to ToiletTree Product that a piece had broken.  &amp;#34;We&#x27;ll send you a new irrigator&amp;#34;, they said.  &amp;#34;No need to return the old one.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed and delighted.</li>
    <li> I purchased this over 6 months ago and I love it.  The charge lasts about a month. It is easy to clean and use.&lt;br /&gt;The water tank can come off so you can make sure it is all dry before traveling. The only downside is the plug to charge is in the front which gets wet with use. So you have to make sure you clean and dry it out before charging. But it is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend over some other \\&quot;travel\\&quot; oral irrigators.&lt;br /&gt;Edit***  I have used this product for just over 9 months and it gave out already. So I am a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t even make it to a full year.  I ended up buying a regular counter top waterpik. On the plus side my husband uses the new one too.</li>
    <li> They claim &amp;#34;high capacity water  tank&amp;#34; but they nowhere tell how much is high capacity which turns out to be a mere&lt;br /&gt;4 ounces ( 1/2 of a cup) which to me is not very much.  Also, it is quite difficult to remove the nozzle (tip) after each use due to the fact that there is no lip on the tip to get a grip and pull up on. There are some ridges to put your fingers around but they are of no use because they are vertical and your fingers will just slip off of them . They should be horizontal to get a reliable grip for removal. The water does not last the 60 seconds that they claim. It lasts just 45 seconds on normal setting. It is, though, compact for travel which is good. In my opinion, the Waterpik cordless&lt;br /&gt;waterflosser WP-450 (although a bit more bulky) is a much better built unit and a better choice.</li>
    <li> whatever you do, do not clean your tonsil pockets out with this thing- you will be bleeding allover. the pressure is so strong. it comes with multiple heads which is great, and it is portable, but the little water container in it runs out fast so you must constantly re-fill</li>
    <li> I suppose it does clean out crevices in the mouth including teeth and tonsil area but even on the lowest/ &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; setting, it hurt.</li>
    <li> I had this for less than 8 months and it just stopped working. Please replace Toilet Tree. I loved your product until then.</li>
    <li> Per Toilet Tree Products enclosed instruction, I didn&#x27;t return it to Amazon!  I called Toilet Tree Customer Service at 1-888-251-0985 to talk with their Product Customer Service.  However, I couldn&#x27;t talk to anyone OR leave a message, because their mailbox was FULL!!!  Now, isn&#x27;t that re-assuring??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have resorted to eMail.  What do you want anyway for $39.95 and made in China.  My problem is that it&#x27;s happening more and more today.  The Chinese products that I purchase, don&#x27;t even make it through the infant mortality stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Oral Irrigator, Model TTP-ROI-01, Lot Number 202 worked as advertised for 5-days and then the motor started humming and NOT pumping any water.  Also, the mode selection button started also not to work correctly and could NOT always be used to select Normal, Soft, or Pulse modes.  And then the motor only hums away anyway, - so who cares!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation, I have gone out and purchased a 120V Water Pic Ultra Flosser, Model WP-100W(W) which is also made in China!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might as well simply just shoot myself in the foot rather that sending ALL my precious fresh printed diluted dollars to China!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Help Us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all Happy Oral Health</li>
    <li> Positive - attractive, and doesn&#x27;t take nearly as much room as a water pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative - Not the easiest to fill, but that&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t keep one from buying.&lt;br /&gt;Big negative for me, that no matter the setting it literally was so strong it was painful, and I&#x27;m used to the Water Pic on full strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a portion of my soil that needs aerating, and it would probably do great.....or tattooing the roof of my mouth if I were so inclined.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews on this item before purchasing it. Some of them are just not valid. A lot of people were complaining that the entry hole for water was too small and that the pick was cumbersome. I have a very small sink and I simply had to tilt the pick horizontally. Some people complained that the battery didn&#x27;t give it enough power. Not true, this waterpick is very powerful. When I first started it, it sprayed me in the back of the throat and I almost choked. It has a very strong stream. Finally, there were complaints that this pick burns out easily. Well, this one was true for me. After using the pick for a few weeks, it stopped up-taking water, then the power button stopped responding and finally it went kaput.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pick exceeded my expectations by far; until it broke.</li>
    <li> Work great, poor design and durability.  The water reservoir is difficult to clean and poorly designed.  Over time, the residual water becomes stagnate and dirty.</li>
    <li> I needed a new irrigator and decided to try a different brand from the one I have used for years (water pic).  I like this one much better.  I always thought it was gross how I couldn&#x27;t completely empty the tank on the old ones, but I can squirt all of the water out of this one because of the hose apparatus.  Also this has a light to tell me that it&#x27;s charged and that shows which mode I am using.  It is very convenient to know if it needs charging or not.  It is easy and comfortable in my hand,  and I find that the tank holds just the right amount of water for a good cleaning.  My teeth are crowded in my mouth and I have been happy with the cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having trouble filling the tank easily and wrote an email to the company.  I had an email back the same morning (from the company president) with a helpful tip about removal of the tank for filling.  Easy peasy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad, and he said the flow was so strong it made his gums bleed.  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> The Oral Irrigator makes flossing easy. The tank holds just enough water to do the job. It really is a great product, and I highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Nice concept, but the first unit stopped working after a few months. The company replaced it with no argument or cost, kudos to their customer service. But the replacement unit just stopped working also. I wonder if the switch plate is fully sealed? I didn&#x27;t immerse the things but oral irrigation is a sloppy business and water runs down the handle to some extent. Perhaps the seals failed, water gets in and corrodes the contacts. Also, I disassembled the first unit after it was replaced and found that the batteries are nickel metal hydride - better than NiCads, not as good as lithium. The unit is hard to disassemble which makes it hard to properly dispose of - rechargeable batteries shouldn&#x27;t go in the landfill. All that said, I&#x27;m a convert to oral irrigation and have ordered a regular corded unit.</li>
    <li> The tank seems to hold just under the right amount of water when using it, but other than that it works really well.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after two weeks.  Had very low power to begin with.  No place to return it to to.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product so far.  I bought one for myself and one for my husband.  It is much more convenient than the wired irigators.  The only drawback is the tank needs to be refilled half way through.  It would be nice to have a double size tank.  Other than that, I am very pleased with the purchase</li>
    <li> I purchased the ToiletTree Oral Irrigator for my wife who had some dental implants. Her gums were imflamed and had \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; around the implants. She was in pain and there were odors coming from under the dental bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the ToiletTree irrigator a few times, it flushed out some pieces of temporary cement that were missed in her dental cleaning. These cement pieces were in the gum pockets which probably prevented the gum from healing and caused the inflammation, pain and odor. As a result, the imflammation, the pain and odor is almost gone. She feels that her gums are now beginning to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am very pleased with this Oral Irrigator but it has some small issues. The first is that it takes a long time to charge (about 8 hours) each time my wife uses it. But in all fairness, she uses it for 20+ minutes after each meal which is probably much more extensively than a person with healthy teeth and gums. The second issue is that the tank is hard to fill through the little door opening which is too small to fill quickly. We got around this simply by removing the tank from the unit, filling it, and then putting it back. The last issue is that sometimes the unit does not want to start in \\&quot;pulse soft\\&quot; mode. The motor buzzes but nothing comes out. To work around this problem we put the machine into normal mode start it up and then immediately put it back into soft mode. Then it works fine. So it might be that we got a unit that was missed by ToiletTree QA but this unit has been such a lifesaver for my wife that we are going to keep it regardless of a few idiosyncrasies.  We use distilled water to keep the unit clean of hard water deposits.</li>
    <li> Was working fine for the first three days, then it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I recharged it for 8 hours before my first use and I was very careful using it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to recharge it and never worked again&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on my previous comment: I am pleasantly surprised by the prompt remedial action, and I give a five stars now because of the instant feedback.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item as a replacement to a waterpik. The waterpik worked ok but took up way too much space and the coiled water hoses wouldn&#x27;t stay put. I stuck it under the counter and rarely used it. Saw this item and read the reviews, price was right so I gave it a try. Works great, better than I expected. I didn&#x27;t find the item difficult to fill. Really surprised at how powerful it is and love the fact that it has such a low profile.</li>
    <li> and she loves it!  She has not had any problems with it and she is 86 years old.  It is easy to use and she said it does a great job on her implants.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to be used for travel but once I tried it out at home, I found that I love that its small and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room on my counter as a Waterpik.  So now I mainly use the ToiletTree product.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the options as Waterpik but it still does a decent job.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I love how clean my mouth feels after using it.  I have troubled gums and I believe this will help stop alot of my gum issues.  The seller is fast and efficient and I would definietly buy more products from them, including the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a Thursday and received it on Monday.  It was charged and ready to go.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and have nothing negative to say about it.  Anxious for my next dental check up to see how it does.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an ancient WaterPik which finally died.  I was thinking that since the Oral Irrigator was self-contained, it would be easier to use.  It isn&#x27;t.  It does, however, do basically what it is purported to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does blow out debris between teeth&lt;br /&gt;Not tethered to the wall or base unit&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bulky, cumbersome, but you eventually get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Only two pressure settings (the &#x27;high&#x27; setting NOT recommended for beginners; can hurt gums and soft tissue.)&lt;br /&gt;Flashing blue light, while recharging, can be annoying if kept in bathroom attached to bedroom and door is left open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I need to replace this unit, I probably look for a different product.</li>
    <li> Right size for travel although I prefer a bigger tank for more capacity.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it takes too much time to charge.  Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on reviews from others, particularly one that expressed a preference for this over a Groupon offer.  I expected the amount of water in the tank to last through one cleaning.  Wrong.  It takes at least 3 refills of approximately 4 ounces each to complete the job.  This is a nuisance and stretches the time it takes to clean your gums considerably.  I still feel the need to use a gum stimulator tip to scrape plaque from the base of my teeth.  Perhaps a product that used a thinner but more powerful stream of water would be more accurate and avoid having to refill.  This is my first \\&quot;waterpik\\&quot; like product and I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I read all the other reviews, and decided to give this a try.  First of all, other reviewers who had problems were quick to note that the manufacturer worked with them to resolve the issue.  This is the type of company I want to do business with!  I also liked the fact that it takes up little space on my vanity.  This product has definitely lived up to my expectations.  It takes up little space, and only needs to be plugged in to charge. I have not yet had to recharge the battery - it seems to hold a charge for a long time.  There are times the tank needs to be refilled while during use, but that is easy enough to do.  I was surprised at how much debris is missed by flossing alone!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on August 17, 2012. I loved it at first and it worked fine for six weeks. It takes a very long time to charge (six to eight hours) and is now holding a charge for only one use. The water stream is so weak after one use that I have to re-charge. The return period has ended so I guess I&#x27;m out of luck. Be wary.</li>
    <li> Nobody likes to read a long review positive or negitive so I will describe this product in one word, OUTSTANDING\\&quot;. I have seen simular water pixs at retail for twice the price or more.&lt;br /&gt;It works great, with the proper care will last for years. It does a great job!</li>
    <li> My family was very happy with this irrigator until 20 days later it suddenly turn on by itself and start spraying me when I got back home from work. We didn&#x27;t submerge it into the water but of course we got it wet during use - it should be meant to get wet. So we thought that maybe leaving it to dry out will help, but it had no use - since then it has it&#x27;s own mind and keep performing sudden attacks until battery dies. We are locking it in the kitchen, face down, until we get new one (different brand). I wish it was better quality. :( and the worse part you can&#x27;t return it after 30 days.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this professional oral irrigator worked so well on my teeth. They have never felt so clean and refreshed like this before. Not to mention it&#x27;s extremely powerful..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the irrigator for about a week but so far I am loving the convenience of a compact item like this.  It works well, charges quickly and takes up very little counter space.  Good work! Atlanta, GA</li>
    <li> This Oral Irrigator was purchased in July 2012 at Amazon. It has only been 4 months and it will not hold a charge nor will the motor function. Do not spend your money on this item! This was 56 dollars wasted. We are very dissatisfied with the product and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just want to add I received a very prompt reply from the company and they are sending a new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; irrigator on Monday. Cannot ask for a better response! Hopefully the product will be as good as the customer service.</li>
    <li> Love this Irrigator!!!  Easy to use after a little breaking in.  I floss more often - after every meal - because this Irrigator just makes my mouth feel so refreshed and happy!  The pulsing actions really do make my gums feel better and the stream is hard enough that it cleans out all the gunk that accumulates under a bridge when you eat.  So much better than trying to use floss or the Waterpik Irrigator.  This was just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I had before another chargeable irrigator, Braun, but the batter died after one year. After this I switched to a portable Panasonic model running on batteries and it was good as long as you replace batteries. This year I decided to try  another rechargeable one. This model appealed to me with a design and not bad reviews. Unfortunately, I was not lucky with this model.&lt;br /&gt;after about 3 month the unit started  switching itself on and it is noisy and woke me up at night.&lt;br /&gt;also the opening for water is too small, it is hard to get water in. In addition, the manual tells that one can add a mouthwash to the water, but when I&#x27;ve added a drop, something got broken inside. complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I went through two units in six weeks. The first unit worked for three weeks until it stopped charging. Nothing made it charge. Returned that unit and received a new unit. That until worked for almost two weeks until it just stopped working. It was charged, the lights were on, but no water flowed out of the reservoir. Absolute junk. The short time it did work, it was messy and the reservoir had to be refilled several times to get a full mouth cleaning. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. I&#x27;ve never used waterpik, but this had better reviews and I&#x27;m happy I went with it. Wish the reservoir didn&#x27;t require refilling so quickly, but I was aware of that before purchasing thanks to the reviews. I travel often and the size comes in handy. First couple of times may be tricky and make you feel like a whole is in your lip, but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like taking great care of my teeth and this helps tons. I brush, floss, use this puppy, then mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  Tried to contact manufacture and they do not return calls.  Do not order this product............you will be very disappointed.  This product only lasted a few weeks.  Just as the material in the box instructed \\&quot;do not return....call us directly for service\\&quot;.  They will not answer or return your call.  It is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Professional Rechargeable Oral Irrigator I purchased from ToiletTree Products. It provides good water pressure in dislodging items between my teeth.  I use dental floss once a day and this product once a day. I previously had a WaterPik rechargeable product for less than 1 year until it stopped accepting a charge. I like that ToiletTree stands bedhind their product. One other benefit of the ToiletTree Professional is that it lets you know when the the battery is charging and when it is fully charged. There was no way to tell on the WaterPik product.</li>
    <li> Used this product for about 6 weeks before it would switch on at will.  Waking me in the middle of the night, only to be out of charge by morning.  Replaced with a real deal Waterpick and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This water flosser was great while it lasted but unfortunately, it only lasted three weeks!  Decided to get a water pic brand since they tend to be more reliable.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time and no coil of tubing to pull up to your mouth. Have to be careful with putting correct end from charge to unit, easy to turn around and short out. I makred charge end for top up and we have no problems with putting cord onto Irrigator.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  It works.  Been using it now for 18 months both at home and when we travel.  The tip comes off and the fill tank separates from the body making it easy to pack in a suitcase. The water tank has been sufficient in size to thoroughly clean my teeth.  I like the idea that it has different sittings.  I use the pulse setting to massage my gums. If this one burns out, I would defiantly buy another one.</li>
    <li> The irrigator is easy to hold and use.  Holding the appliance vertically while using it makes less messy than other products I have tried. My mouth feels very refreshed after use. It is a little bit tricky to fill, but if you hold it under the faucet with a low stream of water, it fills pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> My Husband and I both use it, we love it easy to use and just makes my mounts and gums feel so good, my gums use to bleed when I brush but not anymore, this oral irrigator works great.</li>
    <li> Better than most travel water piks.  Easy to use and light weight for travel.  It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> The first one sent failed miserably. I contacted company and they sent me a replacement promptly. This one has been working perfectly for the past 3 weeks. It does not replace flossing or brushing, but a good adjunct to tooth care.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed it and because of all the positive reviews. I am adding my review to the others. It is exactly as described and performs as well as larger, noisier ones and it is portable. It holds a charge much better than I expected. It&#x27;s the one to buy if you need an irrigator</li>
    <li> The water flosser has good power.The only feature I would improve is to make it easier to fill the water tank. It only works well with a real slow drip under the tap.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  In my honest opinion, for its price this is the best irrigator on the market.  It really works great!  It is very easy to use and extreemly comfortable.  The design of this product is terrific.  It looks and feels professional and contemporary.  The buttons and setting LED&#x27;s are very neatly arranged.  I found its pulse setting unique.  This is a great feature.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product if you want an oral irrigator with contemporary design, high quality and good value. UPDATE - I had only used this irrigator occasionally. I hadn&#x27;t used it for about 6 months, and when I plugged it in to charge it- it was completely dead.  No charging LED - nothing.  I&#x27;m changing my review to 1 star. It shouldn&#x27;t just die after very light use.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable water Oral Irrigator is easy to handle with an adjustable/ pulsating stream. The only negative I have is filling the product,the opening is much smaller than the water stream from the faucet and the tank cannot vent to allow water to enter. I have been using the unit for only 8 days and have only charge it once. I Purchased the product through Amazon with the best price and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The product failed after 2 months use due to water intrusion into product!...Reduced rating to 1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this irrigator for a couple of weeks and really like it. The battery hasn&#x27;t needed a recharge yet, and the water pressure and three settings are good. I wish the reservoir were just a little bigger, because I have to refill it once to finish the job, but it&#x27;s a nice compact package.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago after carefully reading reviews of many similar products. After using it for weeks, I have to say it is easy to use, refill and charge. Based on the reviews of the other offerings, this is a superior product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best units of this type that we have ever had. The water tank allows you to complete a thorough cleaning without having to refill. The multiple speeds also make it very convenient to use in all areas of the mouth. Try it, you will like it!</li>
    <li> I liked this at first. But it&#x27;s dead almost 1 and half month. I really hate this. I can&#x27;t recommend this. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed this product while it lasted.  After 9 months, it will charge but it doesn&#x27;t pump the water in any of the settings.  I was hoping that it would have at least a 1 year warranty, but I can&#x27;t find any of the warranty information for this product, nor is there any information provided by Amazon, other than it can&#x27;t be returned after 90 days.  That&#x27;s fair a \\&quot;return\\&quot; policy, but you would think the MFG would offer more tan a 90 day warranty.  Unless of course, they realized from previous problems that anything more than a 90 day warranty would not allow them to make any money with the sale of their product.  Now it appears, the product is available through Amazon at a much higher price and I would be very reluctant to purchase this product again at any price.</li>
    <li> I have had this product a few months now and use it often seems to work well. Only issue is difficult to fill since opening very small.</li>
    <li> Received the Oral Irrigator very quickly and it was well packed and damage free. I am using it and it works fine but it does have quite a bit of pressure. Had one years ago but it was large and had a separate water container and was clumsy to use and store. This one is self contained and fits in the medicine cabinet. My Dentist recommended that I use one and hoping my gums get used to it. Overall pleased with the purchase and optimistic it will help my oral health.</li>
