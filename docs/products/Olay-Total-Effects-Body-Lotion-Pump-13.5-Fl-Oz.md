      <li>AND I LOVE THE TEXTURE ON MY BODY</li>
      <li>love the feel on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product more than 6 months.</li>
      <li>We have both used many products like this</li>
      <li>More than i wanted.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>The skin does look a bit healthier and more &#x27;elastic.&#x27;  </li>
      <li>I usually love Olay products, but this lotion hurt/stings when applied immediately after shaving legs.</li>
      <li>They love the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Feels very soothing on the Skin and tightens and firms, feels great after a shower and before bedtime</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have the time to return the bottle but the lotion itself is okay, too soon to notice difference in skin tone/ texture though.</li>
      <li>the condition of my skin is much better</li>
      <li>I love this lotion,  &amp; wish it was available in my area.</li>
      <li>I buy 5 or more products which includes the body wash, and the price is really cheap.</li>
      <li>so I could enjoy the products more.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this lotion after a nice hot steamy shower!  </li>
      <li>This lotion is too strong odor.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on well and has a light scent.  </li>
      <li>This lotion feels decadent - it is smooth and my skin just drinks it in - my lover</li>
      <li>This one has great moisture but the smell is a little too strong and flowery.  </li>
      <li>and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have used many lotions but always come back to this.  </li>
      <li>So glad they sell this larger size bottle.</li>
      <li>MY HANDS LOOK MANY YEARS YOUNGER</li>
      <li>I use it when I get out of the shower every day and within in the first week I noticed how much softer my skin stayed.</li>
      <li>This just smells very dated to me.</li>
      <li>It is a real pleasure to cream your body.</li>
      <li>This lotion really works well at moisturizing my skin, even in winter.</li>
      <li>Have tried other lotions and this is my top pick.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item for its high niacinamide content, but the smell is overpowering.</li>
      <li>I LIVE IN COLORADO</li>
      <li>Olay is a big company, so i believe their billions are really put to use!  </li>
      <li>I use a lot of other, more delicately fragranced skincare products and this lotion makes it so that I can&#x27;t enjoy my subtler products at all.</li>
      <li>It makes the skin soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Just bought 3 for unexpected Christmas presents...</li>
      <li>I just wish it could have been delivered directly to me.</li>
      <li>immediately i used it, it leaves my skin soft and silky, locks the moisture in</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE HOW THICK IT IS</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel so soft and smooth, problem skin no more.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion it keeps my aging, dry skin moisturizer in a very harsh environment (Afghanistan).</li>
      <li>( my husband generally uses whatever lotion I buy</li>
      <li>truly can be your so called perfume, especially if you are sensitive to perfume smells as I am.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A purchase for the wife and she swears by it. We have both used many products like this but this one seems to be the best so far.</li>
    <li> More than i wanted.Love it</li>
    <li> I use it as my &amp;#34;indoor tanning&amp;#34; go-to lotion.  MUCH less expensive than the stuff they sell at tanning salons, and does seem to not only smooth and moisturize my skin, but it just makes it LOOK nicer!</li>
    <li> With prolonged use the product does show visible results.  Lathers great and has a nice fresh scent.  Have tried other lotions and this is my top pick.</li>
    <li> I love this product; it works best when used immediately after bathing or showering. It makes the skin soft and silky. I recommend using the body wash with it as well. I will not use anything else on my body. I&#x27;m not sure if it helps with aging; however it has cured my dry skin issue. I&#x27;ve used this product more than 6 months. I purchase through amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save. I buy 5 or more products which includes the body wash, and the price is really cheap. (around $5.75) at Walmart for $8.79. I hope this review is helpful to you.</li>
    <li> This lotion feels decadent - it is smooth and my skin just drinks it in - my lover alos finds my smooth skin delicious to rub and wonderful to smell.&lt;br /&gt;No more ashy legs or peeling feet from winter dryness!!</li>
    <li> I always buy Olay products.  Love this</li>
    <li> love the way that it makes my skin feel after I use it. only place that I could find it since everywhere else started to stop selling it. it makes you skin feel like it is firming up. and it is doing it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this lotion after a nice hot steamy shower!  Especially when my girls rub it onto me.  Olay is a big company, so i believe their billions are really put to use!  So this product probably works well, and defanitely priced well in the market!  You should pick it up too!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.  Olay total effects body is where its at!</li>
    <li> I use it daily - no matter the season.  Love this lotion! My skin drinks this up! Recommended to all.</li>
    <li> One of the best body lotions I have ever tried. So glad they sell this larger size bottle. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for its high niacinamide content, but the smell is overpowering. It&#x27;s flowery-powdery-cloying. I wish Olay would update some of their fragrances so I could enjoy the products more. This just smells very dated to me. I use a lot of other, more delicately fragranced skincare products and this lotion makes it so that I can&#x27;t enjoy my subtler products at all.</li>
    <li> I would wear this lotion like plaster if it wasn&#x27;t so difficult to find. It has a great smell and smooth feel. People have asked what perfume I  was wearing when I use this lotion. And it smells good on men( my husband generally uses whatever lotion I buy lol)&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it is hard to find, Amazon Prime was selling it for $7. Which is a steal. It should have stocked up then.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this product. I do!!</li>
    <li> What a pleasure in a body lotion. A beautiful smell. Not overpowering at all as Asthmatics go. It is on the fruit/ orange side rather than the flower side. It is a real pleasure to cream your body. I have had compliments as to my smell and as to my lotion when my friends have asked if you have some hand lotion. Just bought 3 for unexpected Christmas presents... They love the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;This truly can be your so called perfume, especially if you are sensitive to perfume smells as I am.</li>
    <li> I always love my Olay products! This lotion is wonderful and like the pump. I will tell others about this.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel so soft and smooth, problem skin no more.  The best body lotion ever and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it keeps my aging, dry skin moisturizer in a very harsh environment (Afghanistan). I just wish it could have been delivered directly to me.</li>
    <li> I usually love Olay products, but this lotion hurt/stings when applied immediately after shaving legs. (Not sure if this review is posting twice?)</li>
    <li> I use this on my arms and chest almost daily.  The lotion goes on well and has a light scent.  The skin does look a bit healthier and more &#x27;elastic.&#x27;  I&#x27;m 56 and at the age where skin changes (menopause) as estrogen drops. Would love to have a vat of it to dip myself in!  I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey as the formula isn&#x27;t that much different than regular Olay lotion.</li>
    <li> it is so amazing!!! just as it promised. i have been looking for a good moisturizing product. immediately i used it, it leaves my skin soft and silky, locks the moisture in and i can see visible differences, this is the 3rd day I have been  using it, the changes are awesome and i will definately buy it again and again. i can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in the next one month.</li>
    <li> Great lotion and perfect price.</li>
    <li> Lotion bottle came open and quarter of product spilled! I didn&#x27;t have the time to return the bottle but the lotion itself is okay, too soon to notice difference in skin tone/ texture though.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful.  My skin feels like silk and the fragrance is beautiful.  It is not at all greasy and is very light, never leaves you feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS LOTION LAST MONTH AND I AM QUITE IMPRESSED WITH IT. MY HANDS LOOK MANY YEARS YOUNGER AND I LOVE THE TEXTURE ON MY BODY AS WELL. IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT LOTION AND I LOVE HOW THICK IT IS AND THE SMELL IS NICE TOO. I LIVE IN COLORADO AND IT IS SO DRY AND COLD HERE. SO, THIS ONE GETS AN A PLUS!! EVEN MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE LOTIONS DON&#x27;T COMPARE.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for its aroma.  It smells like medication. However, it is not greasy and seems to keep my skin moist.</li>
    <li> I have used many lotions but always come back to this.  It makes my skin feels so great and it absorbs quickly.  I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This lotion really works well at moisturizing my skin, even in winter. I use it when I get out of the shower every day and within in the first week I noticed how much softer my skin stayed.</li>
    <li> This one has great moisture but the smell is a little too strong and flowery.  Otherwise, it is good lotion.</li>
    <li> Feels very soothing on the Skin and tightens and firms, feels great after a shower and before bedtime</li>
    <li> I will recommend this produce to those that use the body wash 7 effect is great use it you will see the difference</li>
    <li> This lotion is too strong odor. Well softens and moisturizes the skin of the body. But the smell is too intrusive</li>
    <li> I love this lotion,  &amp; wish it was available in my area. I can tell a big difference in my skin between this lotion and others.</li>
    <li> love the feel on my skin.  the condition of my skin is much better</li>
</ol>
