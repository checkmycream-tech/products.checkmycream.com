<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> iI really enjoyed this product I got it a lot earlier than it was supposed to come I Was very happy about that the only thing that bothered me was that the dispenser would leak when I put stuff in it but that&#x27;s the only problem so other than that everything else was great</li>
    <li> Good. So small.  These are like major mini sizes. Picture makes it look like sooo much.... shipping takes forever.</li>
    <li> Every thing in. That box is what i need, i love it and very please,i am satify with it , n the deliver was ok</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Every thing was there, everything sealed. It is an excellent starter kit for a great price! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a place to begin. [:</li>
    <li> Did my own nails the night I got this. Simply amazing. Everything that could leak was wrapped in foil. Nothing damaged or leaking at all. No glass dish but they give you a plastic one which I am okay with!  All a dappen dish is is a cut off shot glass lol! Don&#x27;t let reviews discourage you. Im sure seller reads and takes into consideration because everything was packed great! Probably going to purchase this set when i need more</li>
    <li> I just received my package and everything is in but the acrylic liquid was spilled inside  the box</li>
    <li> Powder clumps up to easy and most liquids where dried up.</li>
    <li> Perfect starter set. I love it</li>
    <li> Love this item..&lt;br /&gt; All my stuff got to me way before I expected it.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was there, nothing spilled, everything was nice and labeled in english although I was expecting uv primer but I got uv gel but that didn&#x27;t bother me cuz i have a uv lamp so all it all I wud buy this for n e one starting out</li>
    <li> I had a little problem with the uv gel but they helped me fix it right away &amp; send me new one. I really love this kits...</li>
    <li> The materials was very bad&lt;br /&gt;The nail doesn&#x27;t stay on for two days at least</li>
    <li> Great kit came early!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but don&#x27;t really like the colored acrylics. In my opinion they are of poor quality  &amp; are difficult to work with. Would rather save my money up to buy the brand name good stuff.</li>
    <li> BUYER BE WARE!!!! The nail glue in this kit and all the other kits like it that brushes on with the pink label gave me 3rd degree burns on my leg when it tipped over... Nail glue SHOULD NOT melt your skin off!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was put into a tiny box when i opened it one of the main acrylic powders was spilled and also the black acrylic powder was open . The acrylic drys to fast me and as beginner it didnt help as much with it drying so fast.</li>
    <li> Everything is so travel size small. And brushes aren&#x27;t flexible so nails became VERY clumpy,  also NO instructions!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t read China but figure most of the product out</li>
    <li> This product was over10 days late. This nail kit was extremely cheap I would never buy it again. The acrylic liquid was hard everything was a disappointment even down to the glitter .</li>
    <li> So far I like it. The only thing I didn&#x27;t get was the dappen dish and the primer. If they send them to me, ill give 5 stars. Thanks. :)</li>
    <li> first lets start the product was received very very very dusty....each content was full of dust, proceeding to use the nail art kit the white nails they give you do not stick properly n it s not sturdy, the glue dont work and the the acrylic liquid is not 100%.&lt;br /&gt;I dont recommend this product at all it was a total waste of money, poor packaging. This product is not the authentic nail art kit...i recommend please dont buy this.</li>
    <li> it was a surprise with all the color powders n glitters but not happy with the gel not easy to work with</li>
    <li> Iliked it i just wished the labels on the powders and rest of the things were in english instead of chinease</li>
    <li> Poor quality of nails and acrylic. This item is ridiculously cheap and the packaging is cheap my items arrived spilled and empty!</li>
    <li> the glitter container were half fill and the bottle is already super small acrylic powder were all over the box other than that its okay</li>
    <li> Everything was in the kit but the nail glue that came with the product didn&#x27;t work also the upright spray bottle. I contacted the seller and they refunded me the price for those items. The product comes from china so you will be waiting awhile to receive it.</li>
    <li> Can I get my money back? It sucks.</li>
    <li> When I got the package there was some powder on everything, one of the powders have leaked but it was ok it wasn&#x27;t by much. The only thing was in the description it promises UV primer, I didn&#x27;t receive that I got regular UV gel instead, other than that everything else was great</li>
    <li> get all messed up and dirty..</li>
    <li> I like every thing but I thing more aycrlic liquid is needed</li>
    <li> Just got it today in the mail came the exact day it said 7/17 and I couldn&#x27;t be happier everything is there no damage to anything all that is missing is the glass dish but I&#x27;m excited to use the product!! The reviews had me scared but I am very pleased with my purchase I would recommend to my friends n family</li>
    <li> Some of the items do not work at all</li>
    <li> It sucked you can tell the product is cheap. Please do not buy product and it took forever to get here!</li>
    <li> I love my kit... I know how to do my own nails and this keeps money in my pockets!</li>
    <li> I received this product on time but the package was open along with stuff in the bag.</li>
    <li> Great for the price lovee the kits only problem I had was when i got it some of the acrylic powder poured out but not to muchh I still was able to use it.If you order this you have to order the UV lamp,cutter,Drill and top coat for the nails.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t let me ask a ? Will only let me type in reviews. Is this an OPI brand set? I know you can&#x27;t mix brands. Thank you</li>
    <li> My nails was melted together and just not happy. The acrylic was half full. They are taking forever to fix it I don&#x27;t think they are.</li>
    <li> This kit is junk!! The tips are poor quality and paper thin..when i got my kit one of the acrykic powders were broke and it was all over the box. One of the sets of gems were open and scattered throughout the bottom of the box. I was very disappointed and wont be ordering this again!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome. Came with everything nicely sealed. A decent amount of everything and fast shipping. I love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with products, shipping was fast too :)</li>
    <li> The package was smaller than I thought it would be. But it&#x27;s worth the wait and the money!!!!</li>
    <li> I loved what i bought totally worth the price the shipping was faster than i expected super duper fast the only thing that i wasn&#x27;t too happy was with the acrylic powder it dries too fast and  the jar looks like a decent size except for when you open it looks like has less then half of container that is the only reason i dont give a five star but over all im pretty satisfied love all the glitter colors</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Expected the lower quality since it&#x27;s a low price.  Didn&#x27;t come with any sort of directions though.</li>
    <li> This is the whole package! So excited to be able to do my nails at home</li>
    <li> i guess i got what i paid for but i was rxpecting better. the product works good but the materials look very cheap.</li>
    <li> what can i say everything came but all beat up and the glue spilled everywhere the monemor smells descusting and it was half empty but what ever everything thing else was ok so if you want to try it then go ahead i just think its ok</li>
    <li> This is great I got everything that it said it would come with and it works great too!</li>
    <li> i was actually having doubts once I ordered then read the comments....but I must say I love the kit...nothing was spilled nor dried out. As a nail technician...Ill recommend and purchase again. You got to understand this line of work to understand wht it was the actually came in this kit.</li>
    <li> I loveddd this set! It was easy to manage and it was alot of stuff for a cheap price! I would recommend to buy more acrylic powder and liquid. Also, the gel only works if you have the UV light! So.. That part was pointless.</li>
    <li> It says UV primer and I got UV gel definitely not happy cause of that and all 3 little bottles of the acrylic powder are in straight Chinese it would have been nice if they were the ones in the actual pictures so I&#x27;m definitely not rating this 5 stars the UV gel IS NOT RIGHT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very excited that I bought this last night, I would hope everything that is included in the kit isn&#x27;t broken or missing itmes &amp; the acrylic is not hard when I get it. So I hope the seller no what he/she is doing! If not I&#x27;ll be VERY disappointed and make sure the seller re inverse my payment that I had purchased this with.</li>
    <li> everything came as described I truly love this. it came early as expected even though you might see the date don&#x27;t bother give it two weeks or so. I love this kit. I will purchase again</li>
    <li> Came on the expected date but the powder was all over the inside of the package.</li>
    <li> Took a long time but it was worth it</li>
    <li> Hello I just bought this kit and it is really nice although some customers find something to complain about weather it&#x27;s the size or the packaging. Guys please learn how to use the individual products before you complain it don&#x27;t work. I have been doing nail art for seven years and yes there are some kits don&#x27;t work with the liquid or powder system you are using. I was able too turn less than great products into use beautiful nail art. The first thing you need to know and learn is the liquid to powder ratio. The bead or pearl consistency has to be rigjt or u will have a big mess. Nail art is fun and exciting. Use practice tools before u do your own nail to see how it will come out.</li>
    <li> I got crappy nails along with a lil tiny bottle of acrylic liquid but 500 nails....hmmm how the hell is that supposed to work?</li>
