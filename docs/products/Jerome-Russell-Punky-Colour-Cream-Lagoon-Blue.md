      <li>All those are beautiful, vibrant and come out just like the color inside</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I could have googled and searched for the answers</li>
      <li>My friend and I have both used Jerome Russell in many colors.</li>
      <li>5 stars all the way  :3</li>
      <li>i LOVE punky color.</li>
      <li>but you MUST use gloves :)</li>
      <li>If you have lighter hair then this might work a lot better for you.</li>
      <li>(Turquoise: 3 weeks, Violet:</li>
      <li>Ok so i looked at this product because it was recommended by ledaor hailedabear she had once dyed her hair with this color</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>i love it it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Fades within a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work as well after so many applies.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I love the smell and</li>
      <li>could tell right away that this wouldn&#x27;t be a bright color.</li>
      <li>If you put pink over the violet, it makes the violet into a bright beautiful purple.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment if you want to keep your color!!)</li>
      <li>las on my hair 4.5 weeks , easy to use....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bright and vibrant.  </li>
      <li>P.S. I have naturally light blond hair, so I didn&#x27;t bleach.</li>
      <li>It smells great (like artificial grapes), lasts forever, fades beautifully and on tone,which is the most important part.</li>
      <li>The more you use it, the more it sticks and stays vibrant</li>
      <li>The old Russell &amp;#34;PUNK&amp;#34; colors were a lot better!  </li>
      <li>If you want it to be bright and last well over a month or two, I suggest bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a funky color to test out, this is the stuff to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It fades gradually to a very light cotton candy blue and will keep fading until it&#x27;s nothing more than the hair color</li>
      <li>The way I part my hair from the extreme right side blends these colors in beautifully.</li>
      <li>Have used the older version for many years.  </li>
      <li>blue fades to a beautiful green after about three weeks (2-3 washings per week) and is very easy to touch up.</li>
      <li>After it dries it looks nice and almost a teal blue.</li>
      <li>the color looks pretty cool, it&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It gets it right</li>
      <li>Hands down THE best blue dye I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Faded very fast the splat brand at Walmart last longer and covers more hair.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something cute and short lived, go for it.</li>
      <li>The lagoon blue is not my favorite at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>The color came out lighter than expected but was really nice.</li>
      <li>use lagoon blue or turquoise or a mix of the two, but ALL of the colors they have are PHENOMENAL.</li>
      <li>The first time I applied it I allowed it to set in my hair for 30-45 minutes before rinsing.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand and shade of blue.  </li>
      <li>It worked really well!</li>
      <li>helps to keep your color from bleeding, and investing in a solid UV protection product for your hair is super important too.</li>
      <li>Okay so the only problem I&#x27;ve found is that if your hair isn&#x27;t light enough it will turn you ruddy brown.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, makes quite the impression (especially with the little kids.</li>
      <li>After applying it, waiting at least 30 minutes (1 hour is recommended personally), and rinsing, it comes out a bright cheery sky-ish blue, but a tad darker.</li>
      <li>This product is very good, however I chosen the wrong color.</li>
      <li>I think a natural blonde or someone who has achieved WHITE hair with bleaching might have more success, but I&#x27;m only ever able to get to a very light yellow with my natural black/brown hair.</li>
      <li>Pink was my favorite.</li>
      <li>So, this isn&#x27;t the dye&#x27;s fault so much as the shade.</li>
      <li>Thanks Jerome</li>
      <li>If you bleach your hair beforehand, it comes out super vibrant and fades nicely and gradually (about a month or so of it being icy blue).</li>
      <li>Fix this problem by making sure you&#x27;ve lightened your hair to a soft yellow or lighter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>have light brown hair with highlights, so it&#x27;s not like my hair is super dark</li>
      <li>color true  but dont stay in very long even with right type shampoo cond etc.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful color and who is not thrilled to see Punky Colors make a big comeback?</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted, so I mixed it with Violet from this same line&#x3D; gorgeous cobalt blue!</li>
      <li>Not a fantastic rich blue, but much more of a teal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great, vibrant color.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
      <li>Neither of us pre-treat or bleach our hair, but it still comes out fantastically vibrant.</li>
      <li>At it&#x27;s most faded, the blue looks like an ice blue in my hair.</li>
      <li>Its a very pretty blue but came out like</li>
      <li>I would try a different color or brand (like Splat) if you want something bright and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this, but the color doesn&#x27;t stay long at all.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a hair dye that keeps the color for a while.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to bleach your hair, I have found that Sparks Hair Color works really well with my natural hair color and would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>(i have golden blonde processed hair)</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell of super sweet artificial grape, this dye is not for you, but I thought it was hilarious.</li>
      <li>I was able to see it in some areas, but it definitely didn&#x27;t hold very long in those areas.</li>
      <li>Even better the blue did not run on my pink or vise versa.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was my first experience with the new version - in several colors.  </li>
      <li>, naturally it turned purple as i expected, but it didnt really stay in, if you are going to use this you need to bleach your hair first</li>
      <li>it comes to lasting, the color fades tremendously about 1-2 weeks later, or around 8 washes.</li>
      <li>to make it bold, and that worked well for the first three weeks, but for some reason the color wouldn&#x27;t take as well the past two weeks I&#x27;ve done it.</li>
      <li>This product is much richer in color and longer lasting than the competitors.</li>
      <li>but this time it completely washed out</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This color lasts really long I am going on my third month it&#x27;s a little faded but it is still noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This blue works nicely, my daughter usually has a hard time with blues showing up in her darker hair, and this blue showed up nicely and has held its color for much longer than other dyes usually do.</li>
    <li> the color is incredible i love it it las on my hair 4.5 weeks , easy to use....but you MUST use gloves :)</li>
    <li> Its a very pretty blue but came out like nothing was put in...... may as well have been the crap from spencers</li>
    <li> This product is very good, however I chosen the wrong color. You definitely need to wear gloves and cover up your sink area or else it stains. This particular color had too much green effect. Washes out in 4 shampoos. Next time I will chose a darker shade.</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR PRODUCT EVER</li>
    <li> i LOVE punky color. always colors evenly, smells great. conditions hair well. personally, i leave the color on over night and then rinse out. color stays for about 2 months before it looks too faded and then i re-apply.</li>
    <li> i have red hair and i tried to dye my hair blue, naturally it turned purple as i expected, but it didnt really stay in, if you are going to use this you need to bleach your hair first</li>
    <li> The lagoon blue is not my favorite at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, i bought 4 colors all together. I bought: Lagoon blue, violet, flamingo pink, and turquoise. All those are beautiful, vibrant and come out just like the color inside (i have golden blonde processed hair) but, the lagoon blue however, does not come out as blue. It is a very faded blue that turns a weird green after a few days, and fades after like a week. All my other colors last much longer. (Turquoise: 3 weeks, Violet: 4weeks, Flamingo Pink: 4 weeks and still fading) i did these colors on my tips for a mermaid ombre look. looked awesome. Pink was my favorite. If you put pink over the violet, it makes the violet into a bright beautiful purple.</li>
    <li> Only lasted one wash! We used it on chin length platinum blonde hair. We were scraping the bottle for every last drop and barely had enough.</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended by someone who regularly dyes their hair so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ll lay out the pros and cons-&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing! I&#x27;ve never used any hair dye that smelled as wonderful as this did.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I could tell right away that this wouldn&#x27;t be a bright color. The consistency just seemed off. When I put it on my hair it already looked faded. I was highly disappointed because I had just big expectations for it. It also came by itself with no directions as to how long to leave it in. I&#x27;m sure I could have googled and searched for the answers but I just did as long as they normally take.&lt;br /&gt;The details:&lt;br /&gt;I have light brown hair with highlights, so it&#x27;s not like my hair is super dark but at the same time it&#x27;s not a bright blonde. I left it in my hair for 35 minutes then rinsed it out in cold water. If you have lighter hair then this might work a lot better for you. If you don&#x27;t want to bleach your hair, I have found that Sparks Hair Color works really well with my natural hair color and would highly recommend. But every person is different, and what didn&#x27;t work on me may work on you, and vice versa.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and who is not thrilled to see Punky Colors make a big comeback? I used this stuff at 16 (17 years ago) and I use it now</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand and shade of blue.  It&#x27;s bright and vibrant.  It also stains the least.  It does smell like grapes, but honestly...does it smell any worse than the way your hair smells after bleaching it?...which is a must to get a vibrant shade of blue.  If you take care to not wash your hair everyday, use the coldest water you can stand, and use as little fussy hair products or heat styling tools, the blue will fade slower.  Dry shampoo is your friend.  For me, the blue lasts as long as I can stand my roots growing out before needing a touch up - about a month and a half.  At it&#x27;s most faded, the blue looks like an ice blue in my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this dye about a month ago after i bleached my hair and normally it works perfectly its always been my go to hair dye brand and ive used this color before but this time it completely washed out I left it in for about two hours and applied heat even though it normally isn&#x27;t needed but it didn&#x27;t help maybe I just got a bad batch I might try a different color next time or another seller</li>
    <li> Faded very fast the splat brand at Walmart last longer and covers more hair. They should make the bottle double the size.</li>
    <li> I really really expected it to last at least a month, but no dyes last that much I guess. Anyway, I love the smell and the color looks pretty cool, it&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This product is much richer in color and longer lasting than the competitors. We&#x27;ve tried Manic Panic and others and they can&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Great color. Great quality - good price. All the colors by this manufacturer seem to be of great quality. Buy it and ty it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this after researching tons of hair dyes and I&#x27;m so happy with the result!! I lighted it up with some conditioner and dipped/ombred the ends of my blonde extensions and I&#x27;m in love with how they turned out!!</li>
    <li> LOVE the color!! If you bleach your hair beforehand, it comes out super vibrant and fades nicely and gradually (about a month or so of it being icy blue). Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a hair dye that keeps the color for a while.</li>
    <li> Color didn&#x27;t take as well as other colts of the same brand. Not very vibrant. Even on bleached hair. Slightly disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price! I did the tips &amp; a few long streaks in my daughters dirty blonde hair, left it in for about 40 min. Very happy with the outcome! She loves it!</li>
    <li> I have used about 6 different Punky Colours before and this one is no bueno.  Not even the same consistency as the others.  Bad batch?  No color left in my hair.</li>
    <li> This was horrible;  would never buy this brand again! My hair turned out green, I had to recolor my hair.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted, so I mixed it with Violet from this same line&#x3D; gorgeous cobalt blue!</li>
    <li> Not the blue pictured</li>
    <li> Applied to dyed blond hair and it turned hair green, as a longtime user of Manic Panic dye, I expected the Punky Colour dye to adhere the same as the Manic Panic but it didn&#x27;t. Manic Panic blue goes on dyed hair blue, doesn&#x27;t color combine like this stuff. Definitely going back to Manic Panic for the next go-round.</li>
    <li> Okay so the only problem I&#x27;ve found is that if your hair isn&#x27;t light enough it will turn you ruddy brown. Fix this problem by making sure you&#x27;ve lightened your hair to a soft yellow or lighter.&lt;br /&gt;The blue fades to a beautiful green after about three weeks (2-3 washings per week) and is very easy to touch up. Beautiful color, makes quite the impression (especially with the little kids. the two boys, four and five, that I babysit are 100% convinced that I&#x27;m secretly a mermaid.)</li>
    <li> So, this isn&#x27;t the dye&#x27;s fault so much as the shade. I picked it without knowing blue fades out to puke green, and light blue is a hard color to achieve. So it came out green. It sucked, but not really this brand&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> The don&#x27;t make this like they used to. It didn&#x27;t even stick in my son&#x27;s hair at all. Put it on, waited, rinsed and nothing.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this, but the color doesn&#x27;t stay long at all. You have to douse your hair in it, and then it only lasts a wash or two before turning a weird green/gray color. I would try a different color or brand (like Splat) if you want something bright and long lasting. P.S. I have naturally light blond hair, so I didn&#x27;t bleach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Punky Colour usually, but this color just did not take to my hair. I was able to see it in some areas, but it definitely didn&#x27;t hold very long in those areas. I think a natural blonde or someone who has achieved WHITE hair with bleaching might have more success, but I&#x27;m only ever able to get to a very light yellow with my natural black/brown hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to dip dye my hair blue. I thought it would be okay if I didn&#x27;t lighten it because I have dirty blonde hair. I followed the direction to a t. When I rinsed out my hair and let it dry, I saw that it was a light green. I thought I may have messed up so the next day I dyed it again. It became a little blue. I waited 2 days to wash my hair. When I did, it came out. This is good for one thing: smelling good. The dye sucks. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> My friend and I have both used Jerome Russell in many colors. Green, blue, yellow, some others I can&#x27;t remember...etc. Every time, it&#x27;s been great! Neither of us pre-treat or bleach our hair, but it still comes out fantastically vibrant. I actually used it for rainbow hair and it came out wonderfully clear (We both have brown hair, though mine is lighter than my friends.) It smells like candy, too. Much better than the horrible, chemical smell I get from other brands. Doesn&#x27;t even stain the tub washing out (though if you do stain a tub or sink or anything during application, try rubbing toothpaste on it! It gets it right out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a bit over a month of staying power, and it&#x27;s a pretty big amount of dye, so it&#x27;ll last you a while!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely support Jerome Russell and mention it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of hair colors (dye) such as Splat, Loreal, Clairol, etc., and the color seems to fade after a few washes. My daughter bought this product in Pink and we decided to do 2 colors in my hair. So we did the butt cut split in the middle all the way around my head and did one side pink and the other side blue. It has been over a month with at least 18 washes and it hasn&#x27;t faded at all. Even better the blue did not run on my pink or vise versa.&lt;br /&gt;  The way I part my hair from the extreme right side blends these colors in beautifully. The shipping surprised me, a little longer than I anticipated but within the ladder part of the ETA given, however WELL worth the wait. I would recommend this for anyone who is tired of hair colors that rip you off for what you pay. I also would like to say that for these colors to work perfect please use a stripper for your original hair color. Just my opinion but I do have my liscense.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks Jerome</li>
    <li> Horrible ! I bleach my hair and everything and it looks like its already fading out . I tried to contact the company and they won&#x27;t replace or refund me at all. I will never waste my money on this crap again</li>
    <li> Ok so i looked at this product because it was recommended by ledaor hailedabear she had once dyed her hair with this color and now i look just like her we could be twins 5 stars all the way  :3</li>
    <li> color true  but dont stay in very long even with right type shampoo cond etc.  dont run all over when u sweat or if it gets on clothes it washes out</li>
    <li> I wanted to leave a review after I have tested it for a month, so this is the result..&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to use on the tips of my hair for a sort of ombre look, which this works rather well for. I&#x27;ve tried other hair dyes before and they just don&#x27;t work as well. My hair is medium-dark brown, but the tips are a little lighter. The first time I applied it I allowed it to set in my hair for 30-45 minutes before rinsing. It worked really well! Although not as bright as I wanted it, I thought it was great considering I hadn&#x27;t bleached my hair. After it dries it looks nice and almost a teal blue. I washed my hair the next day (don&#x27;t freak out when a stream of blue comes out because it&#x27;s not removing all of the color!), and the color faded only some. After the second wash it does kind of dull the color, almost making it turn a greenish blue, which is no big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to lasting, the color fades tremendously about 1-2 weeks later, or around 8 washes. I re-dyed the tips of my hair every week (letting it sit in my hair for one hour instead of half an hour) to make it bold, and that worked well for the first three weeks, but for some reason the color wouldn&#x27;t take as well the past two weeks I&#x27;ve done it. I have used this product in the past with my hair bleached and boy does the color last! If you want it to be bright and last well over a month or two, I suggest bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a funky color to test out, this is the stuff to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great, vibrant color.&lt;br /&gt;Works on dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Fades within a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work as well after so many applies.</li>
    <li> Smelled great but didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.  The container says no peroxide necessary, just apply to hair.  We left it in for 40 minutes but my daughter&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t even remotely blue.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Worked great I my niece&#x27;s hair. She loved the coloe</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this, at all. It doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair at all from the moment it&#x27;s dyed. I&#x27;m warning you.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jerome Russell&#x27;s for over 5 years now and lightening/coloring my hair with &amp;#34;creative colors&amp;#34; for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic, Raw, SFX, Pravana, and Joico. I SWEAR by Jerome Russell&#x27;s Punky Colours ever since I stumbled across it in a random Hot Topic so long ago.  I would give it 6, not 10 stars if I could. Hands down THE best blue dye I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use lagoon blue or turquoise or a mix of the two, but ALL of the colors they have are PHENOMENAL. It smells great (like artificial grapes), lasts forever, fades beautifully and on tone,which is the most important part. What more could you ask for? After applying it, waiting at least 30 minutes (1 hour is recommended personally), and rinsing, it comes out a bright cheery sky-ish blue, but a tad darker. It fades gradually to a very light cotton candy blue and will keep fading until it&#x27;s nothing more than the hair color it&#x27;s sitting on and a slight blue tint, but it&#x27;s STILL BLUE. The more you use it, the more it sticks and stays vibrant longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine usually takes 5-10 washes to become unacceptably light, but I wash my hair 1-2 times a week max, so it lasts well beyond when I get my regrowth and color touched up. Using cold water and salon-quality products (and I&#x27;m NOT talking about Sally&#x27;s stuff. Get yourself some Redken color/strengthening shampoo/conditioner. It&#x27;s worth the investment if you want to keep your color!!) helps to keep your color from bleeding, and investing in a solid UV protection product for your hair is super important too. Blue is one of the fastest colors to fade in hair from UV exposure. I use Aveda&#x27;s sun care protective hair veil, although it&#x27;s kind of pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photos I attached is me with lagoon blue and a stripe of turquoise across my little baby bangs and just lagoon blue in the second.</li>
    <li> Firstoff, the pros of this dye-- it smells like grapes. REEKS of grapes. If you get your hair wet after dying it, you will smell like grapes. Fake grapes, but still grapes. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of super sweet artificial grape, this dye is not for you, but I thought it was hilarious. As for the color, it&#x27;s meh. Not a fantastic rich blue, but much more of a teal. It fades CRAZY fast. Expect your hair to be pale green within two weeks. If you want a long lasting rich color, don&#x27;t waste your money. If you&#x27;re looking for something cute and short lived, go for it.</li>
    <li> The old Russell &amp;#34;PUNK&amp;#34; colors were a lot better!  The dye is so-so.  Not very intense and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Have used the older version for many years.  This was my first experience with the new version - in several colors.  Not very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best hair color I&#x27;ve used! Don&#x27;t waste your time on Manic Panic. This dye is thick, so it coats hair well without drips. And it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> The color came out lighter than expected but was really nice. I dyed it about 2 months ago and it&#x27;s still lasting in my hair.</li>
