      <li>Great for a younger teenager as well.</li>

      <li>Ok first off, as written for the price its a steal.</li>
      <li>But it turned out good for me, overall I like the scent</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like sweet smelling colognes..</li>
      <li>My husband loves this sent and so do I it starts of strong when you first spray it</li>
      <li>It has a clean, fresh citrusy profile.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Lasts maybe an hour or two if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
      <li>asked what kind of cologne it was and ordered shortly afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Now that&#x27;s a masculine sexy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I thought it was worth it.</li>
      <li>some what relax&#x27;s you but all in all its worth about 20 to 25 bucks anything over that don&#x27;t buy</li>
      <li>Definately worth the price.</li>
      <li>this cologne is def worth the money..</li>
      <li>Get this goes on strong but tames down to a warm alluring aroma.</li>
      <li>Have to spray a lot on just to be noticeable and has to be right away.</li>
      <li>yet I favor this now inexpensive but fresh and crisp men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s a plus, but I will say I&#x27;ve bought many different colognes that I would purchase before this one.</li>
      <li>is my first legit cologne iv owned and wore.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>It is a bold smell that&#x27;s citrusy and masculine and does not over power.</li>
      <li>Well, I don&#x27;t care where this is sold because it smells good and the scent last a long time on my husband.  </li>
      <li>Ironic.</li>
      <li>I would also recommend trying Perry Ellis 18 Intense for Men.</li>
      <li>This definitely stand out and is very surprisingly low cost for such a great quality cologne.</li>
      <li>He just loves it so much.</li>
      <li>This cologne will get u thru the night...not a whole day...</li>

      <li>So much cheaper than if you were to go in to a Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Fast shipPing.</li>
      <li>I know this is funny, but it&#x27;s called Power by Fifty Cent..\\&quot; 99% of the time I get a laugh as I am a preppy looking white guy, but</li>
      <li>Smells good, ladies seem to like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last and is not very strong.</li>
      <li>True it doesnt last the longest....</li>
      <li>smells pretty cool reminds me of a old school cologne like a Aspen something like that not to strong but not to weak just right something you can smell and</li>
      <li>but this is my favorite everyday scent.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>I used to pay 80$ when it was new.</li>
      <li>He thinks I paid a pretty penny for it, but in reality.. I paid a very low rate on amazon..ssh!</li>
      <li>Goes out strong it takes a while to settle, smell a little flowery.  </li>
      <li>For a 3.4 oz cologne for less than $17 and including free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
      <li>Smells like my old bottle.</li>
      <li>Brought this for my boyfriend , he said it smelled old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seller is awesome but smells like a women&#x27;s perfume....50 step up your game , you could&#x27;ve done better</li>
    <li> wonderful smell! bought for my son he loves this fragrance. women loves this fragrance. he&#x27;s always getting a lot of compliments &amp; women constantly snipping on him saying they love the smell!! definite buy!</li>
    <li> if you are considering buying this you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price its very good you would not regret buying it</li>
    <li> I loved the product smell great,I would order from this seller again. The cologne is in the original packaging and everything great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> just got it in the mail today and tried it out. the fragrance is weak or i got sent a bootleg fragrance in a authentic bottle. I sprayed it on and i can barely smell it. i sprayed it a couple times actually and had to get less than an inch from my skin to smell it. I had better luck with \\&quot;Unforgivable\\&quot; by Sean john. Now that&#x27;s a masculine sexy fragrance. i&#x27;m sitting still trying to smell it and it&#x27;s still weak. Avoid this bootleg seller!!!!</li>
    <li> Never had more compliments on a cologne. Armani, Chanel, Burberry, none compare, at least on me. Everyone&#x27;s body scent is different.</li>
    <li> smells pretty cool reminds me of a old school cologne like a Aspen something like that not to strong but not to weak just right something you can smell and some what relax&#x27;s you but all in all its worth about 20 to 25 bucks anything over that don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> GOOD SMELLING FRAGRANCE PACKAGE WELL WILL GET COMPLIMENTS  FROM WEARING ANY PLACE THAT YOU GO NICE PRODUCT FOR EVERY DAY</li>
    <li> Love the way it smelled on my man. ..</li>
    <li> The cologne is great, the bottle is great... The reason for the three star is because it is a massed produced cologne that is a toilette.  The scent does not stay with you for more than a couple of hours.  Great cologne for the car or to keep at the office.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect for an inexpensive cologne to stick with me all day though anyway.  Overall, great item!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this sent and so do I it starts of strong when you first spray it but then it mellows out a little and lasts the rest of the day</li>
    <li> Get this goes on strong but tames down to a warm alluring aroma. The price is the best!!! I know 50 Cent??? Fooled me!!!!!</li>
    <li> Hubby and i find this smell great on him.</li>
    <li> It has kind of a strong smell to it. Definately worth the price. I&#x27;m impressed, and would recommend it to anyone. I would also recommend trying Perry Ellis 18 Intense for Men. Its another one of my favorites. But this is a must have, so order both!</li>
    <li> Great stuff I wear it for any occasion</li>
    <li> Had a bad experience with ups other than that thanks for the cologne</li>
    <li> Gotta order me another bottle asap</li>
    <li> I tried this cologne when it launched at a major department store. Aside from my initial hesitance to buy a celebrity cologne, I tried to keep an open mind.&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed so I paid $70+ including tax.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot understand why it wasnt more of a hit, because people ask me what I am wearimg all the time. It has a clean, fresh citrusy profile.&lt;br /&gt;I am somewhat of a cologne collector and have many great classics, including Dunhill, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Hugo Boss, etc. I love them all but this is my favorite everyday scent.&lt;br /&gt;When people ask I preface with...\\&quot; I know this is funny, but it&#x27;s called Power by Fifty Cent..\\&quot; 99% of the time I get a laugh as I am a preppy looking white guy, but I usually get a \\&quot;really, are you serious? It&#x27;s really great.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: great for after working out or any sweaty activity as you smell freshly showered...at work I keep a bottle in my office to freshen up as it lasts only about four hours. Try to find the gift set including the after shave balm, it is great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent several thousand dollars on a collection of premium designer colognes and yet I favor this now inexpensive but fresh and crisp men&#x27;s fragrance. Ironic.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is just to over powering! If you like strong colognes then this one is for you! I don&#x27;t know what 50 Cent was thinking about with this one, it does not smell good at all. Trust me if you wear this in a crowd, your definitely going to stick out!</li>
    <li> The great scent combined with the cool bottle and the price pushed this cologne to the five star mark for me. Other reviewers are correct in the fact that the odor doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. That works perfectly for me though. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> this cologne is def worth the money..i actually purchased it at macys..in my city&lt;br /&gt;but it is def not strong a light smell..worth getting.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my boyfriend , he said it smelled old.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than if you were to go in to a Macy&#x27;s. A+</li>
    <li> Many many compliments and very long lasting. I was surprised to see people saying it doesn&#x27;t last because it does! It is a bold smell that&#x27;s citrusy and masculine and does not over power. My wife loves it! She mentions it to me several times when other times I wear more expensive stuff like Chanel and Dolce and not even notices it. This definitely stand out and is very surprisingly low cost for such a great quality cologne.</li>
    <li> This was surprising a pleasant scent. I received compliments every time I wear this cologne. I definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got this cologne recently. I love the way it smells on him.</li>
    <li> Smells like my old bottle. Fast shipPing. Thanks!</li>
    <li> its Smells Awesome ima buy more trust me its really good</li>
    <li> My boyfriend liked it. Smells really good.</li>
    <li> I just baught it to try and I believe I made a mistacke.I don&#x27;t like sweet smelling colognes..I made a mistacke.</li>
    <li> Goes out strong it takes a while to settle, smell a little flowery.  I wouldnt invest on it again not lasting long</li>
    <li> i actually told a dude at a sink in a restaurant bathroom that he smelled awesome.  asked what kind of cologne it was and ordered shortly afterwards.  my wife loves it too</li>
    <li> ...just got this on friday the 14th..way earlier then expected.....Smell is something I would wear all the time....this is a good one</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet i&#x27;ll get it for Christmas but i did smell it and its a cologne that you would never believe came from 50 cent.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because I like 50 Cent&#x27;s style. I figured if I like his music and his clothing style, I&#x27;ll probably like his cologne. So I took a gamble by not even testing it out somewhere before buying it. But it turned out good for me, overall I like the scent, it&#x27;s a good everyday cologne. For a 3.4 oz cologne for less than $17 and including free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband&#x27;s birthday. I know he&#x27;s  a big fan of Fifty and all of G-unit. He wears it everyday even when he&#x27;s dressed in sweats or basketball shorts. I get kisses with every spray he puts on! He just loves it so much. He thinks I paid a pretty penny for it, but in reality.. I paid a very low rate on amazon..ssh! That will be our little secret!</li>
    <li> Smells good, ladies seem to like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last and is not very strong. Have to spray a lot on just to be noticeable and has to be right away. Lasts maybe an hour or two if you&#x27;re lucky. It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t just go by the name and say that stuff can&#x27;t be any good. Power is a very nice spicy cologne that&#x27;s not over powering. Just wish it lasted longer. Poor longevity I only get 3 to 4 hrs on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!! had to buy another bottle at this price. Always get compliments from woman.</li>
    <li> I was actually shocked this stuff is really good.  Got a little spicey kick to it as well.  I have used three sprays and it does not seem to last long.  But for the price of 3.4 ounces on Amazon.  I thought it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering, my fiance loves this scent and I would agree. It comes packaged nicely, and just as pictured. The price is right as well, I will definitely be ordering more as long  as it is available.</li>
    <li> Smells great, came early, overall really good. I didn&#x27;t have problems with this product and manufacturer. I didn&#x27;t give a five star because nothing is perfect.</li>
    <li> OMG... I buy my husband expensive cologne all the time ($100+) a co-worker was wearing this scent and when I asked him what brand and he said Power by 50 cent I was floored.  I usually think cheaper scents stink, don&#x27;t hold the scent and are sold in box chain stores.  Well, I don&#x27;t care where this is sold because it smells good and the scent last a long time on my husband.  Great for a younger teenager as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product as well.  Same issue with shipping to Alaska.</li>
    <li> Pretty good cologne. I always look for good prices and take chances on trying out new fragrances. I&#x27;d say this is a good purchase. It&#x27;s not something everybody wears so that&#x27;s a plus, but I will say I&#x27;ve bought many different colognes that I would purchase before this one.</li>
    <li> Ok first off, as written for the price its a steal. Now I have an arsenal of smells. ..from aqua di gio to golden sand oil all which all receive great compliments...now this cologne. True it doesnt last the longest....But thats not no reason to skip this gem....trust me its classy and masculine.  Which appears to go well on the well fit body. Seriously this cologne seems to demand a since of respect by its wearer. This scent appears perfect for the athlete type....or successful dressed heavyweight. This cologne will get u thru the night...not a whole day...the bottle is different. ...</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never experienced power then your missing out. And for the price. I used to pay 80$ when it was new. So many complinents</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big 50 cent fan. I own all his CDs, g-unit shirts, played his video games and have been using this cologne for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first legit cologne iv owned and wore. Before this is was just that bod and axe crap.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very nice, and the smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten many compliments from the smell and asking what type it is.&lt;br /&gt;From what I can tell it last a few hours 2-4. Not that long, but I keep a bottle in the car and a bottle in the house.</li>
    <li> I bought this is a gift for my nephew. He loved the scent of the cologne. It came in a attractive bottle. Definitely a great buy at a great price ,</li>
