### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I really loved this product</li>
      <li>They are very cute</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and cute water transfer nail art water decal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to coat them with a layer of clear polish to make sure they stay put.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely adorable..</li>
      <li>but they are cute</li>
      <li>Maybe I haven&#x27;t mastered the art of putting these on, but they seem to almost disintegrate when I put a top coat on them</li>
      <li>Love these transfers.</li>
      <li>They are okay.</li>
      <li>This makes it more interesting.</li>
      <li>Came off easily and transferred without being torn apart before it was applied to my nail.</li>
      <li>So if you really love the design and intend to use it on your ten fingers every time because there are just twenty cats, you should order more than one pack.</li>
      <li>Fun,  Needs a clear coat of polish on top to make it last.</li>
      <li>These are better than the other things I ordered.</li>
      <li>I was expecting several misses before getting the result I wanted but had success on my first try.  </li>
      <li>and I try to do it quickly with only one swipe over decal.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of the tattoos I bought for my boys when they were young... but much easier application.</li>
      <li>These are cute but didnt last long</li>

<li> However, the only down fall about all water transfer decals is that once used they cannot be reused; I know from the beginning.</li>
<li> These nail &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; work easily enough and are cute without being too terribly cutesy.  </li>

    <li> I really loved this product</li>
    <li> These are better than the other things I ordered.</li>
    <li> Absolutely adorable.. Everyone that see&#x27;s them loves them.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  I was expecting several misses before getting the result I wanted but had success on my first try.  Literally dip in water for 10 seconds then transfer onto your nail.  It reminds me of the tattoos I bought for my boys when they were young... but much easier application.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried these yet but they are cute</li>

So if you really love the design and intend to use it on your ten fingers every time because there are just twenty cats, you should order more than one pack. Came off easily and transferred without being torn apart before it was applied to my nail. There is one cat but in different positions; such as it&#x27;s sitting, standing, about to pounce and so on. This makes it more interesting.</li>
