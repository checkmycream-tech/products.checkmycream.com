<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I know Morocanoil products from a long time and know this would not disappoint me as well, great quality, affordable</li>
    <li> This product is great for use in virgin Brazallian hair. It smells good and keeps the frizz out!!! Also its a great detangler for the hair. Im all out now next time im ordering the larger bottle!!!</li>
    <li> If you have curly, frizzy hair this frizz control from Moroccan Oil company is the best.  It works really well and smells good also.  I use all their products.  The curl creme is also great for scrunching.</li>
    <li> awful&lt;br /&gt;did not work for me at all , 2 stars for the smell and thats it</li>
    <li> I live on the Coast of Southwest Florida where it is humid (tropical) most of the time. I have naturally curly and wavy hair and look for any and all products to enhance my curly/wavy hair in the spring/summer months. During that time, I require products that define and soften my hair particularly when I \\&quot;air\\&quot; dry it.   All the Morrocan Oil products are excellent whether you want to wear your hair curly or blow dry it straight. Another great benefit- your hair has a fabulous fragrance after you use the products. However, the Frizz Control Spray did not work for me. I got the frizzies soon after I went outdoors. Again, I believe it is the climate where I live.   The seller&#x27;s service was timely and packaging excellent.   I unfortnately did not accurately evaluate the product or seller in my previous evaluation due to my haste in completing the review.  I, for one, have learned to take Amazon&#x27;s seller evaluations seriously and in the future will take  more time to evalute products and sellers&#x27;  services.</li>
    <li> Love the product and will be ordering again..</li>
    <li> I have extremely frizzy, curly hair and this does the trick!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair and she still has significant frizz.</li>
    <li> I live down south. I cannot live without this product anymore. It&#x27;s the best for taming frizz. I highly suggest you pair this with the shampoo and conditioner. You WILL notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Finally, a viable remedy for statically charged hair in the winter! I swear by this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Love this, however, it does not work like it states it does,so I will not be purchasing this again. It is just much to much money for me to invest in something I am not behind.</li>
    <li> Had problems with the dry air and my hair would just &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; into the air after brushing.  Read that this Moroccan Oil Friss Control would help and it sure does work.  Also makes your hair nice and shiny, good product.</li>
    <li> I  have been fighting with frizz all my life and this is the only product i have found the best working for frizz . AMAZING !!</li>
    <li> I use the whole line.  Im so in love with with product and recommend it to all my friends. Great for curly hair</li>
    <li> I love my Morocconoil products. They tame my curly frizzy hair. I use them every day and so far has been the best products I have used over the years.</li>
    <li> I generally love the Moroccanoil line and in particular its  famous scent, but this product is one of the worst I have ever used of any line.  I finally opened the bottle to test some on my hand and it is essentially water that smells a bit like old dishwater.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> Great to avoid constant &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> made my hair feel dirty.i will not be ordering this product again very pleased with a lot of there other products</li>
    <li> Had high humidity and rain all day and my hair did not get frizzy or curl up like it usually does.... now i dont think any product will be 100% perfect and rid of all frizz. I definitely noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product as I love it but they sent wrong product but are correcting their error and sending the product and letting me keep another. I will order from this company in a flash.  Just beware and order ahead it does take a couple of weeks as it comes from Israel.  Great product.  NOTHING BETTER.</li>
    <li> This product is incredibly awesome! I had ordered it, and as soon as it arrived, I used it and my hair immediately glowed. I am simply pleasant for this excellent item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve mistakenly ordered this product and not only didn&#x27;t help with Frizz,  also it drys out the hair. I liked other Moroccan oil product, but this one has lots of alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and hate those little &amp;#34;fly-away&#x27;s&amp;#34; I get on humid days.  This stuff is great!  It actually works!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see that my favorite hair product company stated making a frizz control spray- it&#x27;s sure to work fantastic!</li>
    <li> I did not care for this oil. I prefer something lighter in consistency like a light cream with the use of my flatiron to straighten the hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I am an older woman with thinning curly hair and this adds volume and body.  They call it Moroccan oil&lt;br /&gt;(oil of argan) and think it likely there is a very small amount of this precious oil in it due to the cost of about 50-80/oz for high quality argan oil but whatever they put in it it works.  Look up argan oil produced in Morocco.  A wonderful product processed by hand by Moroccan women under sponsorship of the King.  I visited there and it is lovely to see all the ladies sitting on the ground, socializing and grinding the argan nuts.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of products that have synthetic or poor quality oil added and that have just a few drops added so they can use the name.</li>
    <li> Smeellsss so good!!! And I really think the this product has made my hair look healthier and shinier 👍 thumbs up to that!! But I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth 25-30$!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this product, she says this works very well, she has been using this for over 5 years, she uses my amazon account to order it but sadly never leaves a review. So im writing on her behalf.</li>
    <li> Love this product great price!</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and frizzy. I bought this expensive hair cream in a hope to control better my frizz. I have used it a couple of times and never noticed any significant difference to my frizzy hair. It smells nice , but so does other less expensive hair conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I have short curly hair, and daily I use 2 pumps of the Moroccan Oil Hydrating Creme when it is wet.  Once my hair is dry, I use 3 to 5 sprays of this frizz control.  The combination makes for wonderful, beautiful curls that stay great all day.  It relieves frizz, and I have been getting many compliments on my curls...I have never had better, softer, frizz-less curls.  I do have to limit myself to the 3 to 5 sprays or I get a little crazy, and it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
    <li> Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller. Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!</li>
    <li> Love it,  great for static hair, leaves hair soft. And looks shiny and healthy.  Lie it, love it, love it</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work. Dont waste your money. However, The curl defining creme is awesome. Tames the curls and smoothes the frizzies. Since I was so impressed with the curl defining creme, thought I would try another product for use prior to and after straightening curls. Doesn&#x27;t work. But I still recommend the curl defining creme to reduce frizz and use if desired to straighten curls.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help my hair deal with the Florida humidity. I&#x27;m glad to say that this product works. My hair stays styled much longer now.</li>
    <li> This product does not control frizz in my wavy curly hair.  I would not recommend.  Get the regular oil instead.</li>
    <li> It is to heavy for my fine hair! It controls the frizz ok! Like their other products better! Shampoo and condtioners are better for frizzy hair with light moroccanoil serum.</li>
    <li> Love the entire line of Moroccanoil products. They have transformed my hair to be shiny, healthy and manageable.  The Frizz control works best when combined with the light treatment oil.  I have another tip from my hairdresser.....when you are going to pull back your hair for sports or beach day, put the hydrating conditioner and some treatment oil in your hair and leave it on!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Does well at controlling the frizzies!</li>
    <li> Very good.  Helps with frizzies</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. my hairdresser suggested it for me because i have wavy semi frizzy hair. this helps keep it looking smooth when i wear it both curly or straight.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, after I wash my hair I use the Morocanoil Fizz Contorl.  It make my hair soft, shiny an fizz free.</li>
    <li> Did not help with frizz.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser swore by this product so I thought I would try it to tame my unruly curls and frizz. I have used many other products that work as well or better at the drugstore. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for controlling the frizz in my hair.  I highly recommend it for your product line up.</li>
    <li> It is not anti frizz ;(</li>
    <li> Great for my hair - I have long, thick hair and use this spray everyday.  It really seems to smooth my hair down and makes it very shiny.  I really like this and will order again.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! I have a ton of hair and it tends to frizz... This take that all away and makes it smooth.</li>
    <li> My hair is shiny and silky smooth. I love this product so much. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use it every day wet or dry hair.  It is great for curley hair.  It actually helps to set the cure.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do!  Bought this for my daughter.  She uses it everyday when it rains and even when it is snowing.  She thinks it has made her hair softer to the touch, too!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to control the unbelievable static winter has wreaked on my hair. It does it wonderfully! My hair feels shiny, silky, and protected, and no more static! I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, but that&#x27;s just personal preference!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from a friend- and unfortunately..I don&#x27;t think it does anything.&lt;br /&gt;After my hair is dry- it&#x27;s still pretty frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Am I applying it wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice though..</li>
    <li> My hair is generally wavy and in the humidity ends up looking wild!  I usually tie my hair back to avoid battling my hair over the summer.  The Morocanoil Frizz Control changed my life in terms of allowing me to tame my hair and allow for easy styling.  The caveat is that I still need to utilize various other products BUT the frizz control does everything I need it to do and I have gotten several compliments on my hair texture lately!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  During the winter months, static is a major problem.  I ordered this product to combat the static.  It works great!  I love the fragrance of the product and love that it is so healthy for my hair!</li>
    <li> Spray pump leaks every time I spray it on my hair. Such a mess. Drips down the bottle and all over my hands. It&#x27;s a very light spray and I don&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference when I use it. The smell reminds me of a man&#x27;s toiletry product, it&#x27;s not offensive but not pleasant either. I wish I would have just bought the regular Moroccan Oil I have used before.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!  Something that works to control static, without weighing down the hair, making it greasy or sticky or crunchy or stiff.  My daughters and I all have very long, fine hair. Mine is wavy (but not in a nice way) and I can&#x27;t make it look nice without a flat iron (after blow drying with a round brush to add fullness). Living in the North (Alberta, Canada) this, combined with super hard water and really dry air makes for a mess of static. All 3 of my daughters have very curly, fine hair, and they sometimes like to straighten it too but because it is so fine and the air is so dry, I hate to do it because of the static. We have tried everything and have even used bounce laundry sheets to try to control it. This stuff WORKS!!  One word of caution: you only need to use a LITTLE (like it says, 4-5 sprays for my long hair is enough). If you use too much it will change the texture of your hair making it not as soft. So what I do is to dry it, straighten it and then spray a bit on my hands and rub my hands down lightly from the top where the frizz starts and then down to the ends where the static is the worst. I use NOTHING else (no gels or mousse) and then a light hairspray at the roots to finish it off.  I definitely will keep this on my product list.</li>
    <li> I perfer the glimmer spray to this product. i love morroacan oil and didn&#x27;t really see where the frizz control did anything speical..</li>
    <li> First off, this stuff smells lovely, which is its main basis of appeal. My only complaint is the directions. The bottle says to use 3-5 sprays in towel dried hair. However, I find that I need to use significantly more (about 8-10 sprays) to ensure I don&#x27;t have frizzes. For reference, I have shoulder length, normal hair. So, while I love the smell and that I can actually get this stuff to work, I wish they&#x27;d adjust to say &amp;#34;spray as needed.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My hair is a frizzy with this product and without.</li>
    <li> This product arrived already expired,smelled bad and looked very old. I had to throw it to the trash.You should send me a product in good condtions.</li>
    <li> I love these hair care products. I will continue to add on as needed. They do a great job on my hair</li>
    <li> i love this product  use all thetime</li>
    <li> not a frizz control it&#x27;s s***</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Does not leave hair greasy. Keeps locks manageable and without the frizz. A little pricey but worth the money</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and rather coarse, length about to the middle of my back.  Let&#x27;s just say that humidity is not my friend!  The fine print on the bottle says that it will perform better if used alone, but the written insert in the box says to use in conjuction with Moroccan Oil treatment, which I do.  I have blond hair so I use the Light Moroccan Oil in the summer, and squirt about 5 or 6 pumps of the Frizz Control on and comb it through.  My usual routine calls for a whole head blow-dry, then a few minutes with the curling iron.  The shine is great, the texture is soft, and the style lasts.  And as always, that awesome Moroccan Oil scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!</li>
    <li> Moroccan oil has been all the buzz in magazines and salons lately.  My hairdresser used this brand the last time I was there but the salon was all out during my visit so I couldn&#x27;t buy any.  I found it on Amazon.com and used it for the first time last week.  All day long at work I got compliments about how great my hair looked and if I had recently been to the salon (I haven&#x27;t been for three weeks).  The only thing I had done differently was use this product, and only this product, that morning.  I guess there is something about it that makes your hair more noticeable.  It definitely controlled frizz for the first 8 hours.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful for the shine and manageability of my hair... but be careful not to use too much... spray some in your hand before applying to hair.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed. I put it on my hair and after I was all done styling it, it made my hair feel very dry and stringy. Felt like the strands were going to snap.</li>
    <li> I have thin wavy hair prone to be frizzy even when the weather is not damp.  This thick cream takes care of the frizz and makes my hair a little curly, which I like.  Despite the price, I love it because it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I loved this but now that I know there are many comparable hair products out there I wont pay this kind of money.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair, and this oil is perfect for controlling certain frizz-prone sections of my hair.  I love it, and will buy a 2nd as soon as I run out :-)</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my hair. Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Have seen a difference in my hair. It has really toned down the frizz.</li>
    <li> If you have curly , frizzy hair this product is the best !</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Best stuff for fly away hair I have ever used. Plus it smells really good.  I would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought this was oil. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a light spray. So, much to my surprise when it arrived and it wasn&#x27;t oil. I still use it, but not often.</li>
    <li> Product made no difference at all.  Spent too much money.  Definitely would definitely not recommend this product to anyone at all</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this is a spray, instead of a serum. Very greasy with one spray. Didn&#x27;t like it although I am a fan of moroccan oil products.</li>
    <li> I have really really fine wavy hair and I&#x27;ve had many a hairstyle ruined by a bout of static. This product actually works! Whenever my hair starts acting up, a few sprays calm it down immediately! It is not cheap, but a single bottle lasts for some time (my hair is just below shoulder-length) and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Ok, Ok, I have no idea how this product works or why and no I have never used it.  However, my wife would argue that I just don&#x27;t understand and that it is a great Israeli product which she loves</li>
    <li> Awesome product awesome price. It smells fabulous...I would buy it again and recommend to my friends and family. The end.</li>
    <li> This is the first thing that goes on my freshly Wen cleansed hair.  There&#x27;s nothing quite like it at any price!  I see many of you feel it helps cut down on static - it really doesn&#x27;t for me during these dry cold months and the wrath of central heat.  BUT!  What IT DOES is leave my hair impeccably softness &amp; shine- which is difficult for blondes to achieve, and it&#x27;s an excellent heat protector.  To be fair, as I said, I apply to wet hair before anything else unless I&#x27;m using a spray conditioner.  Then I rub in my hands to distribute, concentrating on mid-shaft down to the ends and avoiding my scalp. I comb my hair out first so that I&#x27;m not transferring the oil to my roots by wide tooth comb.  After I apply I can let my hair air dry a bit before blow out.  After my hair is blown out, if I use a flat iron or any other hot tool, I usually don&#x27;t use more MO, rather another heat protectant like Paul Mitchell Skinny.  I like to reserve the MO for my wet hair ritual, but it can be used sparingly prior to curling or straightening hair.  I simply don&#x27;t want to go through it too fast and use something else for the final step.</li>
    <li> sorry about the grade that I gave. It was the first time that I was using this feedback and I didn&#x27;t know how to fix the stars.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had heard a lot about this product, but I&#x27;ve never used before, so I reallly didn&#x27;t know that this product wouldn&#x27;t come sealed. The service was perfect.</li>
    <li> Morocanoil , this is the best thing that I have found to help my dry frizzed hair.  I have been dealing with this problem for years, this is the first time something has worked.</li>
    <li> initially I thought this was wonderful. but I needed to spray more and more, then the hair looks dirty. not very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this frizz control.  It not only takes care of the frizz but it also makes my hair not have static cling, love it.</li>
    <li> I have used moroccan products before and the smell is always divine, brought this from amazon and it is disgusting smells awful it is old and is really sticky, feel hard down by as I live in New Zealand and is too much hassel to send back really disappointed, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I do not find that this product controls my curly hair or helps minimize frizz in humid weather - it is way too light for that.  I do find that it smooths my hair a bit and makes it feel silky and shiny.  I cannot use it alone as or in place of a hair serum, but it can be used along with something else.  For the money, it&#x27;s not worth it.  I&#x27;ll use the bottle I have but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> makes your hair way to oily.</li>
    <li> The product did not meet my expectations, especially in comparison to the  Moroccan Oil. Personally, I felt it was the oil diluted with water.</li>
    <li> Love this moroccanoil product. it keeps my hair smooth and shiny and keeps the frizz down in the summer humidity</li>
    <li> Got it for my girl, she loves it for her fine static hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product I wish I could find local but can&#x27;t. I was going threw a beauty supply web&lt;br /&gt;Site but found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair is fine and curly and goes wild in humid weather. This helps to tame it so I can keep it under control.</li>
    <li> The best hair de frizz product I have used yet!</li>
    <li> The Frizz control serum didn&#x27;t really work for me. I moved back to using the Moroccan Oil that works great.</li>
    <li> Thank you it is vvvvvvvvvery good and more on time and we look to take more and in future thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my hair gets so statically especially in winter. I love this product. I have bought others in the past and I have to keep reapplying.  This I just spray it in my hair either wet or dry and lasts all day. The smell is great. So worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product but go lightly on the spritz!</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil and that is why I pay so much for their products.  But this product dried out my hair and didn&#x27;t smell like Moroccanoil usually does.  Sad :&#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Works amazing for static!!!!</li>
    <li> Works okay, but doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Great product! You don&#x27;t need to use much and it smells awesome! I live in FL where it is humid and it totally keeps the frizz out!</li>
    <li> Great for Frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> If I spray it into wet hair, it seems to smooth and detangle.  After it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s way frizzier than usual.</li>
    <li> good product for the hair, my wife like it.</li>
    <li> I use it before I blow dry my hair. I use to get static in my hair and freeze not anymore,  since I have been using this product. I will get it gain.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it.  Light and does not weigh the hair down and DOES keep your hair from being frizzy. Highly recommend.  A staple for frizzy hair and humid days.  If I were to think of a con it might be that it is not inexpensive and goes quickly; however, I use this product daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have SUPER frizzy hair but it&#x27;s frizzy enough that this really helps achieve the &#x27;smooth&#x27; look when I blow dry my hair.  I refuse to use a flat iron because it&#x27;s really bad for it AND I don&#x27;t want my hair to be poker straight either.  I love the smell of moroccanoil!!!</li>
    <li> I do not see any difference when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of maroccan oil products. This works ok I will say if does help with static Control in my hair during winter. BUT as far as frizz I have used better products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used the Moroccan oil products before so this was new to me.  I have long hair that tends to frizz a bit and I wanted something that would help control that as well as add some shine and do all that in a healthy way.  The first time I used it I overdid a bit and ended up with oily patches here and there.  So, for me there was a bit of a learning curve!  Be SURE to hold it far away from your hair when you spray - which isn&#x27;t all that easy with long hair I have discovered.  Actually if you live with someone and have very long hair they may be willing to help with the spraying.  The second time I did much better and my hair was flat, smooth, shiny and healthy looking.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would recommend you give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for my hair. It really does help with the frizzies!</li>
    <li> Best product for curly hair. No more frizz just smooth curls..love it will always use this product I have also purchased the shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Melanie/ Maui</li>
    <li> Love this...no more fly away dry looking hair and never oily ...I use Moroccan oil products this is one of my favorites</li>
