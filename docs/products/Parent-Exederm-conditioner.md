      <li>so it&#x27;s just not the right product for my needs!</li>

      <li>They worked better than anything else I have tried to clear up my eczema breakouts, so the only issue left was my scalp.</li>

    <li> Exederm is only products I can uses besides plain petroleum jelly. Thank Goodness you exist. Relief for eyelid allergic dermititis!  Yay!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had gifted me the flare up cream and face wash from this line of products. They worked better than anything else I have tried to clear up my eczema breakouts, so the only issue left was my scalp. My eczema was so bad, I was losing hair by the handfuls. This conditioner and shampoo, used on a regular basis, did the trick. My hair is finally growing back!</li>
    <li> See my review under shampoo....excellent</li>
    <li> Of all the conditioners I&#x27;ve tried that say they are for highly sensitive skin, this works the best for me.  Leaves my hair shiny and managable.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff was not very good. I still had dirty hair after shower and the conditioner didnt do anything. It made my hair feel sticky and heavy.</li>
    <li> While I like their shampoo, this product for me did not do a good job of moisturizing so it&#x27;s just not the right product for my needs!</li>
    <li> I thought it was possible for me to reduce the dandruff but it really didn&#x27;t work after 3 weeks of use. It worked the first 3 weeks but after that, nada.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling to find a shampoo and conditioner that don&#x27;t make my scalp itch and break out.  These products fit the bill!  I just ordered more and also body lotion.  What a relief!</li>
    <li> I really like the Exederm Shampoo, but the conditioner seems to leave my hair feeling over-conditioned or thick in all the wrong ways, somehow.  I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it was intended to do. No complains. I will definitely purchase this product again in the future.!</li>
    <li> I have scalp eczema,  after the first use you could really tell it helped!</li>
    <li> My 2.5 year old has Eczema.  I use the Exederm shampoo and conditioner for her 4b/c hair.  The two products alleviate her scalp irritation and I am grateful.  She does not scratch at all when I use these products. I found this to be a blessing.  She is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product does not condition her hair. Her hair is clean. She does not try to pull her hair out but it is not good for her hair texture.  I still use it while I am experimenting with other conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only give this 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t condition her hair the way I need a conditioner to.</li>
    <li> This is not a, &amp;#34;put in your hair and wash it out quicky product&amp;#34;.  Put it in your hair and wait a few minutes before washing it out.</li>
    <li> Not great as a conditioner but good for not causing excema.</li>
