### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And these Bucky ones are the best of the best.   </li>
      <li>I was impressed.</li>
      <li>it is absolutely wonderful.</li>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever had!  </li>
      <li>Those had the perfect balance of softness and thickness.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say it is the best mask I have found.</li>
      <li>I have had my Bucky Eye Shades for 3 weeks now and I am sleeping the best sleep ever!  </li>
      <li>Regardless the time of day or the position of the sun, this mask gives me perfect darkness.</li>
      <li>You will wonder how you ever got a good night&#x27;s sleep without it!</li>
      <li>This product is the best I have found for helping to achieve a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
      <li>Great eye shades.</li>
      <li>This also makes a great gift - even for people who don&#x27;t think they need a sleep mask.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy with these shades.</li>
      <li>I LOVE them!!</li>
      <li>They do a great job at blocking the clock&#x27;s light.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job of masking light</li>
      <li>The padding makes them so comfortable, and the velcro closing is a great idea.  </li>
      <li>This is the absolute best eye mask.</li>
      <li>and I have already bought two as gifts in addition to my own.</li>
      <li>My new best friend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable, it blocks out ALL light, and it has a handy place to store your ear plugs.</li>
      <li>(Just make sure you sew/safety pin your contact info.</li>
      <li>In fact, I found a bandana tied around my eyes worked about as well as most masks.  </li>
      <li>many years ago when they were giving out better quality shades.  </li>
      <li>bottom line is that I love this mask...  </li>
      <li>Now it has a dual function :)</li>
      <li>Will work great on an airplane ride if you have an early departure and want to catch some zzzz&#x27;s airborne.  </li>
      <li>But ... the dark they give is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I work nights and this is perfect for creating a dark enviornment for daytime sleep.</li>
      <li>This is truly a superior product that I cannot live without.  </li>
      <li>These eye shades work beautifully for air travel, but are comfortable enough to wear every night.  </li>
      <li>These shades are fantastic in terms of blocking out the light, but ...</li>
      <li>the strap stays in place and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It works the best and is not overly heavy on my face.  </li>
      <li>(Of course, that &#x27;free shipping&#x27; thing will go away.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a really comfortable eye mask.  </li>
      <li>The mask is so comfortable</li>
      <li>It keeps all light out.</li>
      <li>I have no idea if she turned on the light or not.</li>
      <li>She hands them to put, I put them on, she turns on the light.</li>
      <li>This is an all around fantastic product</li>
      <li>The adjustable velcro strap allows you to have a snug fit.</li>
      <li>Because it blocks light</li>
      <li>These eye shades are quite comfortable and not annoying.</li>
      <li>These eye shades are quite bulky, but they do keep out the light.  </li>
      <li>Its adjustable straps make for a comfortable fit around the head.  </li>
      <li>The cheap shades I got from the airline do not work for me.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight, and tends to stay in position.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still using that original mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some cute colors, too, and reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returning it and going back to using the cheap airlines mask until I find one more suitable.</li>
      <li>The ear plugs aren&#x27;t that great, but it wasn&#x27;t the reason I bought the mask in the first place, so no big deal.  </li>
      <li>It is comfortable and its design allows the wearer to blink and/or open their eyes making it much better than most sleep masks.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how MUCH the light bothered me until I tried them!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who needs total darkness for a good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
      <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear them and that it would bother me, but they are soft and comfy and I slept like a baby!!</li>
      <li>These are the most comfortable eyeshades I have found, block out all of the light and generally last for a year or two.</li>
      <li>And the second important feature is that they are very comfortable on my head/face.</li>
      <li>Also if you switch sides during the night they move too much causing light to seep through.</li>
      <li>It blocks out light very well.</li>
      <li>I love the soft way it \\&quot;cuddles\\</li>
      <li>so is well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>This brand was not the most expensive, but it was the most comfortable and effective of all.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>, It does a decent job at keeping a lot of the light out.  </li>
      <li>They would also be fabulous for taking a nap (when it&#x27;s light outside), on the plane, in a hotel, or even as a guest at someone&#x27;s house.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to light</li>
      <li>So comfortable, even my 4 year old daughter borrows it!  </li>
      <li>-- almost like it makes my eyes hot in that area.  </li>
      <li>they are so hot that if you, like me, can&#x27;t stand heat while you sleep, these will keep you awake until you throw them across the room.  </li>
      <li>I am concerned the added bulk will make them hot in the summer.  </li>
      <li>They really cut out the light and allow a deep comfortable sleep.  </li>
      <li>First, said ridge pushes the mask itself up off your eyes so there isn&#x27;t any pressure.</li>
      <li>Normally, if I get even a tiny sliver of light during the night, I wake up and these Shades block out all the light and are very soft and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>These are a bit much.  </li>
      <li>and they work very well.</li>
      <li>These also launder very well.  </li>
      <li>For my eyes, it is ironic.  </li>
      <li>The price was the same as Amazon, and they were having a sale with free shipping.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these to everyone!   </li>
      <li>Second, it helps block the light that would otherwise come in where it is shaped for your nose.</li>
      <li>They are very bulky.</li>
      <li>The pressure on my face bothers me, though, and sometimes it feels as though the heat from my eyes is too much</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft and a bit cumbersome at first when you aren&#x27;t used to the feel of them, yet.</li>
      <li>Overall I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>We now wear our Bucky&#x27;s every night as even a tiny sliver of light will wake us up too early.</li>
      <li>Because these shades block every single photon of light.</li>
      <li>Shields the light very well and even has a little thingy that covers that space next to your nose and under the eyes where light can get in.</li>
      <li>These were the very first of several sleeping masks that I&#x27;ve tried and are still my favourite.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>No other brand works as well which allows me to justify the higher price.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll take a hot face with sleep than a comfortable temperature face and little sleep.</li>
      <li>I simply remember to pop in a fresh pair of plugs before each trip.  </li>
      <li>:  They are indeed too thick to wear in warm weather.  </li>
      <li>I personally find the weight to be just right, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As one other review pointed out, this raised ridge also serves the purpose of keeping light from sneaking in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I really enjoy them and imagine I will be a customer for years to come despite their products bring made for bigger people than me.</li>
      <li>Most masks are either thin, and let light in through the fabric, or have small areas around the mask that jet out from your face and light gets in that way.</li>
      <li>Amazon offers only 1 color, but the shades are available in several colors and fabrics.  </li>
      <li>I just ordered a new replacement mask, but will keep the old one on-hand as a backup.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I saw the mask upon arrival, I had my doubts already.  It&#x27;s bulky and a bit heavy and the wide Velcro strap makes it uncomfortable for sleeping, since there is no give as with elastic bands.  The point of contact of the Velcro strips at the back of the head makes for an irritation when sleeping on one&#x27;s back because of the bump that results.  I&#x27;m a side sleeper and found that the mask tended to shift during the night when I was on my side.  It also tends to overheat the area of the eyes when sleeping in hot weather during the summer because it&#x27;s so thick.  It does a great job of masking light but it just doesn&#x27;t meet my needs.  I&#x27;m returning it and going back to using the cheap airlines mask until I find one more suitable.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever had!  Use them &amp;#34;religiously&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I take a nap in my truck every day at lunch. Regardless the time of day or the position of the sun, this mask gives me perfect darkness. I couldn&#x27;t be happier...it is absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> After suffering insomnia for 16 years, I discovered Bucky&#x27;s Eye Shades and ear plugs. I never had another moment of trouble sleeping, and it&#x27;s been years now. I have since tried other shades, but nothing beats my Buckys for comfort. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just a bit sensitive across the sinus portion of my face, but I have found this eye-mask a little on the heavy side.  Other than that, It does a decent job at keeping a lot of the light out.  Its adjustable straps make for a comfortable fit around the head.  The pressure on my face bothers me, though, and sometimes it feels as though the heat from my eyes is too much -- almost like it makes my eyes hot in that area.  It&#x27;s hard to describe.  I usually end up taking it off, which is disappointing.  When I used it in a recliner (sitting up more), I didn&#x27;t notice the pressure nearly so much, but laying down, it&#x27;s a drag.  ... Update:  I ended up placing these in front of my alarm clock instead of wearing them on my face!  They do a great job at blocking the clock&#x27;s light.  For my eyes, it is ironic.  I had purchased 1/2 yard of black velvet (or velour - I forget!) fabric to use for photography.  One night I grabbed it up and decided to use the black fabric as an eye shade.  It works the best and is not overly heavy on my face.  Now it has a dual function :)</li>
    <li> So comfortable, even my 4 year old daughter borrows it!  The ear plugs aren&#x27;t that great, but it wasn&#x27;t the reason I bought the mask in the first place, so no big deal.  Overall I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had several pairs of eye shades which became uncomfortable and irritating while pressing down on my eyes &amp; face. These eye shades are quite comfortable and not annoying. I did not need the ear plugs.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have found for helping to achieve a good night&#x27;s sleep.  It is comfortable and its design allows the wearer to blink and/or open their eyes making it much better than most sleep masks.  It is something I would definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy with these shades. They are very bulky. Feel like i&#x27;m sleeping with a pillow on my face. Also if you switch sides during the night they move too much causing light to seep through. Finally I did not care for the velcro straps behind the head. Felt very stiff and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> These were the very first of several sleeping masks that I&#x27;ve tried and are still my favourite. They&#x27;re rather thick and make my face all hot on summer nights but I&#x27;ll take a hot face with sleep than a comfortable temperature face and little sleep. They&#x27;re soft and a bit cumbersome at first when you aren&#x27;t used to the feel of them, yet. They have a ridge of foam/fabric on the bottom (below your eyes) that plays a double role. First, said ridge pushes the mask itself up off your eyes so there isn&#x27;t any pressure. Second, it helps block the light that would otherwise come in where it is shaped for your nose. Again, it&#x27;s a bit odd at first but I think it is essential for me to have on a mask, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strap is thick on the back of your head and that might be an issue for those who sleep on their back. You may also end up waking up every once in a while to adjust a strap off of your ear. They are a bit big for my small face but I can make them work for me, which doesn&#x27;t happen often. Overall, I really enjoy them and imagine I will be a customer for years to come despite their products bring made for bigger people than me.</li>
    <li> This is truly a superior product that I cannot live without.  (I do not work for the company or know anyone emplyed by Bucky).  These eye shades work beautifully for air travel, but are comfortable enough to wear every night.  They really cut out the light and allow a deep comfortable sleep.  These also launder very well.  Unfortunately, I lost my mask when I last travelled so I&#x27;m reordering.  Don&#x27;t let the $24.95 price scare you - it&#x27;s worth it.  (Just make sure you sew/safety pin your contact info. to the strap when you travel - it&#x27;s heartbreaking to lose these shades).  Amazon offers only 1 color, but the shades are available in several colors and fabrics.  This also makes a great gift - even for people who don&#x27;t think they need a sleep mask.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best eye mask. Because of its construction, the fabric stays off of your eyes and you can hardly even feel that you are wearing it. It blocks out light very well. I use it when my husband reads late at night while I am trying to sleep. I get migraines and also find it helpful when I am trying to get rid of one of those. Because it blocks light so well, I can lay down even during mid-day and fall asleep. I also find the slight (and I do mean very slight) pressure on the cheekbones and around the strap to be soothing and even helpful in alleviating headaches. This is an all around fantastic product and I have already bought two as gifts in addition to my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dorm student and I got this at a local shop because my roommate has lights on when I try to sleep and I have to say it is the best mask I have found. It keeps all light out. Most masks are either thin, and let light in through the fabric, or have small areas around the mask that jet out from your face and light gets in that way. This covers both areas and I don&#x27;t see a thing. If you are looking for a mask that lets in no light, get this mask. Its the only reason I get any sleep at night.</li>
    <li> I have had my Bucky Eye Shades for 3 weeks now and I am sleeping the best sleep ever!  Normally, if I get even a tiny sliver of light during the night, I wake up and these Shades block out all the light and are very soft and comfortable.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They also have a small pocket for ear plugs (included) and I even found an extremely tiny flashlight that fits in the pocket with the ear plugs - fantastic!  The flashlight is a</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t think you would ever need an eye mask, until you try one.  And these Bucky ones are the best of the best.   Although I don&#x27;t have trouble sleeping, I tried one, and now I can&#x27;t sleep without it!   They would also be fabulous for taking a nap (when it&#x27;s light outside), on the plane, in a hotel, or even as a guest at someone&#x27;s house.   The padding makes them so comfortable, and the velcro closing is a great idea.  Otherwise the elastic can be too tight (very uncomfortable) or too loose (where it shifts when you are sleeping).   I highly recommend these to everyone!   You will wonder how you ever got a good night&#x27;s sleep without it!</li>
    <li> I got my Bucky eye mask as a gift almost 10 years ago, and I still use it almost every night. It is indespensable! It&#x27;s very comfortable, it blocks out ALL light, and it has a handy place to store your ear plugs. The adjustable velcro strap allows you to have a snug fit. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs total darkness for a good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
    <li> I am a side sleeper and I could tell from the mask still in the package that it would be too bulky to sleep on.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I used these in the morning when my girlfriend gets up before me for work. She hands them to put, I put them on, she turns on the light. Or does she? I have no idea if she turned on the light or not. Because these shades block every single photon of light. I was impressed. And the second important feature is that they are very comfortable on my head/face. Soft micro fiber and the sticking placement is well done I think. There is also a small pouch on the front to keep ear plugs. Great eye shades.</li>
    <li> These shades are fantastic in terms of blocking out the light, but ... they are so hot that if you, like me, can&#x27;t stand heat while you sleep, these will keep you awake until you throw them across the room.  Also, If you have long hair, you have to put it up in a ponytail or the shades will slip off.  But ... the dark they give is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a Dr. Oz recommendation!  I LOVE them!! I didn&#x27;t realize how MUCH the light bothered me until I tried them! I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear them and that it would bother me, but they are soft and comfy and I slept like a baby!! My new best friend! Some cute colors, too, and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> These eye shades are quite bulky, but they do keep out the light.  The cheap shades I got from the airline do not work for me.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to light and they let in the tiniest amount.  I got these to try to reproduce the effect of shades I got in business class many years ago when they were giving out better quality shades.  Those had the perfect balance of softness and thickness.  These are a bit much.  The design is supposed to relieve pressure on the eyes.  I don&#x27;t mind the pressure, but, if anything, these cause added pressure.  I am concerned the added bulk will make them hot in the summer.  The Velcro closures wear out and the  overlap of the strap it necessitates adds to the bulk.  On the positive side, other than the velcro, they do seem made to last.&lt;br /&gt;5/27:  They are indeed too thick to wear in warm weather.  I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating from a 4 to a 3.  They are soft, but too thick to be comfortable.</li>
    <li> I am a day sleeper on occasion (work related).  I have tried 4 or 5 different eye shades from numerous manufacturers.  This brand was not the most expensive, but it was the most comfortable and effective of all.  It is light weight, and tends to stay in position.  Will work great on an airplane ride if you have an early departure and want to catch some zzzz&#x27;s airborne.  Use with foam earplugs for additional sensory deprivation and deeper sleep.</li>
    <li> We first bought this brand on a vacation when one of us wanted to read and the other wanted to sleep.  We now wear our Bucky&#x27;s every night as even a tiny sliver of light will wake us up too early. The mask is so comfortable I never know I have it on and lasts about 8-10 years so is well worth the cost. The velcro is the only way to go because if the elastic stretches out a little, I can always tighten the velcro.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot internationally, so need a reliable product that works.  I was initially a little reluctant to spend $25 (the price I paid back in 2004) on a sleep mask, but I was getting tired of other masks that simply didn&#x27;t work well.  In fact, I found a bandana tied around my eyes worked about as well as most masks.  It&#x27;s now mid-2012 and I&#x27;m still using that original mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, I could not be happier than I am with this product.  I love the soft way it \\&quot;cuddles\\&quot; my face, especially the raised ridge along the bottom that keeps the mask away from my eyes.  It&#x27;s the only mask I&#x27;ve ever seen that allows me to open my eyes with the mask on.  As one other review pointed out, this raised ridge also serves the purpose of keeping light from sneaking in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of other reviewers did point out that the Velcro does wear out over time.  Also the straps themselves tend to stretch as well.  It took years for this to happen, however.  My solution was simply to use a big office paperclip to keep the strap in adjustment.  I don&#x27;t baby my things, so toss it into a washing machine after each trip... Few Velcro products would stand up to years and years of machine washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the small pocket for ear plugs.  Like any ear plugs, the included pair only last a few wearings... but that&#x27;s to be expected.  I simply remember to pop in a fresh pair of plugs before each trip.  Additionally, there is room in the pocket for a sleeping pill or two... and/or a couple of Dramamine tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading through the previous reviews, some people complain about the weight.  I personally find the weight to be just right, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing...  I just ordered a new replacement mask, but will keep the old one on-hand as a backup.  I ended up not purchasing the new mask from Amazon because it was available only in the dark blue (the color of my current one.)  I&#x27;ve learned over the yearsto avoid buying everything (suitcases, glasses cases, accessories) all in dark colors...  because when searching for things in a dimly lit airplane or hotel room, you can&#x27;t tell one item from another.  For that reason, I ordered a red color directly from the Bucky website.  The price was the same as Amazon, and they were having a sale with free shipping.  (Of course, that &#x27;free shipping&#x27; thing will go away.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I love this mask...  As a professional traveler, it receives my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Shields the light very well and even has a little thingy that covers that space next to your nose and under the eyes where light can get in. I work nights and this is perfect for creating a dark enviornment for daytime sleep. Comes with a little built in spot to store earplugs. The only drawback is it is heavy suede- like fabric and sweating can occur. These are washable - beware the dark color runs the first few washings. I have other lighter weight shades by Bucky that allows for eye movement due to a&amp;#34; cupped&amp;#34; style around the eye area and yet still blocks light well. No other brand works as well which allows me to justify the higher price.</li>
    <li> I have had several of these and they work very well. My wife reads in the middle of the night. These are the most comfortable eyeshades I have found, block out all of the light and generally last for a year or two.</li>
    <li> This is a really comfortable eye mask.  Thick and soft.  the strap stays in place and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
