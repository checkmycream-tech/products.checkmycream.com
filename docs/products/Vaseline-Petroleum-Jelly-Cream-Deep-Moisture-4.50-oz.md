      <li>Was so glad to find this product on line.  </li>
      <li>love this product and have shared it with some of my family members.</li>
      <li>really love this product</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad I can get it through AMAZON.</li>
      <li>The smell is okay</li>
      <li>so glad I found it.  </li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Anything with Lanolin is out as are most scented products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product many times before</li>
      <li>(so think of it more like an amalgamation of vaseline petroleum jelly and vaseline lotion).</li>
      <li>The tube packaging of this product makes for an easier, more controlled application.  </li>
      <li>With 3 months of non-consecutive usage of this, now my heels are getting whole-lot better.</li>
      <li>The $10 and up products generate more profit per ft of shelf space.</li>
      <li>This is like magic to me since I&#x27;ve been having cracking heels for many years.</li>
      <li>I have been using this vaseline product for decades and, when it became unavailable in my area, started to order it online and have obtained it thus for many years.  </li>
      <li>I would ask the company to make the tube more slender so that it is easier to squeeze the cream out using just the thumb and index finger.  </li>
      <li>I started paying more attention to the effects after that, and I had to agree:  </li>
      <li>really glad I did.</li>
      <li>(Use with caution in the summer time, cause it will make you sweat a bit more, since it locks in everything that may want to evaporate off your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever used and I have very dry skin.</li>
      <li>And you can immediately feel your skin becoming smoother, softer and most importantly, hydrated.</li>
      <li>Perfect for very dry skin (fingers,elbows and especially the soles of the feet).&lt;br /&gt;- Locks in moisture (wonderful to use right after the shower, or ANY time</li>
      <li>My skin gets scaly and cracks easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrence or aroma either.</li>
      <li>I imagine it works fine</li>
      <li>importantly, this product absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling waxy or tacky</li>
      <li>This one is a little greasier than the off brands, but once it is massaged in works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and feels smooth.</li>
      <li>recently was looking in my local WalMart for another kind of moisturizer, always on the hunt for the perfect one</li>
      <li>What I rec&#x27;d is tubes of the equivalent of cheap hand lotion, runny and a bit smelly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rare for me to write a review.  </li>
      <li>The best stuff EVER to use on a new Tattoo, after the initial peeling!</li>
      <li>For some reason it seems discontinued in stores, but it&#x27;s a rich cream that isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
      <li>it - but have not been successful in finding it in any stores recently</li>
      <li>Thanks to the internet I was able to find it.</li>
      <li>True,</li>
      <li>I can no longer find this locally so was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Whole day protection/never need to reapply to problem areas more than once in one day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This works really well for my 5-year-old son&#x27;s hands as well - his are even more chapped than mine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m noticing with this product it doesn&#x27;t heal as quickly.  </li>
      <li>you want a quick to apply lotion, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
      <li>Many of my favorite t-shirts are ruined because of the days we only used Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A smaller tube that would be in-flight carry-on friendly or purse-sized would be amazing.</li>
      <li>If you have severe dry skin, this is definitely a good lotion to get.</li>
      <li>the only thing that could make this better, is if it includes sunscreen!</li>
      <li>The &#x27;Assured Creamy Petroleum Jelly&#x27; is the same thing only it smells pleasant ..!</li>
      <li>I used it as a moisturizer at night, and i was surprised i didn&#x27;t wake up with huge pimples!</li>
      <li>But to my surprise, the cream got absorbed within seconds.</li>
      <li>This is one of those rare products that I must recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>RIGHT IN AND STARTS HEALING.  </li>
      <li>Only comes in one size (but because it is so potent, you&#x27;ll find that you won&#x27;t run out quickly</li>
      <li>I got a very sensitive face and am still looking for good facial cream that can hydrate as well as this one but would not cause redness on my face.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for long time and it&#x27;s am amazing cream, I use it for my face and don&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
      <li>It may be greasy, but not as much as regular vaseline, it has a lighter consistancy and is more easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>This is a great inexpensive way to get daily facial moisture.  </li>
      <li>I would easily order more (whenever I run out) and it&#x27;s definately worth it for the very dry among us!!!</li>
      <li>The cream itself is almost fragrance-free and it is very very moisture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this on my face all winter.  It is heavy duty .  All other moisturizers seem like they are under performing.</li>
    <li> Could not find this product in the stores. Thanks to the internet I was able to find it. Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
    <li> Matter of opinion: I re-order the &#x27;Assured&#x27; brand because THIS one smells like plain Vaseline. I imagine it works fine I just don&#x27;t care for the smell. The &#x27;Assured Creamy Petroleum Jelly&#x27; is the same thing only it smells pleasant ..! My opinion. :)</li>
    <li> I use this stuff regularly; BEST moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on a bit oily at first, but your skin will absorb it eventually. If only it were available in a larger size.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have used this for years.  For some reason it seems discontinued in stores, but it&#x27;s a rich cream that isn&#x27;t oily.  I have hyper-sensitive skin and this works well.</li>
    <li> Was so glad to find this product on line.  It is the best moisture lotion I have found and I could not find if locally anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good overnight hand cream for months. This stuff is amazing. I work in a hospital so I have to wash my hands a lot. I also live in a desert climate so my skin overall is pretty dry. Most creams are $10 and up for a tiny bottle. I have been using this product for a week and my hands are like new. It is very greasy, so it&#x27;s best before bedtime. Load it on and let your skin heal while you sleep!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past month now.  It is very good at moisturizing.  I have psoriasis and this combination of cream and vaseline keeps my skin moist with less of the greasy feel.  From time to time my skin also cracks and bleeds.  Normally, if I put Vaseline grease on my skin when this happens, it heals in about three days.  I&#x27;m noticing with this product it doesn&#x27;t heal as quickly.  That is the only downside I have found to Vaseline Petroleum Jelly Cream.  Other things I&#x27;ve noticed are that the cream will stay with you all day if it is not being rubbed off (i.e. by clothing).  Otherwise, it keeps my skin moist for about half the day and then I need to re-apply it.  The tube packaging of this product makes for an easier, more controlled application.  I would ask the company to make the tube more slender so that it is easier to squeeze the cream out using just the thumb and index finger.  Small thing, I know.  But when you&#x27;re trying to apply the product while keeping everything else grease-free, it keeps things from slipping out of your hand.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Not greasy.  I really like it.  Hard to find in stores, so I get it at AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that says and does exactly what it says. This Vaseline is not a light lotion; it&#x27;s very heavy (so think of it more like an amalgamation of vaseline petroleum jelly and vaseline lotion). Here&#x27;s what you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****PROS****&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect for very dry skin (fingers,elbows and especially the soles of the feet).&lt;br /&gt;- Locks in moisture (wonderful to use right after the shower, or ANY time actually!).&lt;br /&gt;- Whole day protection/never need to reapply to problem areas more than once in one day.&lt;br /&gt;- You only need just a little of the lotion to go a long way (so you won&#x27;t run out of this lotion as fast as you might think!)&lt;br /&gt;- No aweful scent&lt;br /&gt;- Great for everyone (Women, Men, Children and babies!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****CONS****&lt;br /&gt;- A bit greasy (I do not use it on my face as much because of this, but I still do at times).&lt;br /&gt;- Only comes in one size (but because it is so potent, you&#x27;ll find that you won&#x27;t run out quickly either)&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to come by (This product is not sold in all stores, so whenever I see it, I buy 2 or 3 at a time!)&lt;br /&gt;- Locks in too much moisture sometimes? (Use with caution in the summer time, cause it will make you sweat a bit more, since it locks in everything that may want to evaporate off your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and have shared it with some of my family members. I would easily order more (whenever I run out) and it&#x27;s definately worth it for the very dry among us!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very rare for me to write a review.  I have to be passionate about a product, good or bad, to take the time to comment.  This is one of those rare products that I must recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin all my life so am limited in what I can use.  Anything with Lanolin is out as are most scented products.  Not only have I had a dry skin problem all my life, but a few years ago I developed Lymphedema.  (Anyone with this condition understands the extreme necessity for a skin moisturizer.)  I have tried many lotions and creams with unsatisfactory to disastrous results.  Then I tried Vaseline Creamy.  All I can say is Wow!  Put it on at night before bed and you will be amazed at the results when you awake in the morning.  Unscented so there&#x27;s no medicine or perfume odor.  And it absorbs completely w/o that greasy feel.  Callouses?  Rub this in and the next morning you will be amazed at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quick to apply lotion, this isn&#x27;t for you.  But if you want a serious moisturizer/softener, this is what you want.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product just recently, when I was searching for a lotion that would help heal my dry, cracked (sometimes to the point of bleeding) hands.  I live in the Northeast, and we have cold, dry, harsh winters that really do a number on my hands.  I have very sensitive skin (I can&#x27;t use products with lanolin), and I&#x27;ve tried a number of deep moisturizing creams, including Olay, Gold Bond Ultimate, and Neutrogena - none of them does as good a job (or costs as little!) as the Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy Formula product.  This works really well for my 5-year-old son&#x27;s hands as well - his are even more chapped than mine.  It doesn&#x27;t sting, a little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly, so that there&#x27;s little greasiness.  I&#x27;ve used this as a body lotion, and am thrilled with the results - after reading other reviews, I&#x27;m going to try it as a \\&quot;night time\\&quot; lotion.  Highly recommend - I wish that more retail stores carried it; good to know that I can always find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> For particularly chapped skin, this stuff is the best. Especially on your feet. It may be greasy, but not as much as regular vaseline, it has a lighter consistancy and is more easily absorbed. Highly recommend, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my hands and this is the only lotion I can use. When I took it with me to my dermatologist he even told me it&#x27;s great and the right stuff to use for eczema, psoriasis, or severe dry skin. I really love this stuff. When I have a bad rash it clears it up and strengthens the skin; preventing it from breaking and my skin bleeding. I work as a barista and we are always washing dishes and this stuff helps all of us. The other girls have used it and were astonished at how quick it relieves the skin. It&#x27;s good on ashy skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is it is greasy at first but then it&#x27;s not after a few minutes. It&#x27;s not easy to find this product in stores, so I buy it by the dozen when I find it. If you have severe dry skin, this is definitely a good lotion to get. Oh, and it does make your face look nice, as someone previous said that it cleared his wrinkles. I&#x27;ve noticed the line in my forehead disappear. I don&#x27;t have much for wrinkles, just a spot on my forehead. I totally recommend it for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product and I hope you do too.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for the skin.  It contains alot of vitamin e which is very good for healing the skin.  The price is not too bad.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face and neck. I have folliculitis and keratosis pilaris and this product actually works. It moisturizes to point where I am finally turning the corner on both issues. I went to a bunch of dermatologists over the past decade and I have been prescribed a slew of chemical treatments. I wish one of those professionals would have told me to use good ole over the counter Vaseline. I wish I were smart enough to realize that when people suffer terrible burns- doctors use Vaseline. Mercifully, unlike some of the other chemical treatments that I have been prescribed, I can use Vaseline deep moisture creamy formula for the rest of my life. I apply a small amount (think pea size for forehead, right/left cheek, front of the neck and then back of the neck-- the first time a small amount actually works) to my face and neck at night and my skin has improved dramatically in less than one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: For people like me, if you get diagnosed with folliculitis and keratosis pilaris you have dry skin. Even if you don&#x27;t think so because you tend to be slightly oily. Moisturize everyday!</li>
    <li> I found this one at my local walmart and wanted to give it a try for the cracking skin on my heel. The cream itself is almost fragrance-free and it is very very moisture. At first I was not happy with the heavy cream get squeezed out. But to my surprise, the cream got absorbed within seconds. And you can immediately feel your skin becoming smoother, softer and most importantly, hydrated. It might feel a little bit greasy at first, but once it is absorbed (which happens very FAST), it seems become part of your skin barrier. And no oily or greasy feeling at all.    This is like magic to me since I&#x27;ve been having cracking heels for many years. With 3 months of non-consecutive usage of this, now my heels are getting whole-lot better. Still looks dry but no more cracking!(I wished I had kept using it everyday so I could have even better heels now!) Now I even using it on my hand,legs, arms, elbows and neck.     The only problem I have is that I cannot use this on my face. I got a very sensitive face and am still looking for good facial cream that can hydrate as well as this one but would not cause redness on my face.    Beside that, this is definitely the only body lotion I&#x27;d ever need. I wish there&#x27;d be even slimmer and smaller on-the-go pack for in-flight uses.</li>
    <li> The best cream I ever had !I use this cream for skin under eyes . Effect is just great especially so cheap</li>
    <li> Nice lotion for my very dry skin</li>
    <li> I bought this to put on my 3 month old&#x27;s eczema-inflamed skin. And it works much better than the overpriced, ineffective Cetaphil products I spent so much money on. It goes on smooth and creamy and is not heavily greasy like the expensive Aquaphor ointment I was using as well. I already ordered a 3-pack because this product is AWESOME!!!!</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used and I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrific!  It&#x60;s better than any other moisturizer I&#x60;ve ever tried on my face.  I&#x60;m a guy, and I had always tried to avoid buying \\&quot;wrinkle cream\\&quot; or other products marketed for women.  But after using this product for a few months, I noticed a dramatic reduction of the wrinkles in my face.  I would never have thought that using this product would make my face look younger, but it did.  I&#x60;m so glad I found it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ok, yes, I&#x60;m only 32 years old, but I started developing long horizontal lines of consternation on my forhead and a deep crevasse between my eyebrows when I was only 10 years old.  I also started showing wrinkles around my eyes and mouth several years ago that looked like they would eventually deepen into what are politely referred to as \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot;, and maybe not so politely as \\&quot;crow&#x60;s feet\\&quot;.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But a few months ago I bought a bottle of this stuff because my skin gets really dry during the winter.  I&#x60;m not originally from a part of the country that experiences really cold, dry winters, so I&#x60;d been trying different products off and on for the last few years.  I tried this Vaseline-based product on a whim, and I&#x60;m really glad I did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After only a week or so, I noticed the lines in my forehead beginning to become less pronounced.  After a couple months, friends of mine whom I haven&#x60;t seen in a while started telling me how much younger I look.  I was totally surprised.  I started paying more attention to the effects after that, and I had to agree:  most of the lines on my face have become almost invisible, if not completely gone.  Yes, you can still see some of them if you look really closely, but the important thing is that the wrinkles and lines are either gone or so faint that I can barely see them.  And the ones I can still see (the deepest ones) are still slowly disappearing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;ve only been using this product for a little over four months and the effects are visible and quite astonishing.  True, I haven&#x60;t tried a lot of the wrinkle creams or other anti-aging products on the market, but I can&#x60;t imagine anything else being as cost-effective, and it saves me the embarrassment of being a guy buying products produced for women. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negative aspect of the product, and it&#x60;s a minor one, is that my face will be a little shiny for about a half hour after I put it on.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry skin. Not quite eczema, but probably not far from it. If I don&#x27;t use some kind of moisturizer on my face after I shower, all day it feels like my skin is too tight. It&#x27;s awful. I&#x27;ve tried tons of lotions and aftershaves. Most of them either leave my face too greasy/shiny, or they simply don&#x27;t moisturize enough. I also can&#x27;t stand the smell of a lot of lotions, so unscented is really the only thing I go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently was looking in my local WalMart for another kind of moisturizer, always on the hunt for the perfect one and I found this cream. It was four dollars, didn&#x27;t smell, and had Vitamin E in it. So I figured \\&quot;What the hell?\\&quot; It&#x27;s perfect. I only need a pea-sized amount to cover my entire face. It&#x27;s the ideal amount of moisture, but without any greasy feeling or shine. My face feels great, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, and since I only need a small amount this stuff lasts forever. For a four dollar product, this works better than some thirty-dollar products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Whether you need a lotion for your face, elbows, knees -- whatever -- this stuff is perfect.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT STUFF!! I REALLY LIKE THAT WHEN MY SKIN IS CHAPPED, THIS CREAM SOAKS RIGHT IN AND STARTS HEALING.  THANKS!</li>
    <li> I am a RN and my hands get horribly dry. This product provides such relief to my skin it&#x27;s incredible. PS I also use it as night moisturization for my face .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s watery and smells like gasoline. I&#x27;ve bought this product many times before and it&#x27;s always been an inexpensive moisturizer. Very disappointed in the quality of this tube.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff.  Can use it on your face and it soaks in without leaving you shiny.  Also, it won&#x27;t leave your hands greasy like every other lotion.  It is one of a kind. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was told by my doctor that I should try using &#x27;Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy&#x27; formula body cream for my dry skin. I live in Utah with dry snowy   winters and dry desert summer climates. I also have eczema and dry skin due to my thyroid being removed. I tried EVERYTHING for the dry skin and itching but nothing was working until I got &#x27;Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy&#x27;. I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in the stores so I&#x27;m glad I can get it through AMAZON. The product is thick but rub it in good and it really works well. Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has had eczema since she was about 2-months-old. Now she&#x27;s almost 11-months, and her eczema has dramatically improved. I mostly attribute that to the simple fact that as she ages, her immune system is maturing and improving, but it&#x27;s also because we have become experts at managing her outbreaks. Creamy Vaseline is a crucial part of our treatment plan (the most important one second to her prescription steroids). Traditional Vaseline (or other emollients like Aquaphor) are the only ones equipped to tackle skin so dry and damaged as that of an eczema-sufferer, but spreading that over a whole leg (even if it is infant-sized) just doesn&#x27;t work well. It sits on the skin and sort of melts from the warmth, then wipes off when it comes into contact with anything, like clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creamy Vaseline absorbs into her skin while also providing the thick emollient effect of regular Vaseline. Her skin feels softer right away, and after spending RIDICULOUS amounts of money trying other lotions, not ONE other was able to make that happen on her crocodile dry skin. Also, unlike other lotions, it is non-irritating and never made her cry no matter how badly her skin was flared up. And my last point - it is non-greasy, so it doesn&#x27;t leave grease stains on clothes. Many of my favorite t-shirts are ruined because of the days we only used Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, many stores around us have stopped carrying Creamy Vaseline, so we have been buying it by the dozen lately when we see it. I HOPE it is not going to be discontinued! Trust me, if you have ANY dry skin issues, this stuff is more than worthy of a shot. I can tell you with certainty - there is NO other product on the market like it.</li>
    <li> When I had my skin cancer this was the product recommended by the plastic surgeon to ease the discomfort and soften the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love it - but have not been successful in finding it in any stores recently so was happy to have Unilver recommend Amazon for my purchase. This creamy lotion is excellent and provides a wonderful barrier against the winter weather.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing that has cured my eczema after 16 years of trying products out.</li>
    <li> Best hand/body cream I&#x27;ve ever found:  can&#x27;t imagine why it was discontinued in stores.  It dissolves right into the skin, so it&#x27;s not too dense; but it&#x27;s definitely a cream rather than a lotion, doesn&#x27;t run all over.</li>
    <li> The product smells awful!  I really do not like it!  I could hardly wait to use it, as my eye doctor recommended it.</li>
    <li> The best stuff EVER to use on a new Tattoo, after the initial peeling!</li>
    <li> I work in the cosmetic/medical industry and look 15 years younger than my true age, due to good skincare and sunblock protection. I have access to the most expensive, medical grade moisturizers (Neocutis, NIA24, Hymed, SkinMedica, Obagi, Revision, Elta MD, etc.,) and treatments (such as chemical peels, dermabrasion, etc.) that are available, but cannot have treatments due to my dry skin.  For some reason my skin this winter turned extremely dry, and every moisturizer/serum I have tried either wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, or made me break out. I have tried at least 15 different medical grade (only sold by doctors) moisturizers, and nothing worked.  This winter my skin has been starving for moisture, and would be so dry it was almost literally cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought this Vaseline cream as a hand cream and had never considered it as a face cream. Last week I noticed it in my purse, and read the packaging and saw that it is non-comedogenic. It worked immediately and I am thrilled that this has FINALLY provided me with the moisturization my skin is crying for - I do have to reapply it later on in the day around my mouth, because my skin becomes dry as the day goes on.  I am so thrilled that it is SO INEXPENSIVE compared to any other face moisturizer that is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a a side note, I have NOT tried Creme de la Mer or Shiseido or all of the expensive department store brands (did try Lancome and Clinique and Estee Lauder).</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I use it in the morning as a moisturizing base.I also use it as a moisturizer at night before going to bed. It&#x27;s not greasy and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hand lotion i ever bought. Hands down for this. I had very dry skin and had eczema. I even had a regular visit to a dermetologist for so long. Nothing worked so good like this. Price is unbelievable. I was just browsing for some lotion and read all reviews and decided to get this. Buy it,you wont regret! I am buying this a bulk! Love it!</li>
    <li> I do alot of running, cycling and general outdoor activities. I recently competed in a triathlon and experienced chaffing of my nipples...which led to nipple fissures and extreme dry skin. Once the fissures stopped pussing and began healing, I started using this Vasoline Petroleum Jelly Cream. It provides immediate dry skin relief and lasts for hours before I have to re apply. I&#x27;ve also used it for all my general dry skin issues and its worked quite well at an affordable price. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrence or aroma either. I look forward to trying this stuff out in the winter, when it will really be put to the test!</li>
    <li> This is one of, if not THE best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hands. I can only find this product locally at Wal-Mart stores, so I tend to stock-up. Amazon&#x27;s prices are actually a little bit cheaper, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, dehydrated skin that is very sensitive. My skin gets scaly and cracks easily. I&#x27;ve tried O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, but hated the tacky feeling it left on my skin after application (thanks to the allantoin). I tried Vaseline Deep Moisture Creamy Formula on a recommendation from a coworker and was instantly hooked. The product is fragrance-free (though there is a very faint, mild scent to the product - not at all offensive), creamy without being greasy or sticky, and, best of all, moisturizing! Not only is this product moisturizing, but it&#x27;s occlusive as well. As in, the moisture is sealed in and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, this product absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling waxy or tacky (it doesn&#x27;t stick to vinyl gloves or make them difficult to put on). It&#x27;s thick and only a small dab is needed. I usually apply it to my hands just after washing, while my hands are still a bit damp. However, this product works on dry skin as well. I&#x27;ve turned several people on to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product (and it doesn&#x27;t change my rating) is that this tube is the only size offered. A smaller tube that would be in-flight carry-on friendly or purse-sized would be amazing. Until then, though, I don&#x27;t mind making a little room in my bag for the large tubes. This stuff is that good.</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive way to get daily facial moisture.  This one is a little greasier than the off brands, but once it is massaged in works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I purchased  this product  through Amazon.  When I received it, the tube was  less than half full when.  The contents  were not creamy  but  watered down.  I only paid  a little more than $4.00 for the tube  so it  would have been  more trouble  to send it back  than it was worth.  Will not purchase  anything like this again online.</li>
    <li> I only use this during the winter when the air is dry, and it does wonders.  I&#x27;m in late 30&#x27;s, and people often say I look about 27, 28.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 10 years.  The best time to put this on is right after showering when your skin is moist with steam/water already.  Then it locks in the moisture that the skin already has.  I don&#x27;t like putting this on dry skin - makes my skin oily but not moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people have commented on its smell.  It doesn&#x27;t have the typical cosmetic floral smell, and I like it that way.  It smells a little like oil, maybe somewhat plastic.  But it&#x27;s so slight that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I use other fragrance-free lotions, and they all smell similarly.  At least this doesn&#x27;t have artificial stuff to cover the smell.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this locally so was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It is the only hand cream I had discovered (have tried at least two dozen others) that really treats dry hands effectively.</li>
    <li> Both my spouse and I use this product, especially after swimming in the winter. It is an excellent, inexpensive moisturizer lacking scent. If essentially everyone likes this product, why is it so hard to find in stores? In our town, each of the stores that have carried it have dropped the product, except for Walmart, but even they do not have it all the time. My guess - thinner profit margin. The $10 and up products generate more profit per ft of shelf space.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  Maybe I&#x27;m just overly sensitive, but the smell makes me absolutely queasy.  I used it on my hands and I could still smell it after I washed my hands three times.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin to begin with, and living in a place where it gets unbearably cold in the winter does not bode well with my skin, and especially my hands. And this is a cream I have come to like a lot. I dont think anybody will have problems moisturizing their skin. This cream I admit is pretty intense and can feel greasy after applying, but it does absorb after some time.. but I guess this wait is what turns some people off from the product.     I actually recommend St. Ives lotion.. I just recently tried it, and I think it works much better than this.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why Vaseline stopped making this product......or maybe they are, but you can no longer find it in any stores.  It is the best lotion you can buy.</li>
    <li> I have  been using this product for years. I purchased this on line because our local stores no longer stock it.  This new Vaseline Moisture Creamy Formula  is a big disappointment. It&#x27;s very thin much like the new Vaseline they are producing in the green plastic bottles. I will not buy this product again. I will need to find another moisturizer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for long time and it&#x27;s am amazing cream, I use it for my face and don&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
    <li> It is unscented which is a good thing but I don&#x27;t care for the way it smells. It gets absorbed into the skin very nicely.</li>
    <li> Thick and rich, no smell, contains glycerin and Vitamin E and this is great for dry cracked winter hands. A little bit goes a long way and while it&#x27;s greasy if you don&#x27;t use too much is absorbs well and lasts long.</li>
    <li> This lotion is not as I remember.  Seems more liquidy than creamy.  My skin is still dry the next day</li>
    <li> I have been using this vaseline product for decades and, when it became unavailable in my area, started to order it online and have obtained it thus for many years.  This shipment was just awful.  Normally this cream has the has the consistency of thick  toothpaste and takes some effort to squeeze out of the tube.  What I rec&#x27;d is tubes of the equivalent of cheap hand lotion, runny and a bit smelly.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether the supplier is aware that it selling a watered down substitute, but someone should assume responsibility for this deception.</li>
    <li> There is a significant musk smell, but the lotion works great. Should be aware if you are allergic to Musk fragrance/natural odors? from the lotion... Great repair for skin. But if allergic to musk, be aware.</li>
    <li> Now that I have discovered this product, I will never be without it. I found some locally and have bought many tubes of it. I initially bought it on the recommendation of a friend to help with a rash I had. I now use it daily after swimming, and using my hot tub. It keeps my skin silky without any greasy feeling- a new found miracle!</li>
    <li> I used it as a moisturizer at night, and i was surprised i didn&#x27;t wake up with huge pimples! I have oily skin, and i used to use expensive moisturizer that left my face really greasy and bumpy in the morning. The smell is okay, I think it&#x27;s a little comforting for some reason... the only thing that could make this better, is if it includes sunscreen!</li>
