<li> Took A Long Time To Get To me....</li>
<li> I love the Mary Kay brush and was disappointed to open my package and not have it</li>
<li> I received what was advertised, what I expected, and in the timeframe expected.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way cheaper on amazon than I expected.</li>
<li> Took a while to receive, but this was expected from posting.</li>
<li> I prefer my (way way cheaper) wet n wilds mineral foundation.</li>
<li> making me break out or clogging my pores like other powders.</li>
<li> and I am naturally dark.  </li>
<li> I use a face creme, a little bit of under eye concealer, and then put this on.</li>
<li> I did use MK mineral powder foundation beige 1.5, but it was a little darker.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years</li>
<li> DELIVERY MISSING PARTS.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and found that my pores aren&#x27;t as small as they used to be.</li>
<li> I tried other powders and was not happy.  </li>
<li> Left a horrible grey tinge to it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like false advertisement.</li>
<li> WRONG ADVERTISMENT&lt;br /&gt;MISSING</li>
<li> But I was very disappointed I did not get a brush with this product.</li>

    <li> Left a horrible grey tinge to it. Feels so heavy yet doesn&#x27;t cover much at all. I prefer my (way way cheaper) wet n wilds mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years.  Was able to get the right color to blend with my skin tone and I love the way it gives my face a natural look without giving the \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> Product great!!! Got a great deal on it too. Gives you a great coverage without having to apply a lot. Over all satisfied with Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I love this powder foundation!  Good coverage. Feels light</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my marykay product. I have been a marykay user for 15 years. But I was very disappointed I did not get a brush with this product. It&#x27;s like false advertisement. I should have read more but it doesn&#x27;t say brush not included.</li>
    <li> On time.  What i wanted.  Great job.</li>
    <li> I love this light foundation.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of blemishes to cover up, and this is a great foundation for evening out my color and taking the shine off my face.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay Mineral Powder--excellent coverage; easy application; long lasting especially for my combination skin.  Great container--try it out.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  When I heard that MaryKay was discontinuing this product  I was upset.  I tried other powders and was not happy.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  I should buy more!</li>
    <li> This makeup was over 2 years old according to the date on the box.  Makeup doesn&#x27;t last forever.  I think I should probably not use it.  Should have sent it back but threw away the packaging.  Shoot!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay did it again with a wonderful powder foundation.  I have olive skin tone and Beige 1 is perfect....could even go Beige 2 next time.  It is silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It blends well with my skin color and I am naturally dark.  It is very light and I have no problems with it making me break out or clogging my pores like other powders.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. I like that is has a matte finish. Getting the brush with it was a plus. My total for the item + shipping was $16.98. This is cheaper than the powder through a Mary Kay rep. It was like getting the brush for free. The powder is so fine and smooth!</li>
    <li> I have used this powder for years. It is a good product. However, I had issues with the seller. The description clearly stated that the product came with a brush. She sent the powder but then tried telling me that the brush was not included. I got the brush two weeks later after I called her out on it.</li>
    <li> These powder foundations are my favorite.  This Mary Kay foundation is well designed.  They blend very well.  It&#x27;s long lasting as well and is lightweight.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> DELIVERY MISSING PARTS. WRONG ADVERTISMENT&lt;br /&gt;MISSING PARTS. THE ORDER SUPPOSED TO BE COME WITH THE BRUSH AND I DONT GET THAT.</li>
    <li> I love this powder and have been using it for years. Really makes my skin tone look even and fresh, never cakey.</li>
    <li> Best product &amp; best seller...fast delivery, thanks!</li>
    <li> Have used it for a few years and am always pleased with this product.  Including the brush was a real bonus..</li>
    <li> Great brush for powder...</li>
    <li> Love it...I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and I love the way it makes my face look. It&#x27;s way cheaper on amazon than I expected. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This post said it came with the brush. However when I got it in the mail there was no brush. I was not happy as the powder itself is awesome but a good brush makes it 10x better. I love the Mary Kay brush and was disappointed to open my package and not have it</li>
    <li> The color change between Beige 1 and Beige 1.5 is big.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this product for 4 years. Perfectly matches my light olive skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pours. I did use MK mineral powder foundation beige 1.5, but it was a little darker. So I switched to the beige 1. It&#x27;s very light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new makeup.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and found that my pores aren&#x27;t as small as they used to be. Liquid foundations weren&#x27;t for me anymore, clogging up my pores can&#x27;t be good.  I found the Mary Kay powders easy to use, light and natural looking and best of all my skin feels clean!  I&#x27;m letting my skin breathe for a change and it feels good.</li>
    <li> Took A Long Time To Get To me....</li>
    <li> she loves this. its non-smothering and its like wearing nothing at all.</li>
    <li> I love it, the best brand I ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this mineral powder and I use it sparingly.  You don&#x27;t need a lot to get great coverage. I use a face creme, a little bit of under eye concealer, and then put this on.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the May Kay foundation with brush I ordered. Took a while to receive, but this was expected from posting. I received what was advertised, what I expected, and in the timeframe expected.</li>
