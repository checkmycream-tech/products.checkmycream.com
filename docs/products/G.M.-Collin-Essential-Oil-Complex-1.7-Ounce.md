<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My BFF told me about this product, which she purchased from a spa and paid twice the amount. I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the gel  for about 5 months now and it&#x27;s remarkable. I had a great reduction in the amount of pimples the first month to almost none. My face is very smooth. I would say that the improvement is very obvious to others as well. I&#x27;m now asked by my coworkers what are you using on your face it looks really good. I&#x27;m pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone with acne problems . I will definitely stick with this from years to come</li>
    <li> Love it! Gentle in you skin &amp; yet extremely effective!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now and I am pleased with the results.  My active mature skin is not drying out because of the wonderful ingredients found in this product line.</li>
    <li> REally prevents me from breaking out! whenever I finish a bottle, I start breaking out and run to buy more!</li>
    <li> Great effective treatment for acnes.</li>
    <li> My niece loves this product.  She is 17 and it has helped clear the pimples on her face.</li>
    <li> I like the cooling sensation that is has on my skin but it didn&#x27;t really have an enormous effect on my skin. This product, however, has worked wonders on my aunt. :)</li>
    <li> I love the whole line of the GM Collins Acne products.  I have tried a 100 different products and nothing has worked as great as this.  I love the smell and my face just feels so clean after using this with the wash and gel.  The only issue I have is the fancy glass bottle.  I can not tell you how many times I have dropped and broken this and at 40 dollars it is painful.  But that still doesn&#x27;t deter me from buying again since It has done amazing things for my skin.</li>
    <li> It worked in the beginning, but my skin got immune later on.</li>
    <li> Works great on my teens blemishes, it&#x27;s gentle but affective.</li>
    <li> Its get I had a change in my face thanks to this product, i felt as if i had no hope, but this product prevents pimples. amazing, love how it feels, smells great.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years since I was first introduced to it by my facial expert. Since then it has been a must use. I use it once a day (mainly evening) and I works well for me. I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne but there are occasion where I get it and this does the job.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne, cystic acne (all around my chin area and neck) for years and have tried everything under the sun to make it go away. I was even on medicine for a bit but the medicine made me sick so I stopped. I felt like I was doomed to have forever ugly, broken out skin. It really took a toll on my self esteem. I was introduced to this line by a facialist a few months ago. All I can say is I am HOOKED! I bought the whole puracne oxygen line and my skin has never been so clear!!! I can finally look in the mirror and like the reflection looking back at me. Even when I get my period, which would cause the worst flare ups of acne around my chin are gone. I got one tiny little whitehead and that was it. This product has been a godsend and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has suffered with acne and has yet to find something that really works. Yes, I know this line is pricey but trust me it is well worth it! :)</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. Really like the feeling when I apply it on the face. It helps the skin recover and becomes stable.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent formula. Smells great, goes on smoothly and is rapidly absorbed, leaves no filmy residue on the skin. I place two drops on a cotton round then spray the round with witch hazel to make a custom toner. If I do not dilute this with the witch hazel it WILL cause a breakout because it is a bit strong for my oily, sensitive skin. I use this to work on and prevent closed comedones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is I hate the packaging, it is solid glass. I have had this product twice fall off my counter and shatter (full!) all over the floor. To me this product is too expensive to be packed in such a fragile container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I will continue to buy it because the quality is superior!</li>
    <li> Listen of u r looking for quick fix for ur acme or if u r looking for a permanent fix of course with continued use this is it!  Cancel ur appointments with ur dermatologist cancel ur chemical peels. .. this is dermatology in a bottle!  Seriously people I was out of this for a few weeks n I just got it in the mail last night I used it last night n this morning n my face is already clear n smoother!  Must have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks and my acne got worse.. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s in the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; stage but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed so far :/ I use this along with the Puracne Cleansing Gel and the Derm Renewal Gel. Will update again in a month and will change my rating if it does in fact get better but so far not so good.</li>
    <li> Only thing that has been working to clear up my face, I got a facial at a salon and they used this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months my face is glowing</li>
    <li> I love that this leaves my face clean and keeps acne away without drying out my skin. It feels like its conditioning it and I love the way my face feels afterward. You can also dabble a bit on any break out area. I first found this after getting a facial and have used it since.</li>
    <li> Clears skin very quickly. A must have for people with acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent for treating acne.</li>
    <li> love love love this product. I wish i could find gm collin face products for a little bit less but still a  and great product!</li>
