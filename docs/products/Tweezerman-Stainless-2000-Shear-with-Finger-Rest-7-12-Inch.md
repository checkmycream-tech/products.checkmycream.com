      <li>Perfect for the amateur/at home hair cutting.</li>
      <li>They are clearly made from hardened stainless steel and as such might weigh a bit more than shears with plastic finger holes and flimsy blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and well made.</li>
      <li>They are farm dogs and these shears work very well to trim off the longer hair that pick up the stickers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than taking to a dog groomer - Thanks.</li>

      <li>I have extremely thick hair and because I cut my own hair I needed something that was easy to use and sharp, and these did the job.</li>

      <li>They would be fine for long-hair trims, but for mens cuts, as well as short haircuts on women and children, you&#x27;d have to switch to a smaller shear for the nape and exterior.</li>
      <li>These scissors are about medium in weight, not too light or too heavy.  </li>
      <li>Very nice quality of professional cutting scissors.</li>
      <li>In the world of hair shears, there are high end, low end, and Pakistan.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Pakistan sheers. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I continually purchase these scissors. I wish they still advertised for free sharpening. I cut my hair and my dogs hair with these.</li>
    <li> First off, these are super sharp shears, and if you&#x27;re looking for a good at-home shear, then these are a good value.  However, they&#x27;re too bulky. I found them to be heavy and unbalanced in my hand, and the length is such that it&#x27;s hard to get close in at the nape and around the ears.  They would be fine for long-hair trims, but for mens cuts, as well as short haircuts on women and children, you&#x27;d have to switch to a smaller shear for the nape and exterior.</li>
    <li> I ordered these shears for my husband as he cuts my hair. The shears he was using wwere not very good so he had to take extra care and time while cutting. Now it takes less time and does a much better job.</li>
    <li> For reasonably priced shears, these have proved a revelation after replacing my decades-old non-stainless department store barber scissors.Beautifully practically designed, they have a gratifying heft and balance and precision. Besides being a pleasure to handle and look at, they cut flawlessly. I have large hands and have given up on the trade-off of finding an inelegant design to accommodate them. I&#x60;ll happily made due with these...</li>
    <li> I bought these to trim my dogs with.  They are farm dogs and these shears work very well to trim off the longer hair that pick up the stickers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than taking to a dog groomer - Thanks.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and these scissors are sharp, stay sharp and are easy to manipulate with the finger rest.  For $20, I think I bought something that will get a lot of use for many years, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;ll probably end up cutting my kid&#x27;s hair with these, and I don&#x27;t even have kids yet.</li>
    <li> Top quality.  I use it mainly for my beard.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife since she does all of the hair cutting and trimming in our family. Retired now are her plastic-handled cheapos bought from a local discount store that didn&#x27;t cut all that well and wound up causing her hands to cramp and become tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are an impressive pair of scissors that should stand up to many years of use. They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw. My wife says they are really comfortable and cut well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is exceptional and they come in a nice plastic box for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product. More information on this can be found on their website. It appears that the only cost to you would be the shipping to get the product to them. They also have a &amp;#34;sharpening tracker&amp;#34; that will send out email updates as they process your product for service.</li>
    <li> Pros: Precision cut, very sharp  Cons: Not for male thumbs, it is too small for average males to handle.    This scissor is sharp and very good for precision cuts. I cut my son&#x27;s hair and this scissor reduced the cutting time into half and I am very satisfied. My son is also happy as no more pulling of hair between scissors. My only complaint is that it is bit small for male thumbs, but my wife&#x27;s thumb fit perfectly when she cut my hair.    Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I bought then to trim hair. They are a little too large for that. Also, they aren&#x27;t the weight that I wanted and the smoothness in the cut in not there. I bought another pair of scissors on Amazon that I absolutely love.</li>
    <li> I bought these about 2 years ago to assist me on my natural hair journey and they&#x27;ve been great so far. I do wish that they were sharper. I wouldn&#x27;t consider these the most professional shears, but they get the job done if you can&#x27;t afford to got to the shop frequently or you&#x27;re trying to save and not go to the salon. The way they cut is smooth and first, but you&#x27;ll eventually need to re-sharpen and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking into. There&#x27;s suppose to be a warranty with Tweezerman to get your shears sharpened for free, I need to look into that and If it is a go, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and let you all know. For now, these aren&#x27;t bad shears to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> I have used these haircutting shears for many years.  They cut hair well and have stood the test of time.</li>
    <li> The picture and description were misleading.  When the scissors arrived, I discovered they could have been used to shear sheep -- or perhaps the longest of hair. To make matters worse, there was a no return policy that was somehow missed in reading the original description/policy.</li>
    <li> Love these shears.  The right size and easy grip.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the money.  Cuts hair cleanly and smoothly.  Would buy again.  I&#x27;m not a professional stylist but they work great for cutting my own hair.</li>
    <li> We bought a second pair of these shears because we liked them so much - they are an excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get razor sharp shears. These are a bit dull. Definitely household shears but I wouldn&#x27;t say they should be used for hair.</li>
    <li> High Quality and Very Sharp for the price.  Yes, they are a bit heavy but given their size and quality not out of line.  I bought these shears to help keep a wayward beard trimmed and kept as neat as I can.  I think they do a great job and am pleased with the price, value and quality along with quick delivery from Amazon.  They are clearly made from hardened stainless steel and as such might weigh a bit more than shears with plastic finger holes and flimsy blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect these shears will last a lifetime with care if I can keep my wife from using them to clip coupons.</li>
    <li> very sharp scissors. I am a novice hair trimmer, and I use this on my children. It turns out that 7 1/2 inches is a bit large for hair scissors, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. They work well.</li>
    <li> In the world of hair shears, there are high end, low end, and Pakistan.  These are the 3rd.  These are easily some of the worst shears I&#x27;ve ever seen. Invest in quality tools. [...] (SEE the difference)</li>
    <li> This is the best pair of scissors I&#x27;ve ever bought. They&#x27;re solid, sharp, well made, and work perfectly for me. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 40 years (forty years, not a typo) and have gone through many types of barber scissors. So far, these are the best.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality of professional cutting scissors. Christmas gift that recipient loves and will use for grooming her Standard Poodle and ShiTzu pups. Shipped in time and good packaging. May order me a set!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> My younger brother wanted a very good pair of scissors to trim his beard with so I did some research on the net&lt;br /&gt;and decided these were just what was needed. He likes them a lot so all is well.</li>
    <li> I received the shears promptly and packaged well. They are very good quality shears. No problems what so ever. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> These are nice scissors. I bought them to replace and very old pair that had seen their better days. A little heavier than the old pair but I personally like that. Very sharp and they cut well. I use them to trim my hair and am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> These scissors are about medium in weight, not too light or too heavy.  They are very sturdy and well made.  I&#x27;m really glad that I bought them for cutting my hair.  I have extremely thick hair and because I cut my own hair I needed something that was easy to use and sharp, and these did the job.</li>
    <li> These shears are way too big and bulky. Not very sharp. Awkward and heavy feeling in your hand. You aren&#x27;t going to be able to manipulate  these very well unless you have giant hands.</li>
    <li> I temporary lost my other shearer&#x27;s and bought these instead. They worked absolutely wonderful. I personally recommend these shearer&#x27;s for good hair cutting</li>
    <li> High quality, good value and quite sharp, but a little heavy for my liking. I bought them for trimming my mustache and they are a little too thick for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Good price n delivered on time. I expected a little bit skinnier but work work fine so far.</li>
    <li> These are a little heavier in weight than my previous shears, but the balance is fine.  They are cutting well.  Not crazy about the stainless as it is dull looking but for the price, they are very adequate.</li>
    <li> I certainly did not know how expensive shears are until shopping around for them.  These shears are well constructed and do not feel cheap.  Perfect for the amateur/at home hair cutting.</li>
    <li> Sharp, not too heavy, the price is right. I cut my mom&#x27;s hair and she was happy! ! ! !</li>
    <li> Very good, solid and sharp scissors. Nice and long for good cuts. Very sturdy and well made. Good fit with my long fingers.</li>
    <li> These shears work well. They are very sharp and holes are big enough for my husbands hands. Good price for the quality.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, very nice to handle. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best hair shears I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist but these scissors are sharp and work well - definitely better than the ones I bought at the drug store.</li>
    <li> The product is very easy to use, very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll let you know when I&#x27;m able to get them out of the package. I need some kind of special tool to avoid hurting myself. Lots of things these days are packaged in sharp plastic in ways that can draw blood when you try to open them. I&#x27;m on a blood thinner and need to be careful.</li>
