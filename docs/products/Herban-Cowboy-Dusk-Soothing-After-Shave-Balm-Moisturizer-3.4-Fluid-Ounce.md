      <li>The product itself is good at being after shave.</li>
      <li>Good lotion for your face after you shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s organic, good for the skin, absorbs well - has the perfect consistency, leaves the skin hydrated and smooth and smells nice...not too strong...</li>
      <li>amazing moisturizer, it is lightweight and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Its a good product, nice manly scent and makes skin feel healthy after a shave.</li>
      <li>rather they kept the good formulas for their products and just charged a bit more.</li>
      <li>I gave this as a gift and the receiver liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be better used in the winter than the summer!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very good and not even very soothing.</li>
      <li>Great scent, smooth emollient and cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>Great natural product!!!!</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty good, kind of a cinnamon, nutmeg, and cucumber smell.  </li>
      <li>but,  has an interesting smell</li>
      <li>Not to satisfied with the ingredients.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but in a good way--like lotion for the face--and the scent is perfect.</li>
      <li>A smooth amazing smelling balm for soothing the skin.</li>
      <li>The list of ingredients reads more like a grocery list than a chemical lab, and it is not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my partner for Xmas, love the scent.</li>
      <li>I love the soothing healing effect it has, so the oiliness is negated.</li>
      <li>Works just as well and smells better.</li>
      <li>What more do you want?</li>
      <li>Refreshing change of pace from just splashing on alcohol.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>This aftershave balm--which is lightly scented to match my favorite toiletries--is the perfect antidote to the daily violence we perpetrate on our skin by shaving.</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s just me having higher expectations of aftershave scent lifetime, but it does moisturize and it does smell good.  </li>
      <li>Very effective at controlling razor burn, with a decent manly scent.</li>
      <li>Great product and smells amazing and reduces acne and red bumps</li>
      <li>This after shave lotion is excellent: smells masculine but not abrasive, absorbs into skin really well and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>so it went from a neutral cucumber smell to an extremely strong funky herbal perfumed scent.</li>
      <li>However, fragrance is strong, not chemical smell but strong for sensitive/allergic people.</li>
      <li>I discovered this product at a trendy organic store in New Bern, NC and liked it right away.</li>
      <li>so smooth and no rash after that.</li>
      <li>After the cheap cologne wears off, it smells like plastic.</li>
      <li>Smells good and does a decent job of soothing freshly shaved skin.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>I use this after my alcohol aftershave: one to disinfect and clean, one to soothe and moisturize.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much specially as i know what i am putting is organic and serves the purpose.</li>
      <li>Feels very good after a few minutes with this cream</li>
      <li>If you want natural, make your own using vodka (no kidding), coconut oil, splash of peppermint or whatever oil you like.</li>
      <li>Not bad the way I slather it on...</li>
      <li>/&gt;While pretty much every other after shave I own (7of them) is better in actual moisturizing quality, this one has one of the best scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Has a thin/medium thickness for a cream and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast and hassle free.</li>
      <li>None of the scent notes are overpowering like most men&#x27;s cologne scents, so it should not overpower your normal cologne if you choose to use some.    </li>
      <li>All and all, it is worth a shot.</li>
      <li>Feeling very gentle to skin, not harsh, easy to use as an after-shave balm.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Herban Cowboy also used to make the best deodorant I&#x27;d come across in ages, then they also changed the formula for that around the same time as they did the after shave balm, and now it&#x27;s extremely ineffective and does not keep you dry anywhere remotely close to how excellent the old formulation was.</li>
      <li>This balm moisturizer is very fluid and applies to the skin easily.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend likes it, it isn&#x27;t made of animal parts, and it makes your face feel pretty decent after shaving.</li>
      <li>I use Gold Bond lotion or just straight aloe vera gel now.  </li>
      <li>It is a gentle product on your face however it leaves a greasy feeling and smells like week-old gym socks.  </li>
      <li>Very greasy and buttery.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wonderful scent, but moisturizing quality leaves much to be desired.</li>
      <li>Tricky, but I like it and a few of my female friends have said it&#x27;s a pretty good scent for a man.</li>
      <li>Glad I listened to the other reviews.</li>
      <li>I am highly satisfied with its performance, comfort and long lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>he will love this gift says its his favorite and hard to find!!!</li>
      <li>I have their line of deodorants and they are paraben and other garbage free.</li>
      <li>The smell is heavy on cucumber and more masculine.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but like other Herban Cowboy products the aroma doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
      <li>He said it was a great product and had a subtle scent unlike other aftershave products.</li>
      <li>My skin is on the moderate side of things, but it really kicks it up a notch.  </li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite after shave balm for at least 3 or 4 years</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact I use this almost daily because I like it so much, even on days</li>
      <li>It goes on light and is not too heavy.</li>
      <li>I also dab a little bit in my hair for the full effect.  </li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Herban Cowboy products you are missing something special.</li>
      <li>I was a major fan but don&#x27;t buy anything from them anymore.</li>
      <li>what I typically do is after a shave I apply the more expensive and higher quality aftershave lotion</li>

    <li> Great product, this is a very good product and i will recomend it to everybody. so smooth and no rash after that. try it</li>

    <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I picked this up to complement the Herban Cowboy deoderant, and I have no complaints.  Smells good and does a decent job of soothing freshly shaved skin.</li>
    <li> The product itself is good at being after shave. Not to satisfied with the ingredients. I have their line of deodorants and they are paraben and other garbage free. This has phenoxyethanol, I understand it&#x27;s an organic chemical, but data on it is skeptical.</li>
    <li> Smells great and moisturizes well with out a bunch of chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce.  Best after shave I have found.</li>
    <li> This aftershave balm--which is lightly scented to match my favorite toiletries--is the perfect antidote to the daily violence we perpetrate on our skin by shaving. It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but in a good way--like lotion for the face--and the scent is perfect. Your face will appreciate it, both at night and in the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has a beard but shaves his neck. He said it was a great product and had a subtle scent unlike other aftershave products.</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy moisturizing balm! I&#x27;m a fan to a point. My only gripe with this product is that it leaves my face feeling somewhat oily. I do realize that oiliness is a product of skin type and weather. My skin is on the moderate side of things, but it really kicks it up a notch.  I love the soothing healing effect it has, so the oiliness is negated. I&#x27;m sure it will be better used in the winter than the summer!</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and easily.  Only takes a little.  No fragrance.  No sting and skin feels good.  What more do you want?</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars, but the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last long enough (done within an hour).  Maybe that&#x27;s just me having higher expectations of aftershave scent lifetime, but it does moisturize and it does smell good.  I also dab a little bit in my hair for the full effect.  I do recommend using conservatively because it is more expensive -- and 3.5 oz certainly won&#x27;t last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Very effective at controlling razor burn, with a decent manly scent. The list of ingredients reads more like a grocery list than a chemical lab, and it is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite after shave balm for at least 3 or 4 years but then about a year ago they changed the formula and doubled or tripled the parfum ratio so it went from a neutral cucumber smell to an extremely strong funky herbal perfumed scent. I used the last tube of the reformulated balm and have not and will not buy it again. I&#x27;ve switched to Aveeno Men&#x27;s which is unscented and also rated low on EWG&#x27;s toxicity scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herban Cowboy also used to make the best deodorant I&#x27;d come across in ages, then they also changed the formula for that around the same time as they did the after shave balm, and now it&#x27;s extremely ineffective and does not keep you dry anywhere remotely close to how excellent the old formulation was. Maybe they did it to shave costs, but I would have rather they kept the good formulas for their products and just charged a bit more. I was a major fan but don&#x27;t buy anything from them anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic, good for the skin, absorbs well - has the perfect consistency, leaves the skin hydrated and smooth and smells nice...not too strong...The only con is that after a while (once you put it on the skin) the smell turnes weird, strange &amp;#34;after-smell&amp;#34;...almost to the point that you want to wash it off your face... If it wasn&#x27;t for the smell it would be a PERFECT after shave!</li>

As a matter of fact I use this almost daily because I like it so much, even on days I don’t shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful scent, but moisturizing quality leaves much to be desired.</li>
    <li> It is a gentle product on your face however it leaves a greasy feeling and smells like week-old gym socks.  Have to wash it off after an hour or so since the smell is so bad.  I use Gold Bond lotion or just straight aloe vera gel now.  Works just as well and smells better.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this. But I don&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t smell very good and not even very soothing. If you want natural, make your own using vodka (no kidding), coconut oil, splash of peppermint or whatever oil you like.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Herban Cowboy products you are missing something special.</li>
    <li> Feeling very gentle to skin, not harsh, easy to use as an after-shave balm. However, fragrance is strong, not chemical smell but strong for sensitive/allergic people.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot compared to my alcohol based aftershave.  No burn, it does go on quite oiley, so use a little or its gonna stay on you all day. I use this after my alcohol aftershave: one to disinfect and clean, one to soothe and moisturize.  The smell is pretty good, kind of a cinnamon, nutmeg, and cucumber smell.  Tricky, but I like it and a few of my female friends have said it&#x27;s a pretty good scent for a man. All and all, it is worth a shot.</li>
    <li> The smell is heavy on cucumber and more masculine. I like it very much specially as i know what i am putting is organic and serves the purpose. I would recommend this over the non organic ones as it almost the same price point. Shipping was very fast and hassle free.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my partner for Xmas, love the scent. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Refreshing change of pace from just splashing on alcohol. You need a very small amount. Smells good, but like other Herban Cowboy products the aroma doesn&#x27;t last a long time. I believe it means they don&#x27;t use a lot of perfumes, not sure if that is a plus or a minus, you be the judge. Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> This has been my daily face moisturizer for years. It goes on light and is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Makes your face sticky.</li>
    <li> Man, it&#x27;s just horrible. After the cheap cologne wears off, it smells like plastic. Smells like your grandpas 70&#x27;s Cadillac, but without the class.</li>
    <li> Great product and smells amazing and reduces acne and red bumps</li>
    <li> Great scent, smooth emollient and cruelty free.  This balm moisturizer is very fluid and applies to the skin easily.  I am highly satisfied with its performance, comfort and long lasting scent.  I combine this balm with the same brand name soap, cologne and antiperspirant,</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes it, it isn&#x27;t made of animal parts, and it makes your face feel pretty decent after shaving. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This after shave lotion is excellent: smells masculine but not abrasive, absorbs into skin really well and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. It&#x27;s the only lotion I use.</li>
    <li> Glad I listened to the other reviews. Its a good product, nice manly scent and makes skin feel healthy after a shave. This is a would buy again and again product.</li>
    <li> Great natural product!!!! amazing moisturizer, it is lightweight and non-greasy. My skin feels cleaned and refreshed after using it. No residues left.</li>
    <li> Great after shave. Feels very good after a few minutes with this cream</li>
    <li> I have tried all the products out there. I discovered this product at a trendy organic store in New Bern, NC and liked it right away. I could only find it at the one store however. Then I found it on Amazon &amp; I order it all the time. It may seem expensive at first glance, but it goes a long way. I usually go through two of them a year. Not bad the way I slather it on...</li>
    <li> I like everything about this product! Unfortunately it made my husband&#x27;s skin blotchy/rashy, so he can&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
    <li> You could get the same results by smearing a stick of butter on your face.  Very greasy and buttery.</li>
