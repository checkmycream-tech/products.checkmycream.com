      <li>and the fragance is really sweet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for many years and know when I get the real one.  </li>
      <li>Good lasting power too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>as it is just more mature than the cheap, sweet, candy-smelling stuff found at the drug store that I was used to wearing.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind she will wear</li>
      <li>I had to find a different product that I liked.</li>
      <li>This item does not smell right.  </li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no other better perfume for me.</li>
      <li>this one thing about a marriage is to keep your partner happy and she will make you happy,something as simple as that and treat her the way you would want to be treated that&#x27;s the secret to happiness because it has worked for me all these years.</li>
      <li>It has a very soft fragrance that is not overpowering but very fresh and feminine.</li>
      <li>Realities (new) is nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and can only find it on Amazon and you can not beat the price</li>
      <li>This has brought back memories and I am completely satisfied with both the price and prompt delivery.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It is not like the first bottle i had, guess my smeller is gone...</li>
      <li>I really wish they would reconsider this!</li>
      <li>Realities deserves to be better known, and at it&#x27;s current price, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Realities (new) is sisters with LC Bora Bora, LC Liz &amp; Sweet Desire.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light and fresh and big ...</li>
      <li>Pretty much disappeared after spraying it on.  </li>
      <li>It almost smells like pure alcohol.  </li>
      <li>Got it quickly, thanks</li>
      <li>fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It looks like a knock off, but my wife says it smells just like the real one</li>
      <li>I realized it&#x27;s not so much \\&quot;matronly\\&quot;</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>How does this go from so reasonably priced to an untouchable cost??</li>
      <li>And as it fades the smell  becomes even better unlike other perfumes which smells like alcohol as it fades away</li>
      <li>Customs confiscated it on the way back from Grand Cayman, so I promised myself I would get the big bottle when I found it again.  </li>
      <li>It is my new signature scent.</li>
      <li>I have been using &amp;#34;Realities&amp;#34;  by Liz C. for the past 10 years, and have always been pleased with ordering from Amazon....but not this bottle.  </li>
      <li>previously wore LC Realities (original).</li>
      <li>Now I have to order another bottle from a different company and hope I get a real one.</li>
      <li>Soft smell.</li>
      <li>My husband surprised me because I thought it was off the market.</li>
      <li>and it does not smell anywhere close to the soft sultry warmth of Realities by Realities.</li>
      <li>I love how it&#x27;s not heavy flowery stuff for grannies or weird sickly sweet girly stuff targeted towards teen girls.</li>
      <li>The white florals are a bit too cloying but they tame quickly.</li>
      <li>Much better than what I thought I was getting (the Liz Claiborne Realities) when I happened to find the small pink package at TJ Maxx for $12 last summer, just shopping for last-minute things to bring on vacation.  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic and subtle but lasts for hours&lt;br /</li>
      <li>When I first smelled this scent, I thought it might be a little to \\&quot;motherly\\&quot; for someone my age (21 or so at the time).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I get so many compliments!!</li>
    <li> I would defenetlty give it a 5 star. But after i used it my 3rd time the bottle pump got damaged and went inside the perfume bottle i can&#x27;t spray it anymore poor manufacturing quality.</li>
    <li> It looks like a knock off, but my wife says it smells just like the real one</li>
    <li> beware! the color is way off( orange perfume instead of pink) smell is ok- a bit off but is acceptable.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  I use it every day so I need to buy it often.&lt;br /&gt;It is very nice to be able to get it at the same site for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I buy 2 at a time so I don&#x27;t have to do it as often but I am so thankful&lt;br /&gt;that I can get it so easily without leaving my home.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  No issues.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed.  This is fake perfume!!! I have been wearing this for years and this is not it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous!  Much better than what I thought I was getting (the Liz Claiborne Realities) when I happened to find the small pink package at TJ Maxx for $12 last summer, just shopping for last-minute things to bring on vacation.  Customs confiscated it on the way back from Grand Cayman, so I promised myself I would get the big bottle when I found it again.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price - way better than drugstore prices.</li>
    <li> This item does not smell right.  I have purchased this before and was finishing up my last bit in the last bottle.  Opened up this bottle just recently and there is no comparison in fragrance.  It almost smells like pure alcohol.  I would not recommend it.  Although I guess something could have happened during shipping.  I guess I cannot return it because of the time frame.  I sure wish I would have opened it when I first received it.</li>
    <li> people can only smell it when they are up under you otherwise, no sign of wearing anything .. it&#x27;s light and fresh and big ...</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Smells great - I have had this scent before and always liked it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume right now. I wera it everday. It has a very soft fragrance that is not overpowering but very fresh and feminine. It is my new signature scent. Great value---my spouse paid much more at the mall!</li>
    <li> this one thing about a marriage is to keep your partner happy and she will make you happy,something as simple as that and treat her the way you would want to be treated that&#x27;s the secret to happiness because it has worked for me all these years.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for years. I receive compliments on the smell of it all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and hope I never have to change what I use.</li>
    <li> scent is weak and doesn&#x27;t smell like original&lt;br /&gt;i won&#x27;t purchase again....</li>
    <li> My all time favorite cologne. Been wearing it for years. My husband surprised me because I thought it was off the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for many years and know when I get the real one.  I made the mistake a few years ago paying a cheaper price and got a fake perfume where the smell barely lasted.  Pretty much disappeared after spraying it on.  So because of that I buy the $50-$70 range.  With that being said I paid $70 for this one and was extremely disappointed that I ended up with a fake one.  Perfume does not last at all.  Now I have to order another bottle from a different company and hope I get a real one.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT. TEMPTED TO GET ANOTHER BOTTLE.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the scent of this particular bottle of a perfume. I have been using &amp;#34;Realities&amp;#34;  by Liz C. for the past 10 years, and have always been pleased with ordering from Amazon....but not this bottle.  The scent is not lasting, and not quite the same smell...I don&#x27;t know why??</li>
    <li> Realities ... \\&quot;make everyday a lasting memory.\\&quot; The tag line is so cliche, but the juice and bottle are anything but. At the top, citrus. Then I get peonies &amp; orchid which are lovely. The white florals are a bit too cloying but they tame quickly. @nyoka describes Realities as \\&quot;the scent of angels,\\&quot; and she&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s sweet yet clear at the top, perfect when you want to wear a pretty dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me, Realities is all about the base. After the florals dry, Realities wears like a woody, and the sandalwood, musk and vanilla are wonderful on my skin. It wears like Herve Leger, one of my favorites. Yup, Realities is a dead-ringer for Herve Leger at the drydown. Good lasting power too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle &amp; packaging are stunning  beautifully in their simplicity. Realities deserves to be better known, and at it&#x27;s current price, it&#x27;s a bargain. I&#x27;d easily choose Realities over almost any popular scent on the market today. The body products are very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously wore LC Realities (original). Realities (new) is nothing like the original. Realities (new) is sisters with LC Bora Bora, LC Liz &amp; Sweet Desire. If you like one, odds are you&#x27;ll like another. The share qualities but are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 5 of 5</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for over 10 years.  It works well with my body chemistry.  I absolutely love the way it smells on me. However, the last 2 years it&#x27;s been harder and harder to get it anywhere.  I guess Liz Claiborne has decided to stop making it for some reason.  I really wish they would reconsider this!</li>
    <li> This perfume is just as perfect as I was I remembered.  I could not find any any retail stores. Soft smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites.  I am very pleased with the price and delivery.</li>
    <li> Love it and was sent quickly.</li>
    <li> Love love this perfume. It&#x27;s light and clean</li>
    <li> I LOVE this fragrance!!!! One of my ALL TIME FAVORITES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was fast delivery. Was exactly what I ordered. I have absolutely no complaints. I would recommend this seller, as well as use them again!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and can only find it on Amazon and you can not beat the price</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and great price</li>
    <li> Got it quickly, thanks</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. I will purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. But be careful bc the same bottle only pink is realities by liz claiborne and it does not smell anywhere close to the soft sultry warmth of Realities by Realities. It is fantastic and subtle but lasts for hours&lt;br /&gt; I ordered a bottle and the very next day ordered a gift set so I could layer my fragrance. Love love love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This has been my perfume for 2 years already! I love it! There&#x27;s no other better perfume for me. THe only one that may compete with this one would be Cashmere by Donna Karen. It last long and the fragance is really sweet. And as it fades the smell  becomes even better unlike other perfumes which smells like alcohol as it fades away</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great value for this size.</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed with the price of this perfume. I bought it for the first time 20 years ago and it became so expensive I had to find a different product that I liked. My body chemistry is harder to match with different scents. This has brought back memories and I am completely satisfied with both the price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> great price love this perfume</li>
    <li> My wife loves it...thanks</li>
    <li> When I first smelled this scent, I thought it might be a little to \\&quot;motherly\\&quot; for someone my age (21 or so at the time). I had a sample size bottle of it, though, and it really grew on me after I wore it a few times. I realized it&#x27;s not so much \\&quot;matronly\\&quot; as it is just more mature than the cheap, sweet, candy-smelling stuff found at the drug store that I was used to wearing. It eventually became my \\&quot;trademark\\&quot; scent that I wear every day for every season. I love how it&#x27;s not heavy flowery stuff for grannies or weird sickly sweet girly stuff targeted towards teen girls. It&#x27;s somewhere in the middle with orchids, vanilla and a little amber and it&#x27;s not overpowering at all. It&#x27;s lovely! I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and the price!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I get so many compliments when I wear it. This is my perfume for life.</li>
    <li> excellent! good price fast delivery</li>
    <li> This gets one star because of the cost, over $100 increase!!! How does this go from so reasonably priced to an untouchable cost??</li>
    <li> Perfect - great price and on time delivery!! Will buy again :)</li>
    <li> My grandmother loves this parfum.  This is the only kind she will wear and I actually think it smells great too.  I wouldnt wear it though, it&#x27;s definitely for my Grandma!</li>
    <li> It is not like the first bottle i had, guess my smeller is gone...</li>
</ol>
