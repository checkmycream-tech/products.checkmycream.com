      <li>It worked perfectly!</li>
      <li>Is it best to pre-lighten?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>But my hair looks just great.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with the outcome</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the way it makes my sprinkling of greys disappear.</li>
      <li>The directions in the box weren&#x27;t that great.  </li>
      <li>Great color.  </li>
      <li>We followed the package instructions to the letter to make sure we got the best results.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the results, even if the process is a lot more intensive than what I have been used to.  </li>
      <li>I loved the color, and was hooked.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s good advice on the instruction sheet.</li>
      <li>Light Mountain henna dye is wonderful and I&#x27;ve been using it for six or seven months now.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be in the bathroom rinsing this out of your hair for a good hour</li>
      <li>I then make like a paranoid and give myself a good ol&#x27; aluminum foil hat to trap heat and help the hair color bake in.</li>
      <li>wait 3-5 minutes and wipe it off and have orange skin your good to go, if not i would wait longer.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and have always been happy with the results.</li>
      <li>This is a good, really effective henna that you can customize to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If this took so well on my hair, I would think it would take even more on lighter hair!</li>
      <li>how healthy my hair looks all the time, even by hair dressers!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite color!  </li>
      <li>If this took so well on my hair, I would think it would take even more on lighter hair!</li>
      <li>Love the color though!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dye my hair if it weren&#x27;t for henna, and I really do love it and the element of change it adds to my life!</li>
      <li>The color is really nice</li>
      <li>This works just as well, nice color and conditioner.</li>
      <li>it looks really nice.  </li>
      <li>so I can get a nice auburn rather than just a cinnamon brown.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and already in powder form</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s inexpensive disposable plastic shower caps that hold the head more effectively.</li>
      <li>For the price, you can definitely afford to experiment on your own for your own perfect henna cocktail.</li>
      <li>But I am having fun and my hair looks great.  </li>
      <li>this shade of bright red will just add a reddish tint and beautiful shine.  </li>
      <li>It restores the shine and luster to my hair, it makes it softer and I have never had any damage of any kind from using it as it is a 100% chemical free product.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you give yourself plenty of time.</li>
      <li>However, my guess would be that on lighter hair, that orange my be more prevalent than anyone would desire.</li>
      <li>Think of it more like a mud mask that stains your hair.</li>
      <li>so I could better manage what hair I covered</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply vaseline around your hairline and wash up promptly after applying to prevent staining of your countertops, sink and flooring.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you have a bottle of distilled water on hand.</li>
      <li>, one more thing you should know.</li>
      <li>Be sure you are setting aside plenty of time to allow the product to work.</li>
      <li>I have been using this brand of henna for 10 years, and I get many compliments on my hair.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something more drastic.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using light mountain for about a year and still loving it.</li>
      <li>However, my guess would be that on lighter hair, that orange my be more prevalent than anyone would desire.</li>
      <li>It came out much more even then</li>
      <li>If it were shaped like a hood it would be more practical.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so my guess is I am going to apply it a couple more times as my hair lightens.</li>
      <li>my hair for years and love this product.  </li>
      <li>okay?</li>
      <li>I love the results and the condition of my hair is much MUCH better than chemichal dye results could ever be</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>And I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>that is what I did many year&#x27;s ago</li>
      <li>I must say that henna is an interesting experience.</li>
      <li>Love the product, wouldn&#x27;t buy from these guys again.</li>
      <li>, one more thing you should know.</li>
      <li>I have had many people ask me about using Henna</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>Make sure you give yourself plenty of time.</li>
      <li>This does also have the benefit of you being able to blast it with the hair dryer now and then (thru the plastic wrap) to increase the heat.</li>
      <li>I love henna.</li>
      <li>Just layer your baked potato attire over top of the plastic.</li>
      <li>makes it a slightly better process.</li>
      <li>The result was fabulous!</li>
      <li>I would recommend looking up directions from a more reputable source like mehandi, though.  </li>
      <li>This product was my first foray into henna, and I had good results with it.  </li>
      <li>I am a medium brown to dark brown with gray highlights and I don&#x27;t need to leave it in my hair more than 10 to 15 minutes to give my gray hair a beautiful tinge of strawberry blond color (or leave it in for an hour for a bright coppery (on gray)/auburn (on brown) color).</li>
      <li>This is a great starter kit for people new to this process.</li>
      <li>: I found a better recipe with trial and error and now can apply fairly easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure these are factory defects that didn&#x27;t pass quality inspection; I&#x27;d appreciate them being sold a bit more cheaply if that&#x27;s the case.</li>
      <li>Great natural product!</li>
      <li>agree it is so good to have it in the package.&lt;br /&gt;The picture on the box does not support the exotic tone and shade you get with this Light montain Bright red!</li>
      <li>I love Light Mountain henna.</li>
      <li>Great all natural product.</li>
      <li>I have been coloring my hair for many years, and this is the first product I can honestly say I enjoy using.</li>
      <li>It is not even close to bright red,or any kind of red.</li>
      <li>I really love the color I get from the henna, and the fact that its natural and good for my hair.</li>
      <li>Every time I use this my hair has amazing shine, great body, soft texture, and a lovely natural auburn color!</li>
      <li>The color is a beautiful red.</li>
      <li>Super cheap &amp; easy, and my hair is always soft &amp; shines so beautifully in the sun.</li>
      <li>hair was super shiny!</li>
      <li>I feel free free free.</li>
      <li>I love the bright red color and I get compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
      <li>I wish i had a better idea on what i was ordering with the &#x27;bright red&#x27; color.</li>
      <li>Yes henna is messy but for those of us who refuse to use chemicals, it is the best way to go.  </li>
      <li>so get comfortable.</li>
      <li>Overall, though, I think this product is great for people wanting to try henna without investing a lot.</li>
      <li>But the result is fantastic and enduring.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But the result is fantastic and enduring.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for covering grey, and also safe to use while pregnant.</li>
      <li>The smell was good, it smelled like grass clippings to me which is not what I usually associate with henna but still pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I was using the light red, and love it!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this color yet, but am so excited to.  I have light brown hair in the summer with red highlights and I have medium to dark brown hair in the winter.  I was using the light red, and love it!!  I&#x27;m excited to go a little more red.&lt;br /&gt;Some tips!:&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest putting an all-natural lip balm or something thicker than coconut oil or petroleum jelly around your ears and hairline. This stains badly on hands, towels, skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use dark, day old reheated coffee instead of water, any flavor of yogurt without fruit in it, at least one egg, and plenty of nutmeg and cinnamon.  This helps with the organic hay-like smell A LOT.  I use no straight water.&lt;br /&gt;I use the full time (or more) of set time after mixing, before applying, and I usually use at least one hour with the dye in.&lt;br /&gt;I use hair-dryer heat at the very beginning, middle, and end of my setting time.&lt;br /&gt;This is not just a hair-dye, it is a clay mask treatment and makes your hair healthier!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, your hair will feel gritty and dry after your first rinse, and I would use A LOT of TRULY ALL NATURAL conditioner, but after one or two washes, or even drying your hair after the first rinse, the grit and dry is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;WHY NOT USE AN ALL NATURAL PRODUCT?? FORGET all the chemically or supposedly oil-based dyes!&lt;br /&gt;In the first couple of days, the light red was BRIGHT and a bit orange-ish on my brown hair, but still desirable!&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days, most people were asking me if it was my natural hair color.  Keep in mind this is all-natural, so roots are not an issue!  It fades as your hair grows out.&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT! YOU WILL BE HAPPY!</li>
    <li> I have had many people ask me about using Henna so I thought that I would write a review.  I am 44 now and have been using this same product for 10+ years.  My normal hair color is a very dark brown to almost black with an auburn highlight but in my early 30&#x27;s I started turning prematurely grey.  This shade of henna is perfect for my dark hair and the more grey it turns naturally, the more red it gets with the henna which I really like.  It restores the shine and luster to my hair, it makes it softer and I have never had any damage of any kind from using it as it is a 100% chemical free product.  Yes henna is messy but for those of us who refuse to use chemicals, it is the best way to go.  I normally mix mine with one egg and sometimes a bit of paprika but using it all by itself will work wonders also.  I would like to add that with very dark hair this shade of bright red will just add a reddish tint and beautiful shine.  Naturally if your hair is a lighter shade or if there is any grey in it, those strands will turn a deep red.  I suggest as most of the other ladies on here do, to do a strand test first.  I normally treat my hair with one box every 12 weeks because I have very long hair and I normally wash it only twice a week.  I apply it to my hair while wearing latex gloves and then cover it with a shower cap for two to three hours.  Something else that I have noticed is that gals who use chemical hair colors a lot of times have a strange bluish hue to their hair when it is in direct bright light.  With henna, the glow is very natural and not fake looking.  I hope that this helps some of you out!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for many years, and this is the first product I can honestly say I enjoy using. I love the results and the condition of my hair is much MUCH better than chemichal dye results could ever be</li>
    <li> wow i really like this stuff I mixed mine with equal parts cassia because I like more of a natural orangey ginger color. and wow just wow! my hair is soooo beautiful. turned out exactly as i wanted. bright ginger hair, gotten so many complements and its fooled a lot of people into thinking I naturally have red hair. It is bit of a pain to apply (more on that later) but to me its soo worth it. and it lasts so long I&#x27;ve had it in for about a month and normally with red dye my color would be gone and ready for another dye by now but not this stuff. you do have to wait maybe 2-3 days for the true color to show up. i remember looking in the mirror when i finished and thinking \\&quot;its nice but its kinda dark and not as vibrant as I wanted\\&quot; but a few days later i noticed it brightened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for first timers and what to expect when applying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok it looks like a lot of people had issues with this as the directions are kinda vague.&lt;br /&gt;you should have clean-ish hair, it doesn&#x27;t have to be newly shampooed but if you have products in I would suggest washing that out. as for wet or dry I would opt for dry or damp as wet might dilute your henna. also do not strip/bleach your hair then henna it right after. you will most likely end up with primary colors if you do that. If you did just bleach your hair (and its white or super blond) give it a week and dye it a mid blond - mid brown (depending how bright, lighter hair will give you brighter hair). also i noticed in the directions it said add water, and let it sit for a few hours to cure. now i found this odd most henna needs a acid to develop like tea or lemon juice. so if you tried this and got meh results, try swapping the water for strong tea or half water half lemon juice. also let it sit a bit longer (i let mine sit for 24 hours) if you put a bit on your skin wait 3-5 minutes and wipe it off and have orange skin your good to go, if not i would wait longer. speaking of turning orange - gloves are a must!!!also put Vaseline on your ears neck face. (i used to skip this when i dyed my hair, and that&#x27;s not ok with this) also YOU WILL MAKE A MESS it is unavoidable just put newspaper down or go outside. also i hope you like feeling like swimming in swap water because that&#x27;s what you get when you rinse it out. a swamp in your bathroom. also don&#x27;t wash your hair with shampoo, get yourself a family sized bottle of conditioner (your probably gonna use it all) and \\&quot;wash\\&quot; your hair with that(over and over). and you&#x27;ll be in the bathroom rinsing this out of your hair for a good hour so get comfortable.</li>
    <li> I decided I needed a change and went to the store looking for Henna.  A friend had wanted to Henna my hair for years.  My hair at the time was \\&quot;dirty blond\\&quot; gone grey.  The Henna boxes say not to use on grey, but I ignored.  When I was buying the Henna I was trying to decide between the Red and Bright Red.  With a lot of support from the clerk, I bought the Bright Red.  And I am glad I did.  My hair looks so beautiful.  It is a rich bright red!  I do have to repeat Henna every 2-3 weeks or my roots start to show - I hate to see roots.  But my hair looks just great.  Lots of men notice - I might add.  My brother-in-law said a woman my age should not be doing this to her hair (almost 60).  But I am having fun and my hair looks great.  Also with Henna it seems like my hair is getting healthier and healthier with each Henna application.  It is like putting mud all over your head and it comes out a beautiful color.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I would disagree with the reviewer before me; this is a BRIGHT red!!!  I previously used Light Mountain Light Red with yielded a mostly orange cast on my dark blonde/light brown hair - I wanted more of a red but without adding darkness, and this fit the bill!  I followed the directions to the T - I think time is really the key to making a strong, strong color using LM.  I let it cure for an hour and half and then wore it for almost two hours, heating intermittently.  The color is, of course, crazy-bright for the first 2-3 washes.  After that it mellows and within 2 weeks I get a color that could have potentially grown out of my head...which is or isn&#x27;t a good thing, depending on what you&#x27;re into - I like it both ways, I enjoy the crazy, Manic Panic-esque drama of the first few days, but then the natural cast works well for my low-key lifestyle.  I love the smell henna but added about a teaspoon of ginger and nutmeg as suggested this time around but didn&#x27;t really smell either.  And, of course, the best selling point of LM henna is that it is 100% organic botanicals so, while I&#x27;m having fun dying my hair crimson, I&#x27;m not also concentrating crazy chemicals in my body.  I wouldn&#x27;t dye my hair if it weren&#x27;t for henna, and I really do love it and the element of change it adds to my life!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have always been happy with the results. Also, there are plastic gloves and a plastic cover for your hair, which makes the process much easier and cleaner.  I also really like the service that ships this product on a timetable of my choosing, at a discounted rate.  This makes things so much easier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of henna for 10 years, and I get many compliments on my hair. I have dirty blond hair, and the bright red dyes my hair to a very natural looking medium red. It is a messy process, but very well worth it. I only keep the henna on for about 2 hours to get the desired effect.</li>
    <li> I have natural auburn hair and I wanted to pipe up the red a little. I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair before so this was quite an experiment.  This product was not easy to apply and quite messy but the results are worth it! I mixed batch with boiling water and let it sit for about an hour. I applied it to my hair (it took probably 20 minutes or so) and let it sit for 45 minutes before I rinsed with conditioner. The smell stuck around for about 3 washes. It isn&#x27;t a horrible smell, but is not exactly beautiful either.  The color is really nice and I feel like the texture of my hair has changed quite a bit. I can not get over how shiny it is. Next time I am thinking about mixing the color with conditioner or cocoa butter so that it sticks to the hair a little better. The mixture is quite flaky and falls off as your applying it. I was really worried that I was not applying it evenly enough.  Also, the bright red means that this product is 100% henna. I think the others are mixtures of henna with other natural dyes.</li>
    <li> It is a little messy but natural. I have dark brown hair and it doesn&#x27;t change much your natural color but gives it a nice shine and in the sun it is very red!! so my guess is I am going to apply it a couple more times as my hair lightens. only reason why it I gave it 4 stars the smell might not be for everyone and stays a while even after washing.</li>
    <li> Great color.  I did three different treatments with the same package and the color has slowly faded over the course of 50 washes or so.</li>
    <li> Great all natural product. Definitely is an adjustment from typical box or salon store dyes. It is definitely very messy and time consuming so be prepared and have patience! My hair faded quickly and I was stripping all the nutrients from my hair with harsh chemicals so decided to try this out. Picture is from a day after the dye so I think color is still developing and may continue to do so over next couple days. I cured the henna for 3 hrs then left the dye on for 3. I actually applied with dry hair so I could better manage what hair I covered but you can also apply wet. My ends were really stripped and upon wash out they looked orange but now seem to be a bit more red than yesterday. Next time I might wait another hour for my ends to take. Love the color though! It came out much more even then I expected as my hair was about 5 different shades of red orange brown and purple beforehand. Will be using this product again!</li>
    <li> I was on the IR7 merry go round. Washing my hair in ice cold water to fight fade. Dying and demi permanent dying all the time. Then as a Hail Mary I tried This Henna. Yes it does smell like hay, Yes it is kinda messy, and when you rinse your hair out the first time your hair feels crazy fried. BUT the second rinse with shampoo its like your hair becomes silk. I am on my second time coloring. It has changed my life. I am enjoying hot showers again. I have NO FADE. I get compliments on my hair all the time. I feel free free free.</li>
    <li> I received the henna and used it that night and I got a bright carroty red, more of a natural red than bright screaming stop sign red.  The smell was good, it smelled like grass clippings to me which is not what I usually associate with henna but still pleasant.  I have a sneaking suspicion that it is adulterated in some way, when applying my skin was immediately stained bright orange after only a few seconds of exposure...henna shouldn&#x27;t begin to stain for considerably longer than that.  In addition the color never deepened (as per usual with henna) over the following days despite exposure to heat and sunlight.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the feel of my hair afterwards but I normally have very soft hair anyway so I can&#x27;t really speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness as a conditioner.  All in all though if you&#x27;re looking for a natural looking bright red color without using chemicals you could do worse than this product, just wish they were a little more forthcoming about the actual ingredients.</li>
    <li> I started out with henna by buying a Light Mountain kit at Whole Foods.  I loved the color, and was hooked.  Mixed to a yogurt-like consistency, this kit is enough for medium length hair.  The kit comes with a pair of gloves and a plastic hair cover.  I&#x27;d recommend using plastic wrap to cover your hair instead, since the included cap doesn&#x27;t really hold anything in. The bright red makes my light brown hair a beautiful, shiny red color.  It isn&#x27;t a color you&#x27;d find in nature, but it isn&#x27;t Manic Panic red.  Henna helps tame my unruly hair, as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now tried both the Red and Bright Red. Honestly the Red one seemed to make my hair brighter.  I love the overall color, though i&#x27;ve dyed my hair with this product several times and it always turns out burnt orange.  I love the way it turns out and have been dying my hair strictly with light mountain red hair color for the past year now but i feel obligated to share that i&#x27;ve never gotten a red color (and yes i follow the directions to a t).  Also i find that i need to dye my roots every other week because my hair has been growing super fast since switching over to henna instead of chemical dyes.</li>
    <li> This is the last time I bought this product! I have had enough! I like the color, when it works! I have been using hanna for over 20 years and know how to mix it, etc.  But this product is so inconsistent! One box works another doesn&#x27;t. I mix it exactly the same way every time but get zero result 50% of the time. Worst hanna I ever used!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair color I use and have used for the last 5+ years. I love it. The color is vibrant, the application easy, and the product is constant from purchase to purchase which isn&#x27;t always the case with henna. It&#x27;s great for covering grey, and also safe to use while pregnant. Also it looks natural so most of the time people have no idea I color my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using all types of red henna for about 20 years, and I love this brand and color. This kit comes with gloves and a plastic wrap for hair, which is really helpful as I never seem to have either in the around when I do my hair. I have very dark brown hair with a few whites, and this is my favorite shade of red- it has a bit of a coppery overtone which looks shiny and warm on dark hair. I&#x27;ve never used a chemical dye and never would- henna might be messy, but it&#x27;s safe to apply as often as you need, and just makes hair shinier and healthier after each application. I get compliments my color and how healthy my hair looks all the time, even by hair dressers!  One tip is to mix henna with lemon juice (just buy a big bottle) and let it sit overnight. The acid helps release the red pigments in the henna. Mix it so it&#x27;s quite wet and soupy, then leave it in for 2-3 hours.  Also, henna will temporarily stain white tubs and sinks, but a little scrubbing with bleach gets it right out.</li>
    <li> I was a complete newbie to henna for hair color (didn&#x27;t even know it was an option). I also don&#x27;t dye my hair often, anymore, but had died my hair red in October and decided to keep it up. Red chemical hair color doesn&#x27;t last long in my hair and i read that henna retains its color for quite some time. I was skeptical, but tried it anyhow. I was wrong. It did fade, slightly, but my hair is a beautiful, shiny, auburn color and i love it--it&#x27;s also lasted far longer than any chemically treated dye job has (even done by a professional). A few notes--I wish i had a better idea on what i was ordering with the &#x27;bright red&#x27; color. I have dark brown, natural hair, so my finished look is a reddish-auburn. I think the &#x27;red&#x27; would&#x27;ve actually looked more &#x27;red&#x27; than the &#x27;bright red&#x27;.  I didn&#x27;t follow their directions, but looked up some instructions on how to use henna (longer curing time than they suggest--and had it in my hair for four hours--which isn&#x27;t as bad as it sounds, it&#x27;s muddy, and thick, so it really sticks on your head, and just wrap it in plastic and you can go about your business--I cleaned my house and did a few other indoor chores while it worked). This is a great starter kit for people new to this process.</li>
    <li> In your red hair....Amazing shades ! Everybody asks me which color is that?&lt;br /&gt;Which brand?&lt;br /&gt;A little suggestion: the bag to put on your head to wait for the color to mature is a great idea but diifcult to close so, you need to find another plastic to wrap around and keep the henna from running down...If it were shaped like a hood it would be more practical.&lt;br /&gt;I agree it is so good to have it in the package.&lt;br /&gt;The picture on the box does not support the exotic tone and shade you get with this Light montain Bright red!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;natural redhead&amp;#34; for 7 years, after my chemical red dyes (and even the so-called natural hair dyes in health food stores) were giving me really bad split ends. I love henna. I come back to this brand all the time. Super cheap &amp; easy, and my hair is always soft &amp; shines so beautifully in the sun.</li>
    <li> I have been using this color for years.It&#x27;s an all natural plant based product.This does not wash out it grows out.I love the bright red color and I get compliments on my hair all the time.The color is a beautiful red.If you color your hair with a metal based hair color you cannot use henna you would have to wait til that color grows out first that is what I did many year&#x27;s ago and I never went back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Henna for over a year now and I absolutely love it. Just got my 6 boxes of it today in the mail, I&#x27;m set for another half year. It&#x27;s very easy to use and already in powder form so there&#x27;s no grating it down to be able to mix it.</li>
    <li> This product was my first foray into henna, and I had good results with it.  I would recommend looking up directions from a more reputable source like mehandi, though.  The directions in the box weren&#x27;t that great.  Now that I&#x27;ve gotten more experience with henna, though, I plan on looking into higher quality products, such as can be found through mehandi.  Overall, though, I think this product is great for people wanting to try henna without investing a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dye for years now and I really like the result. You have to let the dye sit in your hair for at least 40 minutes to obtain some kind of the color and it really is VIBRANT the first few days. After a couple washes it looks like a more natural hair color which I love. People who say they do not get the BRIGHT red hair color they want need to let it cure, or sit longer in their head (also applying heat here and there helps), it&#x27;s henna so without all those chemicals, dying hair will take a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> This product did not cover my hair, I admit I have a lot of grey. This is nit te product for m</li>
    <li> I really love the color I get from the henna, and the fact that its natural and good for my hair. I used this when I was growing my hair out for my wedding and didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair with repeated dying. There is definitely a learning curve to using this type of dye, but I had great results by following the directions to the letter, and adding some of the suggested ingredients like egg or Greek yogurt for conditioning and various spices to boost the color. Also, after applying the dye I would wrap my hair in plastic and blowdry on low to warm it, as long as my arms could hold up, lol. Also, the product has a mud-like texture and might slow your sink/bathtub drain down after you rinse it out, so be cautious. ;)</li>
    <li> I get much good feedback on the color I&#x27;ve been doing for the past year and a half. This is the stuff. I&#x27;m happy with the way it makes my sprinkling of greys disappear. The reason I wind up touching up my hair is when I have too much new growth. It does fade a little. Especially now that I&#x27;ve been trying to swim regularly, but the color always looks healthy and not that faded tired look that the box dyes can get on reds.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s good advice on the instruction sheet. Here&#x27;s how I achieve my shade.&lt;br /&gt;I use lemon zinger tea as my liquid.[[ASIN:B004K8VBRE Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger Herbal Tea for Keurig Brewing Systems 24 K-Cups (2 Pack)]]&lt;br /&gt;I always make up my batch and give it time to set, with the plastic wrap protecting it. I&#x27;ll usually let it set at least an hour, maybe even two. If I need to add more hot tea before applying, I do that.&lt;br /&gt;While the kit comes with those thin sheet plastic protective gloves, when I can, I&#x27;ll use regular disposable gloves. The kit also comes with a bit of plastic to put over your head. There&#x27;s inexpensive disposable plastic shower caps that hold the head more effectively. I then make like a paranoid and give myself a good ol&#x27; aluminum foil hat to trap heat and help the hair color bake in. The foil should not come in contact with the henna. Just layer your baked potato attire over top of the plastic. If you can, shoot a little heat from your hair dryer from time to time between the foil layer and the plastic layer.&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on anywhere from 1-3 hours. I don&#x27;t think I usually take it much past an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I finally invested in a heat cap, [[ASIN:B003TPTGDK Thermal Spa Professional Conditioning Heat Cap Hair And Scalp Treatments]]&lt;br /&gt;This makes it a slightly better process. One still should use a disposable shower cap. I turn on the heat intermittently throughout a 40-60 minute sit down.&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re ready to rinse, put on a fresh pair of gloves. You&#x27;re going to be there awhile. Rinse the majority out, then apply a good deep conditioner to help you smooth the rest of the gritty product out of your hair. I like [[ASIN:B0032N49S6 Aveda Color Conserve Strengthening Treatment 4.2 oz]] since it helps lock in the color I&#x27;ve just spent some time doing.. You are just doing conditioner at this time, not shampoo. The longer you can go until that next shampoo, the better it cures in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair is still going to smell at least a little henna-y for a few days. And you might still be rinsing a little bit of color out for the next week or so. But the result is fantastic and enduring.&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that since I always have shorter hair, it&#x27;s best for me to only use half the package in one sitting.out, then apply a good deep conditioner to help you smooth the rest of the gritty product out of your hair.

    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it was because it was my first time using the product, but it absolutely did not work for me. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair red for almost 7 years now and was looking for henna to last longer and maintain the bright red color I favor. We stripped my hair of all color to make a nice blank canvas for the henna. We followed the instructions to the T, letting the mixture sit for like two hours before applying it. Due to the gritty texture it was difficult to apply, but I left it on for about an hour an a half, and washed it out using only conditioner as per the instructions. That first night I had macaroni and cheese orange hair. Having had henna on my skin, I knew this was normal (for skin at least), and that it would darken in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 48 hours before I had to run out and get normal hair dye to correct the color. I know it says not to, but my hair was literally carrot orange after it had \\&quot;darkened\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I stripped my hair, or if henna is simply not for me. But I gave the product 2 stars because it remained gritty and difficult to apply, and the instructions, I felt, should have been more informative. Do you apply it on clean hair? Dirty hair? Is wet hair okay? Is it best to pre-lighten?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was incredibly disappointed. Now I&#x27;m stuck with two boxes (they sent three) of this stuff that doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product as high as two stars because I was expecting a strange herbally scent, like the reviews say, but really it was more like the scent of green tea in the bag.</li>
    <li> In a quest to turn my hair auburn for a costume for Comicon (President Laura Roslin, from Battlestar Galactica), I decided to try henna, since it seemed more eco-friendly, and like it would probably do exactly what I wanted to my hair. After an unsuccessful experience with a different brand, I ordered this from Amazon at the last minute. It came on time, and I used it immediately. This time, I was careful to let it cure for a few hours before using it, and let it sit for a full two hours before rinsing it out. I also mixed in some coffee, to help with dye release, and to help keep the brown tones in my hair noticeable (I needn&#x27;t have worried, my hair is fairly dark brown, so that color wasn&#x27;t going anywhere). It worked perfectly! My hair is now exactly the color that I wanted it to be and everyone has been complementing me on it.</li>
    <li> The best red one can achieve naturally. I&#x27;ve been using light mountain for about a year and still loving it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this henna for almost two years now since I picked it up from the healthfood store I was working in. The color you get depends entirely on what color your hair is to start. I have naturally very dark brown hair and when I use the bright red henna it gives a lovely copper red sheen to my hair. The lighter your hair is to start the more dramatic color change you will get. As to the other great qualities of this product, I adore the smell of it which reminds me of fresh hay or cut grass (I also love to throw in a few drops of essential oils sometimes, such as clove oil for a good spicy smell!). After using this henna my hair is also AMAZINGLY soft and smooth! Every time I use this my hair has amazing shine, great body, soft texture, and a lovely natural auburn color! I highly recommend this henna!</li>
    <li> My husband had been urging me for some time to try using henna products. I love the color red for my hair but most chemical red dyes wash out very quickly. So, I tried the henna. I must say that henna is an interesting experience. We followed the package instructions to the letter to make sure we got the best results. I am happy with the outcome but I feel compelled to inform potential buyers of a few things:  1. This product is MESSY! Make sure you are using old garments when you apply and put newspaper on the floor. Be sure to apply vaseline around your hairline and wash up promptly after applying to prevent staining of your countertops, sink and flooring.  2. Make sure you have a bottle of distilled water on hand. Also set aside plastic/glass bowls and spoons for mixing. You cannot use any metal products in the preparation or mixing of this product.  3. It takes a while for the henna to set. Be sure you are setting aside plenty of time to allow the product to work. I left it on my hair for almost 2 hours for good coverage.  4. When you first wash the henna out, DO NOT BE DISMAYED with the color you have. It can take up to 3 full days for the product to oxidize and mature into the actual color it will be. For this reason, you may want to do your first application on a weekend when you are not planning to do much.  I have noticed immediately that my hair is MUCH softer and is full of body. I didn&#x27;t have any color stains on my pillow from the dye and other than a mossy, earthy smell left from the henna I had no obnoxious odors, a facet of this process that my husband LOVED. I will be using henna products exclusively in the future. I am very happy with the results, even if the process is a lot more intensive than what I have been used to.  An item that was not included in the kit I bought was an applicator bottle. It would be helpful for root application to invest in one for yourself.</li>
    <li> Did not work on my hair. Turned it orange ish not bright red what so ever.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews on these hair dyes I was cautious.  I have been using &#x27;regular&#x27; hair dye for many years and was starting to think I needed to stop due to damaging my hair and chemicals and such.  So I took a big breath and ordered the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to receive it in the mail and, because I was told to in all of the reviews, I read the directions front to back.  I bought the purified water and microwaved it in a plastic bowl.  I let it sit for several hours to &#x27;cure&#x27; and I covered all hair lines with lotion to stop it from dying my face.  I chose to dip my hair into the mixture instead of putting in on my hands and &#x27;gooping&#x27; it on.  I left it for about 2 hours and washed it out just like the box told me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked wonderfully.  I have gotten tons of compliments on the color and it practically sparkles in the sun.</li>
    <li> Light Mountain henna dye is wonderful and I&#x27;ve been using it for six or seven months now. However, this seller ships defect boxes or something. The actual dye is fine as far as I can tell, but the packaging for all three of my boxes was ripped and torn. I&#x27;m sure these are factory defects that didn&#x27;t pass quality inspection; I&#x27;d appreciate them being sold a bit more cheaply if that&#x27;s the case. Also, the seller took FOREVER to send me my order. I got it three or four days after the end date of the expected shipping range, and they didn&#x27;t even ship it out until they&#x27;d had my order for almost two weeks. Love the product, wouldn&#x27;t buy from these guys again.</li>
    <li> I used to use the hennalucent product and then I could no longer find it.  This works just as well, nice color and conditioner. I like that it is natural and no carcinogens. BUT...I have just started seeing a few gray hairs, and I know this won&#x27;t cover them, so if I decide the gray is an issue, I may have to find another product.</li>
    <li> Ordered this item twice, both times received the wrong color. Red was sent instead of the advertised &amp;#34;Bright Red&amp;#34;. After speaking with a representative was advised to send back and reorder. I did this only to once again revive the wrong color. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This brand is the best in the Henna market. Hair is so soft after use. Color stays for some time.</li>
    <li> This gets me back to my natural copper red hair. I had been getting my hair chemically dyed for years, but worried about the risks after reading some articles linking it to liver cancer. So I switched to all-natural Henna. For me, this dye lasts about 5 weeks before my roots show. It does take some time (1 hour to let the mix set, 1 hour to apply - if you have long hair, you&#x27;ll need someone to do it for your - , 1 hour to sit in your hair, 15 minutes to rinse out), but I feel better knowing I&#x27;m not pouring chemicals on my head. One box is enough to cover my very long hair. And your hair will smell like hay for the next 24hrs. Don&#x27;t worry. It goes away. And it is messy (the texture becomes clay-like and clumpy as you apply it). Wear clothes you don&#x27;t mind getting stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need the following:&lt;br /&gt;plastic or glass bowl (for mixing the henna &amp; water)&lt;br /&gt;wooden spoon&lt;br /&gt;glass pot/tea kettle for boiling the water&lt;br /&gt;distilled water&lt;br /&gt;good disposable gloves that fit (the ones they include are horrible)&lt;br /&gt;disposable plastic hair net (the one they include is horrible)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve henna&#x27;d my hair for years and love this product.  This is my favorite color!  I recently got hair extensions while growing out my layered cut, and it colored those too (but it does &#x27;plump&#x27; the hair up a bit so there was a tangling incident for about 3 days)!  Used tea and / or coffee to change up the color sometimes but otherwise, I use it to turn the grey hair red and look like it was expensively highlighted!</li>
    <li> I had dirty blonde ask hair and this did not change my color at all, even with adding the cayenne, paprika boosters.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have white gray hair &amp; the first application was flame orange...not red. I allowed the product to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; before applying but didn&#x27;t allow enough time on! I bought a three pack.&lt;br /&gt;The next time I henna my hair I will use 1/3 of product because it made 3 cups worth. My Hair is down to the bottom of my shoulder blades and is very think and curly.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was super shiny! I always add oil ( almond or avocado or coconut) to henna to allow it to be removed easier.&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped fast and arrived packaged well.</li>
    <li> I have natural dark ash hair and this henna turned it in dirty,dark, ugly rusty orange. It is not even close to bright red,or any kind of red. Color I have is really nasty.  I will reapply henna to make it darker and down tone orange and never buy this brand again. I did research and figured that high quality fresh henna gives RED and low quality/old henna gives ORANGE. Yea I understand that result of hair color after henna is hard to predict and it is very individual but when color one receives is not even close to what it has to be it says thats something wrong with henna itself. P.S. I dyed my hair last time 6 months ago so this ugly color I received not because of reaction with  chemicals of  dye I previously used. I did everything how it says in instruction. UPDATE  I changed one star to four. I expected my hair to be something like brown after second application but surprisingly,after I applied this henna second time my hair came out to be...  red. On roots where my natural hair, color it is vibrant red and on ends it is more deep red. Overall I love the color. I didn&#x27;t add anything to my henna, let it cure for three hours, kept it on hair for two hours. I would strongly suggest to do strand test before using  henna because its reaction with your hair is unpredictable.</li>
    <li> This may be true of all henna, but I found this very difficult to work with. It was clumpy and gritty and kept falling off my hair. It took my husband about an hour to put it all on, and I think areas were missed. I&#x27;ll try it again but next time with coffee and additional liquid to see if that helps. Where it has colored my hair it looks really nice.  Update 2015: I found a better recipe with trial and error and now can apply fairly easily. I mix the powder either with amla or potassium bitartrate - enough to create a mildly acidic mix - and add distilled water until it is like mashed potatoes. I let it sit for 14 hours and then add a little more water and apply thickly like icing, and I find it adheres well. Next I wrap my head in saran wrap and a scarf and wait 4 hours. Over the next few days the color changes to a deep red which doesn&#x27;t fade. With one batch I had a reaction and the skin on my ears itched and flaked, perhaps some other natural plant was mixed in, or perhaps it was something else and not the henna. These days I mostly use henna ordered from Mehandi because of the independent laboratory testing. But this one works well and I use it from time to time when convenient. (By the way, don&#x27;t use coffee - you absorb too much caffeine through your scalp during the long time it is on there.)</li>
    <li> Great natural product!</li>
    <li> This is a good, really effective henna that you can customize to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, it&#x27;s gonna be a bright red, so you should be expecting that. But it&#x27;s plain henna so I can use all my little tips and tricks to play with the color/conditioning, and not worry about the price like I do when I use Lush hennas (also a great choice, but more expensive.) I have dark brown hair, so most of my experimentation revolves around trying to amp up the red color so I can get a nice auburn rather than just a cinnamon brown. My hair is also thick and oily, and likes to fry with normal hair dyes (which I have used TWICE in my life and I will never again). Henna is great for a natural coloring to your hair that will leave it healthier versus fried and sad. Plus, since it will wash out in 3-4 months, you don&#x27;t really need to worry about redoing your roots. Just redo the henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips I like to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it sit for 2+ hours (this will help reduce down the time you need it on your hair, helps unlock the red color)&lt;br /&gt;Use hibiscus-based tea (for red color)&lt;br /&gt;Lemon juice (Lightens, but also be careful as this will dry out your hair)&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil (Another conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth it over your head and wrap it in plastic wrap. I&#x27;ve slept in it a few times, wrapping a towel around my head and my pillow, but this can be uncomfortable. I prefer now to let it sit for the 2+ hours and then keep it in my hair for about 3 hours during the daytime. This does also have the benefit of you being able to blast it with the hair dryer now and then (thru the plastic wrap) to increase the heat. Heat will help with the red tones and lock them into your hair for a longer-lasting shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. For the price, you can definitely afford to experiment on your own for your own perfect henna cocktail.</li>
    <li> I love Light Mountain henna. It really grabs onto my gray hair. Watch out for this Bright Red though. It really is as bright as the back of the box shows. The ingredients are 100% Lawsonia inermis (henna) leaf powder with no other chemicals added. Henna fills in all the cracks and spaces in each hair and gives it a natural red color and healthy body. Natural hair has various shades of color to it and when you add henna to it the natural highlights remain. I mean that the lighter hair grabs the henna faster and the darker takes on some red but the variety of shades remain and ends up looking natural instead contrived or fake. Also, the henna will oxidize in a few days after application and look a bit browner than it does at first. I am a medium brown to dark brown with gray highlights and I don&#x27;t need to leave it in my hair more than 10 to 15 minutes to give my gray hair a beautiful tinge of strawberry blond color (or leave it in for an hour for a bright coppery (on gray)/auburn (on brown) color). On the whole, my favorite color of Light Mountain is just Red.</li>
    <li> All it did was add some orange to my bleached hair.  I was hoping for something more drastic.  I have used a different brand of henna before.</li>
    <li> First of all, let&#x27;s get this out of the way. This is NOT a dye! If you&#x27;ve been dying your hair for years or even decades, don&#x27;t expect this to be anything like a chemical dye. Think of it more like a mud mask that stains your hair. This will not look like a dye, it will not go on like a dye and it will not rinse out like a dye. But that&#x27;s OK, it really is. The trade off is it doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin and it doesn&#x27;t ruin everything it plops on the minute it lands! Plus it adds a little something extra to the color that I can&#x27;t quite define.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend doing the allergy and strand test. Only for the strand test I would recommend following the same curing step as for the actual application. Then go ahead and cake it on, like you will for your whole head application. When I did the strand test, I was disappointed. It didn&#x27;t look like it would do much for my hair. But for the full application, I let the henna cure for 1 hour as suggested in the instructions, then left it on my head for 1 hour, applying heat with a hair dryer as instructed. The result was fabulous! This gave my hair a shine and dimension not possible with chemical dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the beginning, you should be aware that this is not your traditional dye. It is gritty like a mud mask. (Actually its very much like what comes out of a babies hinnie, but I&#x27;m too much of a lady to say it!)This won&#x27;t apply like a traditional dye. My daughter (who&#x27;s 16) who applies my dye when I&#x27;m too busy or broke to visit my hair dresser, moaned and groaned for about the first five minutes then finally got the hang of it when she accepted it wasn&#x27;t going to go on like a traditional dye and changed her application method. I&#x27;m not sure I could have applied it myself. She spent about an hour just getting it on, then another ten or so minutes working it into my hair and making sure everything was covered. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be asking my regular beauty technician to take this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the process took 3 to 3 1/2 hours. 1 hour to mix the henna and let it cure, 1 hour to apply , 1 hour to cure on my head (don&#x27;t forget to heat your head up with a blow dryer every 10 minutes or so!) and half and hour to rinse (Rinse once, put in conditioner, let that sit for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse again.)So don&#x27;t think you can slap this stuff on in an afternoon. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time. I&#x27;d set aside half a day, especially if this is your first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing you should know. Since this is not a chemical dye, it will not erase roots! You know, that line of demarcation you get when your hair is dyed a completely different color than it was meant to be. I&#x27;m a dark brown with chemically altered red, so my dark brown roots pop up after about 2 weeks. This&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t completely erase them like a chemical dye would. But it will blend them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if your a blonde or a lighter brown, I would urge caution! If this took so well on my hair, I would think it would take even more on lighter hair! You may want to pay close attention on that strand test and maybe not let it cure so much. Also, I noticed that this color (bright red) had a lot of orange in it, which my dark hair can take and in fact, I think its that orange that gives my hair that extra dimension I was talking about. However, my guess would be that on lighter hair, that orange my be more prevalent than anyone would desire. In fact I&#x27;m planning on stepping down to red instead of the bright red on my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line  is, this is natural and worth the work! I plan on using this from now on. Besides, it appeals to my inner hippie!take this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the process took 3 to 3 1/2 hours. 1 hour to mix the henna and let it cure, 1 hour to apply , 1 hour to cure on my head (don&#x27;t forget to heat your head up with a blow dryer every 10 minutes or so!) and half and hour to rinse (Rinse once, put in conditioner, let that sit for 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse again.)So don&#x27;t think you can slap this stuff on in an afternoon.
