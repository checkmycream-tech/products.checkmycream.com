### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It has been the best razor I have ever owned.  </li>
      <li>Happy Customer...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do a great job at removing hair, but it&#x27;s great at removing skin.</li>
      <li>Great shaver....</li>
      <li>So for the legs this shaver is great.  </li>
      <li>Anyone know of a good brand because I would love to know of one!!</li>
      <li>another poster said, it&#x27;s definitely good for touch ups.</li>
      <li>As for the underarms....not so good.  </li>
      <li>This gave me a shave every bit as good as a razor.  </li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t good for summer use, unless you like having stubble and patches of hair on your legs and arms when you wear shorts/skirts or sleeveless tops.</li>
      <li>It shaves closely, almost like a razor, and did a good job on my legs.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>did a better job on my legs than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
      <li>And Very friendly!</li>
      <li>but the shave is amazing</li>
      <li>:) it works better than my boyfriends mach 3 razor!</li>
      <li>The wdf-3500 is probably the best electric razor as far as shaving is concerned.</li>
      <li>Does an okay job on the legs but caused razor burn to underarm area.  </li>
      <li>It does seem like I have to shave more often, though.  </li>
      <li>your money and find something better.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s an okay razor.</li>
      <li>It does an okay job at removing hair...</li>
      <li>I love this razor.</li>
      <li>The foil breaks easily and you better check it from time to time if you don&#x27;t want to have marks on your skin when the foil breaks....</li>
      <li>EASILY anyway, but as for my legs?</li>
      <li>Also, the top broke off the first time I tried washing it, but I was able to repair it.    </li>
      <li>I bought a Remington EP1000 Smooth &amp; Silky Epilator.</li>
      <li>It specifically says to put all of the blades evenly on the skin but that definitely doesn&#x27;t yield good results.</li>
      <li>The positives of this particuliar razor: nice color, charge lasted more then 25 minutes, neat little storage bag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the purchase for the close shave.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I rarely wear shorts even in summer because of the unsightly bumps and scabs.  </li>
      <li>Gift for Wife, see is very positive about it.  </li>
      <li>Super fast process and delivery!</li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>This razor is only supposed to be used on legs (it says so in the manual) but even then I haven&#x27;t been able to get a close shave at all.</li>
      <li>For the benefits I&#x27;ve received so far, I think I would have been better off just sticking with my old razor.  </li>
      <li>But since my only issue with a razor is my legs this shaver is perfectly fine for my needs.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for the legs!</li>
      <li>In fact, my daughter tried it and now she wants one.  </li>
      <li>it also doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
      <li>However, you could probably get these benefits and better performance with a more expensive model.</li>
      <li>only good thing about it is that it holds its charge for a long time if allowed to charge overnight and that it comes with a facial trimmer and storage bag.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>The two positive things I can say about this shaver are that it does hold a charge for as long as I need it to, and I like being able to shave dry.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good thing i only shave my underarms every other day b/c letting the hair grow a bit is the only way i can get it to cut the hair w/o leaving stubble.</li>
      <li>Plus at $20, you may as well buy a new razor which goes for about $30-$35.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and had been using a Panasonic electric shaver without problems.  </li>
      <li>The first unit purchased the rechargeable battery finally would not take a charge.</li>
      <li>I have pretty coarse leg hair and a problem with ingrown hairs.  </li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get far.  </li>
      <li>thick hair and the others I&#x27;ve tried did nothing for me, but this one actually gives as good a shave as a regular razor.</li>
      <li>Also a little noisey, but all-in-all not a bad deal for the price.</li>
      <li>The shaver has been fine on my legs - not very efficient, or quiet, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any damage and if I&#x27;m careful enough I get a pretty close shave.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, even after reading the largely positive reviews of the more expensive, higher-model-number Remington shavers, and the largely negative reviews of this cheaper one, I still went the cheap route.  </li>
      <li>i really have to press down hard just to get smooth legs, underarms, arms, or bikini area... and the pressing leads to cuts leads to cuts/nicks and razor burn and the stubble is still there.</li>
      <li>Went back to the old one with no further problems.</li>

    <li> Does an okay job on the legs but caused razor burn to underarm area.  The instruction manual indicates the body will condition itself and be less likely to burn after repeated use.  Also a little noisey, but all-in-all not a bad deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver less than one year and already the battery won&#x27;t hold the charge. Compared to my previous Remington model which lasted for a few years, this gets low grades on closeness, smoothness, and battery life. Look for another shaver.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this razor PERIOD. I have owned it for a short time and now it won&#x27;t hold a charge. After some research online, I found this is a trend among this model.</li>
    <li> Until trying this razor, I never knew it was possible to cut yourself with an electric..  In a few instances it looks like I skinned my knee (or shin, or wherever.. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do a great job at removing hair, but it&#x27;s great at removing skin.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten a close shave but don&#x27;t need to shave everyday. The charge lasts long. I&#x27;ve only nicked myself a little in my underarm area.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I found that it&#x27;s too rough to use on my underarms, since I get razor burn there EASILY anyway, but as for my legs? I love it! I had to get the angle just right but the shave is amazing :) it works better than my boyfriends mach 3 razor! the only downside? don&#x27;t drop it on the tub.....the screen breaks and you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> For some reason, even after reading the largely positive reviews of the more expensive, higher-model-number Remington shavers, and the largely negative reviews of this cheaper one, I still went the cheap route.  For the benefits I&#x27;ve received so far, I think I would have been better off just sticking with my old razor.  The shaver has been fine on my legs - not very efficient, or quiet, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any damage and if I&#x27;m careful enough I get a pretty close shave.  It does seem like I have to shave more often, though.  What&#x27;s really bad is what happened to my armpits: painful red welts for several days!

However, you could probably get these benefits and better performance with a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and had been using a Panasonic electric shaver without problems.  The shaver broke when I dropped it and I bought this as a replacement.  It shaves closely, almost like a razor, and did a good job on my legs.  Unfortunately, on the underarms, I got razor burns and stopped using this shaver.  Went back to the old one with no further problems.</li>
    <li> Great shaver....did a better job on my legs than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!  Close shave, no pain.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The positives of this particuliar razor: nice color, charge lasted more then 25 minutes, neat little storage bag. The negatives of this particuliar razor: razor brushed burned me on the back of my legs and even left a couple of cuts, the ON button has to be held continously, razor felt bulky after holding it for 5 minutes. If brushed burned and cut legs, a numb thumb, and aching hand is what your looking for....this razor is for you!!!! I bought a Remington EP1000 Smooth &amp; Silky Epilator. If I&#x27;am going to have to endure pain I at least want something that will remove hair for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> The wdf-3500 is probably the best electric razor as far as shaving is concerned. But the quality is below average. The foil breaks easily and you better check it from time to time if you don&#x27;t want to have marks on your skin when the foil breaks.... The razor itself is not built to last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parts are difiicult to find (I have found only one place in my area that carries them). Plus at $20, you may as well buy a new razor which goes for about $30-$35.</li>
    <li> This razor is only supposed to be used on legs (it says so in the manual) but even then I haven&#x27;t been able to get a close shave at all. It specifically says to put all of the blades evenly on the skin but that definitely doesn&#x27;t yield good results. Also, the top broke off the first time I tried washing it, but I was able to repair it.    To sum it up, after I shave I need to go back over the area with a disposable razor which provides a 10 times closer shave than this razor.</li>
    <li> WOW! Super fast process and delivery! And Very friendly! Will be back again for future purchases!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used electrics before and until i got this, i had no clue it was possible to cut myself or get razor burn with an electric. it also doesn&#x27;t cut very well. i really have to press down hard just to get smooth legs, underarms, arms, or bikini area... and the pressing leads to cuts leads to cuts/nicks and razor burn and the stubble is still there. it&#x27;s a good thing i only shave my underarms every other day b/c letting the hair grow a bit is the only way i can get it to cut the hair w/o leaving stubble. this isn&#x27;t good for summer use, unless you like having stubble and patches of hair on your legs and arms when you wear shorts/skirts or sleeveless tops. i just used it on my bikini line and i got worse razor burn that i would have gotten while i was Gillette&#x27;s Venus razors. i also managed to cut myself somehow! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s also a bit heavy. it took me a while to get used to the weight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the only good thing about it is that it holds its charge for a long time if allowed to charge overnight and that it comes with a facial trimmer and storage bag. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;save your money and find something better.</li>
    <li> Gift for Wife, see is very positive about it.  This is the second unit purchased.The first unit purchased the rechargeable battery finally would not take a charge.</li>
    <li> I get the smoothest shave from this razor than any other that I&#x27;ve used.  In fact, my daughter tried it and now she wants one.  I do agree with the other reviews on the underarms.  I just don&#x27;t use it there.  It&#x27;s worth the purchase for the close shave.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This gave me a shave every bit as good as a razor.  I have pretty coarse leg hair and a problem with ingrown hairs.  I rarely wear shorts even in summer because of the unsightly bumps and scabs.  So for the legs this shaver is great.  As for the underarms....not so good.  I didn&#x27;t get far.  I got a few scrapes immediately and stopped, finishing with a razor.  But since my only issue with a razor is my legs this shaver is perfectly fine for my needs.  Highly recommend it for the legs!</li>
    <li> This razor is great...if you have time to shave your legs 3 or 4 times each time to get all the hairs! I have had several Remington razors over the years and this is THE WORST!  It seems to be that, like everything else on the market today, the quality of Remington razors has gone out the door!  It&#x27;s too bad too because good ladies razors are hard to find and this used to be one you could count on!    Anyone know of a good brand because I would love to know of one!!</li>
    <li> This is the only electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever used. It does an okay job at removing hair...like another poster said, it&#x27;s definitely good for touch ups. However, it is impossible to find replacement parts for this razor. I&#x27;ve looked everywhere and I am finally going to buy them online through the Remington Web site. That&#x27;s a definite drawback for me. Otherwise, it&#x27;s an okay razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor over 10 years ago.  It has been the best razor I have ever owned.  It has just now started to not hold the charge after all this time.  I am going to buy the same model and hope that I have the same results. Happy Customer...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers and have not found one that actually works for me, until this one. I have course thick hair and the others I&#x27;ve tried did nothing for me, but this one actually gives as good a shave as a regular razor.</li>
