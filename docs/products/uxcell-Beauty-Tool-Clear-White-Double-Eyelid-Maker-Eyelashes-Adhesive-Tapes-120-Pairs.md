### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great price!</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t stick perfectly.</li>
      <li>Awesome quality</li>
      <li>very nice!</li>
      <li>but this is a great price</li>
      <li>Happy I got them.</li>
      <li>These would be really great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product if you know how to use it.</li>
      <li>Good value for price.</li>
      <li>But, they package not quite good because some of the eyelid tape was coming off already.</li>
      <li>really cute!</li>
      <li>they look so nice .</li>
      <li>I find it best to kind of stretch it as you&#x27;re putting it on because if you just set it on your lid, it won&#x27;t really pull it inwards.</li>
      <li>to be more defined and these did not do that.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m really enjoying this product.</li>
      <li>okay ..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of visible close up at first but throughout the day the oils on your lid kind of camouflage it with your lids.</li>
      <li>Overall, great for their price.</li>
      <li>Not bad for this price.</li>
      <li>i like it very much!</li>
      <li>Despite this discrepancy, I was pleased because I tend to lose track of clear backed eyelid tapes as they blend into the depth of my drawers-</li>
      <li>a rounder eye that has a more contoured crease, where the tape is not visible when eye is open.</li>
      <li>Not  very sticky..  Very cheaply made</li>
      <li>this makes them much easier to find.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re nice, but you have to double up on them if you want them to actually work.</li>
      <li>cannot last long for all day, this may be the most disadvantage for me.</li>

<li> The stickers are too soft and not very easy to use, but they won&#x27;t make my eyelayers hurt also becasues of their softness.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
<li> The backings of these eyelid tapes is not clear as the picture but a reflective metallic shade.</li>
<li> I do realize that they are quite flimsy and if you&#x27;re looking for an extreme double eyelid look, then these are probably not the ones for you.</li>
<li> I did not get dbl sided tape as expected.</li>
<li> other places ask for $10</li>
<li> Fyi, i have asian eyes with a very small crease.</li>
<li> which apparently they&#x27;re not so they&#x27;re essentially useless.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s Not Double Sided, so these are basically useless, wasted 3 bucks on these😐</li>
<li> I am no satisfied and wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
<li> This is not very good product comparing to what I have used before.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s single sided which makes it impossible to use.</li>
<li> These are thin, breathable and long-wearing eyelid tapes that can stand up to oily eyelids.</li>
<li> this purchase is useless to me.</li>

<ol>
    <li> it did not work like it said it would and i would not recommend it to anyone  at all it does not work</li>
    <li> okay .. they look so nice . depend on your size eyelid if you want to buy big eyes.</li>
    <li> The backings of these eyelid tapes is not clear as the picture but a reflective metallic shade. Despite this discrepancy, I was pleased because I tend to lose track of clear backed eyelid tapes as they blend into the depth of my drawers- this makes them much easier to find. These are thin, breathable and long-wearing eyelid tapes that can stand up to oily eyelids. People I come in contact with have not noticed them at all yet which is a bonus. I do realize that they are quite flimsy and if you&#x27;re looking for an extreme double eyelid look, then these are probably not the ones for you.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stick.I just trashed them.It&#x27;s not like they cost alot .I had a feeling they wouldn&#x27;t work b4 I got them in the mail.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Not Double Sided, so these are basically useless, wasted 3 bucks on these😐</li>
    <li> but did not work for me. I have oily skin and even after washing, they did not work for me!</li>
    <li> i like it very much! and may be i will buy it later! really cute! very nice! i like it !</li>
    <li> great price! other places ask for $10 but this is a great price, I&#x27;m really enjoying this product. Awesome quality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not double sided as it says here. And it doesn&#x27;t stick perfectly. I am no satisfied and wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Not bad for this price. Would definitely try to purchase f or a second time.</li>
    <li> Not  very sticky..  Very cheaply made</li>
    <li> I also bought this, thinking it was doublesided tape as it was described. It&#x27;s single sided which makes it impossible to use. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I did not get dbl sided tape as expected. this purchase is useless to me.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it well but it didn&#x27;t stick well at all. Ended up embarrassing myself in public with these.</li>
    <li> Of course it&#x27;s not double sided, it didn&#x27;t claim to be. It&#x27;s a great product if you know how to use it. I find it best to kind of stretch it as you&#x27;re putting it on because if you just set it on your lid, it won&#x27;t really pull it inwards. It&#x27;s kind of visible close up at first but throughout the day the oils on your lid kind of camouflage it with your lids.</li>
    <li> Happy I got them. But, they package not quite good because some of the eyelid tape was coming off already.</li>
    <li> The stickers are too soft and not very easy to use, but they won&#x27;t make my eyelayers hurt also becasues of their softness.&lt;br /&gt;They cannot last long for all day, this may be the most disadvantage for me.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re nice, but you have to double up on them if you want them to actually work. Overall, great for their price.</li>
    <li> which apparently they&#x27;re not so they&#x27;re essentially useless. I have big eyes to begin with I just wanted&lt;br /&gt;them to be more defined and these did not do that. So I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> Needs instructions in English included</li>
    <li> This is not very good product comparing to what I have used before.</li>
    <li> Good value for price. The tape does stick but is visible. I use tape to reform my eye crease, as it sometimes dissapears when my eyes are puffy in the morning.  Fyi, i have asian eyes with a very small crease. These would be really great&lt;br /&gt;for a rounder eye that has a more contoured crease, where the tape is not visible when eye is open.</li>
