      <li>I think this does a pretty decent job of giving me volume.  </li>

      <li>Plus, it has a natural fresh smell.</li>

      <li>I have been using this product for a number of months and it gives me just enough volume and lift without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Tried this as a replacement for MOP Defining Cream which I have used in the past but is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine &amp; thin hair.</li>

      <li>I have fine and thin hair, so to give it volume</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I  am giving this two stars because I like the light scent. It arrived with some product leaked out, but I am not concerned about that. I am reviewing primarily because it does not perform as promised. I see no root lifting properties. My hair is shoulder length but not thick or heavy. Perhaps very short hair would see some performance from this product. Since there are many root lifting products on the market, best to try something else!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s great to give your hair some lift without leaving it feeling like it has product in it.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for fine hair. It holds my hair but is not stiff. I apply it when hair is damp and then air or blow dry. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> A few days ago I submitted a negative review because this item was sent to a wrong address.  A customer service representative got involved and has been very attentive to fixing the problem. I did receive the item and everything has been resolved to my satisfaction .</li>
    <li> This spray helps give my hair body without weighing it down. It works well before blow-drying or letting hair dry naturally. Plus, it has a natural fresh smell. I generally use this or KMS HairPlay Sea Salt spray.  One advantage this product has is its less drying than Sea Salt.</li>
    <li> Love lemongrass?  Have fine hair?  Then you&#x27;ll like this product.</li>
    <li> It was good, just what I expected</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of months and it gives me just enough volume and lift without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the smell and the texture it gives my hair. The second package arrived with the plastic spray dispenser broken. I didn&#x27;t return as I had one from first order. That said, more care in shipping wrapping needed. Product highly recommended.</li>
    <li> She uses this to increase hair volume and for styling. She tells me this is the best thing she&#x27;s every used for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came quickly in perfect shape and at a great price when compared to normal retail outlets. She said she would rate this a 5 out of 5 stars. I&#x27;ve been instructed to order another one in about 10 days.</li>
    <li> I have fine and thin hair, so to give it volume I have a short haircut and have it texturized and choppy.  To give it oomph and dirtiness and depth, this spray has done wonders and I absolutely love it!  Been using it for almost 3 years now.  I just tried a Shu Uemura liquid fabric spray (that costs $34!) to give texture and \\&quot;dirtiness\\&quot; to my hair, but I still prefer the MOP spray!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t love this more.  It&#x27;s GREAT for my curly hair, keeps it frizz free and holds curls wonderfully.  It smells great, too.  Fun bonus!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and works good inbetween washing...use to hold down flyaways...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that works for my thin, fine hair.  It&#x27;s great that I can order this online and don&#x27;t have to visit a salon.</li>
    <li> This is the best \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells good and lasts a long time. A famous hair dresser first used this on me ten years ago and I&#x27;ve been addicted ever since!</li>
    <li> I have very fine &amp; thin hair. I have tried several volumizers. Lemongrass lift has given me the best results, without leaving a sticky or greasy texture.</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine - when spraying this in after shampoo with MOP Lemon-Grass -my hair has more body.  I&#x27;m so glad to have tried this from my beauty shop first.  They discontinued carrying this product and I found it on Amazon.  and so happy happy I did</li>
    <li> Okay so when I was in the shower, I my hair started to fall out. I thought it was just a coincidence, but I was wrong. As I was drying my hair, it felt soft, but when I looked at the bathroom walls and floor my hair was everywhere. I decided it was just a fluke, so I retried and the same thing happened. When I went back to my regular shampoo my hair was fine. I am not trying to discourage anyone, but this is what happened to me. As I said, it cleaned well and what was left of my hair was super soft.</li>
    <li> Good product for thin hair..</li>
    <li> Gives absolutely no volume or body to my fine hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin Root Lifter is a much better product for adding body to fine hair, and also Phyto Intense Volume Mousse.</li>
    <li> Lemon-Grass Lift from Mop (8.45 fl. oz.) I love the smell and hold of Lemon-grass Lift.  It works good for me.</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair and this product applied at the roots really gives my hair a boost--and smells great, too.  After I spray it on my roots and comb it through, I use the MOP orange peel molding cream to define my curls.  I let my hair dry most of the way and then blow dry using my fingers to lift my hair. These two have been my favorite combination and I have tried a LOT of products!  I recommend this product for anyone who needs some help with body at the roots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and so far haven&#x27;t been impressed. I keep reaching for my Aquage foam instead. Also, I was disappointed to see such a long list of questionable ingredients, namely a few different parabens that have been banned elsewhere because of health concerns.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT ALL ORGANIC ingredients like I was led to believe. It has a long list of things that are not healthy. It&#x27;s a good thing I won&#x27;t be using it because the bottle was poorly wrapped and half of the liquid leaked out!!</li>
    <li> BEWARE! Nothing in this is organic like it is labeled on Amazon. It is also not natural as it is filled with different alcohols, copolymers and other chemicals. Do not buy if you care about your hair.</li>
    <li> Great for lightweight volume with my thin, fine hair...</li>
    <li> Product is Great...pump spray is the worst, very poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to pump, does not work well, gets hung up and doesn&#x27;t spray with each pump.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a pump spray that worked so poorly.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to consider buying a spray bottle and transfer the contents.</li>
    <li> Good value, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, because my hair stylist used it. I always use whatever products she uses because I view that as an endorsement by an expert, I want my hair to look as much like it does when she styles it as possible, minus the hair styling expertise, of course, and it usually does. She/I spritz it on the roots and it makes my hair look fuller. I have fine, limp hair, and this product does what it says; it lifts the hair from the roots. When I&#x27;ve run out, my hair definitely looks limper and flatter. I&#x27;ve been told that the manufacturer no longer makes it. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, but I live in the greater Kansas City area and can find it nowhere here, so I order it from good ol&#x27; Amazon. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As it turns out my hair is too long for a fair trial of this product. I do like the smell. After my next haircut I will try it again and post an update.</li>
    <li> Ingredients listed online and on the label were different. I have severe allergies, so I had to return it. The product shipped to me contained Propylene Glycol.</li>
    <li> Lemon-Grass Lift works well in between shampoos.  I spray it on a section at a time and then blow dry each section with my curling iron/blow dryer, and this gives my hair body.  I have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> love love love it and have already recommended it to friends...&lt;br /&gt;my daughter ordered some from you and that is how I found out about it...best product I ever used for my fine hair...does not dull the sheen....</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a review.  They don&#x27;t make my old root lifter by Got2b fatastic, so I wanted to find a relatively inexpensive booster.  I think this does a pretty decent job of giving me volume.  I have fine hair and not a lot of it, so I need volume especially on days that I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  I spritz water on my roots, then I spray this lemon-grass lift, then I blow dry the roots from underneath.  This lift also has a nice light natural scent, also good if you don&#x27;t wash your hair that day.  It may not give maximum lift because it is on the lighter side, but it is good enough for me to recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok.  It is not so great that I am going to order it again.  I am going to try something different when this stuff runs out.</li>
    <li> Tried this as a replacement for MOP Defining Cream which I have used in the past but is no longer available.  The Lemon Grass Lift did not do much for my straight lanky hair.  Didn&#x27;t provide &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; like the Defining Cream used to do.  Am still searching for a replacement.Trying BigSexyHair Blow Dry Volumizing Gel now.  It does give some body and lift.  This product didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I spray this on my hair to style it. This product is very light and doesn&#x27;t make your style droop.</li>
    <li> M.O.P.S. Lemon-Grass Lift is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;When My hair was shorter it was a more effective product, though. It adds a lot of texture to hair and for me that can mean snarls as well as body.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this product smells wonderful and does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Organic and not a heavy product.  The spray gives the lift needed for my hair without making my hear feel sticky or heavy.  Great deal for the dollar.</li>
    <li> I get this every year for my dad he simply adores it! Makes him feel like he has ore hair than he probably really does ;)</li>
    <li> Smells nice and fresh.  Good for freshening up hair on running out the door non-shampoo days.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It smells different and less nice than what I bought at my salon. Seems to work the same, though.</li>
    <li> Makes hair softer, but hasn&#x27;t  made a huge difference for me.</li>
    <li> I must have the worlds most limp hair, I have not tried any volumizing products yet that work very well.  I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a try, it works so great!!!!  I even got a compliment about my hair the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give hair holding power that Matrix does, and makes it sticky.  Will not order it again.  It is just okay.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for people with fine hair - it has great lift but doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky and/or heavy.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it!</li>
