      <li>AWESOME QUALITY - GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
      <li>I find this to be a great product so far..being over 40</li>
      <li>and I love it!!</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>The Thyrene alone is good for those who do not like the jittery feeling.</li>
      <li>I just purchase this because I used the Phenolox and liked it.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS ITEM.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many things to lose weight since I can&#x27;t exercise.</li>
      <li>So I paid more for nothing</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to tell a difference in any way.</li>
      <li>I love the synedrex and use that however after about 3-4 weeks you have to go off of it</li>
      <li>I find my eating habits are more &amp;#34;controlled&amp;#34;..</li>
      <li>Make sure you drink water with this and</li>
      <li>Awesome product but be careful.</li>
      <li>and so far so good,</li>
      <li>Synedrex in my opinion is a potent capsule when you first take it.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty potent.</li>
      <li>and it seems the more i cycled it it didnt work as much.</li>
      <li>and I have seen amazing results in the last couple of weeks using all three in prep for a competition!</li>
      <li>Worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Product arrived exactly when promised.  </li>
      <li>Really curbs your appetite!</li>
      <li>the bottle says that after you get use to the pill in the first week you can take 2 pills a day.</li>
      <li>The first time i used it I used it alone and didnt feel as if it worked.</li>
      <li>I must admit that when i first started taking it it had a tendency to upset my stomach but after about day 3 or 4 that subsided which is why i continued to use it.</li>
      <li>Its very misleading!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a doctor, but its ironic - isn&#x27;t it?</li>
      <li>This did ABSOLUTELY nothing</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t find this to give me any energy boosts so no jitters or fast heart rate..</li>
      <li>Unless you are really over weight I would just take 1 a day.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have the desire to go to the gym or do much else.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time with my metabolism now becoming much slower..</li>
      <li>So far I think these work well in conjunction with Synedrex.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be very upset if I don&#x27;t get my money back.</li>
      <li>A total waste of money and precious time.</li>
      <li>This was highly recommended by a friend who actually knew someone who lost 35 lbs with this.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product.  I tried another brand and didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m switching back.</li>
    <li> Awesome product but be careful. Start slow and work your way up to recommended dosage.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, it said it had 45 capsules, when I received it it only has 30 and the bottle stated that it only had 30. Its very misleading!</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me,i noticed nothing,no side effects but also no positive effects,just nothing..</li>
    <li> A total waste of money and precious time.</li>
    <li> It may work for others, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It did not suppress my appetite or boost my energy level.  Maybe it&#x27;s me...</li>
    <li> I was excited about receiving my Thyrene, but was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t experience any change, I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle in a bottle but I was hoping for a ramp in energy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product!</li>
    <li> bought this to mix with Metabolic Nutrition Phenolox Diet Supplement, trying to get the same results as Metabolic Nutrition Synedrex Diet Supplement, will update if the mixture works a s well as Synedrex alone, I doubt it will.</li>
    <li> Instead of this medication giving me energy it made me sleepy. tried to return for a refund or exchange, but Amazon would not allow it.</li>
    <li> Really curbs your appetite! Gives no jitters and or side effects but you will see a difference on the weight scale</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works. I have tried so many things to lose weight since I can&#x27;t exercise. I noticed within a week.</li>
    <li> Product arrived exactly when promised.  However does not work at all.  Promises lots of energy, actually makes me very tired even tried taking 2 a day, no difference.  Also have no lost any weight.</li>
    <li> I just purchase this because I used the Phenolox and liked it. I read that you can combine the too to maximize your training and weight lost goal. I&#x27;ve only been taking it for a week and so far so good, But let me tell you, man do you get a burst of energy. not jittery energy, but a need to be doing something instead of sitting. Make sure you drink water with this and the bottle says that after you get use to the pill in the first week you can take 2 pills a day. Unless you are really over weight I would just take 1 a day. This stuff is pretty potent.</li>
    <li> Awesome ,lost 42 pound ,It help me in a way I &#x27;d never imagined and ate all the foods I was eaten prior,plus no Gym. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I guess I received the placebo pills. I will start upping my dosage to two pills in the morning but I haven&#x27;t been able to tell a difference in any way. At this point I&#x27;m tempted to return them.</li>
    <li> Lost 20 pounds with this , just drink a lot of water because you will sweat a lot at the gym , receive a lot of energy and heat</li>
    <li> Ordered the 45 pill bottle and received the bottle with 30. So I paid more for nothing</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the Syndrex and Phenolox and I have seen amazing results in the last couple of weeks using all three in prep for a competition!</li>
    <li> I feel like this product works but I myself get Lethargic. Don&#x27;t have the desire to go to the gym or do much else. It may affect you differently. It works like I said I just wish I could keep my active lifestyle AND use this.</li>
    <li> Works well, when combined with Lipocide, I lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ITEM. AWESOME QUALITY - GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
    <li> This did ABSOLUTELY nothing and I&#x27;ll be very upset if I don&#x27;t get my money back.</li>
    <li> I take Thyrene with Synedrex and I love it!! The combination keeps me energized through my day at work and during my workouts, and is helping control my food cravings and appetite!</li>
    <li> So far I think these work well in conjunction with Synedrex. The Thyrene alone is good for those who do not like the jittery feeling.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great product so far..being over 40 I have a hard time with my metabolism now becoming much slower..I started (marathon) running to help maintain my weight and stay active but needed a little help with weight loss.. I have been using 45 days on/45 days off for 10 months now...I find my eating habits are more &amp;#34;controlled&amp;#34;..less urges (sugar). Don&#x27;t find this to give me any energy boosts so no jitters or fast heart rate..I recommend this to anyone who needs a little help maintaining thier metabolism</li>
    <li> I lost 10 pounds in 30 days using metabolic nutrition thyrene 45</li>
    <li> No side effects. I have lost about 10lbs since March 2013. Does curb the appetite and no jitters.Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> ***WARNING  This is NOT a 45 capsule count I returned the 1st shipment only to be sent another 30 count bottle. I would purchase the cheaper listing of 30 caps*** I have used this twice. The first time i used it I used it alone and didnt feel as if it worked. It sat in my cabinet for a while. I love the synedrex and use that however after about 3-4 weeks you have to go off of it and it seems the more i cycled it it didnt work as much. So this time when using the synedrex I decided to try taking it with the thyrene and it definitely worked at curbing my appetite once again. So myadvice is if it doesnt work alone try taking them together. A word of caution I would only combine if you have built a tolerance for 1 capsule of synedrex. Synedrex in my opinion is a potent capsule when you first take it. I must admit that when i first started taking it it had a tendency to upset my stomach but after about day 3 or 4 that subsided which is why i continued to use it. Now I have no issues with either.</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended by a friend who actually knew someone who lost 35 lbs with this.  I didn&#x27;t lose anything, felt very hungry and exhausted - could not get out of bed in the morning.  From the reviews, it appears that women don&#x27;t seem to do well with this, but men do - I&#x27;m not a doctor, but its ironic - isn&#x27;t it?</li>
