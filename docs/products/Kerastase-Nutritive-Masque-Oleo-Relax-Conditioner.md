      <li>One thing I love about Kerastase products is that they perform just as they claim they will.</li>
      <li>I also use Kerastase Oleo-Relax Anti-Frizz shampoo and love the products.</li>
      <li>The taming hair mask works better than this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have a curly hair and tried many products.</li>
      <li>I shampoo my hair, towel try and leave this on for 20 min or more.</li>
      <li>Kerastase Oleo-Relax Masque is pretty much the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Genuine Kerastase product for a great price, and shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I love this item because it makes my hair silky and smooth, it&#x27;s a great conditioning system, and I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>I was able to do my hair and get the smooth look that my hair stylist achieves.  </li>
      <li>This is another great product from Kerastase -- and much more reasonable thru amazon.com than in salons, where we first discovered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>full of chemicals!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a rinse-out conditioner (or &amp;#34;masque&amp;#34;) that is excellent in taming dry hair and making it thicker, fuller, more manageable.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and curly and this adds the perfect amount of moisture without weighing my hair down.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get mani/pedis regularly, I don&#x27;t buy brand new cars or the latest and greatest in cell phone technology.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price and more.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s pretty easy to get over when I run my fingers through my silky mane!  </li>
      <li>For me, that is well worth the price!</li>
      <li>This is worth the price!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it for sleek hair!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny, even from the salon, but great to find it online for such a bargain!</li>
      <li>Great for curly, dry, rebellious hair.</li>
      <li>Then after using it a few more times my hair started not responding as greatly to this product.</li>
      <li>My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice.</li>
      <li>The sent is very strong but I am pretty sensitive to perfume smells so many may like it.  </li>
      <li>and you can use a very small amount with excellent results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal now for years.</li>
      <li>Very shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff so far</li>
      <li>but well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Kerastase masque tames the frizz, but I end up needing to wash my hair more often than I&#x27;d like because of greasiness (near roots).</li>
      <li>I want to see if it&#x27;s worth the inversion.</li>
      <li>I spend my dollars on my hair and this stuff is worth it.</li>
      <li>but I have to say it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>But I still think this is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for years and can&#x27;t seem to find anything else that leaves my hair tangle free, soft, and easy to manage curly or straight.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny and easy to work with.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This conditioner left my hair straight and silky. Exactly how I like to wear my bob. Could not do without it now.</li>
    <li> Everything was great. I received it in a timely manner.  It was the product I wanted.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s pricey but well worth it.  Great for curly, dry, rebellious hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry wavy, course thick hair.  I decided to go out on a limb and buy this very expensive product based on its great reviews.  I had very high expectations for this, so I was a little disappointed when my hair didn&#x27;t turn out silky and soft.  But it did do a better job than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  My hair was a little more soft after the 5 minute treatment.  I will continue to use this product, but I probably won&#x27;t buy a new bottle once it&#x27;s out because it&#x27;s just too expensive!</li>
    <li> Love this product and it is cheaper on Amazon than in the stores</li>
    <li> I bought this with high expectations. I have a curly hair and tried many products. This one not only doesn&#x27;t do what it says but it makes my hair extra rough. It is also expensive. So try a sample begore commit to buy.</li>
    <li> the worst product ever! when i applied this to my hair! it my made my hair fall out as soon as i put it in there! it destroyed my hair! it made it thin! full of chemicals!</li>
    <li> GOOD: I have had highlights in my hair for over 12 years and it has turned my hair to a straw texture.  My stylist won&#x27;t admit that but she says since I hit my 30&#x27;s and I have major gray hair the straw I feel are the grays.  Whatever the case it felt so dry.  I used this product and left it in my hair while I shaved in the shower, then rinsed.  My hair felt soft while rinsing and was easy to brush wet.  When it dryed my hair was noticable different.  Very shiny and smooth.  Very soft and suble.  Now, my dead ends are still dead so I need to cut them off - there is no saving them!  BAD: No instuctions.  Just says rinse off.  No ingredients listed.  While the product was in my hair I noticed my ears and skin on my neck were getting hot and I felt like I was having an allergic reaction.  The 2nd time I used it, the same thing happened.  This won&#x27;t stop me from using it but I will try very hard not to get it on my scalp/skin.  OVERALL: I love this stuff so far but I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.  Products seem to stop working after awhile on me so I will update in time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I had ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is perfect, just the way I want it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use between appointments. I loved the feel of my hair upon leaving the salon. When I used it at home, my hair was tangled and brittle. Additionally, my hair is so straight after blow drying that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, very thick, dry, frizzy hair.  This product actually worked pretty well at calming my hair down (not miraclously so, just good). It is better than other products I have tried. But, and this is a big BUT, it is ridiculously expensive. I read on one website to comb 2 teaspoons of the product through your hair.  I probably used 2 Tablespoons and it lasted for 5 shampoos. That&#x27;s nearly $10 per shampoo!  If I used it everyday, at that rate of use, it would cost me $288 a month (nearly $3,500 a year)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try it again to see if I could use less and still get it through all of my hair. Maybe I will try mixing it with some water first. If I do, I&#x27;ll update my results.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is very coarse and this keeps it under control and give&#x27;s it the moisture it needs.  I went online to purchase this product because it was much more expensive in the salon and saved a lot of money by ordering through Amazon.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is worth all the hype. I have used the purple Kerastase products for colored hair; this one smells and works worse. It feels hair feeling very smooth when wet, but I&#x27;m not sure if it works by just making my hair oilier. Kerastase masque tames the frizz, but I end up needing to wash my hair more often than I&#x27;d like because of greasiness (near roots). I also think that it still leaves my hair somewhat dry (near the tips). I thought it would be a fix-all given its reputation and price... alas it&#x27;s not. I guess I&#x27;m just slightly disappointed, but overall, it&#x27;s still a good product. Just not sure if it&#x27;s worth it to now have greasy hair (near the roots) instead.</li>
    <li> The only product that really does what it says it can do! If used according to the directions or left in your hair for 30 minutes or so and then blown dry, you can achieve a smooth silky finish without the dreaded dry frizz.</li>
    <li> Genuine Kerastase product for a great price, and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I have been this using this product for over 7 years. It&#x27;s great for curly-normal hair... makes it super silky!</li>
    <li> I have used this product a total of four times in a row on my hair and it has completely changed the way my hair looks and feels.  I have naturally curly hair that I wear shorter and straight.  Between the hair dryer and the flat iron, it takes a beating!  But, this masque has totally revolutionized my hair!  It feels so silky and healthy.  This is worth the price!</li>
    <li> Like most shoppers, I initially balked at the price of this product, but I split my first jar with a friend so it wasn&#x27;t such a big gamble for either of us. We both have very, very curly, often fuzzy or frizzy, hair. I have used this product without using the rest of the products in the line (I didn&#x27;t buy any shampoo or any other styling product) and I love it. It makes my hair smooth, soft, and shiny when I style it (I blow dry it straight). You use a very small amount with each treatment, so the price per use isn&#x27;t totally outrageous. My hair still gets wavy when it rains--it&#x27;s not a straightener--but it stays softer, even in high humidity.</li>
    <li> I never had used before buying it, just read the other customer&#x27;s comments. No regrets at all, it does what it says! I have problems with my hair, it is thin and has some waves from the middle towards ends, so if I don&#x27;t brush it there is a disaster (bad hair day every day). This masque really helped on that, I didn&#x27;t use any leave-in neither brushed and it was great!!!</li>
    <li> The taming hair mask works better than this conditioner. But the conditioner is not bad, just not strong enough to fight the brittle frizzies...</li>
    <li> My hair is greying faster by the day.  Which then causes it to be more coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Oleo is perfect for adding moisture to my hair and adding shine after styling.</li>
    <li> Awesome-it makes my hair so soft &amp; silky. Love it-shall buy it again &amp; again-it is expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Always a great product and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> my hair has been loving this stuff for, hmmm, the past 6 months or so, but i just found out -- so much for trusting my trusty hairdresser! -- that it&#x27;s loaded with parabens. what&#x27;s a vain, health-conscious gal to do? suck it up for now &amp; hope for a product that&#x27;s just as delicious but doesn&#x27;t has those nasty cancer-growers in it, which is why i am buying only the small size now, even tho the biggie is an awesome money-saver.</li>
    <li> Love this product!. Have been using it for years and can&#x27;t seem to find anything else that leaves my hair tangle free, soft, and easy to manage curly or straight.</li>
    <li> I am a male with short to mid length hair that has always been dry, frizzy and wavy when grown out to any length.  After years of wearing a very short, razor-cut textured look, I decided to let my hair grow out.  The first six months were an unruly, curly, frizzy mess.  Then I stumbled upon this product.  The frizz control is unparalled.  I have tried Redken products - which are good - but this product by LOreal is world class.  With the Oleo-relax mask my hair is relaxed, but still wavy, and the volume is under control - no frizz!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product 1-2 times per week.  It is important to use regular conditioners on off days.  I use both leave-in products as well as rinses on these days.  Phosphate-free shampoos also help to round things out.  If I use phosphate shampoos I need to treat 2x per week; otherwise 1x per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the best results when I apply the product at the gym, then go into the steam room for 5-10 minutes.  The amount of hydration forced into my hair is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is expensive, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I have think hair and wavy and frizzy so this product really works so great to me love it</li>
    <li> I saw this product featured in Essence magazine and found that it was only availble on thier site or on Amazon.  After additional research decided to purchase and have been hooked ever since.  Comb a small amount in hair after washing, sit under dryer or leave in for 15-20 minute and then lightly rinse out.  You should notice the difference in the texture of your hair immediately.  Great to use with the serum to protect against heating products.  Only downsize is that directions are in French only (go figure).  Great product.</li>
    <li> Awesome for detangling coarse, wavy, and frizz-prone hair, and is a great base for straightening. Can get a bit greasy (especially in hard water) so use only enough to slide smoothly through strands, and alternate with your regular conditioner to get the most out of the small container. This is one of the few hair products I&#x27;ve tried that&#x27;s actually worth the cost. I&#x27;ve been loyal now for years.</li>
    <li> Does well for these two purposes. I use it 3 times a week and it&#x27;s great. Also better price than Kerastase store. Will buy again for sure!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin and curly hair with lots of frizz. This helps emensley with keeping my hair moisturized and healthy. If you try this product you won&#x27;t use other conditioners again!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would be purchasing a conditioner from France, but this is the best.  I don&#x27;t know that I will ever use anything else.  Luxurious and rich, but does not weigh down my hair.  Very excellent quality.</li>
    <li> This is another great product from Kerastase -- and much more reasonable thru amazon.com than in salons, where we first discovered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rinse-out conditioner (or &amp;#34;masque&amp;#34;) that is excellent in taming dry hair and making it thicker, fuller, more manageable.  As with all of this series of Kerastase, including the shampoo, leave-in conditioner, etc., this smells simply great, and quite unlike the cheaper brands from bix box stores.  I usually use it only as a quick rinse-out conditioner;  however, if you leave it in for a while, read the paper, etc., and then rinse out, apparently it works even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is a bit pricey -- even from amazon -- but well worth it.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and always go back to it when I try something new.  My hair is fine and curly and this adds the perfect amount of moisture without weighing my hair down.  It&#x27;s expensive but so worth it and you can use a very small amount with excellent results. I shampoo my hair, towel try and leave this on for 20 min or more.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kerasase Masquintense for the past 15 years and Elixir for me is like the next generation. Left my hair fabulous just remember you cannot put a lot ...so it&#x27;s great and lasts a lot!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a miracle masque for my ultra-dry, extremely curly hair! Worth every penny, even from the salon, but great to find it online for such a bargain!</li>
    <li> It weighed down my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair due to chemical use. Buy this product just out of curiosity and then I found great use. Leaves hair soft and the look of my hair has changed. I just hope to continue using it to see the extent to which transformed my hair. I&#x27;ve only used in 02 opportunities. I want to see if it&#x27;s worth the inversion.De it will be good buying</li>
    <li> Kerastase products do wonders for my hair. I have a long history of dry &amp; damaged hair, but you would never know it when I&#x27;ve used this masque. The transformative effects are incredible. I only wish they lasted beyond a shampoo or two. I&#x27;m not sure how the stuff works, but it does temporarily keep my hair from getting frizzy and out of control.</li>
    <li> I just love this mask! Best product ever!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t just go wrong with kerastase!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have regular, fine, straight hair. When I blast my hair with heat, hot tools and my once every 3 month highlighting sessions, I need this conditioner. It smooths, it calms, it relaxes. My hair feels like it gets a sexy dip in luxury cream. Definitely worth it for sleek hair!</li>
    <li> Naturally curly hair has much less frizz with this easy to use product and less tangled long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax for a friend and she loves it. Would buy it again despite the price.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leave my hair soft, silky, and smooth. I just can&#x27;t use anything else.  I use it everyday because I love it. Although it is expensive, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this item because it makes my hair silky and smooth, it&#x27;s a great conditioning system, and I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> My hair would be doomed if it wasn&#x27;t for this amazing product. Totally worth the price and more. I flat-iron and curl my hair ALL THE TIME. But you wouldn&#x27;t know by looking at it and I owe that to this magnificent thing!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely not worth the high price.  It was no better than the drugstore brands that are a fraction of the cost.  I have mildly frizzy hair - nothing outrageous and if this did not work for me, it will certainly not work on hair that is coarse or really frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this one.......</li>
    <li> I love it .. Great product. Worth the money</li>
    <li> Leave my hair really silky. And that&#x27;s not easy to do in Florida&#x27;s humidity with curly hair. I was really surprised.</li>
    <li> Kerastase Oleo-Relax Masque is pretty much the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It leaves my hair visibly smoother,shinier and healthier than anything else out there.  The only drawback would be the ridiculous price but that&#x27;s pretty easy to get over when I run my fingers through my silky mane!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, extra curly and rebellions and this product has been a life saver. A little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I have use the products from the line Kerastase for years and they original are great thus the reason to expend a bit more when purchasing the products. The item I received does not smell or have the similar texture than the original. It is a heavy product it was filled to the lid which is also unusual and to top it of it comes with a stiker stating &amp;#34;this product is new&amp;#34;. A new product does not need such statement. No one purchasing was expecting anything less than new and better yet the original product. Loreal should be aware of vendors tampering with their great line as it is a disservice to the company and to those that purchase it trusting this vendor.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever - I know its costly - but it works.  My hair is smoother and I feel like I do not have split ends.  I have well water - so its really hard on my hair - but this helps!</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I love this product and the price was great.  Getting ready to order from them again.  Expect same, terrific results.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am a black female with very textured, relaxed hair. Upon the recommendations of several others I decided to try this masque and I am so glad that I did! I used it after prepooing and co-washing my hair with wonderful results! Bear in mind that it has been almost six weeks since my last relaxer, so I had a bit of new growth at my roots to contend with. But, that was no problem after using this stuff! One thing I love about Kerastase products is that they perform just as they claim they will. For me, that is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the oleo-relax shampoo, anti-frizz masque (basically conditioner), and serum. They work wonderfully together. My hair is much, much less frizzy even on rainy days and through workouts, and the volume has reduced without making my hair look flat. Another advantage of these products is that they don&#x27;t leave hair feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (like John Frieda products) or greasy (like some other hair oils). My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice. The price is high, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable for how well this line of products works. One last note... I have used some shampoos/conditioners that seem to cause dandruff. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had that product, if it&#x27;s caused my scalp irritation or what, but I have very sensitive skin, and these Kerastase products haven&#x27;t bothered my scalp or caused breakouts on my face. They also smell lovely. Not too flowery or fruity or anything.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever the straighten Curly Hair!</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  It makes my hair soft, shiny and easy to work with.  I also use Kerastase Oleo-Relax Anti-Frizz shampoo and love the products.</li>
    <li> I have dry frizzy damaged hair and use this every week. I leave it in my hair for 30-60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;All the Kerastase products are amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING KERASTASE OLEO-RELAX ANTI-FRIZZ FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  I USE IT ONCE A WEEK TO KEEP IT HEALTHY AND REDUCE ANY RISK OF DAMAGE FROM OTHER HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> This brand is really  good and I like this product for my dry and curly long hair. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I do not think this was an authentic product. Product was not even sealed in the package.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the star item between it and the shampoo. My hair was dry, dull, and frizzy, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything at the drug store or salon that could compare. It&#x27;s definitely a splurge, and I wish it would last as long as the bottle of shampoo, but it&#x27;s worth it. I don&#x27;t get mani/pedis regularly, I don&#x27;t buy brand new cars or the latest and greatest in cell phone technology. I spend my dollars on my hair and this stuff is worth it. Subtle yet elegant and expensive smell. I have to ring my hair out after each use because it&#x27;s helping my hair hold a ton of moisture. I&#x27;m back to getting lots of compliments on my hair and who wouldn&#x27;t love that?</li>
    <li> Really controls my dry and frizzy hair.  Makes my hair look healthy and controllable.</li>
    <li> not as good as i thought. started to have dandruff after using</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair colorist for my over-treated hair.</li>
    <li> I used Kerastase Oleo-Relax years ago, but after trying a lot of other conditioners, etc.. I have gone back. I have very curly hair, but not very thick. I straighten out my hair after each shampooing and the Masque leaves my hair very manageable and straight. Love the product and would recommend it to everyone that is looking to reduce frizz in their hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My sister turned me on to it and I in turn turned my mom on to it. We all love it, we each have different hair types and it works wonders for all 3 of us.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about this product.  I have thick, highlighted hair that has a tendency to be frizzy (the more grey the more unruly).  The sent is very strong but I am pretty sensitive to perfume smells so many may like it.  I used it in conjunction with the shampoo and it worked wonders.  I was able to do my hair and get the smooth look that my hair stylist achieves.  Due to the smell I only use if when I am going out and want that extra control but I have to say it is worth the money.  Does not over condition (greasy) as long as I avoid the roots.  Leaves hair silky and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair masque. But like all other products, the first few times I used it my hair really shined. Then after using it a few more times my hair started not responding as greatly to this product. But I still think this is worth the price. Specially if you have thick hair like I do.</li>
