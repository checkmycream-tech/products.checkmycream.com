<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product for the price.  Using twice daily in a vegetable capsule for weightloss along with peppermint and another essential oil.</li>
    <li> I love this I use it for my skin mixing. Will buy again. I make it with my organic coconut oil .</li>
    <li> was smelling like grapefruit ok, the smell not so pungent or overwhelming. For the price, nothing could beat.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and has calmed my skin!!  I have a unique skin disorder that gets very inflamed at times.  This oil seems to calm my skin yet not strip it from moisture that my skin needs.</li>
    <li> I love this grapefruit essential oil!  I usually just inhale it for 6 deep breaths and I feel so rejuvinated.  Since it is therapeutic grade I will try it in a glass of herbal tea like I do with the lemon essential oil.  Yummers!!!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the oil and the company&#x27;s service...</li>
    <li> I use this oil when making a blend of attractive energizing fragrances to lift my spirits and help me feel better.  It does an excellent job and the aroma is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great scent! Love this addition to my essential oils!</li>
    <li> beautiful smell not pink grapefruit tho just smells like normal grapefruit</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy has an excellent selection of quality oils. I purchased the larger size of the pink grapefruit essential oil because I find that I use it almost as often as I do lavender. The price is not reflective of the quality. Thank you Plant Therapy!</li>
    <li> I love this! It smells great, and oh what a price! I&#x27;ll be back for more and more and more!</li>
    <li> Great oil. Fantastic smell.</li>
    <li> I Adore Plant Therapy&#x27;s Grapefruit essential oil.  It is my go to oil when I need a pick me up and is really honest and truly pleasant.  I have smelled, spark naturals, doTerra, Eden&#x27;s Garden, etc and this is just perfect.</li>
    <li> It drips a little faster than my other essential oils, but other than that it&#x27;s awesome! Pink grapefruit is one of my favorite scents now. I like to use a few drops of it, tangerine, and lemon oils in my homemade dishwasher detergent for a multi-citrus scent that also smells super clean! I use it in other cleaning products too!</li>
    <li> This is a very good essential oil - use lots of scents and run out of grapefruit the most frequently...was looking for a company with a good price and a true scent - this one is it.  Would purchase from them again...!</li>
    <li> This smells so fresh and invigorating! I love it! The 6 bottles will last a long time though, so I don&#x27;t expect to be buying it again anytime soon, but I will if I run out! This reminds me of Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt!</li>
    <li> Grapefruit [pink] essential oil is said to be great to use to freshen up mattresses - mixed with baking soda. This one spells fresh &amp; bright. It is also nice to simply open &amp; sniff!  Once I noticed that, I read up a bit more and there are many other uses.</li>
    <li> This oil is very strong and I use a drop of it in my handsoap bottles. I love the smell. You used to be able to buy grapefruit scented hand and dish soap, but they&#x27;ve gotten so expensive that I don&#x27;t buy them any more. Now I can have them again at a fraction of the cost. Also try a drop on your finger and wiping the top of a lightbulb before you turn it on. When you do turn it on it scents the room. I would recommend this oil to just about everyone. Who doesn&#x27;t like a clean smell?</li>
    <li> I LOVE grapefruit anything, and purchased this oil mainly to add the scent to lotions, dish soap, etc. It has a wonderful smell and works well for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your fast, professional service!  The grapefruit essential oil is perfect.  I look forward to ordering again soon in the future.</li>
    <li> little bottle but has a powerful grapefruit essence, just few drops is all you need . love it!!!</li>
    <li> I had read that the essence of pink grapefruit essential oil helped to lessen appetite, therefore, assisting with dieting.  After a few minutes of application, I could no longer smell the grapefruit.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the grapefruit oil,  but received cinnamon oil instead. Was very disappointed and did not realize until it was opened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve mixed this with coconut oil and keep a jar at my desk for mid day moisturization and rejuvenation! Love it!</li>
    <li> I only need two drops in a two cup mixture of epson salt and baking soda for a wonderful bath treat.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent, will definitely be re-ordering! I Love, love, love this scent in my DIY body butter.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my friend and he likes it very much, and i guess it is useful for him. whatever i rate 5 stars are great to have.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of this oil!  Very refreshing and uplifting.  Was packaged great and was here quickly.</li>
    <li> Almost ruined my diffuser.  This is not pure.  It smells good, but I just use it to clean with now.</li>
    <li> This oil has a very pleasant citrusy uplifting scent. I use it in cleaning products, in personal care products (bath salts, lotions, lip balm, etc), and in my diffuser. It mixes really well with peppermint to give a great &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34; in the afternoons when I start to get tired and slow-moving. The scent is said to help decrease appetite and increase good mood. Along with Lemon, this is my favorite for cleaning because it leaves the room smelling delicately fresh and does a great job of cutting through grime while still being gentle on surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many essential oil brands (Young Living, DoTerra, Eden&#x27;s Garden, NOW, KIS oils, etc) and Plant Therapy has consistently been a favorite in my household. The more I learn about using essential oils, the more I appreciate this brand for its ability to provide quality, therapeutic grade oils at reasonable and accessible prices. I also like that PT offers these 30 ml bottles, which are a much better value than the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> Excellent essential oil.</li>
    <li> wife been enjoying this for over a year and I&#x27;ve been re-buying.  She seemed to like it and enjoyed it the past year.</li>
    <li> 1 oz. at this price was high given the quility of the oil. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again there are better choices through the wholesale market.</li>
    <li> For the price it is ok, but the scent is very underwhelming. My empty bottle from Plantlife has a stronger aroma.</li>
    <li> Ordered 30ml bottle. Came quickly in the Plant Therapy green package. Love this EO. It&#x27;s helping my food cravings a LOT.</li>
    <li> Beautiful natural aroma, mixes easily with a carrier oil, dispenses through a handy dropper tip.</li>
    <li> One of my absolute favorite EO.  I use it in everything from homemade handsoap to household cleaners.  This is one EO that everyone should have!!</li>
    <li> Smells really nice but I wish the scent was longer lasting.</li>
    <li> I love grapefruit oil and have purchased a few.  This one is superior to others.  It is a light, sweet invigorating fragrance.  The bottle does dispense quickly, so use carefully until you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using essential oils for years and love grapefruit to revive and control appetite suppressant. This brand is cheap and thats what you get. Doesnt have much of a scent and does not smell like real grapefruit oil should. Now oils are very good for the price. I use Now grapefruit and love it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, however, you have to use a lot of it in the diffuser. I also put a few drops in my water. It has helped me kick my Coke Zero habit!</li>
    <li> I love this grapefruit oil. I use it in my laundry softener. I just mix several drops into some distilled vinegar and add it to the fabric softener compartment in my washing machine.</li>
    <li> Grapefruit scent is known to increase the metabolism in your body and brain(prefrontal cortex).&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my clinic to give refreshing feeling to our patients. They love it, but I couldn&#x27;t find what I bought before.&lt;br /&gt;So, I have to chose from some here, but I didn&#x27;t know which one would smell the best.&lt;br /&gt;Well, so I just bought 3 of them (although I know I can&#x27;t return them after I opened it).&lt;br /&gt;First when it arrived, it was old and smell bad, then the seller was kind enough to send me the new one to replace.  And the new one smell so much better, so I like it as much as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, here is what I bought in order I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Now Foods Grapefruit Oil, 1-Ounce... most fresh and close to real grapefruit smell&lt;br /&gt;2) Grapefruit 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 30 ml... this was not too bad either&lt;br /&gt;2) Grapefruit Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade... very fresh &amp; sweet smell.</li>
    <li> I use essential oils for homeopathic [external] remedies, as well as for scented body oils. I prefer the citrus family for my oils. A base of grapeseed oil and grapefruit essential oil [I added lemon essential oil as well]  is a lovely after shower moisturizer, and I can pronounce all the ingredients.The scent lasts also.</li>
    <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> This is a very aromatic grapefruit essential oil.  I recommend it to anyone who likes grapefruit.  I mix it with other essential oils and water to make a room spray.  Yummy!</li>
    <li> Helps me curb my appetite and is so easy to put a few drops in my water in the morning and evening</li>
    <li> Smells just like it should, Invigorating like slicing open a grapefruit.  Like to put a few drops into my floor vents, makes the house smell  clean and fresh, also use in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> The smell is beautiful, but you need a lot to make an impact in any lotion or perfume. Would probably try a different brand next time to see if I could get something with more oomph.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me like it worked for someone else</li>
    <li> I add this to my ice water. Love the way It tastes...yummy!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because I did not get any results from this product.  I will not use or recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade cleaning solution that I use for cleaning my kitchen and bath. The scent is lovely and really gives the house a clean scent. Love it! Only problem is they don&#x27;t sell this stuff in a larger size!</li>
    <li> Excellent Stuff! Will order again</li>
    <li> This is perfect to lift your mood on a cold and frozen morning, lol. We use it in a burner so the home is infused with the fresh smell of grapefruits.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this oil.  It was purchased because I no longer want to shell out $100 for Jo Malone&#x27;s Grapefruit fragrance.  It blends will with carriers (I use grape seed oil).</li>
    <li> Most of the time I use this instead of perfumes or colognes.  I find it very pleasant.  Of course, this is a matter of taste...</li>
    <li> Anyone into essential oils will need this for thier collection.  I have been amazed at all the little wonders. Thanks</li>
    <li> I received my order as placed. No problems. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The Plant Therapy Essential Oils are simply wonderful! Very high quality! The Grapefruit Essential oil smells like heaven! Excellent price also!</li>
    <li> This is my second order of the pink grapefruit oil. Love the pure uplifting scent. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy is #1 in my book for quality, and the price just can not be beat.</li>
    <li> This smells like a fresh, sweet grapefruit! The container is nice. I can dispense a few drops without a mess. I am new to using essential oils, so I am learning how to use it in my home.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t very strong and I needed to use a lot in my diffuser to really notice it in the room (and I was close to the diffuser). Smells nice and citrusy but more on the bitter side than the sweet one. Good size bottle however.</li>
    <li> love this oil!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mixed with witch hazel as a facial astringent and toner. I&#x27;m pleased with the affects of the grapefruit but I wish it had a stronger smell. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like much of anything to me. I would like to use grapefruit essential oil in a body lotion but will wait until I find one with a more refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> I like this mixed with eucalyptus.  Its an invigorating scent. Worked great in my oil burner and for bath salts and sugar scrubs. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This has got to be my favorite scent of all the essential oils - so clean, tart, fresh and citrusy!  An excellent essential oil.</li>
    <li> I use this scent at home in an electric fan type diffuser.  Makes the whole house smell fresh and clean without smelling too strong.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly followed the advice of a fellow Amazon customer and started adding the grapefruit essential oil to my Air-O-Swiss evaporative humidifier. Well, it has a Styrofoam ring in it and the oil has eaten through part of the ring. Bummer.</li>
    <li> 2 drops every morning. My Mom loves it. She makes a citrus mix and is very happy.It defenitly has a wonderful citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described. It smells great! The shipping was quick. I am perfectly satisfied with this product. Recommended if looking for grapefruit oil.</li>
    <li> Recieved on time &amp; as expected.  I use a lot of essential oils in cleaning and Grapefruit (or Citrus Seed) is needed a lot so it was nice to find a 30ml bottle for a reasonable price.  Free shipping was nice too.  :)</li>
    <li> Eucalyptus Essential Oil. 30 ml (1 oz). 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade. (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;please the product does need to be thicker and does not hold smell very long at all I use these oils for my perfumes because of my COPD can not use over the counter fragrance please either maker the oils thicker ,maybe I could mix young living oils with the plant therapy so it would last</li>
    <li> like the oil wonderful</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with all of the Plant Therapy oils I have purchased!</li>
    <li> Decent value for the price, but when mixed with body butter/carrier oils, it is not a very strong smell. I had to use a LOT for it to be as strong as I wanted it.</li>
    <li> Great flavor! Love it.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil for my diffuser. Not watered down. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil for different things and these are great.</li>
