    <li> Be aware with this product! I used it twice a day for almost two months and I didn&#x27;t see any changes at all. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> After a month and a half of using it, I still can see my veins, but they are definitely better.</li>
    <li> In fact, you can barely see them on the inside of the ankle because I had them on both sides on both legs and they were very prominent.  I used twice a day and waited to put clothes or socks on to make sure it absorbed completely into my legs.  It can take up to 6 months to see changes with products like this, whether it&#x27;s for veins or for wrinkles or hair growth.  Nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried has worked in a week or two, or even a month.  It always takes time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t  seen any inprovement</li>

    <li> Not as good as I thought at the price I paid I&#x27;d rather return it and get my money back and just buy a reg lotion cuz it&#x27;s not doing anything dif then making skin soft just like lotion dose but lotion is cheaper way cheaper so it sucks</li>
