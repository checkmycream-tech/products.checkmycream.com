### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Thank you for the wonderful product, has arrived on time, and as described  have a great weekend</li>
      <li>Does a great job cleaning too.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work great.</li>
      <li>and I have a good feeling</li>
      <li>Yes it is a good toothpaste, I&#x27;ll give you that, but eventually they&#x27;ll reduce the size to 1 oz for $10.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting for a good whitening toothpaste for maybe 2-3 years now</li>
      <li>:) My gums are pinker and teeth are shiny!    </li>
      <li>It makes your teeth feel amazing.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste has a nice balance...not too minty, not too salty, not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>Although I liked this toothpaste, and the way it made my teeth feel, I eventually  had to throw it away.  </li>
      <li>have found this product very effective in preventing tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, natural, and great tasting.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste, after using it in Germany, I was thrilled to buy it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this seems to have a nice balance.</li>
      <li>Been using this for over three years now after reading up on how this product is safe and chemical-free.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>what more can you want?</li>
      <li>it takes to traverse the globe safely.</li>
      <li>Neither my husband nor I could use it more than once.</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t feel like it kept my teeth very clean.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very easy to rinse the paste clean off.    </li>
      <li>But most important, the TSA limits the size of carryon items over 3 oz.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re avoiding fluoride, you can use this stuff like mustard and feel safe, because it&#x27;s fluoride free.</li>
      <li>It has almost no plastic packaging; just a cardboard box and a metal tube, which can easily be recycled.</li>
      <li>I will thank Weleda for the years they made this product available to me at a good price and a decent size.</li>
      <li>Very effective teeth cleaner and left my mouth</li>
      <li>Love the clean feel and the fresh breath.</li>
      <li>Has a fresh clean taste rather than the sugary flavor found in most toothpastes.</li>
      <li>The salt one is pretty potent with a very fresh peppermint flavor.</li>
      <li>do think it polishes well, as my teeth always feel super clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>How DO the Swiss brush away traces of their chocolates and strangely sweet cheeses?&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Most city water has fluoride added, the last thing you need is more of it in your dental hygiene products.</li>
      <li>There just aren&#x27;t any other good options available, even in so-called health food brands (Tom&#x27;s of Maine,</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste, my teeth feel extra clean and look brighter and whiter!</li>
      <li>The Weleda Salt Toothpaste whitened my teeth after the first brushing, no joke!</li>
      <li>the price is HIGHER!</li>
      <li>But I have to ask myself, is it the toothpaste, or am I just brushing a little longer because I&#x27;m imagining myself in a snowy chalet, happily scrubbing away while some Swiss song plays on a funky Euroradio I have plugged into a twelve pronged socket, or whatever they have over there.</li>
      <li>I do buy and try many natural toothpastes, but this one just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>It is worth it.</li>
      <li>Cleans better, refreshes, and is all natural.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s WORTH it.    </li>
      <li>I also tried the Redman&#x27;s salt stuff (Earthpaste), but that has Xylitol which I&#x27;m not crazy about (was making my stomach hurt after trying their suggestion of swallowing--bad idea).</li>
      <li>With regular toothpastes, I would squeeze out a pretty good amount and the tube would last me the better part of a year.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to EVERYONE looking for clean, shiny, white, healthy teeth without having to wait 30 days for results.</li>
      <li>This stuff does the job and is pretty comparable in my experience to the Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste which I like for the lack of additives.</li>
      <li>I look forward to being able to bring my regular toothpaste in my carryon kit.</li>
      <li>It is considered very healthy there, and was available long before German store shelves became crowded with Crest and Colgate.</li>
      <li>so learn from my mistakes: make sure to hold your toothbrush upright while twisting the cap back on because it WILL fall off your brush!</li>
      <li>Arm And Hammer used to have a tooth powder, which was mostly baking soda, and this tastes very similar to that.</li>
      <li>It does kind of suck that you get LESS product at a HIGHER price but trust me</li>
      <li>Very favorite toothpaste...takes a few uses to get used to the grittier texture</li>
      <li>Enough salt to support healthy ph balance and enough mint to make it fresh!</li>
      <li>toothpaste has that expected salty granular feel, but you love it after the first try.</li>
      <li>It is very highly scented, too:  </li>
      <li>I wish the price tag was a little smaller, but this is the best toothpaste you can buy to protect your teeth and your overall health.</li>
      <li>That foaming btw does absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>All of this really wakes you up in the morning, and freaks out houseguests.</li>
      <li>Using the Weleda is very Earth-Friendly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really smitten with the idea of traveling.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like the taste of this one,</li>
      <li>One of the first things I noticed was many fewer little mouth sores - which has continued.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste IS BETTER then any other I have tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for a few days, but I am so thrilled!</li>
      <li>This is my first natural toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>WELEDA WORKS BETTER THAN EVERY OTHER TOOTHPASTE I&#x27;VE TRIED!</li>
      <li>tube is a satisfying metal thing, like a little capped submarine.</li>
      <li>Cleans and leaves a lasting fresh taste.</li>
      <li>At first the saltiness tastes pretty strong, but after a few uses you only notice the peppermint flavor.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this natural toothpaste, but it didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
      <li>When it comes to quality health or beauty items, I make no qualms about a higher price tag, especially when the product handles both (health and beauty).</li>
      <li>No one uses more than a small amount because of the taste, and we use a fluoride toothpaste at bedtime, because nothing on the label says that there is fluoride in the Weleda.</li>
      <li>alternate between the electric toothbrush and a regular daily, just to be sure I&#x27;m not missing</li>
      <li>Unlike the toothpastes normally available in the US, Weleda is salty, not sweet, and is a shock to the system at first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The SLS dries out the gums because it&#x27;s a detergent, which interferes with natural immune function in the mouth.</li>
      <li>I use a salt or salt n&#x27; soda toothpaste before brushing with my regular toothpaste because it whitens and really breaks up the tarter.</li>
      <li>Instead, I lean on items like this to give me a taste (pun intended) of far away places.</li>
      <li>feeling naturally refreshed.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>this toothpaste tastes pretty salty and at the first moment you might not like it - but keep using it for a couple of days and you wont want to switch back again to conventional toothpastes</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t sweet and it takes a little getting used too-</li>
      <li>SLS is not only a toxic chemical, but it is an extremely common allergy and many suffer mouth ulcers from their toothpaste without knowing the culprit.</li>
      <li>The grit that you feel when using Weleda isn&#x27;t silica (a major part of sand) at all, it is salt and baking soda, which cannot harm your tooth enamel.</li>
      <li>After a sugary snack or hell, a meal in general, my teeth would have \\&quot;fuzzy slippers.\\&quot; Not with this toothpaste, the clean, slick feeling lasts all day.    </li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s gums were sore and soft, bleeding each time she brushed.</li>
      <li>It is gritty and feels like someone supercharged your toothbrush, and your teeth start feeling as if you just had a professional cleaning all the time.</li>
      <li>The grittiness of this paste really makes the mouth feel clean without that foamy residue and flavor that traditional toothpaste leaves behind.</li>
      <li>One thing I&#x27;ve also noticed is that my teeth feel super slick ALL day.</li>
      <li>but once you get past this you don&#x27;t notice anymore and only notice the unbelievably minty fresh, clean feeling left.</li>
      <li>Like really windy, and a little bit of sand gets in the mix, because there is a gritty feel to this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>see other people upset about the new smaller size, but I see a couple of benefits.</li>
      <li>Not salty like a bucket of chicken, more like walking near the ocean when it&#x27;s windy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews here on Amazon, but I just had to sing the praises of this toothpaste.    I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for a few days, but I am so thrilled! I bought this simply because of all the glowing reviews across the web and decided to try it - why not? When it comes to quality health or beauty items, I make no qualms about a higher price tag, especially when the product handles both (health and beauty). It does kind of suck that you get LESS product at a HIGHER price but trust me, it&#x27;s WORTH it.    With regular toothpastes, I would squeeze out a pretty good amount and the tube would last me the better part of a year. Since this doesn&#x27;t foam, I find I try to use literally a pea sized amount and I have a good feeling the tube will last me several months. I&#x27;ve already inadvertently wasted some of the product (and you don&#x27;t wanna waste anything that&#x27;s more expensive than usual) so learn from my mistakes: make sure to hold your toothbrush upright while twisting the cap back on because it WILL fall off your brush! And only use a FEW DROPS of water to dampen your brush, it&#x27;s very easy to rinse the paste clean off.    It&#x27;s only been two days and I&#x27;ve already gotten comments on how shiny and white my teeth look! I&#x27;ve been hunting for a good whitening toothpaste for maybe 2-3 years now and I hate waiting the requisite 30 days before I see any results (and then having to use the whole tube anyway so as not to waste it). The Weleda Salt Toothpaste whitened my teeth after the first brushing, no joke! I&#x27;m looking forward to its continued use. :) My gums are pinker and teeth are shiny!    One thing I&#x27;ve also noticed is that my teeth feel super slick ALL day. After a sugary snack or hell, a meal in general, my teeth would have \\&quot;fuzzy slippers.\\&quot; Not with this toothpaste, the clean, slick feeling lasts all day.    The salty taste is new, but far from unpleasant. The peppermint flavor gives me something to focus on while I brush away, but I can&#x27;t help butto think perhaps some vanilla extract would work wonders for the taste. It does linger if you prod around with your tongue, but its nothing noticeable.    I would recommend this product to EVERYONE looking for clean, shiny, white, healthy teeth without having to wait 30 days for results. I will never go back to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, my teeth feel extra clean and look brighter and whiter!</li>
    <li> No flouride or other toxic ingredients. No sugar. Has a fresh clean taste rather than the sugary flavor found in most toothpastes. Does a great job cleaning too.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that has both no fluoride AND no sodium laureth sulfate. Other fluoride-free brands like Tom&#x27;s of Maine use SLS, and ones like Natural Care have no SLS but have fluoride. Fluoride is a toxic chemical linked to bone, joint, skin and teeth problems. Yes, they put fluoride in toothpaste despite it being known to cause dental fluorosis. Most city water has fluoride added, the last thing you need is more of it in your dental hygiene products. SLS is not only a toxic chemical, but it is an extremely common allergy and many suffer mouth ulcers from their toothpaste without knowing the culprit. I wish the price tag was a little smaller, but this is the best toothpaste you can buy to protect your teeth and your overall health.</li>
    <li> Cleans and leaves a lasting fresh taste.</li>
    <li> Very favorite toothpaste...takes a few uses to get used to the grittier texture but once you get past this you don&#x27;t notice anymore and only notice the unbelievably minty fresh, clean feeling left. Been using this for over three years now after reading up on how this product is safe and chemical-free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this Salt Toothpaste  for a long time. All of a sudden when I go to re-order it again, I saw that they have REDUCED the size from 3.3 oz to 2.5 oz and the price is HIGHER! I&#x27;m sorry, but there are just so many things I&#x27;ll be taken for and a fool isn&#x27;t one of them. I won&#x27;t be buying this product anymore. Yes it is a good toothpaste, I&#x27;ll give you that, but eventually they&#x27;ll reduce the size to 1 oz for $10. Well they can keep it.  I will thank Weleda for the years they made this product available to me at a good price and a decent size.</li>
    <li> I use a salt or salt n&#x27; soda toothpaste before brushing with my regular toothpaste because it whitens and really breaks up the tarter. I really don&#x27;t like the taste of this one, although....it works.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this natural toothpaste, but it didn&#x27;t deliver. I didn&#x27;t have any bad issues with it, but for the price I was not impressed. It didn&#x27;t work great. I read reviews before I purchased it about people having an issue with the taste. I&#x27;ll admit that the taste didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It wasn&#x27;t bad. I just didn&#x27;t feel like it kept my teeth very clean. I do buy and try many natural toothpastes, but this one just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Although I liked this toothpaste, and the way it made my teeth feel, I eventually  had to throw it away.  The pink toothpaste started turning grey, and the tube seems to be made of aluminum.  From the way the toothpaste aged in just a few months, I would guess it&#x27;s uncoated aluminum as well, so eventually I threw it away.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the job and is pretty comparable in my experience to the Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste which I like for the lack of additives. Burt&#x27;s however really sucks at packaging and it makes a huge mess. The salt flavor doesn&#x27;t bother me but I&#x27;m not coming from a Crest toxic toothpaste (which gets you so addicted to sweet that anything thats not drenched in Saccharin tastes off--you get used to that, takes a few weeks but you&#x27;ll get your taste buds back). I also tried the Redman&#x27;s salt stuff (Earthpaste), but that has Xylitol which I&#x27;m not crazy about (was making my stomach hurt after trying their suggestion of swallowing--bad idea). The Weleda stuff feels very European and is lacking in the American obsession with the experience of foaming at the mouth like a rabid dog. That foaming btw does absolutely nothing, it is 100% psychological (my father is a dentist).</li>
    <li> this toothpaste tastes pretty salty and at the first moment you might not like it - but keep using it for a couple of days and you wont want to switch back again to conventional toothpastes</li>
    <li> This is my first natural toothpaste.  I have never liked real toothpaste and can&#x27;t understand why I didn&#x27;t try something like this before.  Once I got past the brown color I was pleasantly surprised.  Very effective teeth cleaner and left my mouth feeling naturally refreshed.</li>
    <li> Cleans better, refreshes, and is all natural. what more can you want?</li>
    <li> Thank you for the wonderful product, has arrived on time, and as described  have a great weekend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really smitten with the idea of traveling. But when it comes down to it, I don&#x27;t have the money or self-preservation skills (I&#x27;ve accepted checks for Craigslist deals) it takes to traverse the globe safely. Instead, I lean on items like this to give me a taste (pun intended) of far away places. How DO the Swiss brush away traces of their chocolates and strangely sweet cheeses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is a satisfying metal thing, like a little capped submarine. Upon squeezing, a slightly unsightly poop of congealed gravy is ejected onto your toothbrush. If you can get past that, you&#x27;re in for a treat, if salty toothpaste appeals to you. Arm And Hammer used to have a tooth powder, which was mostly baking soda, and this tastes very similar to that. Not salty like a bucket of chicken, more like walking near the ocean when it&#x27;s windy. Like really windy, and a little bit of sand gets in the mix, because there is a gritty feel to this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re avoiding fluoride, you can use this stuff like mustard and feel safe, because it&#x27;s fluoride free. If you are a fluorideophile, you can use this paste in conjunction with a rinse like ACT ([[ASIN:B0012DX2VS ACT Anticavity Fluroide Rinse Alcohol]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it polishes well, as my teeth always feel super clean after I use it. But I have to ask myself, is it the toothpaste, or am I just brushing a little longer because I&#x27;m imagining myself in a snowy chalet, happily scrubbing away while some Swiss song plays on a funky Euroradio I have plugged into a twelve pronged socket, or whatever they have over there.</li>
    <li> I was unable to tolerate the taste of this toothpaste, so my review is rather limited. I just want to warn people that the saltiness is mixed with a very &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; mint flavor and is extremely unpleasant. Neither my husband nor I could use it more than once.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a nice balance...not too minty, not too salty, not too overpowering. I&#x27;ve tried many and this seems to have a nice balance. Enough salt to support healthy ph balance and enough mint to make it fresh!</li>
    <li> I changed to Weleda toothpaste a number of years ago when I wanted something without flouride and sodium lauryl sulfate components. There just aren&#x27;t any other good options available, even in so-called health food brands (Tom&#x27;s of Maine, are you listening?) One of the first things I noticed was many fewer little mouth sores - which has continued. The SLS dries out the gums because it&#x27;s a detergent, which interferes with natural immune function in the mouth. I go back and forth with the salt and pink ratannhia version. The salt one is pretty potent with a very fresh peppermint flavor. A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other people upset about the new smaller size, but I see a couple of benefits. One is that using such small amounts, it will be fresher when you open the next tube sooner. But most important, the TSA limits the size of carryon items over 3 oz. Supposedly even if it is almost gone, if the tube says 3.3 ounces, they can take it away. I look forward to being able to bring my regular toothpaste in my carryon kit.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, after using it in Germany, I was thrilled to buy it here on Amazon. It is considered very healthy there, and was available long before German store shelves became crowded with Crest and Colgate. Unlike the toothpastes normally available in the US, Weleda is salty, not sweet, and is a shock to the system at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste, [[ASIN:B0013NP9FE Weleda: Natural Salt Toothpaste, 2.5 oz]] is scary looking when you first squeeze some out of the tube and onto your toothbrush:  it is brown. Not off-white or eggshell, but the brown of a brown paper bag. It is very highly scented, too:  Weleda contains mint, eucalyptus and tea tree essential oils. All of this really wakes you up in the morning, and freaks out houseguests. (heh, heh, heh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it comes down to it, does the stuff work?  YES! WELEDA WORKS BETTER THAN EVERY OTHER TOOTHPASTE I&#x27;VE TRIED! The grit that you feel when using Weleda isn&#x27;t silica (a major part of sand) at all, it is salt and baking soda, which cannot harm your tooth enamel. It is gritty and feels like someone supercharged your toothbrush, and your teeth start feeling as if you just had a professional cleaning all the time. My daughter&#x27;s gums were sore and soft, bleeding each time she brushed. No longer - the Weleda baking soda and the tea tree oil&#x27;s disinfectant properties healed her gums and they are hard and pink as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s pricey, but one tube lasts a very long time. No one uses more than a small amount because of the taste, and we use a fluoride toothpaste at bedtime, because nothing on the label says that there is fluoride in the Weleda. Using the Weleda is very Earth-Friendly. It has almost no plastic packaging; just a cardboard box and a metal tube, which can easily be recycled. Only the cap is plastic, which I think is unavoidable.</li>
    <li> Try this one on and off with the Marvis toothpaste. Love the clean feel and the fresh breath. Even in the morning - no dragon morning breath. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.  It isn&#x27;t sweet and it takes a little getting used too- it is minty and salty.  The salt seems to neutralize the mint a little bit and make it so that my mouth recovers from the flavor assault of tooth brushing faster than with conventional toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is light reddish brown (can discolor toothbrush bristles at base) and doesn&#x27;t stick to the toothbrush very well so apply carefully.  It is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. At first the saltiness tastes pretty strong, but after a few uses you only notice the peppermint flavor. The grittiness of this paste really makes the mouth feel clean without that foamy residue and flavor that traditional toothpaste leaves behind. I recommend it to anyone, especially those looking to avoid flouride.</li>
    <li> This product is now fairly difficult to find at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I have found this product very effective in preventing tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, natural, and great tasting. I would recommend it for all adults.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste IS BETTER then any other I have tried. I&#x27;ve been all over the map. Over whitening etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste has that expected salty granular feel, but you love it after the first try. It makes your teeth feel amazing. I have a bad sweet tooth, this gets that film layer that candy or cake leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It noticeably whitened my teeth! Maybe by removing what other toothpastes left behind, or because it continually removes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between the electric toothbrush and a regular daily, just to be sure I&#x27;m not missing places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not foam up like cr3st, c0lgat3 etc.</li>
