      <li>I wear it all the time and plan on ordering another bottle to keep in my purse and one at home :)</li>
      <li>Found this during my travels in an airport shop and just fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for pretty much any day, it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything like that.</li>
      <li>I loved the smell so much I almost purchased in the store.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume and smell, very fresh for spring.</li>
      <li>This perfume smells so good, it&#x27;s a very adult, clean scent!</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance and the price was right.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this perfume!!!</li>
      <li>I ordered Gucci Flora because i love this smell, it delivered in two days,i was very glad, smell is the same, but in one hour it&#x27;s disappearing.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Smells great and stays on me a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and sweet and floral.&lt;br /&gt;However, 30 mins after I spray it on me</li>
      <li>so I was excited when I purchased it here.</li>
      <li>Came in original packaging, sealed.  </li>
      <li>wish it&#x27;d be longer lasting, but it&#x27;s good for the price,</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s really aromatic.</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon :)</li>
      <li>Smells good, just do not directly inhale the droplets.</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to be the real fragrance with that price tag, but it still smells pretty good!</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and pretty</li>
      <li>I bought this fragrance from Macy&#x27;s before, and the beautiful scent would last really long.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>oh so ready to wear it!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to see the same exact one here on Amazon for such a savings.</li>
      <li>Packaged in a nice little bottle</li>
      <li>It is light enough to wear during the day yet has a charm that can be worn at night.</li>
      <li>I do really like the scent</li>
      <li>But it really doesn&#x27;t smell like gardenia flower scent ...  </li>
      <li>Love the smell very gourmand similar to angel but doesnt last ..</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t expect it last long as it an eau de perfume &#x3D;mostly water and alcohol...</li>
      <li>I truly enjoy the scent of this spray and appreciate that it differences itself from other fragrances.</li>
      <li>I received and this perfume is the exact same one from the store.</li>
      <li>bought a smaller Flora by Gucci perfume for $80 at a department store, but that one lasted the whole day when I sprayed it.</li>

<li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to throughout the day.</li>
<li> not sure if it was an old bottle or just a fluke..</li>
<li> My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
<li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was due to the staying power on me.</li>
<li> I like how they list the ingredients on the back of the box, although some of the components of the perfume are semi-controversial and not really healthy.</li>
<li> Found it on amazon for half the price</li>
<li> probably wouldnt buy again was a little dissapointed .</li>
<li> but, unfortunately, it does not last on for very long..</li>
<li> Do not buy this, it is not authentic.  </li>
<li> Lasting power isn&#x27;t bad for an eau de toilette.</li>
<li> but the scent doesn&#x27;t last longer than 10 minutes if that. :(</li>
<li> but it was too expensive in the stores.</li>
<li> I could still faintly smell it in the morning.</li>

    <li> The perfume is amazing. Smells great and stays on me a long time. Great, prompt service. I will use them again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I truly enjoy the scent of this spray and appreciate that it differences itself from other fragrances. It is light enough to wear during the day yet has a charm that can be worn at night.

I have found this to be the scent I shall continue to purchase and wear as my own daytime Eau De Toilette.</li>
    <li> I do really like the scent but, unfortunately, it does not last on for very long.. perhaps I&#x27;m used to eau de partum now... however, the product was offered at a good price therefore giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I Love the fragrance, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies which I usually have to perfume. I will purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and smell, very fresh for spring. I went to Sephora ($72) and happen to try this perfume on. I loved the smell so much I almost purchased in the store. I was thrilled to see the same exact one here on Amazon for such a savings. I received and this perfume is the exact same one from the store. The smell is amazing!! Love it! Thanks amazon :)</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite perfume. It smells so fresh and pretty and I have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I compared the sample of Gorgeous Gardenia I received from the store with the bottle I bought off Amazon and they&#x27;re definitely not the same, however they do smell very similar. I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to be the real fragrance with that price tag, but it still smells pretty good! Lasting power isn&#x27;t bad for an eau de toilette.</li>
    <li> Found this during my travels in an airport shop and just fell in love with the scent. Found it on amazon for half the price and I absolutely love it. Flowery but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The perfect name for the perfect fragrance -- and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and she was very happy with the length of time it lasted and the smell of the perfume. She said it was a very pleasant scent that she would wear often.</li>
    <li> I like how they list the ingredients on the back of the box, although some of the components of the perfume are semi-controversial and not really healthy. I&#x27;ll just spray it on my clothes and stuff instead of letting it touch my skin. Smells good, just do not directly inhale the droplets. Might cause allergies.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance from Macy&#x27;s before, and the beautiful scent would last really long. This purchase however, seems diluted somehow.. not sure if it was an old bottle or just a fluke.. but the scent doesn&#x27;t last longer than 10 minutes if that. :(</li>
    <li> I loved the price and the product was amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this scent--very happy to have found it for a better price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have finally found my signature fragrance! It&#x27;s the only perfume I ever wear and I get compliments from everyone, every time I wear it, even by people who have already complimented me on it before. I would recommend it to anyone except my friends... I don&#x27;t want to give away my secrect!</li>
    <li> Came in original packaging, sealed.  Smells and acts just like the bottle at the department store, but at a friendlier price.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells amazing :)</li>
    <li> Very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Love the scent wish it lasted longer though, get compliments about it all the time!  Should last longer for the price!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s really aromatic. It&#x27;s perfect for pretty much any day, it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything like that. It&#x27;s smooth and sweet and floral.&lt;br /&gt;However, 30 mins after I spray it on me, I don&#x27;t smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it&#x27;d be longer lasting, but it&#x27;s good for the price, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a smaller Flora by Gucci perfume for $80 at a department store, but that one lasted the whole day when I sprayed it. I could still faintly smell it in the morning. So I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of the Gucci Flora line so I was excited when I purchased it here. I have no complaints, I don&#x27;t expect it last long as it an eau de perfume &#x3D;mostly water and alcohol...but I love it.</li>
