### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>You have to experiment with it, determine which frequency of applications work best.</li>
      <li>so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>GREAT product!!!</li>

      <li>even felt great, plus I was no longer depending on Elidel which is another bonus.</li>
      <li>It is great for flaking skin and dandruff.  </li>
      <li>The H &amp; S works great for me.</li>
      <li>It also smells very nice.    </li>
      <li>Theses qualities are excellent in the treatment of Acne,  Psoriasis, Dermatitis, Blackheads and whiteheads and more.  </li>
      <li>Good price, timely delivery.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>no fragrance, mild , great!</li>
      <li>If you are not prone to break outs, I think this soap would be a miracle, since it is so cost effective.  </li>
      <li>Definitely effective for seborrhoeic dermatitis.  </li>
      <li>Between the two of these things my skin has not looked so good in many years.  </li>
      <li>I had a face break out that seemed to be sebhorheic dermatitis, it was not pimples but some kind of a rash.  </li>
      <li>It was effective in keeping my Seb-Derm contained</li>
      <li>It needs to be followed by a very strong moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Some people use it twice every day with great success.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see I could still buy ZNP Bar, I used it right away</li>
      <li>Great product for the right price.</li>
      <li>It lathers well, gives good coverage and rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>This product is wonderful and takes care of flaking like no other product I have used.</li>
      <li>But, like most things that seem too good to be true, the FDA issued a black-box warning against Elidel claiming an inherent risk of skin cancer.</li>
      <li>For me works for all kinds of skin conditions and helps keep my skin healthy.      </li>
      <li>Stopped using it and everything seemed ok for many years.  </li>
      <li>However just as many dermatologist</li>
      <li>2: Follow with Salicylic Acid shampoo 3% or equivalent to be sure you have nothing but the lowest level of skin to treat or the medicine wont work as well.</li>
      <li>I love the product, but it seems to be OUT OF STOCK everywhere.  </li>
      <li>Although the 4 star rating would belie the consumer looking for a over the top success, this stuff is full of win.  </li>
      <li>Please \\&quot;experiment\\&quot; with this product and more importantly</li>
      <li>It feels good on my skin, very creamy and</li>
      <li>The bar has a light fragrant odor.  </li>
      <li>Since ZNP Soap was discontinued my Dermatologist recommends Joesoef Skin Care Acne Sulfur Soap 10% to replace the ZNP Soap that is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>The transaction itself was smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I should feel free to use the drug as often as I choose.</li>
      <li>Soak in a hot bath in Epsom salt or wash first with glycerin soap, Nutregena facial bar is perfect.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, after about a week of using it twice per day (as I read in feedback) my face started becoming more and more dry</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that while I still am conscious of my Seb-Derm, it has never been so contained and disguised as it is right now</li>
      <li>ZNP really does work!!</li>
      <li>I really hoped this soap would be my cheap, reliable solution.        </li>
      <li>Elidel almost completely masked my Seb-Derm and what&#x27;s better was that it was NOT a steroid</li>
      <li>For best results use warm water and work soap into a rich lather, its important to allow 60 seconds before rinse, this allows the sulfur to penetrate deep into your pores killing all the bacteria and fungus on contact while at the same time it will gently remove dead skin cells and reduce the redness and inflammation caused by the acne.</li>
      <li>I have used ZNP bar soap for many years, recommended by my dermatologist, for mild to moderate rosacea.</li>
      <li>From that point until right now,I have been using ZNP soap exactly twice per week.</li>
      <li>Over ten years back a dermatologist recommended this to me for a skin rash and it worked great.</li>
      <li>, this is good stuff for skin related conditions, it leaves my skin feeling soft too.</li>
      <li>While this product ended up doing exactly what I had really hoped it would: it truly allowed me to be in full control of my Seborrheic Dermatitis, I felt that only a 4-star rating was appropriate.</li>
      <li>Customer service went the extra mile for me and more than satisfactorily adjusted the discrepancy.</li>
      <li>My guess is that some of it most definitely will.    </li>
      <li>With little more than a quick phone call my issue was resolved and the rest of the order was fulfilled.</li>
      <li>I will be very honest, throughout these first six months, I nearly abandoned this product out of frustration on several occasions which would have ended with a far different point of view toward this product than what I feel as of this writing.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how something as simple as a bar of soap can make such a difference.</li>
      <li>It seems it is only available online now.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to work very well controlling sebhorreic dermatitis.  </li>
      <li>So it is important to know that I give this feedback for ZNP soap based solely on its effectiveness with treating only Seborrheic Dermatitis.</li>
      <li>Shutting the water off between rinses conserves but this process is a longone, but if you want clear skin you have to decide if its worth the effort.  </li>
      <li>Joesoef Skin Care Sulfur Soap 10% is available online at [..] or from your local dermatologists.  </li>
      <li>After using this product for nearly 6 months now, I have finally decided that I am now able to provide legitimate feedback.</li>
      <li>Before trying ZNP soap, there were several feedback comments of people saying that they use ZNP twice every single day with astonishing success.</li>
      <li>I have never felt better about my complexion, I attribute that to ZNP soap, but I still have Seborrheic Dermatitis (although now it is MUCH less noticeable, oftentimes unnoticeable).</li>
      <li>Its getting harder and harder to find a good shampoo/soap to treat Psoriasis and dermatitis.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to realize that at this point in time, I was using Elidel every single day, no exceptions.</li>
      <li>There are still a few very important points that I want you to keep in mind.     </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this soap after reading the reviews.  </li>
      <li>But I decided to at least use it as it is prescribed in its own instruction.</li>
      <li>This product does an ok job, it does not remove the condition, it will however,remove the dead skin.</li>
      <li>Def worth a try, but you have to use it religiously, and there is a method to doing it.  </li>
      <li>The only area where I suffer from visible Seborrheic Dermatitis is on my cheeks right below my eyes on each side of my nose.</li>
      <li>I am 29 years old and I have battled \\&quot;Seb-Derm\\&quot; since I was in high school.</li>
      <li>The ZNP bar does really improve itching and redness in general.  </li>
      <li>Elidel is a topical treatment, and at first it seemed like a miracle.</li>
      <li>I read a study where you need much higher concentrations of Selenium to even equal the power of 2% Zinc.  </li>
      <li>The only reason it didnt get a full five stars was I started using it the same time my dermatologist gave me Clobetasol.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it is actually a very very inexpensive form of treatment considering how long it lasts.      </li>
      <li>Through these six months, sometimes I would have outbreaks of Seborrheic Dermatitis and get very discouraged and have to go back to using Elidel to clear it up.</li>
      <li>And let me tell you, I can&#x27;t ever remember my complexion being so clear.</li>
      <li>The Seb-Derm was back, this time much angrier than ever before.</li>
      <li>znp soap will get rid of them and leave your skin baby soft.  </li>
      <li>Sulfur is anti bacterial, anti fungal and its a natural antiseptic soap.  </li>
      <li>It is your standard variety of Seb-Derm and nothing I have ever tried seemed to treat it with any real effectiveness:</li>
      <li>The value is despite the higher cost for this soap, the bar lasts exceptionally long.  </li>
      <li>Compared to prescriptions for sebhorreic dermatitis, this soap is so much cheaper, considering that one bar probably would last months.  </li>
      <li>I could not be happier when a company does not haggle with me and simply puts things right, for that the DermStore earned my future business.</li>
      <li>No less then 7 minutes.  </li>
      <li>So, if you look at $12 and feel it is too much, please understand that it lasts an awfully long time.</li>
      <li>However, after only one or two washings, it would give me large, red, itchy...</li>
      <li>Skin is soft and not dry after you get out of the shower or bath.  </li>
      <li>At this point, I had to load up on Elidel for the next week without going near the ZNP soap just to get my face back to normal after basically accidentally O.D.&#x27;ing on ZNP soap.     </li>
      <li>Was recommended by an old dermatologist, it was a little drying but it cleared my skin up quickly and lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>Has nearly doubled in cost over the last ten years, but I&#x27;m still buying/using it!</li>
      <li>Does not dry out the face.</li>
      <li>Immediately upon using the ZNP bar, my face became much noticeably smoother, and less itchy.</li>
      <li>It is probably different for everybody but please be willing to run into a few setbacks before you abandon this product.</li>
      <li>I would not be surprised if that one single bar will last me an entire year.</li>
      <li>It might burn a little, if your skin is especially sensitive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My order arrived on time but with a minor snafu requiring me to contact customer service. With little more than a quick phone call my issue was resolved and the rest of the order was fulfilled. Customer service went the extra mile for me and more than satisfactorily adjusted the discrepancy. I could not be happier when a company does not haggle with me and simply puts things right, for that the DermStore earned my future business.</li>
    <li> My pharmacy recently discontinued selling this product so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  I have used ZNP bar soap for many years, recommended by my dermatologist, for mild to moderate rosacea. It shows up as a rash on and around my nose, cheeks,  and along my forehead and hairline.  As long as I use this soap, morning and evening, I have no rash problems.  Within a week of non-use, I notice a definite deterioration in the condition of my skin.  Has nearly doubled in cost over the last ten years, but I&#x27;m still buying/using it!</li>
    <li> no fragrance, mild , great!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and takes care of flaking like no other product I have used.</li>
    <li> Although the 4 star rating would belie the consumer looking for a over the top success, this stuff is full of win.  The only reason it didnt get a full five stars was I started using it the same time my dermatologist gave me Clobetasol.  Between the two of these things my skin has not looked so good in many years.  The bar has a light fragrant odor.  It lathers well, gives good coverage and rinses clean.  Skin is soft and not dry after you get out of the shower or bath.  The value is despite the higher cost for this soap, the bar lasts exceptionally long.  If used as directed this bar could last for several months, or longer.  The only other Zinc product which worked as well was Head and Shoulders \\&quot;Intensive Treatment\\&quot; 2% Zinc P but is no longer sold in stores.  The Selenium Sulfide just doesnt cut it.  I read a study where you need much higher concentrations of Selenium to even equal the power of 2% Zinc.  So why buy the weaker product?  Its getting harder and harder to find a good shampoo/soap to treat Psoriasis and dermatitis. (of which I have both in the same places, Doctor said I was \\&quot;lucky\\&quot;)  Skin flakes less, and the redness all but disappears.  Def worth a try, but you have to use it religiously, and there is a method to doing it.  1: Remove the scale.  Soak in a hot bath in Epsom salt or wash first with glycerin soap, Nutregena facial bar is perfect.  Let it sit for several minutes and rinse, repeat if needed to get the thick skin off. 2: Follow with Salicylic Acid shampoo 3% or equivalent to be sure you have nothing but the lowest level of skin to treat or the medicine wont work as well. 3: Lather the bar well, let sit for up to 10 minutes.  Any less and you are only short sticking yourself.  No less then 7 minutes.  This is key.  It might burn a little, if your skin is especially sensitive.  But give it a week, and you wont care.   My showers take about 30 minutes.  They have to.  Shutting the water off between rinses conserves but this process is a longone, but if you want clear skin you have to decide if its worth the effort.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by doctor for skin dryness on face.  Since using it there has been no itching or flaking.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> not available any longer</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this soap after reading the reviews.  It does seem to work very well controlling sebhorreic dermatitis.  But for some reason, it gave me almost a hive type of reaction.  I&#x27;m not sure what it was.  I know I have breakout-prone skin, and so I was taking a risk by using a solid bar soap, instead of a liquid face wash.      The ZNP bar does really improve itching and redness in general.  However, after only one or two washings, it would give me large, red, itchy...I&#x27;m not sure what.  They were like hives.  I took a break from the soap a few times and tried using it again, hoping I would not react to it, but unfortunately I did, each time.  So it was helping one problem (seb derm) but causing basically the same problem.    The soap smells very very good.  It also does seem to last for ever.  I&#x27;ve never seen a soap this sturdy.  After using it, it&#x27;s as if the soap bar hasn&#x27;t decreased in size at all.      If you are not prone to break outs, I think this soap would be a miracle, since it is so cost effective.  Compared to prescriptions for sebhorreic dermatitis, this soap is so much cheaper, considering that one bar probably would last months.  It also smells very nice.    Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t seem to use it without getting allergic type reactions.  I am really not sure why I get these reactions, and am really disappointed.  I really hoped this soap would be my cheap, reliable solution.        One tip for those who want to buy this soap.  It seems it is only available online now.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any drug store.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product.  Great product for the right price. Bar lasts a long time. Does not dry out the face. Takes care of the contact dermatitis.  will continue to use product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My dermatoligist MD recommeded the ZNP Bar to me years ago.     For me works for all kinds of skin conditions and helps keep my skin healthy.      Turns out I&#x27;m deficient in blood zinc levels so this bar helps supply zinc directly to my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is great for flaking skin and dandruff.  Recommended by a dermatologist and have not had dandruff since.    The transaction itself was smooth.  Good price, timely delivery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how something as simple as a bar of soap can make such a difference.</li>
    <li> ZNP really does work!! It was initially prescribed by my doctor for dermatitis  I love the product, but it seems to be OUT OF STOCK everywhere.  GREAT product!!!</li>
    <li> When all other dandriff shampoo&#x27;s fail... this one works.  I used it growing up because of dandriff issues.  Stopped using it and everything seemed ok for many years.  lately, nothing worked.  Went back to the ZNP bar and problem solved yet again.</li>
    <li> Definitely effective for seborrhoeic dermatitis.  My only complaint is that its expensive.  However, the bar lasts forever.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap bar for me.  It feels good on my skin, very creamy and it suds well.  It took care of my dermatitis and is now part of my daily cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by an old dermatologist, it was a little drying but it cleared my skin up quickly and lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> This product does an ok job, it does not remove the condition, it will however,remove the dead skin. It needs to be followed by a very strong moisturizer.</li>
    <li> After using this product for nearly 6 months now, I have finally decided that I am now able to provide legitimate feedback. I will be very honest, throughout these first six months, I nearly abandoned this product out of frustration on several occasions which would have ended with a far different point of view toward this product than what I feel as of this writing.    I suffer from Seborrheic Dermatitis. I am 29 years old and I have battled \\&quot;Seb-Derm\\&quot; since I was in high school. So it is important to know that I give this feedback for ZNP soap based solely on its effectiveness with treating only Seborrheic Dermatitis. If you are planning on using this soap for any other ailment, I do not know if the following testimony will be applicable or not. My guess is that some of it most definitely will.    The only area where I suffer from visible Seborrheic Dermatitis is on my cheeks right below my eyes on each side of my nose. It is your standard variety of Seb-Derm and nothing I have ever tried seemed to treat it with any real effectiveness: Until I was prescribed Elidel by my dermatologist. Elidel is a topical treatment, and at first it seemed like a miracle. Elidel almost completely masked my Seb-Derm and what&#x27;s better was that it was NOT a steroid therefore our bodies do not begin building a tolerance for it, hindering its power. But, like most things that seem too good to be true, the FDA issued a black-box warning against Elidel claiming an inherent risk of skin cancer. I spoke with several dermatologists regarding this health risk and it was a mixed bag of opinions. Some of them claimed the warning is not warranted and I should feel free to use the drug as often as I choose. However just as many dermatologist I spoke with were of the opposite school of thought and because of the black-box warning, they cautioned me to use Elidel only as a last resort when the outbreaks of my Seborrheic Dermatitis became too unbearable. It&#x27;s important to realize that at this point in time, I was using Elidel every single day, no exceptions. I would estimate that for 3-4 years leading up to this black-box warning and these conversations that I used Elidel on my face every single day. It was effective in keeping my Seb-Derm contained so I had no reason not to use it every day. So my ultimate goal was now to somehow find a way to battle  Seborrheic Dermatitis without using Elidel or at least not near as often as every single day. This is what led me to the ZNP soap.     Before trying ZNP soap, there were several feedback comments of people saying that they use ZNP twice every single day with astonishing success. So I bought some and immediately began using it twice per day for about a week. Seborrheic Dermatitis leaves itchy, scaly dry patches on my face. Immediately upon using the ZNP bar, my face became much noticeably smoother, and less itchy. From both an internal and external perspective, the ZNP soap was definitely disguising my Seborrheic Dermatitis and my face even felt great, plus I was no longer depending on Elidel which is another bonus. HOWEVER, after about a week of using it twice per day (as I read in feedback) my face started becoming more and more dry and suddenly it was dryer than it had ever been in my life. The Seb-Derm was back, this time much angrier than ever before. That day or two after I had used it twice daily for a week left my face in worse conditional than ever before. Clearly this ZNP soap has gone terribly wrong. HOWEVER, the instructions on the box clearly say to only use it a few times per week. I came very close to abandoning the soap at which point I would have been under the impression that it is a terrible terrible product. But I decided to at least use it as it is prescribed in its own instruction. At this point, I had to load up on Elidel for the next week without going near the ZNP soap just to get my face back to normal after basically accidentally O.D.&#x27;ing on ZNP soap.     From that point until right now,I have been using ZNP soap exactly twice per week. No exceptions. At the beginning of this plan, I would usually use a little bit of Elidel after each time I use the ZNP soap (by the way I always use the ZNP soap when in the shower). Through these six months, sometimes I would have outbreaks of Seborrheic Dermatitis and get very discouraged and have to go back to using Elidel to clear it up. Again, I just started leaning towards abandoning ZNP soap. However I began noticing that I was waiting too long between applications. While I tried to stick with twice weekly, I caught myself not using it until I would start to experience a small outbreak, then I would use it, and because I had a small outbreak I would become discouraged. This obviously was a flawed approach. So for right now, and for the past few months, I have been using ZNP soap twice per week, no exceptions (every Thursday and Sunday). I no longer wait for my Seborrheic Dermatitis to surface. And let me tell you, I can&#x27;t ever remember my complexion being so clear. I can honestly say that while I still am conscious of my Seb-Derm, it has never been so contained and disguised as it is right now and I credit ZNP soap for that 100%. However I will still use a little bit of Elidel every once in a while but not very often at all.    There are still a few very important points that I want you to keep in mind.     1) There is no cure for Seborrheic Dermatitis. This ZNP soap will by no means cure Seborrheic Dermatitis. It will disguise it. It will definitely subdue the outbreaks. It will make them less often and less embarrassing, but it will not cure you from Seborrheic Dermatitis. I have never felt better about my complexion, I attribute that to ZNP soap, but I still have Seborrheic Dermatitis (although now it is MUCH less noticeable, oftentimes unnoticeable). So please do not buy this product, or any other product for that matter, in the hopes that you will be cured of Seborrheic Dermatitis. You would only be setting yourself up for disappointment because no known cures exist.    2) Please \\&quot;experiment\\&quot; with this product and more importantly, BE PATIENT! Some people use it twice every day with great success. I tried that and ended up looking like an alien. For others, only a few times a week is enough. It is probably different for everybody but please be willing to run into a few setbacks before you abandon this product. I almost gave up on it twice. I figured, I will have Seb-Derm for the rest of my life, so a 6-month sacrifice seemed insignificant. I stuck with it and finally found a routine that worked. I urge you to be patient as well.    3) Some people balk at the price of a single bar of ZNP soap. It&#x27;s something like $12 for a bar. However I am still using the same bar that I started with. When I bought it, I immediately cut the giant bar into 6 or 8 smaller chunks and have them stored in a ziplock bag in a drawer. I would not be surprised if that one single bar will last me an entire year. So, if you look at $12 and feel it is too much, please understand that it lasts an awfully long time. Don&#x27;t be discouraged by that. In fact, it is actually a very very inexpensive form of treatment considering how long it lasts.      While this product ended up doing exactly what I had really hoped it would: it truly allowed me to be in full control of my Seborrheic Dermatitis, I felt that only a 4-star rating was appropriate. I did not give it 5-stars for the sole reason that it is not fool-proof. You have to experiment with it, determine which frequency of applications work best. Because of that, I did not give it 5 stars.    Lastly, I see people in their feedbacks penalizing ZNP soap because it stings if you get it in your eyes. I will agree, yes it hurts, but it is not suppose to get in your eyes. Diet Pepsi and windshield wiper fluid will also sting you if you get that in your eyes, but I wouldn&#x27;t hold that against those two liquids if I were to write a review about their uses.I hope this helps. Take care.</li>
    <li> I had a face break out that seemed to be sebhorheic dermatitis, it was not pimples but some kind of a rash.  I used the ZNP bar and it dried up and is going away.  Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Over ten years back a dermatologist recommended this to me for a skin rash and it worked great. I had some type of growth on my scalp lately and tried another medicated shampoo which seemed to help but just wasn&#x27;t doing the job. I was happy to see I could still buy ZNP Bar, I used it right away and it had immediate results, this is good stuff for skin related conditions, it leaves my skin feeling soft too.</li>
    <li> Or you could simply wash your face using head and shoulders dandruff shampoo that contains the same percentage of PnZ or try one of the coal tar dandruff shampoos. The H &amp; S works great for me.</li>
    <li> Since ZNP Soap was discontinued my Dermatologist recommends Joesoef Skin Care Acne Sulfur Soap 10% to replace the ZNP Soap that is no longer available.  Sulfur is anti bacterial, anti fungal and its a natural antiseptic soap.  Theses qualities are excellent in the treatment of Acne,  Psoriasis, Dermatitis, Blackheads and whiteheads and more.  For best results use warm water and work soap into a rich lather, its important to allow 60 seconds before rinse, this allows the sulfur to penetrate deep into your pores killing all the bacteria and fungus on contact while at the same time it will gently remove dead skin cells and reduce the redness and inflammation caused by the acne. Joesoef Skin Care Sulfur Soap 10% is available online at [..] or from your local dermatologists.  Hopes this helps....</li>
    <li> If you have flakes anywhere on your body znp soap will get rid of them and leave your skin baby soft.  I have been using ZNP soap for 30 years and hate to see it unavailable. one bar lasts a very long time. about a year! Please bring the soap back!</li>
