### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with the Dove Men+Care Styling Paste</li>
      <li>But it IS the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
      <li>curls.&lt;br /&gt;This has been working great for the preteens in the house</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re both happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Both work just as great for me</li>
      <li>Works and smells great.</li>
      <li>The Dove Men + Care Styling Paste is a great companion to the gel.</li>
      <li>The product has a good scent as well.  </li>
      <li>This is a good hair paste with a lemon/lime/cedar/sweet scent.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>This Dove Men+Care Styling Paste does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>I use this right out of the shower on damp hair which I&#x27;ve found gives the best results.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Very light fragrance which is good since the ones using this have allergies</li>
      <li>He parts and styles for a nice 60s style business look.  </li>
      <li>We both liked that part and thought it complimented his style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Emulsification of the product is nice - it does NOT clump like a gel product does, which means once you start working it through your hair</li>
      <li>The Dove Men+Care fortifying styling paste has a nice texture that is non-greasy and non-glossy on the hair.</li>
      <li>It is heavier than gel but still does leave hair feeling nice.</li>
      <li>Never cut your own hair thinking it will look cute.</li>
      <li>It went on nicely &amp; controlled his hair for a while, but as the day got hotter (it was in the 90s) &amp; even more humid, the styling paste stopped working.</li>
      <li>Has a nice scent to it and washes off hands easily after application.</li>
      <li>The Dove Men+Care Fortifying Styling Paste can also be used during the day to give my hair more volume.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After using Dove&#x27;s Styling Paste twice I can safely say that I do like the product.</li>
      <li>likes the styling paste &amp; thinks it might&#x27;ve worked better for him if his hair was shorter.</li>
      <li>The paste gives my hair more volume.  </li>
      <li>Love the Dove Men&#x27;s line of hair care products and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>This is matte rather than shiny, which I think looks better.</li>
      <li>I once used an eye cream that had caffeine in it too (by Mac), supposedly to wake up and stimulate your lower eye-lids (that most undoubtedly was a gimmick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like it better than the Dove Men + Care Spray Gel ([[ASIN:B00BOUQUHM</li>
      <li>I look at paste as a more heavier-duty product than gel.</li>
      <li>so make sure to compare the per ounce cost and not container cost.</li>
      <li>I also found that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like many maximum hold gels do.</li>
      <li>and it looked OK,</li>
      <li>latest test is Dove Men+Care Styling Paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All in all he is pleased,</li>
      <li>I like a textured or stronger hold gel or pomade to develop more depth and style to the top and front and one that will hold through the day and may even be able to be reworked when life happens and it gets messed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some over the top hair pastes and gels for men that had all sorts of exotic ingredients and a price-tag to match.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild and pleasant, you don&#x27;t need much, and it keeps his hair looking good.</li>
      <li>scent is a very clean smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because the scent is mild and genderless - and because it lists caffeine as an ingredient (it&#x27;s supposed to be good at keeping follicles alive), I tried it on my own hair.</li>
      <li>Works in easily, lets your hair be styled and after it is worked in my hair stayed in place but didn&#x27;t feel like a rock.  </li>
      <li>The container is easy to carry in one&#x27;s backpack, man bag, coat pocket, etc.  </li>
      <li>you need a strong holding paste and don&#x27;t mind the soap scent (or price), check it out.</li>
      <li>have been using it for the last two weeks and surprisingly, it has a pretty good hold.  </li>
      <li>Light scent, not at all over-powering.</li>
      <li>My husband and I did but care fit this product.</li>
      <li>Also, if you use too much it can make straight hair look really greasy, so it&#x27;s best to use this paste sparingly unless you&#x27;re going for a greasy look.</li>
      <li>However, this is helping me more than I could ask for right now.</li>
      <li>he first tried this before a haircut and thought it made his hair look greasy, after a hair cut it worked much better.  </li>
      <li>that is all I am looking for-a full day of style.</li>
      <li>It was a much better experience,  but neither one of us were very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is available at my local walmart at a much better price!</li>
      <li>Although mild, it hangs around for hours.</li>
      <li>It is a light waxy paste and there really is not much to say about it (a good thing).</li>
      <li>The paste has a light, barely noticeable scent that is masculine and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>has a VERY strong hold, although strangely it does not keep my finer hairs in place - the hair over and around my ears is fine and curly.  </li>
      <li>In addition, it has great definition and easy to style, and holds the hair well for the whole day without looking heavy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m not crazy about the price, I will say that the product has worked for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Always looking for a medium hold, natural or matte finish, I have tried many brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product did produce a nice lasting shine.  </li>
      <li>The scents of the gel and paste have very similar smells which blend together nicely.</li>
      <li>He finds that it does work well, but he still prefers his Old Spice version a bit more.</li>
      <li>You did it right for</li>
      <li>My son and I are sensitive to fragrance, but we don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be overly strong; it smells kind of like regular Dove soap to me.</li>
      <li>I like this hair paste, if I only use a little bit it keeps my hair nicely in place with a good texture and look.</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with Dove Men+Care styling paste and though it is a decidedly good product on its own, comparing it to leading brands or simply higher-end hair products makes the Dove product less</li>
      <li>It works and I will probably go through the whole container before my bangs will stay back on their own.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a diehard Dove Men+Care user then the higher price point may be acceptable.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty pricy paste, but it does work well.</li>
      <li>of the differences I learned with this styling paste is that you don&#x27;t need to have so much of it, just a finger tip&#x27;s worth and you will want to rub it in your hands thoroughly, as it can come out a bit clump, so rub it on your palms and run it through your hair and comb or blowdry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love using the Dove Men+Care Fortifying Styling Paste for several reasons.  </li>
      <li>Depending on where you look be sure to compare the price PER OUNCE to higher end brands like American Crew.</li>
      <li>works better for the ones in our house who have the shorter thinner hair not so great for the one guy with loose thick</li>
      <li>He prefers the fragrance of the Old Spice paste over Dove&#x27;s, and after comparing the how much product you get for what you pay, I like the price of the Old Spice better.</li>
      <li>When using more paste, I could get his bone straight hair to stand straight up - so this will definitely work if you want to spike your hair.</li>
      <li>Dove Men fortifying styling paste is a white dense paste that is easy to apply to the fingers to transfer to your hair.  </li>
      <li>Purchased for the male in the household who normally uses this brand’s pomade, but was looking for something with more hold when the weather is severe.</li>
      <li>The white color means that it must be applied lightly, but its all that is really needed.  </li>
      <li>I really like his curls.</li>
      <li>The Dove product isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to hold up well under the intense heat and humidity of a Midwest summer.</li>
      <li>Use too much &amp; you will look like the 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caffeine supposed to help prevent hair loss……</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll have to give it to Suave for the much cheaper price.</li>
      <li>It really does make his hair stay in place and keeps it thicker looking than the gels he used to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall it is a nice styling paste and the hold has been lasting all day when they use it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a nice quality firm</li>
      <li>This Dove Styling Paste is a nice consistency- not to heavy or oily while having sufficient hold to play with and style your hair as you like.</li>
      <li>First, and most importantly, I can use it on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The hold is medium and lasts all day - he&#x27;s added a tiny bit more when we&#x27;ve gone back out at night and it works very well.</li>
      <li>As a styling paste, it works well enough, but not as good as salon brands such as American Crew, but the Dove paste does get the job done.</li>
      <li>Dove Men+Care Spray Gel, Control &amp; Medium Hold Thickening 6.7 oz]]), which is less controllable and requires a greater quantity in order to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this more simple approach, and in the end, they all mainly do the same thing.</li>
      <li>It also has a subtle masculine scent that is pleasant up-close but unobtrusive to people near-by.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need the hairspray except when sitting next to a table fan and it definitely gave my side-swept bangs lots more</li>
      <li>It holds my hair well throughout the day albeit with a bit more stiffness than the American Crew Forming Cream I regularly use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Dove Men+Care</li>
      <li>and I recommend it highly.  </li>
      <li>have short straight hair that has little body on its own.</li>
      <li>As far as the hold it provides -- it&#x27;s sufficient and might even be better than its more expensive gel and paste competitors.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair is extremely straight, thin and bodiless.  I love using the Dove Men+Care Fortifying Styling Paste for several reasons.  First, and most importantly, I can use it on both wet and dry hair.  After taking my shower, I gently, but firmly swirl my fingertips into the paste and rub them throughout my hair; then I style and blow-dry it.  The paste gives my hair more volume.  [One would never know I had Male Pattern Baldness (MPB)].  The paste also allows me to control the amount and where it goes.  I like it better than the Dove Men + Care Spray Gel ([[ASIN:B00BOUQUHM Dove Men+Care Spray Gel, Control &amp; Medium Hold Thickening 6.7 oz]]), which is less controllable and requires a greater quantity in order to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Dove Men+Care Fortifying Styling Paste can also be used during the day to give my hair more volume.  I don&#x27;t need to rewet my hair.  I simply swirl my fingertips into the white paste and rub them throughout my hair; I fluff up my hair using my hands.  The paste never leaves my hair feeling dirty, sticky, tacky or stiff.  My hair feels natural and my style holds for hours.  The paste has a light, barely noticeable scent that is masculine and pleasant.  I can never smell it in my hair.  The container is easy to carry in one&#x27;s backpack, man bag, coat pocket, etc.  It is approximately the size of a can of chewing tobacco.  I highly recommend Dove Men+Care Fortifying Styling Paste for any man who likes to travel.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 7 year old&#x27;s curls. He loves his curls but sometimes they need to be defined and this paste helps. I have also used this to mohawk his hair!  I look at paste as a more heavier-duty product than gel. It is heavier than gel but still does leave hair feeling nice. Not sure this is worth $10 but if you are looking for a manlier hair paste then this is the one to buy. Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using [[ASIN:B00FRDPMNK Old Spice Spiffy Sculpting Pomade 2.64 Oz]] for the last year or so to touch up his hair before work. He has a short military cut (high and tight) he started getting when he was in the USMC about 12 years ago and hasn&#x27;t wanted his hair longer ever since. He&#x27;s in law enforcement now, so the the military cut still works for him. After years of getting his hair cut once a week while he was in the service, now he can&#x27;t go a day past 2 weeks without a haircut or he says he feels like he&#x27;s got long hair. He&#x27;d prefer to get it cut every week but it&#x27;s just too expensive. So instead he&#x27;s been using Old Spice Sculpting Pomade to touch up his hair between cuts. He says it keeps his hair from being \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;, and from what I&#x27;ve seen it does tame it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove Styling Paste has the same matte finish as Old Spice Spiffy, so I was interested to find out if my husband would like it. He finds that it does work well, but he still prefers his Old Spice version a bit more. He prefers the fragrance of the Old Spice paste over Dove&#x27;s, and after comparing the how much product you get for what you pay, I like the price of the Old Spice better. The jar of Old Spice Spiffy is an ounce larger than Dove&#x27;s paste, but is currently priced at half as much.  While prices do fluctuate, that&#x27;s a pretty big difference! Dove&#x27;s costing twice as much for 60% less product. So while the products do work similarly, unless Dove brings the price down significantly, they will have a hard time convincing Old Spice users to switch to their styling paste.</li>
    <li> I think my wife started me on Dove Men +care products though their soaps.  BTW, they rock.  First thing that I&#x27;d like to point out about ALL of Dove Men +care products is that they are in grey packaging in grey containers.  They are subtle, direct, and something that I noticed and was attracted to, since I don&#x27;t like to have neon products by my sink or shower to make me look like I want to be a 20 something.  So - Dove marketing/packaging ppl...  You did it right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short straight hair that has little body on its own. My cut is a tight on the sides with a little more on the top, tapered on the back.  I like a textured or stronger hold gel or pomade to develop more depth and style to the top and front and one that will hold through the day and may even be able to be reworked when life happens and it gets messed.  All without looking like a slick shiny grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Men fortifying styling paste is a white dense paste that is easy to apply to the fingers to transfer to your hair.  The white color means that it must be applied lightly, but its all that is really needed.  The hold is immediate and provides a textured look when teasing a little.  Its an all day hold and there is no strong scent to compete with your cologne.  It&#x27;s a solid paste and I recommend it highly.  A little goes a long way, and depending on how aggressive you are with it, one of these could last between 1 to 2 months.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It was simply rebranded from a Suave product that was cheaper in price though. Depending on where you look be sure to compare the price PER OUNCE to higher end brands like American Crew. Honestly American Crew can cost about the same, a little more, or a little less depending on what store or website you look. Keeping in mind there is only 1.5 ounces in this Dove product so make sure to compare the per ounce cost and not container cost. The fact a Dove product (formeraly Suave) is at the same general price point of American Crew is pretty crazy to me. I swear I remember buying this product when it was Suave for under 4 bucks at WalMart. Really disappointed in the price hike and now I believe this to be overpriced.</li>
    <li> This ain&#x27;t Wildroot Cream Oil, Charley. Quite simply, it does exactly what I hoped it would do: give my hair the consistency it needed to comb it. And it looks like there is no product involved. Apply damp or dry but apply it evenly. It even makes my hair appear thicker. I recently purchased Axe&#x27;s version. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell which would not go away. The Suave product may have the same ingredients as Dove&#x27;s But I wasn&#x27;t going to take the chance on the fragrance. Since I use other Dove products this was the logical choice. I&#x27;d give it five stars but &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; is a word I reserve for things like music, paintings or books not styling paste. But it IS the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
    <li> This is the exact same product as the suave men&#x27;s styling paste. Same packaging, save for a color change,it is  Ingredient for ingredient identical. They even tried to his this fact by calling the beeswax by its alternate name, cera alba, when it is listed as beeswax on the suave styling paste.     Both Suave and Dove brands are made by the same company: Unilever. So it is irritating to me that they moved this product from their value brand (Suave) and put it into one of their higher end brands. They did this with no changes to the product itself yet have nearly doubled the shelf price. At least make the container a bit larger to make up for the increase! Apparently the word &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; is worth charging your customers double for the same product.</li>
    <li> Purchased for the male in the household who normally uses this brand’s pomade, but was looking for something with more hold when the weather is severe. He has medium thick straight hair that just reaches his collar and uses about a dime size amount. It is applied by rubbing palms together then evenly distributed by sliding hands through his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been using it off and on for a couple of weeks in substantial wind and snow. It does not turn his straight medium thick hair into a hair helmet, but it does provide more control and generally prevents total collapse. Light scent, not at all over-powering. Not much is needed and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Last week I would have not even looked at this product. However, I made a decision to cut bangs into my hairstyle. I cut over ten inches and it looked OK, but I did not like having the bangs back. I did not know what to do but then realized I could style them back until they grew out longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have been using hairspray after I brush my bangs back as I dry them. They stay for a bit but with the humidity and spray; they fall down to the sides and look terrible. I almost feel like I have a mullet cut going on with how it falls down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this, I remembered using something like this years ago on my thin straight hair and it kept it in place. I figured it did not hurt to try it.  I dry my bangs back as normal but when I am done now, when my hair is only slightly damp, I run this through the middle to ends of it and pull it back. Six hours later where the hairspray would have my bangs fall to the sides; this is still in place and all pulled back. It does not look greasy or heavy; it just holds it in place, almost like hair glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very clean smell. I love it! It works and I will probably go through the whole container before my bangs will stay back on their own. However, this is helping me more than I could ask for right now. Never cut your own hair thinking it will look cute. Because you will end up with hair like mine and have to wait weeks for it to grow back.</li>
    <li> This product is well packaged for a men&#x27;s hair styling paste. It&#x27;s sold everywhere, so that&#x27;s a plus. As far as the hold it provides -- it&#x27;s sufficient and might even be better than its more expensive gel and paste competitors.</li>
    <li> Love the Dove Men&#x27;s line of hair care products and this is no exception. I have very straight hair that I like to style in various fashions so depending on how long my hair is that day I usually have to use a lot. Did not have to use a ton of this to get my hair styled the way that I wanted to with this (and a spray of hair spray) it lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is all I am looking for-a full day of style.</li>
    <li> Very light fragrance which is good since the ones using this have allergies and I was afraid might be too harsh for them to use it.&lt;br /&gt;This is easier to use when applying to damp hair and especially if trying to get the hair to spike up a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave a shine to the hair and you only need a little bit it will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This works better for the ones in our house who have the shorter thinner hair not so great for the one guy with loose thick curls.&lt;br /&gt;This has been working great for the preteens in the house and I like that it does not leave a heavy lingering scent like other products&lt;br /&gt;that we have tried on them. Overall it is a nice styling paste and the hold has been lasting all day when they use it.</li>
    <li> It works well to style short hair.  I would not use this with longer hair.  It makes the hair look greasy and artificial.  I usually just use hair conditioner as a leave in styling product.  This styling paste is a bit too thick and stiff.  The Suave styling paste seems like the same product, and is about half the cost of this Dove product.</li>
    <li> The fellow who tested this has curly hair, not tight curls but loose. I really like his curls. It went on nicely &amp; controlled his hair for a while, but as the day got hotter (it was in the 90s) &amp; even more humid, the styling paste stopped working. When he began sweating the product burned his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;He likes the styling paste &amp; thinks it might&#x27;ve worked better for him if his hair was shorter.</li>
    <li> Not being as terrible as some other product probably has its merits.  Possibly?  This is much better to use on our small boys when they want their hair to stick up and I don’t want them to smell like Larry the Lounge Lizard.  So, close.  It does hold their hair up and their hair did not end up looking all shiny and greasy..  I don’t know why it has caffeine in it.</li>
    <li> This styling paste seems to be almost the same as Suave Professionals Men Styling Paste that I have used. Which I suppose is not surprising considering both are made by parent company Unilever. That said, there are some subtle differences.  The Dove brand has a different fragrance and is infused with caffeine. I&#x27;m not sure what caffeine does for your hair, other than maybe make it stay up all night, but all the Dove hair products include it. As a styling paste, it works well enough, but not as good as salon brands such as American Crew, but the Dove paste does get the job done.</li>
    <li> As a frequent user of Malin+Goetz, Hanz de Fuko and Blind Barber&#x27;s &amp;#34;60 Proof Hair Wax&amp;#34;, I tend to also purchase a variety of brands pomade and paste for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always looking for a medium hold, natural or matte finish, I have tried many brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My latest test is Dove Men+Care Styling Paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the differences I learned with this styling paste is that you don&#x27;t need to have so much of it, just a finger tip&#x27;s worth and you will want to rub it in your hands thoroughly, as it can come out a bit clump, so rub it on your palms and run it through your hair and comb or blowdry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for the last two weeks and surprisingly, it has a pretty good hold.  Especially in the summer, working out in the heat or always on the move, it&#x27;s held up pretty well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if there is one caveat, it&#x27;s the price.  While in the middle of pricing of other paste from department store brands around $6-7 and the brands I use which are typically $18-20, in a way, I think of Dove as a brand that would be great for the budget conscious person and would be under $10, let alone under $8.  So, I am a bit surprised it&#x27;s selling for $11 on Amazon and that&#x27;s coming close to Matrix Biolage pricing that you would find at a hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m not crazy about the price, I will say that the product has worked for me.  A tiny bit clumpy, but you just have to rub it in your hands and not dip so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with the Dove Men+Care Styling Paste and I definitely recommend the product, but at $6-8, I would have scored it higher but at $11, I&#x27;m giving it a 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> My son has very thick but straight hair.  He always uses paste in the front....he first tried this before a haircut and thought it made his hair look greasy, after a hair cut it worked much better.  His hair doesn&#x27;t look stiff, or greasy, and it holds very well.  The product has a good scent as well.  All in all he is pleased, and I would probably buy this again, although I can purchase similar products for less, so I&#x27;d probably purchase only with a coupon or a sale.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair paste with a lemon/lime/cedar/sweet scent.  It only takes a small dab &amp; it holds the hair.  As long as you don&#x27;t use too much product, it won&#x27;t give you a goop/wet/waxy look.  Use too much &amp; you will look like the 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caffeine supposed to help prevent hair loss……research is still being done on that claim.  I would not buy this product based on that claim.</li>
    <li> My husband has just switched over to Dove Men + Care Styling Gel from a gel he has been using for years after I reviewed the product for VineVoice. The Dove Men + Care Styling Paste is a great companion to the gel. Using the paste on his longer hair areas adds that little bit of&lt;br /&gt;control needed so that his hair looks well groomed for longer periods of time. The scents of the gel and paste have very similar smells which blend together nicely.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Old Spice&#x27;s Spiffy styling paste and didn&#x27;t expect much from Dove&#x27;s - but he now considers it equal after trading back and forth for the last week. The fragrance is mild and pleasant, you don&#x27;t need much, and it keeps his hair looking good. I slightly prefer the tropical scented Old Spice Spiffy simply because I love the odor, but I also like this milder scent. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and neither of these sets my sinuses to twitching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is medium and lasts all day - he&#x27;s added a tiny bit more when we&#x27;ve gone back out at night and it works very well. It really does make his hair stay in place and keeps it thicker looking than the gels he used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the scent is mild and genderless - and because it lists caffeine as an ingredient (it&#x27;s supposed to be good at keeping follicles alive), I tried it on my own hair. Normally I just spritz the front (bangs, shorter areas) with hairspray to keep it from blowing. I didn&#x27;t need the hairspray except when sitting next to a table fan and it definitely gave my side-swept bangs lots more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others mention this is just a Suave product, updated and rebranded.  I don&#x27;t see this as a bad thing since Suave&#x27;s inexpensive conditioner is one of the few that has enough detangler in it to handle my fine waist-length hair. I like the brand. We&#x27;re both happy with this product. It&#x27;s not just for men.</li>
    <li> What we have here is a pretty solid product, and I don&#x27;t just mean how well it holds my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you&#x27;ll find inside the lovely grey container is a white paste that has the consistency of creamy putty. It&#x27;s not like a typical gel product that feels gooey and sticky - it&#x27;s a paste that when rubbed in your hands will make it look like you&#x27;ve just dipped them into white paint. But don&#x27;t fear, it goes on without leaving any trace of colour in your hair or on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emulsification of the product is nice - it does NOT clump like a gel product does, which means once you start working it through your hair you aren&#x27;t going to walk away with bits of clumped together hair that are obviously adhered with gel. This isn&#x27;t Something About Mary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is effect all day long - I use this right out of the shower on damp hair which I&#x27;ve found gives the best results. If your hair is too dry, just moisten your hands before applying the paste and you&#x27;ll get the same result. It holds without looking greasy. No one wants that slick back look these days (well, if you do, try a different product) and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I also found that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like many maximum hold gels do. It&#x27;s just a nice quality firm hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one that I&#x27;m planning to keep in my bathroom cabinet and use regularly. A solid 5 stars for product consistency and texture, quality, and ease of use.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men+Care fortifying styling paste has a nice texture that is non-greasy and non-glossy on the hair. It also has a subtle masculine scent that is pleasant up-close but unobtrusive to people near-by. In addition, it has great definition and easy to style, and holds the hair well for the whole day without looking heavy.  I find that this Dove Men+Care styling paste is awfully similar to the Suave Professionals Men&#x27;s styling paste that I have been using in terms of both the texture and performance. Both work just as great for me but I&#x27;ll have to give it to Suave for the much cheaper price. Another thing is that the Dove product has caffeine added to it, which is reportedly a possible hair growth stimulant. I don&#x27;t have a hair loss problem but at least the caffeine doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm neither.</li>
    <li> This Dove Styling Paste is a nice consistency- not to heavy or oily while having sufficient hold to play with and style your hair as you like. It is a light waxy paste and there really is not much to say about it (a good thing). The addition of some caffeine (not much, it is the last listed ingredient) is an interesting twist which may or may not be a gimmick. I once used an eye cream that had caffeine in it too (by Mac), supposedly to wake up and stimulate your lower eye-lids (that most undoubtedly was a gimmick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some over the top hair pastes and gels for men that had all sorts of exotic ingredients and a price-tag to match. I like this more simple approach, and in the end, they all mainly do the same thing.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty pricy paste, but it does work well. It has the consistency of a dense sponge - pretty strange stuff.  I have a couple of other pastes and they are nowhere this thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on dry hair vs damp hair, and found it much easier to use on damp hair. Once it&#x27;s brushed in place, it sets pretty fast. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent. Although mild, it hangs around for hours. I used it three hours ago and I still smell it. Smells like soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a VERY strong hold, although strangely it does not keep my finer hairs in place - the hair over and around my ears is fine and curly.  All my hair is nice and styled - except those annoying hairs are defiantly sticking out where they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a strong holding paste and don&#x27;t mind the soap scent (or price), check it out.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer mentioned, this is the new rebranded version of the Suave Professionals Men Styling Paste. It works well and does not add shine to my hair which is already oily! Fingertip amount is enough for my short hair. It is available at my local walmart at a much better price!</li>
    <li> My husband and I did but care fit this product. It seems to with too well.  It was difficult to wash out.  It definitely felt like there was product in his hair.  Even the next day,  after his shower,  it seemed to still be there.  Refusing to believe it was an entity resistant to soap, he tried again a couple of days (and shampoos) later.  This time he used less product.  It was a much better experience,  but neither one of us were very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has hair that is several inches long. He parts and styles for a nice 60s style business look.  This product did produce a nice lasting shine.  We both liked that part and thought it complimented his style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does work,  it adds shine and manipulates well. It does feel heavy though, and that is a deal breaker for my guy.</li>
    <li> Dove Men+Care Styling Paste works well for texturizing straight hair or a firm hold. My son let me try varying amounts on his super straight dark hair. In small amounts, it works well for texturizing his straight hair by giving his hair some separation. When using more paste, I could get his bone straight hair to stand straight up - so this will definitely work if you want to spike your hair. The only slight issue is that he does have super dark hair and it took some time to work this paste, which is thick and white, into his hair so it wouldn&#x27;t show. Also, if you use too much it can make straight hair look really greasy, so it&#x27;s best to use this paste sparingly unless you&#x27;re going for a greasy look. This is matte rather than shiny, which I think looks better. My son and I are sensitive to fragrance, but we don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be overly strong; it smells kind of like regular Dove soap to me. As to the addition of caffeine, I have no idea what effect if any that has on this product. This Dove Men+Care Styling Paste does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I like this hair paste, if I only use a little bit it keeps my hair nicely in place with a good texture and look. It&#x27;s a little stiffer in feel than my usual pomade but that&#x27;s okay, it works well. What I don&#x27;t understand is why caffeine is in it and why that matters enough to put that on the label. Can anyone enlighten me as to the effects of caffeine in a hair paste?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hair cremes in various formats - forming cream, styling paste, pomade - and from differing manufacturers for about ten years. This is my first experience with Dove Men+Care styling paste and though it is a decidedly good product on its own, comparing it to leading brands or simply higher-end hair products makes the Dove product less desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me mirror what&#x27;s been stated in several other reviews - the price per ounce (at the time of this review) of the Dove Styling Paste is crazy. This stuff is priced higher by a wide margin than American Crew Forming Cream which I use regularly and consider a better product. Second, the Dove product suspiciously resembles (right down to the packaging) the bargain priced Suave Styling Paste with the addition of two ingredients: caffeine and cera alba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Dove&#x27;s Styling Paste twice I can safely say that I do like the product. It holds my hair well throughout the day albeit with a bit more stiffness than the American Crew Forming Cream I regularly use. The Dove product isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to hold up well under the intense heat and humidity of a Midwest summer. The Dove paste does smell a bit floral but wasn&#x27;t noticeable after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m having a hard time recommending this product. If you&#x27;re a diehard Dove Men+Care user then the higher price point may be acceptable. Personally if I were looking at something cheaper than the American Crew product I&#x27;d try out the cheaper Suave Styling Paste first to see if I could live without the (apparently pricey) caffeine and cera alba ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with caveats - also check out American Crew or Suave Styling Paste.</li>
    <li> Works well to style my 6yr old grandson&#x27;s short hair. Has a nice scent to it and washes off hands easily after application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not as big of a fan of products that leave your hair wet looking, and I don&#x27;t like thicker hair products.  This styling paste seems to be somewhat in the middle.  It&#x27;s pretty thick, but once spread out and warmed up a bit on your hands it thins out some (although I would have preferred to have it thin out even more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I grabbed a bit too much and really had to work it in, it just takes a very small amount.  Works in easily, lets your hair be styled and after it is worked in my hair stayed in place but didn&#x27;t feel like a rock.  The smell is nice, not overpowering, hard to describe, has a masculine smell, but subtle.</li>
</ol>
