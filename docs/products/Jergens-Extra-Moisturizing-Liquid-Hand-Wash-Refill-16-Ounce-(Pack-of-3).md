<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hand wash is heaven.  We wash our hands a lot as we have two children to attend to at home.  It can be unbearable in the winter if we do not use the right product.  Thank goodness that we purchased this product after having read all the reviews.  It does its job and yet keeps your hands soft.</li>
    <li> One year for Christmas, my grandson asked me to give him the &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; he had always used at my house.  He loved the smell.  He said he and his sister both related the smell to me (thank goodness it was a good smell)!  For Christmas I sent both of the bottles of the Jergens Liquid Hand Wash Soap Refill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jergens for years.  The scent is very appealing yet mild.</li>
    <li> This soap is very mild and has a pleasant scent.  It is also very economical as you can just refill your smaller dispenser.  It really does the job of cleaning your hands without drying them out.</li>
    <li> My go to hand soap. So glad I was able to find it on Amazon. The traditional Jergens almond scent, the smooth texture, and I&#x27;m not creating super bugs by using anti-bacterial substances. Win-win!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this hand soap, because I can no longer find it in stores.  It&#x27;s gentle to my hands and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, just a very mild Jergens cherry almond scent, which I&#x27;ve always loved.  I hate most fragrances in products, but this fragrance is so mild that it doesn&#x27;t bother me, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on my hands.  My husband loves it, too.  It&#x27;s the only hand soap we use.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand soap in refills!  This soap is so nice, it smells wonderful, wont dry out your hands and the price here on Amazon is fantastic.  I have no idea what it would cost in a real store because I live in the middle of nowhere so my basis of comparison is off as far as that goes but it seems very reasonably priced  to me.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product—the fragrance is subtle and the pearlescent white color looks great in a clear glass soap dispenser.</li>
    <li> My husband has super dry hands.  In the winter they look terrible.  I got him the small bottle and he loved this.  Now I am ordering it in bulk because its hard to find it that way at the store.</li>
    <li> Works well and leaves hands feeling soft, but I can&#x27;t say it has helped with the dryness of my hands. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to take the place of using lotion so for me it worked just as I expected.</li>
    <li> This is THE best liquid hand soap for kitchen and bathroom sinks.  There is no ammonium lauryl sulfate to dry and crack your hands.  The light cherry almond  scent is gentle on your nose and the suds are sufficient to make you feel that your hands are clean.  I buy this in these bulk 16 ounce refills and fill all the small hand soap dispensers throughout the house.  If you have any trouble with red hands or dry cracked hands from hand soaps,  try this.  I can&#x27;t find it in any local stores so I buy it on here on a subscription;  it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product as it is very difficult to purchase a decent hand soap not containing antibacterial additions at a decent price. The anti bacterial soap  destroys the beneficial as well as the negative bacteria. Jergens hand soap is very soothing and has a nice scent and is not anti bacterial.  So many of the ant-bacs dry out your hands even though they might do a good job of cleaning. Highly recommend Jergens hand soap.</li>
    <li> the scent reminds me of being a young girl at my Grandma&#x27;s house. We can not buy this locally anymore.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not a germaphobe, but maybe a little ocd about washing my hands.  sometimes its just something to do.  you get 3 of these bottles for $5?  total bargain.  not terribly fond of the fragrance, but it is extra moisturizing which is real important in my dry climate.</li>
    <li> I love this hand wash and have a hard time finding a refill that is more than 8oz and not a total rip off!  This is both larger and cheaper (3 whole bottles)!!!  And, with Amazon Prime, I get it in two days, no shipping!  It&#x27;s a no brainer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hand wash itself, it smells delicious and is also moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem (especially through the winter) with dry hands.  I wash them a lot especially with the newborn now.  This soap has been drying out my skin a lot less than Dial or Softsoap usually does and fits nicely in the budget.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the soap as well as the moisturizing effect it has.  We use it with Jergens lotion as well!</li>
    <li> Watery hand soaps are nasty and don&#x27;t clean well. This stuff is great - thick, creamy, cleans well, hands feel good.Put in a refillable soap pump by the sink so you only need one hand to dispense.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing hand wash does exactly what it says, moisturizes and washes.  It also has a really pleasant scent of cherry vanilla which I really like.  The price is fantastic too.  I shopped around and this was the best.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma.  I&#x27;ve used this soap for many years and can&#x27;t find it locally any more, so it&#x27;s nice to have a ready source.</li>
    <li> I love the Jergens line.  I love the cherry almond smell.  Fresh and clean, not over powering,  This is actually the only handwashing soap that leaves my hands soft and supple after use.  I rarely have to use a hand lotion after.</li>
    <li> I bought this because other reviews said their hands were less dry, but i didn&#x27;t see any difference between this and generic brands.  I was pregnant at the time so I wash washing my hands a lot more than usual, so that may be part of it.  I like the smell though, it reminds me of my childhood.</li>
    <li> One of the best pump soaps around. Moisturizes with every use, can wash hands many times a day and still not get broken skin, dried out skin, etc. vs. some of those anti-bac soaps that are just too harsh. Low scent odor that doesn&#x27;t make you smell up the entire room after walking into it with freshly washed hands unlike other pumps.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it helps keep my hands feeling soft.  I don&#x27;t like the anti-bacterial soaps as they dry my hands out.  The Cherry Almond is also a very pleasant smell.  I&#x27;ve gone from using hand lotion after every washing to using it only once a day now that I am using this soap all of the time.  Sometimes the older stuff is better.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and the smell. Even my teenage grandson remarked about the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance. Would recommend especially where guests can use it.</li>
    <li> I tolerate this liquid soap a lot better than other brands. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands and has a light scent .</li>
    <li> This soap is great and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which I like. It has a pleasant smell, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I know this isn&#x27;t an expensive fancy brand name, but it really helped my 6 yr old&#x27;s dry skin problem from over washing her hands with too much liquid soap.  Between using this soap and using some moisturizers the problem is resolved.  Good stuff.  She really likes the cherry smell too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, cleans very well and is priced just right!  Buy this stuff.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> We use this liquid soap in a dispenser int he kitchen.  It has a nice Almond scent and it isn&#x27;t too drying on the skin.  It&#x27;s also quite reasonably priced.  We buy six bottles at a time and they last about 4 months in our house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love the consistency of the creamy liquid, as well as the delicate cherry almond scent.  I buy it in bulk so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this here!  I&#x27;ve looked in all our local stores, but no one carries it anymore. It has been my favorite hand soap for many years. It&#x27;s very gentle on hands, especially chapped hands in the winter. Hopefully, it will still be available, because I&#x27;m almost out again!</li>
    <li> This is the only liquid soap that doesn&#x27;t make my skin crack with use.  I am very pleased to have found it and wish that it was available in stores.  It would be a hit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the fragrance of this hand wash. It is gentle and has a beautiful pearl like appearance if it&#x27;s in a clear dispenser.</li>
    <li> Perfect..I love this soap..I haven&#x27;t been able to find it at my usual store anymore..have tried other stores..no luck their either..love the scent and feel of this soap..so glad it was available on Amazon..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied. I take one to work as well to avoid the cheap drying soap provided. Refills are handy.</li>
    <li> Really nice smell and nice on the hands. Have not been able to find it is local stores anymore. Bought some for my Mother who is a fan.</li>
    <li> These should keep me supplied for a long time.  Other soaps are murder on my sensitive skin. Very  grateful to you.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this hand-soap invokes memories of carrying hand-cream in my purse when I was in school  and&lt;br /&gt;sharing with girlfriends.  Jergens hand-cream was the popular brand back then!  We always carried hand-cream, gum and other assorted necessities in our purses which we passed around  as needed. .  Don&#x27;t know how we managed to lug those overloaded cumbersome purses around!  Anyway, this hand-soap is extremely gentle and I bought several of these refills after finding some  Jergens liquid hand-soap pumps locally.  Now I&#x27;m set for awhile.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an old school cherry scented soap with the &amp;#34;pearly texture&amp;#34;, this is the one for you. My mom would buy cherry Jergens when I was a kid so I have a lot of nostalgia for the smell. I remember playing basketball outside on the asphalt and my hands would be covered in blackness. Jergens would get the blackness and gross smell out. I remember huffing in the deliciousness of the Jergens smell on my hands when I was through washing and drying them.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this hand soap.</li>
    <li> Really a moisturizing soap with the almond scent of Jergen&#x27;s lotion  I remember from childhood.</li>
    <li> very mild hand soap, good size for refills.  My hands are sensitive to the others, this works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I love this smell. I will always love this smell. Overall, a great cleaning soap that doesn&#x27;t leave your hands screaming for moisture (a BIG plus in our 0% humidity climate).</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff, even if it does smell like those chocolate-covered cherries you get at Christmas. Eliminated my need for hand lotion for my chapped knuckles during winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pretty pearlescent appearance, and easier to rinse off than other non-foam liquid soaps.</li>
    <li> I love this liquid hand soap. I often would get the scent of almonds when using restrooms at restaurants, but was never able to find anything with that smell in stores, so I&#x27;m really glad Amazon carries this. Now I&#x27;ve signed up to get regular shipments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lovely, cherry and almond, but not overpowering. The bottle says it is &amp;#34;extra moisturizing&amp;#34; and it leaves my hands feeling great even in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this is not anti-bacterial soap.</li>
    <li> Love the almoind scent of this moisturing liquid hand wash!  Glad Jergens has not updated the scent from 60 years ago!  Brings back great memories every time I use it!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I have dry hands, and washing them tends to make them worse. This soap, however, keeps them soft. I love the cherry almond scent, too. It&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad skin on my hands. This doesn&#x27;t really help, but doesn&#x27;t hurt it like some other soaps do either. Not sure if that helps, but it&#x27;s soap; what do you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice. I&#x27;m not sure about $3.00 a bottle.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hand wash.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in my local stores anymore and was so happy to find it here. I love the smell and as much as I wash my hands (due to my work) it does not dry me out. Will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product in 6 packs twice. Six bottles can last almost half year in my house. I like this soap because it does not have strong scent added to it and it feels very gentle on skin. It is good both for adult as well as kids.</li>
    <li> Great for refilling hand wash soap pumps.</li>
    <li> So the price just can&#x27;t be beat! I use this product everywhere in the house and I just luv the scent!</li>
    <li> HI :) This is the only soap we use around the house, and I love it. It leaves your hands creamy smooth and is not harsh on them at all.  I used to buy it in the store offline, but they stopped carrying it so I found it on amazon and I&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;For people with dry skin, this is the least offensive to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day :)</li>
    <li> Love the smell hate the ingredaints, this has parabans so I wont be using it which is sad bc it does smell great and works well but its not worth the risk.</li>
    <li> Very nice, smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry, nice lather. One of my favorite hand soaps.&lt;br /&gt; Good price</li>
    <li> Dry skin is no fun &amp; I have tried so many other products with no relief, so happy I found this!! 5 star product!</li>
    <li> Finally found a hand washing lotion to use by every sink everywhere forever!. Lovely aroma. Bought 5 convenient dispensers. Buying refills in 2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s. Love that scent!</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; it seems that whenever I purchased it, they would discontinue it.  I love the clean scent of almond &amp; cherry blossoms.  When I was a child we carried a little bottle of the hand lotion like the ladies.  When I purchased it, it brings memories of days gone by.  It is wonderful scent, it doesn&#x27;t chafe my hands in the winter.  A very good product, but of course I am an older woman with memories of times gone by.  You should try it, the fragrance is light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This hand soap is so thick it has clogged several of my soap dispensers - even when watered down! The soap also leaves a slimy residue that is hard to wash off. Perhaps that&#x27;s a byproduct of the type of water we have here, but it doesn&#x27;t happen with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it was one of the few refills that were NOT antibacterial. I&#x27;m not interested in contributing to the rise of more antibacterial-resistant germs! I was really disappointed that it was so thick, so hard to wash off, and so soap-dispenser unfriendly.</li>
    <li> I have spent years trying to find a soap that didn&#x27;t dry out my hands. I have always loved the smell of Jergens lotion so I thought I would give it a try. It is wonderful!  My hands aren&#x27;t so dry anymore from my constant hand washing.</li>
    <li> I have an infant son, so I&#x27;m changing diapers a lot, and therefore washing my hands A LOT. I use this soap in all of my dispensers, and while my skin&#x27;s a little drier than I&#x27;d like, it&#x27;s not unreasonably so, especially since it&#x27;s winter. Plus, it smells nice and has a nice feel to it as you lather it up.</li>
    <li> With having to wash my hands so many times a day, this certainly helps them from getting overly dried out.</li>
    <li> I think this is my 4th or 5th order of this soap.  I found it a few years ago at Dollar Tree and decided to buy it. I remember my grandmother used the Jergens line and it only took one use of the hand soap to bring back fond memories of being at her house in Houston, TX. I use the hand soap as well as the hand lotion.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the most moisturizing soap out there but it works for me.</li>
    <li> We have been using this hand soap for years and have never found anything we liked better.  I have difficulty find it at the store now, and this is a convenient economical way to buy it!</li>
    <li> I wash my hand constantly and this is the only soap I ever found that cleans without drying.</li>
    <li> it is really good for cleaning and moisturizing. ​It keeps my hands soft even if I wash them many times, but I did not like its smell. In general I recommend it.</li>
    <li> shipped right to your door on the subscriber save -- smells good, fair price, 3 bottles--will last a while and I can refill the bottles I already have.</li>
    <li> I really like this hand soap. The smell is nice (though I can see it being sort of \\&quot;hit or miss\\&quot; with most people), and after washing my hands I definitely feel moisturized in a way that I don&#x27;t feel with most other lotions. If you have dry hands/nails and are looking for the softest soap available, I&#x27;d recommend trying this product out. Any soap will dry out your hands to some extent, but I&#x27;ve found this to be the least offending soap.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and creamy texture.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Works well and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is not sold in any of my local stores!  It smells so good!  Love the cherry smell and it leaves my hands soft.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling hand soaps that I have ever tried. Not too strong, but very clean smelling.</li>
    <li> Love the light sent. Best smelling hand soap not over powering  I buy it all the time. Smooth and creamy texture.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  Love the smell of this and brought back memories from my childhood.  :)</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive hand wash that&#x27;s gentle on the hands. I ran out of the hand wash and had to go a few days without it, I immediiately notice a difference in my hands. A  great item to have on auto ship.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feeling, at an excellent price</li>
    <li> Rich, creamy soap that leaves your hands feeling good.  The scent is wonderful and reminiscent of pleasant childhood times and family.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff, it smells soooo good, and leaves my hands very soft. I wash my hands ALOT throughout the day and I can use these refills to fill up all the little soap dispensers in the bathrooms and the kitchen sink.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand soap that keeps my hands from cracking up in the winter.  Thanks again for this item.</li>
    <li> Got this through the subscribe and save program you save more money going that route instead of paying full price for buying it alone.</li>
    <li> I do like the feel and the smell of Jergens&#x27; products but discovered this one can cause a problem.  Be sure you rinse your hands very well after using.  While I thought I was, discovered that without lots of rinsing, this hand wash causes itchiness and irritation on hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I chose this product because of Jergens&#x27; reputation and my long-time acquaintance with their products.  After many years of using soaps with ingredients I now know can be harmful, wanted basic hand wash.  I read ingredients lists of many of these liquid products and Jergens met my needs.  Just need to rinse well.</li>
    <li> We love this hand soap; it has a beautiful light scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> After a couple of days of use, I feel the winter dryness slowly fading away. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this brand. It arrived in the promised time, and smells great. Item as described and perfect for refilling my soap dispensers.</li>
    <li> This soap is just what I need -- non-antibacterial so it does not promote superbugs and only lightly scented, so it does not give me a headache. If you wash your hands thoroughly, you do not need an antibacterial wash, ever. It is also a gentle soap, although it does not seem to really be moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have issues with fragrances. The cherry almond scent is the only one that does not irritate skin or nose. Plus it is a nice hand soap.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the smell of this soap after using it at my chiropractor&#x27;s office. I ordered a pack of 3 and used during the harsh winter months in Chicagoland. I was shocked! This actually seemed to dry out my hands rather than moisturize. I had more cracking on my knuckles and the backs of my hands. I ended up mixing this product with my tried and true Softsoap Soothing Aloe Vera just so it didn&#x27;t go to waste. I will NOT be buying anymore of this ever again.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this hand soap!  I really suffer from severe dry skin in the winter and I&#x27;ve had the hardest time finding a true moisturizing soap.  It smells heavenly and it just soothes my hands.  I&#x27;ve even washed my face with it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over the place to buy this product and was glad to find it again online</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. I&#x27;m somewhat of a hand washing freak and my hands would get all dry and cracked from regular soap. This stuff get the dirt off and moisturizes at the same time. Love it. Wont use anything else now.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as advertised.  Hands still get dried out with frequent washing.  I purchased to replace soft soap but I will be returning to that after using this.</li>
    <li> Each one of these bottles can refill the smaller pump bottle three times. Would definitely buy this item again and again.</li>
    <li> I am using this everyday, and this works really well on dry skin in winter.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to have bigger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;A bit too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This liquid hand soap REALLY moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for... it cleans and feels great on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;No odor or fancy smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a automatic hand dispenser but the refills are SOOOO expensive, so I buy these at a much lower price but its a good quality brand and just refill with these.</li>
    <li> I will be buying more of this soap.  It does not dry out my family&#x27;s hands and has a light almond, cherry scent.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores in my city, so Amazon to the rescue.</li>
    <li> Great hand soap, with creamy conditioner that moisturizers your hands. Shipped promptly, but one bottle was leaking in the shipping container.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! Smells great keeps hands soft and it was a three pack deal I couldn&#x27;t miss!</li>
    <li> It was just what she was looking for. Couldn&#x27;t find the size in the &amp;#34;BIG BOX STORE&amp;#34;</li>
