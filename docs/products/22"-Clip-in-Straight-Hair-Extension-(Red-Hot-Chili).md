      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use light heat to straighten out the kinks from the packaging.  </li>

      <li>its really easy to put in and take out.</li>
      <li>Really easy to use.</li>
      <li>They go in and out so easy, who cares?  </li>
      <li>Its just an overall great product for me :-).</li>
      <li>Good length and decent quality for the price.</li>
      <li>the color is so pretty everybody tho that it was my own hair ......</li>
      <li>The clip came out really quick and a lot of the hair came out without even touching it</li>
      <li>they are nice just lose hair really fast</li>
      <li>I bought just one of these, because I wanted to make sure that it was going to be worth my money.</li>
      <li>It had a cheap clip not like the one it has in the picture.</li>
      <li>you want bright, punky colors, you pretty much need to go synthetic.  </li>
      <li>They go in super easy and come out super easy.  </li>
      <li>I originally got this for a Halloween party.</li>
      <li>these are for sure a better quality (for what it is) than what I have been able to find locally.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my 5 year old sister since its more age appropriate for her</li>
      <li>color is really vibrant like the pictures and the clip on part is very easy to put on.</li>
      <li>however, they are really long and pretty good for the price!</li>
      <li>The color is bright red.</li>
      <li>I love them so much ....</li>
      <li>If it was a whole wig of hair it would be more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It gives your natural hair a nice pop of color.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re easy to hide and look pretty real.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipped quick,  long extension,  good clip</li>
      <li>Overall I am very satisfied and wear it almost every week.</li>
      <li>I love the bright color of this for game day (and it&#x27;s nice to be able to take it back out and not have to ruin my hair in the process!).</li>
      <li>This is a nice, true red-</li>
      <li>I wish I had found these each hair extension clips first!</li>
      <li>and now i can complete my elena look!  :)</li>
      <li>She loves it, fun addition to her hair style that can be taken out or put in as wanted.</li>
      <li>so it was worth it</li>
      <li>Other than that it looked good and stayed in place.</li>
      <li>Came fast and has lasted me for over a year now, while being stuffed in a full drawer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order more and make different lengths for fun styles.  </li>
      <li>For $10 I got a whole lot of fun.  </li>
      <li>It is meant to be more of a costume piece to be worn occasionally, but she wears them off and on throughout the year.  </li>
      <li>The color was exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for natural, don&#x27;t go for this, because they really are bright red.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty</li>
      <li>It said straight but came out very very curly.</li>
      <li>The clips are great, bend them till the teeth pop out, and bend back the other way to close.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell that they won&#x27;t last forever, but still, cool! (:</li>
      <li>the shippin was so fast .....</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m losing much money when the product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>They stay put in her straight, slippery hair all day.  </li>
      <li>Gently comb- they will be perfectly straight and silky.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care because it was for a child, but others might not like that the clip shows so much.</li>
      <li>With all that in mind, if you are looking for a statement piece that you wear occasionally, then I think you&#x27;d enjoy it.</li>
      <li>When you tug on the extension your whole head goes with it.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>One of my purple ones was very stringy after just opening the package.</li>
      <li>but it was really shiny(yea its synthetic).</li>
      <li>If these were human-hair extensions they would have cost ~$20 each - and they wouldn&#x27;t have as much color.  </li>
      <li>I was attempting to get color in my hair that looked real without going with the hair dyeing alternative.</li>
      <li>They also stay put really well in my hair.</li>
      <li>i just got my hair extensions today and they are so pretty, their bright red and very long, my hair was as long as the extension</li>
      <li>, I thought it would be vibrant</li>
      <li>I ordered the red extensions because my favorite sports team has red colors and I would be wearing them to the games.</li>
      <li>The hair is very shiny and Barbie-esque; obviously fake and plastic, which is great if that is the look you are going for.</li>
      <li>I was worried it would be more of a hot pink, but it is definitely red, just what she wanted.  </li>
      <li>Did not enjoy this for more than one day before I had to throw it out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My daughter has a couple of hair extensions like this that I have picked up from local stores around Halloween time.  Most of them are a little too short for her long hair that is nearly down to her hips.  These are the longest I have found- and I was very pleased with the quality.  It is meant to be more of a costume piece to be worn occasionally, but she wears them off and on throughout the year.  When they arrive, they are a little bent from being packaged- just pour some boiling water over them, (carefully comb out any tangles first) gently skim them with your fingers to take out the excess water, and hang to dry.  Gently comb- they will be perfectly straight and silky.  The clips are great, bend them till the teeth pop out, and bend back the other way to close.  I put them about an inch down from her middle part, (under the hair to hide the clip) and about two inches back from her face.  They stay put in her straight, slippery hair all day.  She says she gets a lot of complements while wearing them, and they do look great!  This is a nice, true red- I was worried it would be more of a hot pink, but it is definitely red, just what she wanted.  Great price, and these are for sure a better quality (for what it is) than what I have been able to find locally.</li>
    <li> Just wasn&#x27;t what i was looking for, too orange not red.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture. It had a cheap clip not like the one it has in the picture. The clip came out really quick and a lot of the hair came out without even touching it , I thought it would be vibrant but it was really shiny(yea its synthetic). I gave it to my 5 year old sister since its more age appropriate for her and she loved it haha so it was worth it I guess</li>
    <li> i absolutely love the quality, color, etc. of this piece, and the price was great. i would love to order one in every color, to be honest. IT&#x27;S TOO BAD I CAN&#x27;T GET THE THING TO STAY IN.  maybe i got a faulty piece or something, but i can&#x27;t get it to stay in. if this wasn&#x27;t an issue i&#x27;d give it a solid 5.</li>
    <li> Super fake hair. Wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy either just didn&#x27;t think I was getting Barbie hair...</li>
    <li> I should have realized that because these are not real human hair it wouldn&#x27;t be how I wanted it. You can tell that it&#x27;s not real human hair as it&#x27;s as shiny as barbies. BUT I should have expected this for only $1.50. I will still use them but probably not for my wedding in which I had hoped. Also the color isn&#x27;t quite like the picture but close enough, from far away in the packaging they look pink but then again up against a white background. Overall you get what you pay for and they aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I was looking to add a little fun and flair to my style so I bought 3 of the red (Red Hot Chili) and 3 of the purple.  For $10 I got a whole lot of fun.  They go in super easy and come out super easy.  There are a ton of how-to videos on YouTube if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use light heat to straighten out the kinks from the packaging.  One piece got a little damaged because I used a little too much heat.  My fault - I know better.  They are not human hair.  If these were human-hair extensions they would have cost ~$20 each - and they wouldn&#x27;t have as much color.  You don&#x27;t get the option to curl them, and they won&#x27;t last as long; but if you don&#x27;t wear the same ones every day they should last you a bit.  Yes, a hair or 2 will fall out here and there.  I probably lose 30 strands of my own hair a day so sure...why not?  They are $1.50 for crying out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want bright, punky colors, you pretty much need to go synthetic.  With synthetic you know it&#x27;s going to look like barbie doll hair.  It&#x27;s just the way it is.  I used two pieces on one side of my head and one in the other, and it blended in well enough that my husband and a friend both thought I had dyed my hair.  If it was a whole wig of hair it would be more noticeable.  But a little piece here and there looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely by the end of the day the clips started to make my scalp a little sore, hence the 4 stars vs. 5.  I wouldn&#x27;t dream of wearing them for more than a day, or sleeping in them &lt;shudder&gt;.  They go in and out so easy, who cares?  Just remember to be very careful brushing your hair or even running your fingers through it.  When you tug on the extension your whole head goes with it.  ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they&#x27;re long...just cut them.  I&#x27;m going to order more and make different lengths for fun styles.  I&#x27;m also getting more colors.  What a truly inexpensive way to change your look up, and with no damage to your hair whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine shipped from overseas so expect a bit of lead time on the shipment.  At this price, whatever!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my stephdaughter. She loves it, fun addition to her hair style that can be taken out or put in as wanted. No dying her hair needed.</li>
    <li> They took a long long time to come in the mail... however, they are really long and pretty good for the price! They are soft and shiny.  If you&#x27;re looking for natural, don&#x27;t go for this, because they really are bright red.  There has been some shedding already and I can tell that they won&#x27;t last forever, but still, cool! (:</li>
    <li> Good quality all things concidering, 22 INCHES long, and just as a warning, i&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks, and have worn the red more then the rest, they seem to be frizing up and tangleing more then the others, i&#x27;m ordering one more to see if it&#x27;s just that color that frizzes so badly, or just the set i have at the time, so i&#x27;ll clarify on that later. also the clips were a little thicker then i expected but if you know how (unlike me) they&#x27;re easy to hide and look pretty real.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into anime or cosplay, the red in the photo is close to the actual color, which i have dubbed Grell Red, if your familiar with Black Butler</li>
    <li> Did not enjoy this for more than one day before I had to throw it out. It tangled up so terribly.</li>
    <li> They were a good length but they came to me beyond frizzy and knotted. By the time I combed them out half of the hairs had fallen out. I tried using product to straighten them back out and all it did was make it worse. I had to throw them out.</li>
    <li> Love it! I wanted a red streak for blood clot awareness, and this is perfect! I had to cut it a little bit, but I wear it everyday and it is still nice! No one noticed it was just clipped in my hair!</li>
    <li> i just got my hair extensions today and they are so pretty, their bright red and very long, my hair was as long as the extension so i didnt have to cut it! it came  in about a week and a half from china. its really easy to put in and take out. i would definetly reccomend it... i got theis red hair extensions because im a big fan of the vampire diaries and i always wanted elenas hairstyle and now i can complete my elena look!  :)</li>
    <li> The clips I got were 12&amp;#34; long&lt;br /&gt;I sent the company a picture of them next to a ruler to show them.  They offered to reship my order. I said yes.&lt;br /&gt;A few days later got my replacements, And they were still 12&amp;#34; long.  I like the ones I did get, they look good, but not the length I ordered.</li>
    <li> Prior to finding this product, I colored a strip of my hair pink. This included bleaching my dark hair first and then coloring it, which left a very undesirable result once the color faded. I wish I had found these each hair extension clips first! I ordered the red extensions because my favorite sports team has red colors and I would be wearing them to the games. They are very easy to install and the clip doesn&#x27;t show in my thick hair at all when I put it underneath. They also stay put really well in my hair. I love the bright color of this for game day (and it&#x27;s nice to be able to take it back out and not have to ruin my hair in the process!).</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of this extensions and they are very nice and bright. They also looked real next to my real hair. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they seemed very staticy striaght out of the package but maybe that will change when I was them.</li>
    <li> The color was exactly like the picture. The extension was long. The hairs fall out a lot out of the piece. The bottom starts to look like split ends.</li>
    <li> It said straight but came out very very curly. Still looks nice though.</li>
    <li> These are very long but I cut them.  Side note do not leave them in a jean pocket and then wash our jeans.</li>
    <li> they are nice just lose hair really fast</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try the product anyway. The hair is very shiny and Barbie-esque; obviously fake and plastic, which is great if that is the look you are going for. I was attempting to get color in my hair that looked real without going with the hair dyeing alternative.</li>
    <li> I looked in my mailbox earlier, expecting my markers to come in and instead, I got my Hair extension earlier than expected. It&#x27;s really pretty and it looks nice in my hair. Thank you for making my day, I may do business with you people again. Have a nice day.</li>
    <li> I bought just one of these, because I wanted to make sure that it was going to be worth my money. What I found is that it&#x27;s a great piece of synthetic hair. It gives your natural hair a nice pop of color. In my opinion, I don&#x27;t think that is a piece that should be worn all day, every day. Remembering the fact that it is synthetic hair, it seems to hold up quite well to the riggers of mild everyday use. The toupee clip snaps into your hair very easily, and I found it to stay just where I put it. With all that in mind, if you are looking for a statement piece that you wear occasionally, then I think you&#x27;d enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I originally got this for a Halloween party. It did its job but at a price it left my scalp very tender for a couple of days. Other than that it looked good and stayed in place.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good product for maybe one use but it does defiantly have it&#x27;s flaws&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;The color is really vibrant like the pictures and the clip on part is very easy to put on. The clip did not hurt or bug my scalp at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Looks very fake!! Low quality also! After using for a hour or so it was already losing some hair. One of my purple ones was very stringy after just opening the package. It gets tangled so so so easy! And when u brush it out it just gets frayed at the ends! And after it got frayed the fray never came out. The clip is very bulky and hard to hide in my hair. It feels very different from real hair! When u brush ur hair with it in it  just pulls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is very cheap so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m losing much money when the product doesn&#x27;t work. I think this product is more of a 2 1/2 though</li>
    <li> I cant complain about this product. I love the color and it doesnt slip out. Its just an overall great product for me :-). Glad I bought a few of them!</li>
    <li> Came fast and has lasted me for over a year now, while being stuffed in a full drawer. It comes pretty long, so I can just cut it to my length! The clip on piece is good quality. However it fell off once, but nothing a little needle and thread can&#x27;t fix up! Overall I am very satisfied and wear it almost every week. I also like this one so much that I bought the Dark Blue one too!</li>
    <li> I love them so much ....n the shippin was so fast .....the color is so pretty everybody tho that it was my own hair ......</li>
    <li> The Product is amazing. I really like it. I would tell my friends about it and have them order it.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for halloween for my 4 year old and certainly beat the $10 ones at the beauty store. I didn&#x27;t care because it was for a child, but others might not like that the clip shows so much. But the clip does a great job of staying in hair, even in a child&#x27;s fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful real hair, I can straighten it. Got many compliments on this! The hair is sooo soft! It lasts a while, and is a good price.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use. The color is bright red. I had to bend the clips to get them to stay in my hair, even then they slid out a bit. Good length and decent quality for the price. I knew I was only going to use them twice, so this was the perfect product for me. If you&#x27;re looking for something better quality you&#x27;ll probably have to pay more.</li>
    <li> The extension is very long so you actually stand a chance of not looking tacky with it being super short if you have long hair. The color is very bright too. I love this!</li>
    <li> Shipped quick,  long extension,  good clip</li>
