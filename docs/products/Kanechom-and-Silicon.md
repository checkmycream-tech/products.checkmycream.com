<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is way too strong and over bearing. I think the product would be better without it, otherwise would give a better rating.</li>
    <li> wonderful wonderful...been telling all about product</li>
    <li> great product, and love the smell</li>
    <li> works well, but the type in the dark brown jar works better. good product though</li>
    <li> i like this better than the other kanechoms. its a little thicker, and i like the smell and function.  works well with other products from other lines,</li>
    <li> I mix it like everyone else and it help my weave curl pattern to come back after dying 2 times. I only use it once.</li>
    <li> I used this product with the Silicon Mix, which works well. I found that I could use the Silicon Mix with any type of conditioner, but I do like the product. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. I would use this again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very quick and the product smells AMAZING!! It kept my hair really nice and soft and manageable and I can&#x27;t wait to replace this before it even runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well recommended!</li>
    <li> I Used this product on my hair and my hair fell out......  I have natural curly hair no perm ever and  I applied this product with the silicone mix.  i watched the U tube instruction video. MY HAIR CAME OUT IN CLUMP!!!!!  I&#x27;m very upset!!!!!</li>
    <li> I knew goat&#x27;s milk was great for skin but had no idea how great it is for hair. This product made my hair so soft and hydrated,  it&#x27;s wonderful. The milk proteins add strength and it smells heavenly. If I had to choose one \\&quot;do all\\&quot; deep conditioner this would be the one. This coming from an unrepentant product junkie. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> This is yet the best hair treatment for any type hair....when combined with the Silicon Mix from the Dominican Republic the result is butter...instant butter I could say that with confidence being a license cosmetologist specialized in the treatment of damaged hair...I Just Love it, and in 30 years plus I&#x27;ve never raved  nor endorsed about any product....actually both...Brazilian and West Indies...you cannot go wrong with this...a little bit goes a long way.  ENJOY!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner ever!!!! Wow no more dandruff. I also mixed with silicone conditioner. My hair is soft and silky!!! I&#x27;m in love now! Thanks</li>
    <li> I did not like how this left my hair limp, I have fine hair, it sucked, I did not use it again, I used it on a few clients and was not impressed, I used in conjunction with silicone, this is all hype, I saw it on utube, where some girl was raving about it, and I am sorry she was phony to me, in retrospect</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie. I brought many expensive conditioners that are currently stock piled in cabinets and drawers...you get the point. This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. I will continue to buy this wonderful conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a review to help anyone who has 4a.b.c. type hair. african american hair.I used this product mixed with the silicon mix and i left it on for about 8 hours by that time it was dry and set in my hair. great for deep conditioning. well my type hair which is a 4a tangles alot well when i used this mixed with the silicon mix my hair was smooth as silk when i washed it out i hand blow dryed my hair and flat ironed my hair straight and when i say my hair was soo soft it wasnt weighed down it felt just like i got it professionally straightened. it flowed and shaked like the wind my hair was so nice. i will continue to use and will add to my regimen. I wish I would have found out sooner before my hair broke off but my hair will be pretty for now on. I credit my knowledge of this product to omgitsvictoria on youtube she&#x27;s the one that put me up on this product and the silicon mix,thanks girl. and hopefully this will help someone that needs a good product that will keep their hair nice and tangle free.</li>
    <li> Love what this does for my hair! Lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and this is soooo moisturizing! Love it and will continue to purchase and try all of the other kanechom hair mask as well! :-D</li>
    <li> This is an okay conditioner on its own--but when paired with the Silicon Bambu, I had excellent results.  I used two parts Kanechom with one part Silicon Bambu, left it on my hair for three minutes, air dry, then straitened with my Maxiglide.  My hair was soft, silky with great shine.</li>
    <li> The product actually  made my hair quite dry. I tried it as part of the silicone  duo. The silicone  actually worked quite well by itself but when I added this found my hair turned out dry. It is a shame that I spent 15 dollars on a product that I can not return.</li>
    <li> This product is slightly on the watery side but its good for a deep conditioning treatment if your hair is healty</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable</li>
    <li> I used this with the Silicon Mix. Works very well with it or on its own. Leaves the hair super soft and manageable. The smell is to die for. Super creamy and a little goes a long way. Another jar that will last me a full year. Can&#x27;t wait to try all the other varieties.</li>
    <li> Love , Love, Love Did I say love. My hair smells great and is so soft after every use. Introduced, and bought this product for my Hairstylist. After seeing how much product I received for the price she asked me to order it for her. She is quite impressed with product as well. My hair is down the middle of my back.Longer than before.I am a black woman, and am certain that people believe that I have a Weave. No, no, no. It&#x27;s all my Hair people. Lol.</li>
    <li> looking at the picture it is not what you get the container is completely different</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner is ok I didnt really see any big difference from any other conditioner that I have used.</li>
    <li> After years an years of searching an trying different hair treatment...I&#x27;ve finally found the one!!!....this stuff makes my hair feels like butter an the shine is amazing!!...I&#x27;m truly pleased with this product an will be in my hair regime for a long,long,long time....in love is what I call it...thank u Jesus.</li>
    <li> It is a good product will continue to use. Smells really good and leaves your hair pillow soft. I mix mine with silicon mix</li>
    <li> Too harsh for my hair. I am African American with natural hair. Smelled way too chemically. Did not see what everyone else saw.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very soft and it doesn&#x27;t carry that chemical scent.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Use mostly for wigs. Revive human and synthetic wigs with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes a long way. Brush wig thru with Denman brush and let set or place in zip lock bag with smudge of water and deep treatment 1mim microwave and wash out as normal</li>
    <li> I received the product today,I not get a change to use it as yet but it smiles really good. product also came damaged.</li>
    <li> Good product I have a total satisfaction with the product and with the distributor.</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner ever, mixed with Silicon Mix by hair was absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair. Damaged it pretty bad</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well. Without a doubt Silicon Mix is much better.</li>
    <li> This product is nice, but not the one I received. I got a different one than pictured.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff.</li>
    <li> oh well...i haven&#x27;t used this product yet. but with the reviews, I&#x27;m sure it will be good. Good packaging, and its as big as it looks.</li>
    <li> I love this Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk.  Hair is soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> WOW love this product! Great price and seller. Fast ship!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the product and it is what I needed. It was on time and I really appreciate everything! I&#x27;, in love with it and I will order more from the seller. Thanks</li>
    <li> This was amazing I will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Does not work the way I hoped but it is ok.  Company was very efficient and got the product right out to me.</li>
    <li> i love this product ! You can tell a difference after the 1st wash especially if you use the silicon conditioner . LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
    <li> A beauty secret that many salon don&#x27;t tell excellent .... I really like this product  all the family can use it</li>
    <li> I  couldnt wait to receive this product.  I have been wanting to try it for about three years now. Sadly, Im not that impressed.  It does leave you&#x27;re hair soft, but not that soft.  It also has a VERY strong perfume  smell. I hate the smell.  Maybe if I keep using it and use it by itself and not add the silicone mix then I&#x27;ll like it better.... I hope so :(</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I would recommend to anyone it makes your hair feel so soft and feel like silk thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> i this was ok my hair didn&#x27;t like it  so i have to give it always</li>
    <li> Great product! Used for deep conditioning and managing thick hair. Left my hair soft and silky. The price is reasonable for the large 35.2 fl oz container.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by the immediate results that I got from the &amp;#34;Kancechom&#x27;s, Brazilian Goat&#x27;s Milk Treatment. I had some hair breakage from using a previous product, Kanechom has already began the healing process on my hair. Already, I notice the luster and strength that my hair has regained and it has only been 4 weeks and two treatments since I began to use the product. I plan on exploring more of this brand&#x27;s many products and would recommend them to anyone who desires silky, smooth, repaired, strong hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and leaves my hair feeling amazing. Will order again.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.it last a long time and works really good.this is my second one and i had the first one for 10month and i use it once a week</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. .......this stuff is so good. My hair is so thick and when I applied the mixture of this product and silicone mix intensive, my hair was so soft. It also softens my hair if used alone.</li>
    <li> this product is great for hair that is in trouble. Its the best by far mask i ever used. You can feel the difference in your hair within seconds. the smell is so very pleasurable. you get alot for the money. I&#x27;ve used $50. treatments and none of them can be  compare to kanechom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was very dry and brittle and falling out. now my hair is moisturized and healthy. this is a the best mask treatment ever.</li>
    <li> I use it in combination with Silicon Mix, and it actually doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference, Silicon Mix is great, so not sure if it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Thus is my new BFF mixture with the silicone. I leave on for about 30 minutes to an hour it is great. Leaves my hair manageable and silky smooth. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair so all I do is comb it out and it&#x27;s blowing in the wind. I sometimes add coconut oil to my hair after a few days to pull back a ponytail. This stuffs great. Love it</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes your hair super soft</li>
    <li> my mom had this under her sink in her house, and i normally use only devacurl or miss jessie&#x27;s for my curls. but since i didnt have my products around i decided to use this. OMG!!!! this is by far one of the best conditioners ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did notice that my mom&#x27;s normally tight unruly blonde curls were looking more softer and beautiful. i thought it was perhaps because she got a hold of the products i was using. but NO, it&#x27;s all because of this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only shampoo once a week, but co-wash(wash with conditioner) every other day (when you have curls its the best way to care for them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love this conditioner so much im ordering two jars.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It smells amazing and it has allowed me to detangle my super curly hair with no problem. Definitely recommend this product for all hair types especially my natural hair sisters!</li>
    <li> This is one product I don&#x27;t want to go without along with the silicone mix intensive deep treatment by Avanti.</li>
    <li> This is a treat for my hair. I&#x27;m mixed, Mexican and American Indian. I have coarse hair. Very,very, coarse hair. This product give my hair a smoothness that I can&#x27;t find with ANY OTHER product. I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I got the wrong item, I was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product worked great on my hair! Will buy again. After using this product it made my hair feel soft and it took the fuzziness away.</li>
    <li> It is a little too early to comment on ots long term effects however the use so far is great. It goes on smoothly and smells great. I use this item with another item (silicone). I mix it in a 1:1 ( one to one) ratio as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair is so silk soft when I am finished.  I like it because I can tell that I my 4A/3C hair is actually mositerized through and through.  It first appears to be surface oil but then  after you rinse your hair well, my hair is still soft.  I mix it with SILICON MIX Intensive Hair Treatment in a 50/50 ratio.  I also sit under the dryer for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> This product is bomb! I used this product in conjunction with the silicone mix treatment and let me just tell you! That combination will have your hair feeling stronger, looking healthier and feeling smooth! I was very pleased with the the texture of my hair once I rinsed out the products and blow dryed my hair. My hair had so much body.</li>
    <li> I ordered three of the Kanechom products, This one ranks #1 for my hair. My hair is really healthy now and the texture is so amazing! My hair loves the Kanechom line, and this one I will continue to use for a very long time. I feel that this line has contributed to good hair growth.</li>
    <li> I just used this conditioner today, I love it! It makes your hair feel soft and healthy. Great conditioner and economical.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Kanechom Keratin conditioner as well as this one, both are huge and last me forever, they are wonderful products, I have fine curly, dry hair that I torture, but these conditioners keep my hair happy and moisturized.  I have tried it with the silicon mix, but didn&#x27;t like that as much.  Lately I actually mix the two Kanechom conditioners together :)  Either way, these are some of the best conditioners I have ever used, and will continue to repurchase them both, and I&#x27;ll probably try the rest that they offer as well.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m natural and it worked on my hair, by making it curly and a bit soft. through the time it was in my hair (overnight) it was extremly itchy. id advice to do it with a hair dryer (not hand held) for better result. packaging doesnt look the same.</li>
    <li> I received this yesterday and used it later that nigh. Oh my goodness I LOVE LOVE this, instantly mule hear was not frizzy, it was smooth, and shined. My hair is just weird it has no shine and is never soft. It&#x27;s been that way since I can remember. But this stuff made Mt hair soft and smooth and even gave it a little shine. I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> this works pretty well not as much as the hype was about I will stick to natural oils, this product along with some silicon mix were shipped to me with a piece of tape on the lid to hold it tight no seal, sooo needless to say the product was everywhere when it got to me. really disappointing, at least it&#x27;s a big bottle!</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s one of the worst hair conditioner brands in Brazil, it costs 1 dollar for this huge package.. i don&#x27;t understand why everybody likes it</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it for my hair extensions and it leaves them feeling silky for weeks. And my hair has never been so soft. Love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the product and will also reorder this again. Love the smell of it. It does an amazing job on the hair and on weaves!</li>
    <li> Love it!  First time I used it I could feel and see a difference in my hair.  I have very damaged hair and it makes it soft and smooth and shiny.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people put it on and they felt it made their hair brittle.  Because of that, I mix it with another conditioner at times.  I&#x27;m glad I found this product.  Works great for me.</li>
    <li> Quite miraculous!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing in that it tames the frizzy hair in this family! Makes our hair super soft (but not limp or greasy or weighed down at all). Not the best smell, in my opinion, but can put a styling product in my hair and fix that. SO worth it for the softness payoff!  Am buying again and more so all daughters can have their own! Would like in a pump bottle even better....</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives stressed hair an awesome kick.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a deep conditioner that worked well with my natural hair. I was so pleased with this product and how it made my hair feel during application and after. The smell is amazing the slip of it is perfect and my hair feels amazing. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Provides great shine and hair looks healthy. Used this product with the silico  mix.  Will buy products again</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Don&#x27;t think about it just buy it. My hair is colored thing curly and split at the ends. I used this for the first time Lastnight for 30 minutes and it&#x27;s already doing wonders to my hair. My hair had never felt so soft easy to style and just all over good looking.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and try their other products.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews on ytube.  I did not like the smell, I did not like that there was no english translation, did not do enough to purchase again. Did not like the weak packaging.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of good things about this hair treatment, so my expectations were high.  To me, it was just okay.  I mixed it with the Silicon Mix as suggested but I don&#x27;t feel like it lives up to all the hype.  Doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
    <li> I do love this conditioner but I must say I like to use this with Silicon Mix! Great slip when both is used together! Will purchase again:)</li>
    <li> after seeing a few youtube vids about this stuff, I decided to try it out for myself. I bought with the silicon mix I guess ones protein and one is moisture so your hair will be balanced. So upon rinsing the mixture my hair felt really nice, smooth, and silky! Once my hair started to dry though it started feeling funny like almost dried out so I decided just to wait and see and once my hair was fully air dried the results were amazing. It really took the frizz out of my texlaxed hair! This will be a staple and 30 something ounces will last me many wash days to come which balances out the cost for me.</li>
    <li> Great product keeps your hair well hydrated and soft,smooth with a lot of body.  This is the first time i have used this product, guess i will be ordering it all the time.</li>
    <li> Significantly improves my dry colored hair. I actually leave some in my hair at times because it helps maintain my moisture and locks in my curls.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. It will leave your hair smooth and shiney. I would recommend this product to everyone of color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works really well with silicon ..makes your hair very soft &amp; manageable .. I Love It! will purchase again</li>
    <li> Very Moisturizing, great price for the amount! I LOVE IT! KANECHOM Addicted!  I alternate between the Kanechom Goat&#x27;s milk and the Kanechom Chocolate Mask every other week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural, also bleach and dye my hair a lot so it needs a rich conditioner to refortify it. and this does the job!!!! plan on investing in the whole line in the future!!!!!!! buy this ladies your hair will thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Leaves hair soft, silky, and very managable! Very satisified with this purchase! I will try other products by</li>
    <li> Overall my hair feels really moisturizer and smooth after using this.I saw it in my local Dominican hair dresser and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.I use this with silicone mix and it works together like a charm.Good for natural/transitioning hair!</li>
    <li> I saw a Utube video of a girl w/ curly, frizzy hair mix this with Silicon mix and her hair was fabulous; I decided to try it and it worked wonderfully!  I thought my hair needed to be trimmed and after utilizing this, I really didn&#x27;t need the trim just something to tame frizzy; I live in a very humid climate</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioning treatment and found it to make my hair very silky to the touch however as a naturalist, I wasn&#x27;t so keen on the fact that it has silicone in it and using it in conjunction with the &amp;#34;Silicone Mix&amp;#34; by Avant, I didn&#x27;t want my hair coated with this silicone. If I was wearing my hair straight, I find this product to really be amazing as if does make my hair feel buttery smooth but I don&#x27;t recommend this product for those who want to wear their hair in its natural curly state because you will have to use sulfate shampoo to remove the silicone coating from your hair &amp; that really stripped my hair of its moisture. I had to really work with my hair to replace the hydration that was taken out &amp; for me it took about 2 weeks to really get my hair back the moisture level that I maintained on my natural hair before using this.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Its so amazing, my hair has never been this halthy! Every one should try it!!</li>
    <li> Its great and it was on time 😊. Definitely ordering from y&#x27;all again !</li>
    <li> I mix this with the protein silicon and I get really fabulous silky hair!! This stuff lasts for a long time and gets to you fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the silicon mix I notice a different after my first application. Im African American with coarse thick long hair this product made my hair so soft n shiny. I used this product every two weeks as a deep conditioner and my hair is string silky and soft. Please try you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I usually combine it with Silicon mix and I get defined curls. However, i am not sure I would use it regularly</li>
    <li> Loving it , tried using it on my weave and it feels good and more more soft each time... Thanks</li>
    <li> I heard great things about this hair treatment; I bought and try in my hair.  My hair came out soft I love it would buy again.</li>
    <li> Makes hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Sept. 12th from Amazon. Got it 13th Sept., so very happy about that. I heard about this product on You Tube from a couple of ladies who use it mixed with Silicon Mix from Avanti. I applied both mixed together in pretty equal portions on my freshly washed hair last night &amp; left in during the night. Rinsed from my hair a bit ago &amp; my hair feels wonderful; soft, bouncy &amp; full. My natural hair type is 4b. It is presently colored &amp; texlaxed in back part only. I usually mix an oil or 2 in my conditioning treatments, but I didn&#x27;t with this so I could see how effective they are. I&#x27;m very pleased with the result &amp; will continue to use these products. The price here is lower than what I paid so get it while it&#x27;s HOT!!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered quickly, packed perfectly and worked marvelously! It has a light, clean scent and conditioned my natural, curly hair very well. I plan to purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I smells great, it comes in a large quantity and seems to do a great job. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair so soft and moisturized.  I have relaxed, chemically damaged hair and this product has done wonders.  I mix this with the Silicon Mix and a little Castor/Oilve Oil and he results are amazing.  It has also helped me to stretch my relaxer longer because my hair looks as if if as just relaxed after use.  Will never be without this product.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Will continue to order from this seller.</li>
    <li> Works well with the silicon mix</li>
    <li> I first saw this product used on YouTube and the young lady raved about the product so I have to try I actually see what she was raving about it makes your hair so silky soft when you&#x27;re taking a shower and washing your hair and you put this conditioner on  it becomes tangle free so silky you won&#x27;t regret buying this</li>
    <li> Great, mixed with silicone cream for mixed hair use.</li>
    <li> Good for easy application and quite satisfactory as there was no skin reactions or peppery sensation.it is a great deal well deserved and less costly.recommended</li>
    <li> I used this in addition to the Silicon mix on my hair and when I say it left my hair so soft, that&#x27;s an under statement. They both were delivered in a couple of days. I will be sure to order again.</li>
    <li> Makes hair super soft really fast, and detangles very well. Help my damaged ends too. I love it. I will sure buy it again.</li>
    <li> This has changed my hair dramatically for the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am part spanish, french and russian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow my hair is fine, thick and kinda wavy/kinda curly. It damages very easily and likes to clump together into a nest if left unattended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair feel like silk while still looking full yet shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add I do not use this on its own. I make a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix two parts Kanechom Leite De Cabra, and one part Bambu silicon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on as long as I can. (a few minutes, a couple of hours, or overnight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair now looks like salon hair! :-)</li>
    <li> made my hair feel soft. I would re purchase this after I have used all of it. Glad I found.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and the Silicon conditioner after rave reviews here and on U Tube, needless to say it was a very bad choice. I used it as the directions stated. I have fine soft kinky African American hair not sure what number I am 3c 4b ect. I had done the big chop and grown my hair to pass shoulder length; which took about 2 1/2 yrs. I used this product it dried my hair out it became crunchy and just began to break off very VERY! badly. My entire pony tail just broke off  :(  . The conditioner could not be washed out because it sank into the hair shaft , it was extremely depressing. My hair continued to break off for several months and became very thin. finally I cut it way back and now I am starting over again. @ 62 yrs. of age my hair does not grow that fast now. So BE VERY CAREFUL choosing and  using this product, I don&#x27;t like to put down anyone&#x27;s product line but I would really hate any one to go thru what I experienced.</li>
    <li> I used this product alone as directed by the package directions. i did not notice any improvement. As far as, shine and manageability. I also used it in conduction with another product which was recommended to use with it. The results were better. I used the other product alone and achieved better results. I should have just purchased the other product.</li>
    <li> I had broguht 3 products from the same company at 1 time and this one I love the best. This product is hard to find on the streets and thank god for Amazon they had it and at a reasonable price. You need to try this product it leaves your hair so sliky soft and I have kind of tight coil hair. You will love love this product for real. I&#x27;m telling  you the truth and the price is right. Get some you can&#x27;t go wrong at all. the smell is wonderful.This is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my hair, the sheen and softness is a testament to how good this product is. I would recommend this to anyone who has hair that is chemically treated or coloured</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously since I got it 3 weeks ago. This is my go to product. I use this for my wash n go pixie style when I go out. I use it with aloe Vera gel and my vegetable glycerin water spray. There is no leftover residue. My 3c/4a hair appears to have a slightly looser curl when I use it. I have coily spirally hair. This does the trick in laying my hair down. It has wonderful shine and moisture when I&#x27;m done applying the product. The slip is something I can&#x27;t explain it doesn&#x27;t disappear like other conditioners do. I will definitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical when I see such great reviews on hair products. After watching a YouTube video on this particular product mixed with the silicon, I had to try it for myself. This is honestly an AWESOME treatment/product. It makes my hair so silky and soft...almost like butter! I definitely recommend anyone to try it!</li>
    <li> Worse conditioner ever used. After using my hair felt like straw and was very dry. I had to recondition with another conditioner just to get my hair to feel soft again. I think it may work for others............maybe, but not on my hair. This is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and the silicon to use together because of all the great things I heard. I have type 4c hair and I do not straighten my hair often. I have used this conditioner for a few months now. This is a good conditioner alone and with the silicon, but it was no miracle worker for my hair. I did notice an improvement in the softness of my hair the first few days after using. I also use a little on my dry hair as a leave in in conjunction with some other oils, butters and water, and it works great.</li>
    <li> in conjunction with the Silicon mix. Use it on my natural curly hair, also on my daughters relax hair. Very good, will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I liked this product on my relaxed hair. It moisturized and made it very soft; however on my natural hair I would recommend a different product. Of course everyone has different hair textures, as my natural hair grew in I found this a little less effective--Could just be me though. It smells nice &amp; has an interesting consistency. Nice product, I&#x27;d definitely consider using it again. Hope this helps. Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! The softest and curliest my hair has been in YEARS! This has been one of my better investments this year for my hair</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells awesome, feels good, and leaves my hair feeling great! Will definitely use again! Love it!</li>
    <li> got this product in less than 4 days and well packaged, will return after i use it this weekend. I&#x27;m a natural girl so I&#x27;m hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> Another good product, love it , I got to have it, it is good for all hair types, even colored treated hair like my own, my natural hair loves this stuff very soft manageable, can not love without it.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend with relaxed hair and wondered how it would work on my natural hair. It works pretty well but I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again. If you regularly apply heat to your hair however, this is a great product! I used it for deep conditioning along with the Silicon Mix and it performed wonderfully. This product is great for damaged hair so I highly suggest it after heat or color treatments.</li>
    <li> Love love it makes your hair soft and helps it grow but it smells.like.cheap.baby lotion.but  its amazing and.i.havent even.tried it with the silicon.mix yet</li>
    <li> Very good when mixed with silicone mix I will purchase this product again, and I recommend everyone to give it a try. It works better on my aunt&#x27;s hair, but it left my hair with less tangles. It was also soft.</li>
    <li> I have medium fine dark brown hair, shoulder length hair. I bought this and silicone mix after watching a YouTube video that swore it was the greatest thing on the planet for hair. You&#x27;re suppose to mix the two together.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER I bought both of these I read reviews stating that the silicone mix leaves your hair flat greasy and waxy. I decided to just use the goat mix. My hair felt dry and not soft at all. I looked at both these gigantic jars of white goo and thought &amp;#34;what a waste of money&amp;#34;. A month or so later I decided to just try the silicone mix. I washed my hair with baby shampoo and then put a big handful of the silicone mix in my hair and leftist in for 5 to 7 minutes. I rinsed and let my hair air dry. OMG!  I LOVE THE SILICONE MIX! My hair soft, shiny, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this review is for the goat mix. I just wanted to explain how my experience came to be.</li>
    <li> I heard about this treatment on youtube and all of the reviews where great. It&#x27;s a really good conditioning treatment. My hair felt great after using it. It smells nice and the consistency is thick and creamy (like pudding). I was priced higher then the other conditioners I purchased but I think it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Has so much slip and It allows me to detangle my hair easily</li>
    <li> Mixing this with SILICON MIX IS PERFECTION. Made my hair soooo soft. I have never felt my hair that soft</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! It makes your hair very soft and shiny! If I could give more than 5 stars I would have! Excellent!lo</li>
    <li> This is a great stand alone product without the use of Silicon Mix.  Or you can add the Silicon Mix Bamboo (my favorite) and still reap the benefits.  I use this on my natural hair and I have no complaints.  I have also recommended this product to other naturals dealing with hydration problems.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Loved this product !!!!😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I mix it with the Silicone Mix conditioner. It is a heavy conditioner and provides a good deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> Ok, I recently purchased this item and a Silicon Mix conditioner and those together after a deep condition of 30-45 mins on my natural hair and my extentions left my hair extremly soft, healthier looking, more vibrant looking and an awsome scent that didnt wreak of chemicals but more of a fresh clean scent. My husband even commented on how healthier it looked and that my hair was more softer to touch. I am floored about how I had never heard of these products let alone how my stylist never has used these products either. Either way, this is now married to me and my healthier and more managable looking hair for LIFE. This is truly a great investment for all types of hair that is very affordable and will last you for months depending on usage. Take a healthy hair challenge and see the amazing results after just one use. Im sure your hair will thank you.</li>
    <li> smell great make  my hair soft and manageable . I will buy again I mix it with the silicone mix its GREat</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from others on Youtube, Others used this product along with the Silicon Mix Intensive Hair Deep Treatment by Avanti.  So I ordered it based on the reviews and I tell ya, it was just what I heard and expected. I used 1 TBSP of the Silicon Mix and 1 TBSP of the Kanechom hair treatment and mixed both together in a small bowl. I actually washed my hair about 12:30am and used the mixed conditioners, put a plastic cap on my head and sat under a dryer for 15 minutes and I got hot and tired and went to bed with the mix still in my hair and the cap on my head. I rinsed my hair and blow dried it about 7am. OMG! My hair was so soft and bouncy. It has so much body. I loved it! It felt so good! Better than any other conditioners I have ever used and that&#x27;s the truth. I then flat ironed and curled the ends. It was so full, silky and just beautiful. I didn&#x27;t use this product by itself, so my rating is based on the two products mentioned earlier, mixed together just as others instructed. I was VERY pleased of the results.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very soft and shiny and helps repair my dry damaged hair. I have fried my hair by bleaching multiple times and getting perms and relaxer and heat tools , plus  I&#x27;m mixed black and Korean . My hair is mostly like black people hair curly and corse . With this my hair feels and looks healthy and silky I will be repurchasing this And might try different kinds from this company :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the silicone mix. I like using this product alone rather than with the silicon mix. This stuff makes my hair feel like butter. The smell is light and not overbearing. I would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!! I will be using and buying this from now on!!!!! no other product can compare to this stuff!!! I am in love!!!</li>
    <li> but it was the same product my mom loves it and it has helped her hair i see i will ave to order more later&lt;br /&gt;the smell is very nice i didnt expect that from this product</li>
    <li> Like most women on this page, I tried this conditioner after watching the youtube videos. First of all, I did not like the smell. It almost puts me in the mind of a relaxer. It made my head tingle as though I was getting a chemical treatment. It caused my heart to race and my breathing was short.  Second, it made my hair brittle, hard, tangled, and dry. I knew it the minute I ran my hair under the water. My hair felt so hard and it was breaking off really badly. I have relaxed African American hair and it did not work as well for me as everyone else. I will stick to using the Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil line by Organix.</li>
    <li> my hair is silky soft and stronger after using this with silicone. I can prolong my relaxer using this product</li>
    <li> this is one of the best products on the market for hair at least my type I am mixed so it&#x27;s complicated to find things that work for my hair this is one of them</li>
    <li> works great.  would recommend</li>
    <li> In my opinion, every woman needs this in her supplies when it comes to detangling and conditioning hair. I use this in conjunction with Silicon Mix. It helps the hair to blow dry at ease. I&#x27;m glad I found out about those 2 great products.</li>
    <li> This product had a nice smell to it. I mox it with the silicone mix for my hair when I do a deep treatment</li>
    <li> Based on all the YouTube vids I just knew this added with that Silicon stuff would be amazeballs. The 1st time I used this + the silicon together I kept it in my hair for over an hour....I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. My hair is soft already so I just thought it would be more soft. It wasn&#x27;t. The second time I left it in for maybe 5 mins. I was in the shower so it wasn&#x27;t long at all but this time I noticed a difference. My hair was softer. So I guess all the raves were correct.</li>
    <li> It was good for my hair and made my hair so soft, please try it if your hair needs it..later</li>
    <li> So this offers my curly semi-coarse hair incredible slip; however, the smell is just too overwhelming its is a weird perfumy almost baby lotion esque scent. I would not buy this again unless the headache producing scent is overhauled, even if my hair was left awesomely soft.</li>
    <li> So few times I have found a product that actually does what it says it does. This product worked for me it has made a huge difference in my hair I can&#x27;t wait to try different Kanechom products. Give it a try and see what it can do for you.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fabulous my hair loves it have tried it twice since I have received it.  Hair type I think 4a-b. when I use it hair is shiny, I do twist out after treating my hair with this wonderful product.. The twists are bouncy, hair looks hydrated . Can&#x27;t wait to do a blow out after treating my hair with this product. I mixed this with equal amounts of silicon like the Lady on Youtube suggested.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It will literally &amp;#34;Tame&amp;#34; any hair type. I will continue to purchase... A great buy, for sure!</li>
    <li> First use, I noticed a difference.  It smelled nice. Great price for the amount you get. I shared mine with my sister. She loves it as well. I have heat damaged hair and split ends. This is an awesome treatment for that.  I will continue to order and use this product. The only thing about the container is the instructions aren&#x27;t in very clear English. I figured it out though.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it would on the container! It also restored the health of my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very milky which I think helps it to penetrate better if you blot your hair.  I think it is a great value for the size (32 oz) in relation to the price.  It does leave my hair detangled which is a great benefit for coily hair.  i would suggest you try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. When mixed with silicon mix shampoo and conditioner it leaves hair silky and smooth. Over time it repairs damaged hair. I would recommend this product to people of all hair types.</li>
    <li> Great treatment for my hair</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue using it. Really good for my natural 4c hair. It just needs a more sturdey container, but again its about the product. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product too much for my coarse hair. I thought my hair would be silky but instead it was tangled</li>
    <li> This is so good for the hair. It makes it so soft, I will keep using this also.  Found this after seeing a review on You tube</li>
    <li> I bought this to try it because of a youtuber&#x27;s rave when used with the Silicon Mix Hair Treatment. So purchased both here in Amazon and used it right away. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product at all. It wasn&#x27;t completely terrible, but it also wasn&#x27;t insanely awesome either. I am mixed race and have naturally curly hair (not sure of the numeric type). Using this product didn&#x27;t make it particularly easy to detangle my hair. I usually do that in the shower while conditioning and I was expecting this to miraculously make that an easy process for me. It didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve had much better results with other products I&#x27;ve used and will definitely go back to those. After washing it out, it left me hair feeling kind of dry. That was something I wasn&#x27;t expecting at all. Because of that, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again. I guess the results will just depend on your hair. Some people are really raving about this, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Oh well. What is nice is that you get so much for your money. I will probably have this tub for years before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Love love love this. Leaves my hair super soft, easy to comb. Together with the Silicon Mix Treatment, there were zero hair loss or breakage. Did I mention how soft my hair was after this?</li>
    <li> This is the four time I buy this product. And let me tell you it&#x27;s amazing! There are 3 of us at my house and we all have different hair types. It&#x27;s works amazing on us. I will definitely recommend to others. For healthy, shinny, cheap,volume, anti breakage, and soft hair this is the product to buy!</li>
    <li> I liked this, I used it with the Silicon and it made my hair feel healthy. I am an older woman, and was trying to wear my hair natural, but I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to look full, and get good strong curls with bounce, and movement in them. After I used this with the silicon my hair popped, now my hair has body, shine, bouncing and behaving curls. I could get in a convertible, and the wind could blow my curls and I could just shake my hair back into place. I used two parts Brazilian Goat&#x27;s Milk to one part Silicon and just used a gold heat cap over night. The next day I used my regular hair products, and flat twisted my hair, and when I took it out my hair has been great ever since. I would continue to use the Brazilian Goat&#x27;s Milk to deep condition as needed, but would not recommend using the silicon all the time, as I heard it can cause a bad build up. Hope this helps😊.</li>
    <li> I tried several conditioners after 2 used of Brazilizn hair treatment and let me tell you This conditioner is the BEST EVER!  I will never tried anything else. Leaves my hair soft bouncy and shining. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I  bought  this plus the cerimidas hair moisturizing cream after see the reviews on youtube, I ordered them a few days ago and received them today, I found the silicon mix at the beauty supply store, well I mixed both of the kanechom cerimidas and the goat milk conditioners with the silicon mix and I applied it after washing my hair and put a plastic cap on and let it sit on my hair for 30 minutes then rinsed it out and blow dried my hair.  My split ends were bad especially in the back even though my hair is long and I have been wearing weaves for two years, the ends were so bad that when I curled the back it would not hold the curl, well after blow drying my hair and curling it I noticed there was no breakage, the back that would not hold a curl now held the curl and my hair was soft and has so much volume, it feels great and it looks like I just got a relaxer and it is so bouncy and thick now.  This is my new conditioner, this product did what the ladies on youtube raved about and I was hoping for great results and I got it.  I am glad I ordered two of them and the containers are pretty big so they will last me for awhile.  I am loving my hair, now I can use my enstyler.</li>
    <li> Simply the best conditioner line I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I used it along with the silicone mix and within 3weeks I noticed new growth!!! It smells amazing as well!! Makes my hair soft and easier to manage</li>
    <li> Great for all types  of hair textures ,  most of all it dies wonders on tangled, damaged  and dry hair. Leaves your hair soft as a cotton  ball. Silky</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and it has a good smell to it and it&#x27;s not over-powering at all. The texture is very smooth and has enough slip but I haven&#x27;t used it by itself yet bc I mixed it with the Silicon Mix Bambú. This mixture always leaves my hair silky smooth for almost a week. I love this combination!!! The only thing is that it had some coming out and on the sides when I got it. The supplier should had wrapped it in plastic wrap before shipping but I&#x27;m not going to take a star off for that.</li>
    <li> USED IT WITH SILICON FOR MY NATURAL HAIR...PERMED HAIR....AND SEW INS....AWESOME PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I like this one more than the Ceremides one that I bought. I still have to mix them both with other products but it&#x27;s still a nice conditioner IMO</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Thank you for the prompt shipment!</li>
    <li> An absolutely perfect conditioning treatment. I use this for deep conditioning and I absolutely love it. My hair is softer, shinier, and holds moisture a lot better. For all my 4c curly heads, this is a great conditioner for you.</li>
    <li> Mix this with the Silicon Mix Hair Treatment and you will be in love with your hair.  I used both to condition my hair after shampooing it, left it in for about 30-45 minutes, washed it out and my hair was so soft and healthy looking.  My hair has been restored to perfection.  Excellent product....wanted to give 10 stars!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> 5 stars because it smells amazing, and my hair feels like silk after using this. (in conjunction with silcon mix hair treatment)</li>
    <li> This left my hair nice and smooth but I feel its better to use it when you straighten your hair I actually I have very curly hair and this reduces the frizz so its good</li>
    <li> I love this product itself. But the last time I ordered it, the lid had popped open and the conditioner spilled all the the container. Luckily the container had plastic wrap around it and not much was able to spoil out. I was disappointed with the packaging. I use this product in my hair and my daughter&#x27;s who is mixed. Makes our hair so soft.  I love this product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> Great product but horrible packaging. It&#x27;s as if they were cheap with bubble wrapping the darn thing. When I opened my back age it was busted on the side.</li>
    <li> I love this. I mix it with the silicone mix and it makes an excellent mask for my unruly, coarse, slightly graying, wavy hair. There&#x27;s a Youtube video on how to mix this with the silicone mix. The longer you leave it on, the better the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very big tub so you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> you are missing out if you havnt tried this product. I have waist length curly hair and it makes my hair buttery soft. I love this stuff!! Excellent for detangling. Just apply, let it sit for about 20-30 minutes and whola! easy to comb hair. exellent for thick coarse hair (weaves as well).</li>
    <li> Great product! Loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought the conditioner after reading the reviews about it. I find it to be too heavy and not detangling enough. I end up putting another conditioner after rinsing it out. I have relaxed hair and I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t say enough about this product, I use it with the silicon mix and the results are soft, shiny , manageable hair also helped to stop my hair from excessive breaking when used frequently as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair....probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  Feels more like a cream rinse to me. Smells funny.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my hair as advertized but it washed out with daily shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and bath tub get little greasy every time I rinsed out the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;So I am not using right now.  My hair is dry side and very fine.</li>
    <li> Came right on time. I have heard nothing but good things about this hair treatment.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> Smells very good. Lasts a long time. Makes my kinky hair soft and easier to comb after washing. Did I mention is smells delicious?!</li>
    <li> The top was cracked and alot of the product had spilled out in the box. I did not take the time to send it back. It was just too much of a hassle. It should been wrapped in bubble wrapped instead.</li>
    <li> Great product did wonders for my hair... fast delivery</li>
    <li> Packaging was damaged when it arrived, which caused some of the product to leak out of the bottom. For as pricey was this product was, I was not exactly thrilled to watch some of it go to waste. I transferred what was left into a tupperware container. I saw a lot of very positive reviews on Youtube. This is not a very popular, so I guess its marketing mainly relies on word of mouth. The reviews said this was the best deep conditioner they had ever used, etc etc....so I decided to pay the $20+ on a leap of faith. The scent is pretty good. The consistency is runnier than I expected kind of like yogurt instead of, say, mayonnaise. I tried using this deep conditioner over night under a plastic cap and bonnet, under a hooded dryer, and under a heated cap. I&#x27;ve used it by itself and I&#x27;ve also used it mixed with Silicon Mix like they do in the salons for maximum results. I can honestly say I was somewhat disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the results I was expecting. I was expecting to rinse this out of my hair and be able to detangle my extremely course, dry, tangle-prone hair with just my fingers like I&#x27;ve been able to with other deep conditioners. Instead of the hair being buttery soft, silky, shiny, with lot&#x27;s of slip and moisture, it made my hair feel only lightly conditioned. I&#x27;ll be honest, V05 rinse out conditioners gave me better slip than this conditioner. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right for my hair. I&#x27;ll use the rest of it up since it wasn&#x27;t cheap. Maybe I can add some oils to it to make it work better. We&#x27;ll see what happens. But overall, I was disappointed by the product itself and the poor packaging.</li>
    <li> arrived with the product spilling out o the jar :-(</li>
    <li> I am currently in the process of transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural. I am currently 16 weeks post relaxer when I used this conditioner the first time I left it on over night for a really deep condition. And I must say after one use this stuff is amazing it left my new growth soft, my relaxed hair stronger, allowing it to retain moisture from the oils I use. It too no time for the flat iton to straighten my hair. I mixed it with the Silicon Mix Perla and I am beyond impressed. I had very little shedding and drying time was shorter than my previous wash days. I swear my hair was absorbing it as soon as I put it on my head, I am also heavy handed so I used a lot, plus my new growth is very thick and i wanted it to saturate all of my strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a permanant stable for my Hair Journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Leaves my hair stronger and very well conditioned, great slip, a must have. Has a wide mouth Jar which I love, and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I don&#x27;t care for the smell, a little watery for it to be a mask</li>
    <li> Good solid conditioner...use in conjunction with Silicon mix conditioner for beautiful curls...love love love will order again!!!</li>
    <li> Good for detangling but there are better dominican products out there. Shampoo is terrible makes my hair feel like straw. I&#x27;m a natural 4a.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long 3c-4a hair and this product makes my hair soft and bouncy.  If you like volume, don&#x27;t leave it on too long.  I use this before a blowout and my hair looks like I&#x27;ve been to a salon when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Good product left my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Okay so that was two words, but I hope you&#x27;ve gotten my drift. I bought this product last week with the Silicon Mix Shampoo Hidratante 36oz [Health and Beauty], and the Silicon MIX Intensive Hair Deep Treatment 36oz and requested shipping to be next day air... It GOT HERE ON TIME!!! YESSSSS Honey! I also bought the Professional Salon Hair Steamer with Rolling Floor Stand Base from this site as well but I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it. I plan to wash my hair with this product for the second time tonight and I will be using my hair steamer with it. The shampoo and then condition mix with the Kanechom product was just as I had decribed.... OUTSTANDINGLY AMAZING!!!! My hair is VERY FINE, soft, and stubborn. It&#x27;s curly ONLY WHEN WET. It is cooperative when I straighten it ONLY when it is NOT humid outside. Otherwise, I would have to put two or three products in to keep the curl pattern in it, but the frizz and puff make me miserable. Needless to say, I don&#x27;t even THINK about using a curling wand or curling iron to bump or curl my hair. the moment I walk away from my vanity, the curls DROOOOOOOP, honey!!!!&lt;br /&gt;SOOOOOOO- enter these wonderful products.... When I used these for the first time (minus the hair steamer, which I KNOW will deeply penetrate better than a regular hair dryer) I was so amazed at how much VOLUME my hair appeared to have (I DON&#x27;T WEAR WEAVE ANYMORE SINCE TRYING THEM BROKE OFF MY HAIR). My hair was bouncy, flowy, and shiny as all heaven, honey!!! I am so not your pre-madonna! I love to get up and go- so-to-speak. I love love love how this stuff makes my hair feel. I even tried it on my 3 year old princess and she loves her hair too, which is beautifully thick and hard to comb without making her cry. She sat pretty and let me detangle, blow dry and then braid her hair without a hitch!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am now back on here to order the Silicon Mix Bambu Nutritive Hair Treatment line with the hair gloss and also the Intense Straightening w/ Almond and Wheat Protein &amp; Silicone Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Leave in Styling Heat Protection Creme for my princess just so that we could have variety.... LOL Truthfully I just love them all and I am going to be buying the entire line in due time....... I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, THE SHAMPOO, AND THE LEAVE IN CONDITION, which I am so mad I forgot to put in my cart (LOL) AND THE HAIR STEAMER FOR MORE DEEP PENETRATIVE CONDITIONING (which I know works from when I got done to my hair done at a salon tent when I was deployed to ABU DABI, UAE in 2004- LOVEDED IT).Wheat Protein &amp; Silicone Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Leave in Styling Heat Protection Creme for my princess just so that we could have variety.... LOL Truthfully I just love them all and I am going to be buying the entire line in due time....... I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, THE SHAMPOO, AND THE LEAVE IN CONDITION, which I am so mad I forgot to put in my cart (LOL) AND THE HAIR STEAMER FOR MORE DEEP PENETRATIVE CONDITIONING (which I know works from when I got done to my hair done at a salon tent when I was deployed to ABU DABI, UAE in 2004- LOVEDED IT).</li>
    <li> I am African American, with natural hair type, 4, and this product was amazing, the conditioner is silky and detangled my hair in 5 minutes, I could not believe it, I usually leave conditioner in about 30 minutes with a plastic shower cap, no need with this product</li>
    <li> This is a great treatment.  I&#x27;m caucasion and have thick bleach blonde hair that is layered and can sometimes appear choppy and dull but this treatment, when left on my hair for a few hours makes my hair feel like slippery butter!  It is really nice after a day at the beach (even used some after being in the water to soften things up some) so I give it 5 stars for making my hair so soft and shiny and adds volume and bouncy curls to help soften my layers!  love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I love the texture and smell. I leave it in my hair over night and it feels great! Now, I will say that when I wash it out my hair feels dry but once it air drys....OMG!!! I&#x27;m talking about sooooooft! I mix this product with Silicon mix (which is a wonder ALSO!). When I flat iron my hair it is super soft and flowing! I pin curl my hair at least 5-7 days a week and this stuff has my hair Claire Huxtable bouncy and curly...LMBO! You get the picture....I just don&#x27;t wear the hairstyle. I recommend this product and I can&#x27;t wait to try the chocolate Kanechom!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, and my hair loves milks it makes it buttery soft.  I decided to use this straighten my 3 C, 4 a natural coily curly hair so that I could give my hair a nice trim.  I wanted to use a product with cones; including silicon mix to give my curls protection and along with a heat protectant.  I did not put the flat iron on the highest setting.  It gave my hair a shake, you know that gorgeous white girl shake.  I don&#x27;t think I ever had that before so it was kind of awesome and it smells so good.  After a few days of massaging my hair with oils my hair got straighter on it&#x27;s own. The reason why I gave this product only 4 stars and not five is because it was a little difficult to wash out, I had straight hair, even when wet.  After, several washes and a apple cider vinegar rinse my hair finally curled again. However, my hair is now completely altered.  It is now a 4 C/3 C/B, it is still curly and pretty, but it is so fragile.  So now I have hair fall like crazy and I think I compromised the strength and thickness, by straightening it. I attached three pictures before I straightened it, After and Now, with my new curl pattern.  It&#x27;s been a hair adventure but I not giving up. Overall, it is a good product, just be careful with the temperature that you use to straighten your hair. I added three pictures my hair before I straightened it, with the Kanechom and My new curl pattern after.  I hope this helps:)</li>
    <li> MAKES ME AND MY KIDS HAIR REALLY SOFT AND MANAGEABLE</li>
    <li> Not impressed. It smell nice though.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair soft! &amp;  look like it has a perm &amp;  my weave look good. The container is really huge and should last you a very long time! I mixed it with silcon mix &amp;  it was perfect! It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
    <li> Best thing known to man lol. But this is an amazing product. For best result, mix in with Silcon mix &amp; deep condition for about 30-45 mins. Your hair will feel like butter. Delivery came on time within 2 days. This is my second time buying &amp; I&#x27;m still in love w/ it. I would recommend product to everyone &amp; there momma lol</li>
    <li> Using this product along with using the Silicon mix deep conditioner as suggested made my hair so silky smooth! The smell is pleasant and it lasted my some months(as I mostly used it once a month) The company shipped it in a very timely manor and I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> arguably the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> worst conditioner ever!  I brought this because of the utube hype it was horrible my hair was dry tangled and matted together!!  It was a dry mess!  Had to use another conditioner on it to soften my hair so I could comb it!  Now I have this big bottle in which I will be throwing away.  Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> This hair product is new for me...but it also work great on my hear texture.  I do relax my hair  (type of hair coarse)...smells good and soften the hair very nicely.  adds shine.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see a big difference with my hair.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is very soft and detangle my curls perfectly !!</li>
    <li> Before I made my order, I was really surprised at how many people said this conditioner works so well. So I placed my order and used it as soon as I got it. I can honestly say that its true. My hair was very soft, shiny after straightening, and easy to comb through. I would tell anyone to try this.</li>
    <li> Amazingly this product made my natural kinky hair soft and curly, it works great.  I am not sure what is in it so I will use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> This product is okay and didn&#x27;t do much for me, however my daughter tried it as a pre poo and she liked it. She applied it over night on dry hair and her hair came out soft and bouncy. I think I will try it that way also. I just used it as a deep con with the silicon mix and my hair came out kind of hard.</li>
    <li> This goes along way and grows your hair tremendously! I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair really soft and moisturized, however I&#x27;m not impressed with the smell as the scent was like that of a cheap perfume...very strong. If one can ignore the scent then they&#x27;ll be satisfied with the results of really deeply conditioned hair. I&#x27;d have to really think about this one before purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Cheap stuff messed up our hair.  Used with and w/o silicone.  My hair is 4a and my daughters is 3a. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I loved this product!</li>
    <li> Package arrived in very good condition, no leaks.  Big size. I put it on dry hair for 40 minutes before shower and i wear a cap.  After that i dont use shampoo anymore, just rinse my hair.  Feels very soft after that.  Didn&#x27;t affect my red hair color.  Nice scent.  Use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice &amp; leaves your hair really soft. &amp; this is coming from a girl with natural 4b/c hair lol</li>
    <li> I lived this product it left my daughter&#x27;s hair straighter, softer, shinny, and smelling great for days. This it&#x27;s my new line of products from now to eternity.</li>
    <li> Jar is way too flimsy. Everything spilled when I was moving.</li>
    <li> I have natural African American hair( 4c) and I had been wearing extensions for the past four months...I really needed a protein treatment and I wanted an alternative to Aphgee,,&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the Kanechom with two tablespoons of Silicon Mix and and leftconditioner on under a plastic cap for aprox 10 hours....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product...I can tell my strands are thicker now and I have no breakage. after about two weeks</li>
    <li> In many years, my hair never feel so soft till I started using this product. For dry hair people, especially.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all who wrote those reviews.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product,my hair is gorgeous!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this with the Silicon treatment and this conditioner tends to work better without it on my hair. I would like to try the chocolate and shea versions to have a comparison. It was packaged very well which I appreciated.</li>
    <li> After three washes I was totally happy with ny hair and felt baby fine I used it with the silicon mix and my hairs just the softest it&#x27;s ever been feels so healthy it shines like crazyyy I&#x27;m overall very happy with this product but use it with the silicon mix(:</li>
    <li> I love this with the silicon mix. I have natural 4b/a and a little c natural hair but I keep it blow dried for the most part. I&#x27;m not sure about the long term effects of this but the one time I used it my hair has never been this soft and silky except when I got the $200 design essential STS treatment. I flat ironed my hair after the kanechom and silicon mix treatment but I think next time I&#x27;ll just blow dry. Its sooo soft after just blow drying. Usually my hair is hard and dried out after blow drying. It smells amazing too. Lingers a few days but its not too bad.</li>
    <li> I LOVE &amp;#62;LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE  this mask OMG. I have used this product for about a month every sunday when I do my hair, I am AA with 4A hair type, I am transitioning to natural and my hair is about APL (arm pit length). I mixed this product with Silicon Mix, wow.....I put my hair in sections and applied to my new growth first then to length of my hair.  I then sat with the heating cap for about an hour to hour and a half. I let my hair cool off, then i rinsed and needless to say the slip is fantastic. My hair was feeling soft as butter. I have used this product for about a month and a half. I am almost out of product now yessss I will repurchase and yessss I will recommend this product. I am very curious about the bambu silicon mix and maybe the avocado kanechom... I will be purchasing these products next, I hope  I will love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you will love this product.,,,,</li>
    <li> Feels same as the normal conditioner. The cap is broken when I got it. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing...mainly on my weaves!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it !! Freaking awesome!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I sell hair extensions and this product works very well on the hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I got lots of comments on the conditioner; from my customers who&lt;br /&gt;i gave samples to along with the hair I sell.</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair, it gives it softness, and shine making your hair look healthy. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> why it is getting more and more expensive?&lt;br /&gt;Plus the shiping ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be more consistent with the prize or I have to stop recommending it.&lt;br /&gt;MC</li>
    <li> Love this product, it smells good and it leaves my hair feeling soft. I have a relaxer in my hair and I heard from the reviewers that it was good for normal regular hair and relaxed hair. My hair will usually get more tangled if I use a conditioner or treatment it is not use too, but this product is great for something that is new and is the first time trying it out. This has become one of my must buy hair products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! and mixed with the silicon mix it works wonders!! used fort he first time last night i will never go back to anything else!!!</li>
    <li> Use with silicon..haven&#x27;t used alone..together they r great</li>
    <li> I wasnt impressed at all. Will not be repurchasing. It wasnt mositurizing at all.</li>
    <li> I love what this did to my hair, I bought together with silicon. my hair is super soft.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m officially jumping on the Kanechom/Silicon Mix bandwagon.  First of all, I bought this on Friday, chose 2 day shipping but got it the very next day!  I have fairly long straight Brazilian hair and I can say since coloring my hair, it has never been so soft.  I co wash my hair once a week and shampoo it once a month.  I co washed my hair with Organix brand Brazilian Ever Straight Keratin conditioner (the one in the brown and gold bottle).  Then I mix equal amounts of Silicon Mix and the goats milk Kanechom.  I also add a squirt of Silicon Mix Pearl Protein conditioner.  I put my hair in a plastic cap and sit under the dryer for about 15-20 minutes.  I then wash it out with cool water.  I had so much slip in my hair and after it was completely dry I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair and now that I&#x27;ve styled it, it&#x27;s even softer.  I went in to the salon for a trim and even my stylist was commenting on how nice my hair felt.  Anyway, I can&#x27;t wait to add more Kanechom products to my collection.  I think I&#x27;m going to buy the shea butter, the aloe, maybe the chocolate and the intense straight.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair reacts to the other formulas!</li>
    <li> I have relaxed African American hair and I have struggled with my hair for years. Last year I went to Hair Cuttery to get a relaxer because my old stylist just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore (bad decision). Long story short. I pretty much paid to get chemical damage to my hair. For anyone who has had that happen to you, you know how frustrating it is to combat chemical damage. Anyway ever since then I completely did a 180 on how to take care of my hair and I came across this little gem. My hair is so soft I can&#x27;t even believe it!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a little funny. Most other reviews of this product come from people who saw it from YouTube reviews. I however, was running out of my OGX Macadamia oil intensive moisture mask (very nice deep conditioner by the way) and I wanted to try something new. Well I came across this deep conditioner on Amazon then saw the YouTube reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I really love this deep conditioner and I use it mixed with the Silicon Mix Treatment. My hair is so soft and it works wonders on my new growth.</li>
    <li> I love it! It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This condition is everything that it claim to be. Makes my black hair very soft and manageable. It has a great smell to it also. You will not regret this purchase. When combined with the Goat&#x27;s Milk condition it is super great. It gives your hair the salon look.</li>
    <li> I too purchased this hair treatment because of a review I saw on Youtube. Amazon was out of the Shea Butter so I tried this one. I also purchased the Silicon Mix. Right now I go about 10 weeks between relaxers. I am still trying to understand the code system for the different types of hair. I was looking for the slip and super softness but I didn&#x27;t experience this. I am originally from New York so I use to frequent the Dominican shops. Since my hair is in the middle of my back lately (just may be the fact that I am going longer between relaxers too) my hair just seems to really get tangled.  My daughter has curly hair that we relax twice a year. Her hair seems to like this conditioner. When washing...her hair is really thick and unmanagable even with a relaxer (we both use mild).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short I probably will not buy this again since I did not get the firework experience I was looking for. It smells great.. just wish it did great things for me too.</li>
    <li> Good for your hair love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to all of my friend. I love the it smells amazing..........claps hands my pick of the month</li>
    <li> So far pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Product was okay.  Not really great results on african american hair.</li>
    <li> Still have it ordered some time ago doesn&#x27;t stink that&#x27;s what I was concerned about and hair is BOMB when u mix this with the silicone mix !!</li>
    <li> For MY hair this product was ok. But I am an alien and I guess my hair and leite de cabra weren&#x27;t the best of friends in our past life. But this product isnt bad my hair is just.... like I said I&#x27;m an alien.</li>
    <li> Love the consistency of this and when combined with silicon mix, it&#x27;s amazing! My natural 4c hair loves this stuff! Best curl definition ever! I used this along with my oil rinse while deep conditioning</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cheap feeling and very watered down and didn&#x27;t do as much as I thought it would used it about five times and was very disappointed</li>
    <li> I received my order within two days! And I had standard shipping. That was great. So far I have fell in love with this conditioner. Hands down one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. ORS is great as well but this gives you soooo much slip and your hair just feels like silk and butter omg. My hair had so much swing after blowdrying and flatironing. Im sold. Thanks to YT! Lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had excellent results.</li>
    <li> Amazing my hair is so dry but with this product is so moisturize ..the only thing is I ordered The chocolate one and I got something else so I wish next time the send me the right one but overall excellent product.</li>
    <li> I expected a bit more from this product based on the reviews. I also purchased the silicon mix and used them together. My hair smelled like ground up dove soap .It is a really strong and offensive scent. While my hair felt soft, it didn&#x27;t provide any shine and my hair still looked dry. I also sat under the dryer for 45 minutes. I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST CONDITIONER I HAVE EVER USED!!!!  I read all the other reviews, before I bought this product and thought can it really be as good as most of the reviews say and the answer is YES!  I saw a difference in the texture of my hair after the first use.  I have color treated hair and the color is drying, but this conditioner changed all that.  My hair is so soft and shiny.  It feels like I&#x27;ve just come from my beautician; I bet this is her go to product as well....the secret has been revealed! :)&lt;br /&gt;I use this product for moisture as well as Aphogee Keratin 2-minute reconstructor for strength.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my go to product for years to come.  The price is very good for the amount of product you get.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations! I really enjoyed using it after I swam in the pool. it made my hair feel extremely moisturized and the scent is fresh and welcoming! I&#x27;ll have to try the others!!!</li>
    <li> this whole line of products are nice and a generous amount for the price.they all work well and have a nice smell</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair feel so soft.  I mix it with silicone mix and sit under the dryer for about 20 mins and my hair comes out so soft and wonderful.  I have very thick natural coily dry hair and this product helps to tame all of that and makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> The best treatment for Brazilian hair extensions!!!!! This is the only product I use on the hair. Love it. The best</li>
    <li> Awesome for hair extensions and/or deep conditioning treatment. Best if used along with Silicone Mix.</li>
    <li> I am an African American with natural hair and I have fallen in love with this conditioner! I use it with the silicon mix and the magic began on my curly hair! I can&#x27;t wait until my next application because I am going to sit under the dryer so it can penetrate my shaft! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Smells great, delivered on time, made my hair feel amazing mixed with the silicon mix! Haven&#x27;t used this product on its own yet.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/4b hair type. Makes detangling simple, my hair is amazingly soft, great moisturizer, and smells great. This will stay in the top 2 of my staple deep conditioners. Have gone through one container already and working on my #2.</li>
    <li> If you live close to a brazilian store you will find this for less than $10 , too bad i forgot about that and got one here</li>
    <li> This was just okay for me. The quantity is amazing and the shipping was fast. The actual product, a little runny almost like a melted vaseline. Not thick and rich like you would expect from a deep conditioner. It is conditioning but nothing exceptional- just ok. Has a strong smell which is not pleasant. It smells musky or chemically. Not sweet or clean at all.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS Really GREAt FOR dry or frizz hair n it help the hair to flo back too its natural state u can&#x27;t go wrong also it make the hair softer.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. can&#x27;t say nothing else.  I mean this is the true business,com  A must must must have all times.</li>
    <li> I am african american with texturized/ texlaxed hair.  I mix this with the Silicon Mix about a half and half measurement and leave it on for at least 30 mins with a plastic cap.  The combination leaves my hair feeling so soft and moisturized for days.  The scent last all week but it is very perfumey smelling which can get annoying at times but I love the way my hair is afterwards.  I use it every other week as a deep conditioning treatment for my hair.  Best conditioner I have ever used hands down!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I would not ever go back to regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> My staple product...  Wish I could find this at a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item with another hair product, and this Brazilian hair treatment arrived over one week after the first product.  However, it was still within the estimated time limit.  So far I really like it--it has proved very moisturizing to my fine, relaxed, dry hair--but since I have only used it in combination with another conditioner, I can&#x27;t say how it would work alone.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I mix it with another conditioner and your hair is super soft and manageable after using this.  I am natural by the way!!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best thinks ever!</li>
    <li> Super stuff used with with silicon!!!</li>
    <li> Dose not work wonders</li>
    <li> I mixed this with Silicon mix and Balsam, put a plastic wrap on my head and then sat under the dryer for 30 mins..Washed with cold water and my hair came out silky/</li>
    <li> Product does what it says and I love it. Like others suggested, I purchased the silicon mix and use them together. The results are amazing. I&#x27;m done searching for conditioners.</li>
    <li> This product has my hair feeling brand new. After washing my hair and putting this mask in it , I sat under the dryer for 45 minutes and blow dry it. My hair came out super super soft. Oh my, it felt so good and flowy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners yet, it smell lovely. When you apply it to your hair you intently get softness plus the outcome is even more wonderful.</li>
    <li> I mixed this product with Silicone but did not have to.  It leaves my 3b-4a hair soft and touchable. Again I wish this was a leave-in product that way I could benefit from it on a daily basis.  If anyone does use it as leave-in Please state so. I intend to revisit utube where I first discovered this product to see if anyone has.  The instructions do tell you to wash the hair and condition with Kanechom but rinse out.  I usually just add a butter cream and a good oil mixture (organic products of my choice) for a leave-in styler. Great product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The Brazilian hair treatment did not work for my hair .I thought it would make my hair soft and flowy but it was not .The product just left me feeling like i should get my money back.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Good conditioner. Not sure what all te hype was about for this product. But I decided to try this one. Hands down detangles like crazy. But left a werid feeling (sensation)on my head in a certain part every time is used it. Ladies, def check the ingredients first and read up before purchasing. I&#x27;ll stick to my cowashes.</li>
    <li> This jar came with other jars. I would have gave it a 5 but inside the bubble wrap the top poped off and some othe product went everywhere i was so upset. Its nt worth my money if the product i gonna keep cumin in a messed up box and product all in the bubble wrap i shouldnt have to clean up product. They need better wrapping. Will find somewhere else with better packaging!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after I saw this was recommended on a You Tube channel and being that I have thick, dry, 4a-4b hair, I was in desperate need for a deep conditioner/mask. I tried it for the first time today after following the directions and sat under the dryer for about 30 to 40 minutes. When I rinsed it out, I was utterly amazed. This product really does soften the hair. Once it is blow-dried you can really tell the difference. I did not mix it with the Silicon Mix as everyone else, but since it was recommended, I have ordered it and will try it with that product. I agree with everyone else, this is a keepsake for those who have hair in dire need of conditioning. I can&#x27;t believe I just found out about this product. Trust me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product for colored treated hair. Don&#x27;t forget to mix it with your &#x27;silicon mix&#x27; n your favorite hair oils.</li>
    <li> I have wavy caucasian hair and found this product to be just so-so on its own (I did not buy anything additional to mix into the concoction). It&#x27;s not bad, but nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> Makes hair very soft. Only con for me is the smell makes me nauseous. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, just too fraranted for me.</li>
    <li> Smells good and made my hair soft and shiny! I will purchace it again in the future. A little goes a long way. Ive been natural for 4 years, and i am sold on Dominican products! I have type 4 a/b hair.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is the bum, great product to use on all types of hair,., I love how it keeps your hair so soft and manageable!!! I would recommend this to everyone.. After Flat ironing my hair it felt so silky I did not have to flat iron my hair anymore until my next wash... What an amazing product...</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time and loved the way it made my hair feel. This product made my hair soft and easy to comb. Highly recommend for those with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product.. Omg!!! leaves my hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I suffer from very dry bar that will break off really fast. And I have been hoping to find a very good protein deep conditioner. This condition has my hair feeling completely moisturized for longer periods of time just from doing one treatment a week. And my breakage and shedding has stopped by 95%. I have my husband, mother, sister, and lil brother hooked. So I will be buying more really soon.</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of slip and leaves the hair soft and hydrated. I would recommend this product for pre blowout treatments.</li>
    <li> Used with kinky curly. Nice and soft. Made hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> I researched this product on U-Tube and it has exceeded all my expectations - I currently have a sew in and it makes your hair so soft and manageable. It smells great and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I used this product as a deep conditioner.  It is very good.  I had try so many deep conditioners for the past year.  This one is different.  I was also using the hot iron on my hair to get a straight look after I used the hair dryer, not anymore with this conditioner and I feel the difference on my hair. I have wavy hair and I always use the hair dryer to make it straight.  I am very please with this product.  I leave it for 30 to 45 minutes I wrap my hair with a shower cap and apply some heat to it.  It smells good and make your hair look silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have spent countless amounts of money trying to find something for my daughters mid back curly hair! Something that takes away the numerous hours of detangling and removal of shed hair.... THIS WORKS!! Wash day for us can be an ALLL day thing. Not anymore. I was able to wash her hair with the CON sulfrate free shampoo and follow up with this conditioner and when we sat down to start the styling process it was a breeeeeeze! It was soooooo soft... I used Dominican Magic Moisture lock as her leave in, some coconut oil and we were done in less than an hour ( she has ALOT of hair).. I am african american and she is african american with a touch of puerto rican from her dad side. So trying to figure out what works while keeping it from drying out was a mystery to me, because we have 2 different textures of hair.Now we have less shed hair, less tears and the perfect moisture balance......... I am soooooo glad i have found her staple products.</li>
    <li> I was combing YouTube looking for help with transitioning hair. I have like 7 inches of natural hair and about 8 inches of permed hair left. Anyone else going through this knows how frustrating this is. I ordered the Goat&#x27;s Milk and the Aloe Vera. The 1st time I used the Aloe Vera and Silicon and the 2nd time I used the Goat&#x27;s Milk and Silicon mix. OMG! Bye bye two-textured hair. I could not believe the line of demarcation in my hair literally melted away. Yeah, I could see my natural hair and my straight permed hair, but I couldn&#x27;t feel that stubborn tangled mass they always made where they met. It was one continuous smooth section of hair from root to tip! Before I ran across it, I was SO about to do the big chop. Now I can transition WITH my permed hair and ease into full natural tresses. This is my new hair crack!﻿</li>
    <li> I have used the Kanechom shea butter formula and it is terrific.  I ordered this one because it specifically states it&#x27;s for color treated hair.  It smells terrific and it works like a charm.  I use it alone and mixed with Silicon Mix.  There have been lots of reviews of this product on youtube but I wanted to sing its praises here on Amazon and add my review to those also giving it a high rating.  Although I have no proof, I believe that the ingredients in this conditioner (specifically the formaldehyde) are there to open up the hair&#x27;s cuticle so that the moisturizing ingredients penetrate deeply into the hair shaft.  I was told years ago that formaldehyde allows this to happen.  I find this product extremely moisturizing.  I use it at least once a week and spend about an hour, sometimes more, under my heat cap.  My hair is very long and needs the addition of oil (the product contains mineral oil).  I concentrate mainly on the area from my ears down to the ends, applying very little to the roots.  My hair is somewhat fine but I have a lot of it.  I use hot rollers and this conditioner does wonders to undo the damage that heat styling causes.  It&#x27;s also reasonably priced and comes in a huge container.  I have spent as much as $55 for a deep conditioner and even so, it cannot hold a candle to Kanechom.  It simply works.  It does what it promises, which in this day and age is a miracle.  I understand that Kanechom is a leading brand in Brazil.  The women in Brazil must have beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  If you&#x27;re concerned about the mineral oil or the silicone in this conditioner, there is another option.  Shea Moisture makes great masks (Raw Shea Butter, 10 in 1 Renewal, Manuka Honey) that don&#x27;t have silicone, paraben and are cruelty free.  I love Kanechom conditioner but I&#x27;ve since discovered Shea Moisture and am impressed with SM too.  It&#x27;s normally in the African American  hair care section in Walgreens, CVS, Target and Sally Beauty Supply, but it&#x27;s really for all hair types.  There are a variety of formulas that address varying hair concerns and all are sulfate free so they&#x27;re safe for color treated hair.  My favorite is the Manuka Honey formula shampoo/conditioner and mask, which are only available at Target (for some strange reason).  My second favorite is the Raw Shea Butter formula, which also works really well.  I just happen to like the smell of the Manuka Honey formula, it smells like wildflower honey, yum!  SM leaves my hair soft, supple and really shiny.  The Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar removes all traces of styling products and hairspray.  It makes my hair bouncy and light.  And it smells really fresh and clean. So if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s silicone free and that works great for any hair type, check out Shea Moisture.r types.

    <li> Simply put-I love it, but I only use it with the silicon mix conditioner. Together, the combo is great but typical &amp;#34;black girl hair&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Of my hair. I pair it with the silicon and it does what nothing else has been able to do. Make my bleached hair feel good. Like hair, not a scrub pad.</li>
    <li> Arrive as stated. Didn&#x27;t work well for my hair. It smells great. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff! Works very well and at a great price! I have kinda course wavy, frizzed out locks and I saturate my hair in this stuff. I also use joico moisture recovery shampoo and conditioner. Great combo!</li>
    <li> I mixed this with silicon mix and my kinky hair is now straight and fluffy like I just left the salon. I recommend putting a light oil on you ends while wet. Just perfect! No matter how often I wash/deep condition I get the same great results. Definitely a staple.</li>
    <li> Per the other reviewers comments, I have purchased this product with the silicone mix. After only one application I can tell you that this stuff is amazing. I was between relaxers trying to stretch my hair and I was starting to get that frizzy end look from to much heat. After using this, my ends were smooth and easy to maintain. Hair is bouncy and full of life like I received a blowout. You really get a decent amount for the price. I will use on my daughters hair too!!!!</li>
    <li> Makes brittle hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product smells great and feels like butter.</li>
    <li> works great leaves hair soft will use again..</li>
    <li> I really like this treatment it keeps my hair moisturized, I used this product two time this month and It seems that the more I use it the better my hair is, the product did what I needed it to do</li>
    <li> This is the stuff if you have coarse, kinky, curly, dry, thick frizzy, out of control hair! Mixed with the Silicon, it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair! I LOVE IT! My hair is soft, shiny, and says &amp;#34;Thank You&amp;#34; every time I give it a treatment! My hairstylist commented on how healthy my hair has become since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
    <li> This purchase was a mistake but thankfully it was only $10. I saw a video review on youtube about his product and the woman was black and she LOVED it and recommended it to everyone. I&#x27;m Caucasian and have thick hair but not a lot of it, I dye it and sometimes straighten it or blow dry it. I wanted something that would make my hair silky and feel thicker so I though I&#x27;d try this out.&lt;br /&gt;First off it smells pretty bad, it&#x27;s not super overpowering but you can still smell it in your hair the day after. It smells like toxic chemicals and cologne, gives me a headache. Secondly it just made my hair brittle, frizzy and it feels like you have a lot of product in your hair like a lot of build up, because you do, this stuff is filled with silicone. I easily fixed that by shampooing my hair with baking soda and shampoo and then sprayed with AVC, rinsed and conditioned with my regular conditioner, my hair was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely not recommend this for Caucasian hair types, but it seems to really work for afro hair types from all the review on here and on youtube.</li>
    <li> Love it, excellent combo with the silicon mix.</li>
    <li> Real good  hair care product will buy again thinking about trying their other products as well looking forward to buying it again real soon</li>
    <li> I received this product and used it right away mixed with the silicone mix conditioner.  Best conditioner ever for my super curly thick natural 4b hair.  Can we say slip, slip, slip????  When you put this conditioner in your hair you can instantly feel your hair relax and smooth out.  I recommend this highly and mine arrived looking just like the picture in the ad.  It was packaged perfectly and was wrapped and sealed.  This will last me for a while but I will use this weekly now.  Get rid of your tangles and knots with this.  A stranger in a beauty supply told me about this so it must have been my day!!!!</li>
    <li> I am loving this product in combination with  the Silicon Mix Hair Treatment.</li>
    <li> Amazing, leaves hair feeling soft and shiny. Nice scent as well, nothing overbearing. Will purchase  but I want to try out the other Kanechom versions. This arrived packed and sealed amazingly, and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> now this one is very good as well I&#x27;ve had this now for maybe a month and I&#x27;ve been using it every week when my hair leaving it on my hair for two hours and this left my hair is so soft and I would definitely purchase this one again as well I&#x27;m going to keep this and the silicon mix bamboo in my staple so it is now proud of my hair regimen thank you so much for these great products</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s better than anything I have ever tried!!!</li>
    <li> I use this treatment once a month for my coarse 2A/2B hair. Because I have a pretty balanced hair regimen, I only keep this in my hair for 4-5 minutes in the shower and then rinse. Whenever I let it set for a 30-minute leave in treatment, it often left my hair dry and brittle. I don&#x27;t mind the scent of the product and I like that it keeps my hair smelling fresh for days, as I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week. The conditioner has great slip and a little goes a long way which makes this an even greater bargain. I&#x27;m interested in trying other Kanechom products but will most likely keep this in my repertoire to keep my normally dry hair silky and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it to help replenish the moisture on my tips if they feel dry or overprocessed. Again I just set it for no more than five minutes in the shower, applying only to my ends and it does a great job at making them feel soft and moisturized again.</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner for African American hair.  Only problem I have is because it is on the liquid side more so then a solid cream it should be in a different container with a pump or squeeze cap.</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled to have discovered this product through a friend.  I am very pleased.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Great by itself but I mixed it with the Silicone Mix Bambu&#x27; and used it under the dryer as a deep penetrating conditioning treatment. The best I&#x27;ve had yet!</li>
    <li> WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE KANECHOM??????? This stuff is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  You must know how to use it. I had my hair braided for 3-4 months and let me tell you my hair was ruff. If you are african american women you know exactly what I mean when I say RUFF! It dry, tangled I with no perm. I added this with 2 teaspoons of the silicon mix put it in my hair like a perm then I added shampoo while this stuff was in my hair and it was easy to comb. Love it thanks Amazon and reviewers for helping me get this item!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good treatment for hair my hair was very dry , the first time I used it I can comb hair and now my hair is very beautiful</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but once, but it does make your hair shiny and silky.  Will write about it later</li>
    <li> You will love this conditioner mixed with the silicon mix , they work together , your results will be very good , you will be pleased .</li>
    <li> I have damaged,dry bleach blonde highlighted hair with naturally wavy, coarse texture. I have tried TONS of different masks and products and haven&#x27;t found anything as good as this! I mix it with silicon mix and either use it in the shower as a regular conditioner or put it on overnight with a cap and shampoo out in the morning. sometimes I even put a little on the ends of my hair before shampooing then again after shampooing. Will definitely be buying these two products again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, left my hair feeling amazing!</li>
    <li> OMG!  I ordered the yellow and brown lid one, but I ended up getting the grey and blue lid one.  I&#x27;m not sure what the differences are, but let me tell you, this conditioner paired with Silicon Mix is AMAZING.  The best mix I have ever tried at home.  It gives me salon comparable (if not better) reuslts.  I tried it on its own (without the Silicon Mix) and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  However,I found it works best when paired with the SM.  It gives you bounce, and lots of swing.  I tried it at 8 weeks post relaxer and my hair got sooo straight and silky which is unusual for my coarse hair type.  I would recommend for relaxed, natural, all types of hair! Again, I&#x27;ve never been able to get these results at home with any conditioner.  I got soooo many compliments from co-workers, family members, and random strangers.  I have very healthy relaxed hair and this product with the silicon mix just makes it even better.  This will be my new staple conditioning mix.</li>
    <li> Upon arrival of the package I was happy to  say that nothing was leaking as described by other reviewers. When I opened the lid however, I was repulsed by the strong perfumie smell, but decided that I would try it nontheless. When I mixed this with Silicon Mix Perla in a smaller bowl the scent was much less pungent and more soothing. I piled it on my head after shampooimg and when I rinsed it out I was met with unbelievably soft supple hair! I thought my hair could only feel this soft when moisture overloaded, but I was wrong. It feels soft but nice and supple, it isn&#x27;t breaking at all. After I rollerset my hair it felt softer and silkier than ever before. I will say however that it has a lingering smell in my hair, but I love it because it&#x27;s a light pleasant smell. All im all I am very pleased with this product, this will be my new staple deep conditioning treatment from now on!</li>
    <li> Works so well. My hair is soft manageable and healthy. I use it for my two daughters too. Just ordered it again!</li>
    <li> My beautiful young Russian girlfriend likes it; that does not mean it is good; she likes to spend my money.</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner months ago after watching a youtube video in which a young lady went on and one about how beautiful her hair always looked after using this treatment. To say the least I have used it several times and it is a pure waste of money. My hair wasn&#x27;t manageable, moisturized or anything. Since it&#x27;s such a large container I will probably combine it with some other conditioner and use it, but I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite one so far. My hair is soft and it gives get slip.</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair coming back everytime! Definitely a must have if you put heat on your hair regularly. The smell is very pleasant, not overpowering at all. I deep condition once a week with this product. I leave it in my hair for 10 mins when I&#x27;m showering. Rinse thoroughly because this stuff is moisturizing. I apply a dime size amount of Chi Silk Infusion in my damp hair &amp; let air dry. Bam! Silky, shiney, healthy looking hair everytime.</li>
