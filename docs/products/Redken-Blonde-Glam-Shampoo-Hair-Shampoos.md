<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keep this stocked. Makes my hair feel wonderful. Good for the color. Smells nice</li>
    <li> Outstanding--Highly Recommend--I received a status alert via text and e mail when the package was shipped and delivered. Professional Shipment. Items were true and exact as shown with the new/improved formulas.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this at my new hair salon and loved it. It&#x27;s not drying to my hair, which is normal to oily. You don&#x27;t need a lot to get sudsy and it rinses easily. The product that arrived to me in the bottle is the real thing, not a copy or fake as another review mentioned happened to her.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, you only have to use a little and your hair is full of foam, leave your hair really really smooth like no other one...and I tried hundreds.  I&#x27;m so glad I founded it!.</li>
    <li> Great product for color treated hair  Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for over 8 years. Too bad Redken has changed the formula and essentially no longer make this. The new formula is not as good. I will switch now to Pureology. Why do manufacturers think they need to fix things that aren&#x27;t broken???</li>
    <li> I buy these whenever I see them on sale.  Usually a hair salon has a sale once or twice a year so you can get these bottles for 1/2 off Ive noticed... I wait for them.   But the product really works for my all natural hair.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I had low expectations, as I have used many shampoos targeted for blondes (Tigi Bed Head, Paul Mitchell, Pantene, Aveda, John Freida, etc...)  I bought this at my salon yesterday, along with the conditioner, figuring it would be just another gimmick.  I live in Japan, and am a victim of brassy-turning highlights (due to the water.)  Despite the hype, I am desperate!  Desperate to get rid of the yellow!  And I don&#x27;t have a huge selection to choose from! Hence, like I said, expectations were low...  Holy cats!  In just one washing, a lot of the brassiness is gone!  My hair soft and silky smooth!  I have coarse, curly hair and generally have to use a leave-in conditioner and a ton of products before I straighten.  The smell is also amazing!  Today, the only styling products I used were Organix Moroccan Penetrating oil, my Chi iron, followed by Bed Head Brilliance...  My hair looked like I just walked out of a salon, and smelled faboosh!  This is a phenomenal product!  I also bought the Redken So Soft conditioner (in the event the Blonde Glam shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel like hay- but they did not, so I can not yet offer up a review for this product!)</li>
    <li> Love it for my blonde&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> Holy grail shampoo. The only one that works for my hair on a daily basis. Very sad it&#x27;s gone forever.</li>
    <li> I love Redken, ever since I went to this salon in England and they used these products.  It made my hair super straight and super shiny (but that was a spray).  This one in particular makes my hair look amazing though.  My hair has never shone with such brilliance and perfection before.  My hair is usually a dull dirty blonde but this brings out the light in it.  It truly works wonders and makes my hair feel, smell, and look amazing.  I also use garnier fructis leave in conditioner afterwards.  Not as greasy in my hair as normal conditioner but still leaves it silky smooth. It was shipped well and on time too which is a plus always.  So.... I love this product!  :)</li>
    <li> Pricing is ok, but I love this Shampoo and I do not usually have the time to go out to a hair salon and buy it, so having it shipped to my house was very nice.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for bleached hair, provides good conditioning and a little goes a long way.  Wish it came with a pump.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. I have been using it for several yrs. It even works on silver hair. Great.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, and I&#x27;m sad that it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves the Shampoo the shipping it was speedy. I will order next time she runs out of shampoo good stuff.</li>
    <li> Just starting using this a little while ago. I have to say no dry hair yet. I would buy again</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years and love it. Never want to be without it. It leaves your hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> really great blonde hair shampoo. I have natural hair, and its very long this really makes is shine. I would bet its a great choice on treated hair too. it is not a purple tinted shampoo or one with yellow color in it... its just a cleaning shampoo to brighten up your blondes. the smell is great too. I have been using it 6 months now, my ends are still in good shape. so its not a drying shampoo. some I have to give up in a few weeks as my hair turns to straw. its a bit pricey but its my hair... I dont want to have cheap hair...</li>
    <li> This is the BEST highlight activating product I have used since going blonde! Yes, it can be drying to your hair, HOWEVER compared to any other highlight activating product, the drying is much less. It brings out and highlights your processed hair. It works amazing. The conditioner that goes with this is not necessary and does nothing to bring out the highlights. With that said, the shampoo keeps your blonde looking salon fresh and keeps it looking amazing! Yes I would recommend to anyone with natural or colored blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this prodcut for 5 years and LOVE this shampoo!!  Will not change!!  Redken rocks! If you are not a blonde, try another Redken product.  Love their shampoo.</li>
    <li> Not the same consistency I think it&#x27;s a fake</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for blonds.  I have been using this for years.  Gives hair a nice shine.  I have fine hair and it does not tangle it as some other shampoos do.</li>
    <li> Great quality and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling soft and enhances blonde.  Smells very good!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It&#x27;s just like what is in specialty beauty stores, great product. Keeps my color from fading and looking dull.</li>
    <li> Redken Blonde Glam Shampoo seems to be keeping my blonde highlights in great shape.  It is just a tad drying, so if you have naturally dry hair make sure to use a conditioner.  I have somewhat oily hair that only gets worse during the day, and this shampoo actually helps with that problem.</li>
    <li> Great. Seems to be keeping my hair a nice color (not brassy), and I&#x27;m close to needing another highlight done (2 months).</li>

Call a physician immediately. Immediate&lt;br /&gt;action is critical to minimize possibility of blindness.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo because it is so gentle to my skin as well as my hair while making my hair shine and it really does help your color. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look like it has been bleached since I started using this shampoo. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my eyes get red after I shampoo so I will need to use extra care in keeping the product away from my eyes while I am rinsing it out of my hair. I have VERY sensitive eyes anyway.</li>
    <li> excellent for the daily use. it works perfectly, the hair does not get sticky, and neither too smelty. Perfect. Delivered on time and in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have blonde hair but I do have blonde highlights. Getting highlights leaves my hair dry, rough, and very hard to brush. I&#x27;m already a lover of Redken so I decided to try out this kind (I have also tried others as well only to be dissapointed) and found that it&#x27;s as if I don&#x27;t even have highlights. I am able to brush my hair with such ease and comfort, without it feeling like I&#x27;m going to rip it out of my head. GREAT PRODUCT for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Works well, I suggest you also buy the pump.  That way it will last, I typically go through a bottle a month</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE What this shampoo does for my hair. It gives it a perfect shiny smooth finish. Sadly I began to get really bad acne on my back and chest. I thought maybe that the shampoo was the cause. So a stopped using it. (i have been having problems with acne for a while though)Recently i changed acne medication and my skin has started to clear up so i thought id give the shampoo another shot just in case i was wrong. Oh boy. Big mistake. My hair is gorgeous but i have about 10-15 new HUGE blister like zits on my back just after one use! My hair is gorgeous but my skin is itchy and inflamed. I have also had problems thought with dove and treseme products and my skin. I guess im back to my Garniar 100% pure clean (somehow the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin) even though it dries my hair out. Bottom line is this is a GREAT product! Just be careful if you have sensitive or acne prone skin like me.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Does the trick, whether you are blonde, red, grey, or brunette. Doesn&#x27;t strip your hair or leave it feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for blondes</li>
    <li> I faithfully use color care by redken which I love.  This time i switched to blonde glam since i went very heavy on my highlights.  I must admit it really brightened the hair but that was completely offset by how dried out the hair becomes.  I looked like a witch for days.  This product is not for me; too drying.</li>
    <li> Every time I color my hair, after a few shampoos, it starts to look dull, and becomes almost yellowish. I bought the Redken blonde glam shampoo and conditioner, and &#x27;holy smokes&#x27;,my hair, on the first wash, brightened up and was beautiful. My husband even commented how much nicer it looked. Ladies with blonde hair, natural or colored, give this a try. You won&#x27;t be dissappoined.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO, KEEPS YOUR BLONDE WHETHER NATURAL BLONDE OR HIGHLIGHTED BLONDE IT KEEPS THE COLOR LOOKING BRIGHT AND FRESH ALL THE TIME.  USE DAILY AND LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Good quality and economical size.Family has used it for the last few years and all like it.Great product.Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed this product. Guess i will have to have a new one.</li>
    <li> this is a terrific shampoo for hair that has been colored. It is not drying and good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.  It really keeps my blonde bright, the only down side i have found is if i dont rinse really well it leaves a film on my hair.</li>
