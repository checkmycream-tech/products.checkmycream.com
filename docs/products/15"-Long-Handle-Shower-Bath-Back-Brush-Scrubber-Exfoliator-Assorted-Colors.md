### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Delivery: Impressive!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this brush.</li>
      <li>and I have almost flawless skin.....</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>It is however doing a good job scrubbing the tiles on the shower floor!!!</li>
      <li>Refreshingly, a very good product!</li>
      <li>Exceptional!</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>IT WAS MADE VERY NICELY</li>
      <li>The reach is good.  </li>
      <li>These are good for the money.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I would have liked it to feel sturdier.</li>
      <li>It is a nice product.</li>
      <li>This provides a good scrub and while the handle is flexible, it&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
      <li>It feel good when I clean my body.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay length-wise</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed my bath/shower brush for several months now (love it!!), and no longer have reservations about it&#x27;s durability.</li>
      <li>I for one enjoy the stiffness of the bristles.</li>
      <li>I liked the reach on this brush but after using it I feel like it is going to break if I put too much pressure on it.</li>
      <li>TOO SOFT WICH IS GOOD.  </li>
      <li>My guess is that the spacing of the bristles are too far apart to generate a good lather.  </li>
      <li>Just Right!</li>
      <li>So, while the functionality is good, overall I knocked off 2 stars.</li>
      <li>I thought for this price it would have been a nice soft bristle brush like the ones at Bath and body&lt;</li>
      <li>Looks to be a good product seems like it would last about 6 months before it fell apart</li>
      <li>However, most people won&#x27;t use that much force</li>
      <li>Curved in the right place to manipulate use in the shower.</li>
      <li>the right color.:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to update my review...</li>
      <li>When you first get this scrubber, it feels very flimsy and cheap.</li>
      <li>Ultimately, at this price, though, it will definitely be worth the cost, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth of use out of it.</li>
      <li>I just love this back brush!  </li>
      <li>It was not real expensive and was shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I broke the first one by using it too aggressively.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>So for more coarse skin, it will probably feel like a soothing massage.</li>
      <li>Nice size but not very friendly.</li>
      <li>It does have a certain stiffness to it</li>
      <li>I really wanted to rate this as 5-star...</li>
      <li>strong, flexible, the bristles aren&#x27;t too hard and it was cheap.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate, so I didn&#x27;t expect this to gather mold easily.</li>
      <li>My skin&#x27;s a bit sensitive, so it was rough at first, but I still enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Not stiff enough for scrubbing my back, the bend in the brush needs to be more angled, and the bristles started coming out.</li>
      <li>far scrubbing, it does scrub skin very well, so I gave it two stars.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a medium bristle hardness and these are very soft.</li>
      <li>Not fancy or exotic, but gets the job done on those hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>And the brush against your hand feels a bit too soft.</li>
      <li>Far too abrasive for skin.</li>
      <li>If you brush it along your hands, it feels completely natural.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know what people are looking for in a back brush other than some type of an extension of your arm to clean your back.</li>
      <li>but, it works fine when you push down on it to scrub your back.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s soft on the hand is not so soft on the back.</li>
      <li>They are not like a wire brush that will pull your skin off and not so soft that you have to wonder if you are even washing your back.</li>
      <li>The only complaint is that the plastic is easy to snap:</li>
      <li>Really thought 15 inch would be long enough, but it turns out to be shorter than my old brush and has less bristles.</li>
      <li>I got this to go in my new bathroom which is royal blue and lime - this came in pink.</li>

<li> Sorry for the low review but this back brush is just a bit too short and the brissels at first felt soft</li>
<li> In fact, it&#x27;s not such a bad idea to toughen your skin up a bit and make it more resistant to blemishes and irritation.</li>

<li> I did not find it scratchy, rough or any of things</li>

<li> Within a week, the bases of some of the bristles turned black.</li>

<li> I can not believe some of these people that reviewed this brush and think this is too stiff.</li>
<li> Bristles on the brush are stiff and scratchy.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks, used it on a daily basis, and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
<li> It is only a brush, so what can go wrong?  </li>
<li> When I put soap on it,&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t even lather up because the bristles are very stiff and actually is hard on the skin.</li>
<li> And by the way, it still hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just that I order the wrong color.</li>

    <li> Curved in the right place to manipulate use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I liked the reach on this brush but after using it I feel like it is going to break if I put too much pressure on it. I would have liked it to feel sturdier. And by the way, it still hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> still using it today.. thank you</li>
    <li> Not fancy or exotic, but gets the job done on those hard to reach places. Won&#x27;t mold like my wooden one did.</li>
    <li> These are good for the money. I was hoping for a medium bristle hardness and these are very soft. They work nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Really thought 15 inch would be long enough, but it turns out to be shorter than my old brush and has less bristles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay length-wise but I thought the bristles would be a little stiffer.  I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for it and I do use it.</li>
    <li> This is about the same price as stopping by the local Walmart or Target.  The only complaint is that the plastic is easy to snap: I broke the first one by using it too aggressively.  However, most people won&#x27;t use that much force so I can&#x27;t give it any lower of a rating.</li>
    <li> When you first get this scrubber, it feels very flimsy and cheap. And the brush against your hand feels a bit too soft. However, once you use it, you realize if it were any stiffer, it&#x27;d take the skin off your back. What&#x27;s soft on the hand is not so soft on the back. This provides a good scrub and while the handle is flexible, it&#x27;s holding up fine.</li>
    <li> It is only a brush, so what can go wrong?  It met all my expectations. I have no problems with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this to go in my new bathroom which is royal blue and lime - this came in pink. So, while the functionality is good, overall I knocked off 2 stars.</li>
    <li> NOT TRUE TO WHAT I EXPECTED.  IT APPERAED TO BE A TOY BRUSH FOR A CHILD.  I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> It is a nice product. It feel good when I clean my body. It&#x27;s just that I order the wrong color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks, used it on a daily basis, and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. My skin&#x27;s a bit sensitive, so it was rough at first, but I still enjoy it. In fact, it&#x27;s not such a bad idea to toughen your skin up a bit and make it more resistant to blemishes and irritation. If you brush it along your hands, it feels completely natural. So for more coarse skin, it will probably feel like a soothing massage.</li>
    <li> IT WAS MADE VERY NICELY BRISTLES ARE NOT TOO SOFT WICH IS GOOD.  BUT THE LENGTH OF THE HANDLE WAS TO SHORT FOR MY TASTE.</li>
    <li> Not stiff enough for scrubbing my back, the bend in the brush needs to be more angled, and the bristles started coming out.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I did not find it scratchy, rough or any of things some of the reviewers have said......and I have almost flawless skin.....so I am told.....I think it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> The reach is good.  The stiffness of the bristles is brisk.  I find it doesn&#x27;t retain the soap product.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for that reason.  My guess is that the spacing of the bristles are too far apart to generate a good lather.  I</li>
    <li> Sorry for the low review but this back brush is just a bit too short and the brissels at first felt soft they realy tore up my back. It is however doing a good job scrubbing the tiles on the shower floor!!!</li>
    <li> Delivery: Impressive!! Price: Exceptional! My only concern is that the shower/bath brush may break at ANY moment. It arrived with a tiny crack already on it. Ultimately, at this price, though, it will definitely be worth the cost, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth of use out of it. I really wanted to rate this as 5-star...I just don&#x27;t believe it will last for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meant to mention: Didn&#x27;t have a way to choose the color I wanted, but somehow ended up with the right color.:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to update my review...I have enjoyed my bath/shower brush for several months now (love it!!), and no longer have reservations about it&#x27;s durability. The bristles are just right, and hard to reach areas are no problem (I have  arthritis). Refreshingly, a very good product!</li>
    <li> I can not believe some of these people that reviewed this brush and think this is too stiff. I for one enjoy the stiffness of the bristles. They are not like a wire brush that will pull your skin off and not so soft that you have to wonder if you are even washing your back. It does have a certain stiffness to it but, if you are looking to stimulate your back while you are washing it, this brush is for you. The handle does flex a bit but, it works fine when you push down on it to scrub your back. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying a massive amount of pressure on the handle but, it works find for doing your back. I really don&#x27;t know what people are looking for in a back brush other than some type of an extension of your arm to clean your back. And as the name says it is a Back Brush Scrubber Exfoliator. And it is like I said before, a bit stiff but, is stimulating and will open your pores to an extent. I would recommend this brush to anyone that is looking for a brush that&#x27;s not soft or overly stiff but, somewhere in between.</li>
    <li> 15&amp;#34; Back Brush.  I just love this back brush!  It reaches where I can&#x27;t.  It was not real expensive and was shipped quickly. I love it!</li>
    <li> got the stank off me ! graphite and mud. carbon dust.etc. I don&#x27;t look like Dick Van Dyke on Mary Poppins anymore.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even use this brush.  Far too abrasive for skin.</li>
    <li> I thought for this price it would have been a nice soft bristle brush like the ones at Bath and body&lt;br /&gt;It actually feels like a toilet brush on my skin. I do not like it at all. When I put soap on it,&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t even lather up because the bristles are very stiff and actually is hard on the skin.</li>
    <li> Bristles on the brush are stiff and scratchy.  Would not purchase again...looks are deceiving.  Nice size but not very friendly.</li>
    <li> Works well and plastic handle won&#x27;t ruin the way a wood handle can. Bristles are stiff enough and handle long enough to reach for the average sized person.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush. It is exactly what I wanted. strong, flexible, the bristles aren&#x27;t too hard and it was cheap. Just Right!</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate, so I didn&#x27;t expect this to gather mold easily. Nevertheless, I hung it away from the shower head just to keep it dry. Within a week, the bases of some of the bristles turned black. I had to keep spraying the bristles with bleach. I finally decided to just use it as a scrub brush for tile and grout and I replaced it with something else for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far scrubbing, it does scrub skin very well, so I gave it two stars.</li>
    <li> Looks to be a good product seems like it would last about 6 months before it fell apart but its just my quess</li>
