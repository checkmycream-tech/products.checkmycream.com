      <li>I think this would be better if they had made it in one of the fruity scents instead.</li>
      <li>DEP #11 Gel Sport Endurance was better than Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel but neither of these held a candle to Johnny B. Mode.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to squirt out the appropriate amount</li>
      <li>My daughter has beautiful curly locks and with the right ply I felt as if she could have some really pretty looks.  </li>
      <li>but none of them matter much when the gel doesn&#x27;t provide a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mostly use this on my son&#x27;s hair, and it helps hold the style for most of the day (I say most, because by the time he gets home from school, his hair does not look as good as it did when he left).</li>
      <li>It flakes really easily even when you use 1/2 the product they suggest.</li>
      <li>It washes out easily and there were no flakes in his hair</li>
      <li>The tube provides easy dispensing.</li>
      <li>He spiked it out and it looked kind&#x27;ve funny to me, but I didn&#x27;t say a word until he was finished.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I Like it because the gel is alcohol free and washes out easily</li>
      <li>I tried this on the little guy and it worked GREAT!</li>
      <li>The gel worked fine, but my sons&#x27; hair is very thick-we could not style it in the desire that he liked.</li>
      <li>This kids gel fills the bill, and I love the fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this gel would allow for some more formal&#x27; styling options my mostly results in a kind of greasy look that falls apart in short order.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that it is hypoallergenic and dye free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free, which helps to prevent drying.</li>
      <li>This seems safe enough for them to play with and a spray bottle of water makes a good substitute for a can of hair spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was initially really excited about this as well.  </li>
      <li>When you run your fingers through your hair, it doesn&#x27;t come off with a bunch of residue .... nice and light .. clear and functional.</li>
      <li>However it works well to hold stray hairs in place and is a must for \\&quot;Picture Day\\&quot; or special events.</li>
      <li>My objective is to test and review products fairly, providing you with helpful information that improves your shopping experience.</li>
      <li>My daughter is getting to that stage where she longs to be a teenager, and yet she&#x27;s a good seven years away from actually being one, and</li>
      <li>Works good on short hair to spike it up</li>
      <li>It holds the hair well and doesn&#x27;t have that strong alcohol smell that is in most adult gels.  </li>
      <li>It wears out of their hair pretty easily.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it was pretty easy to remove.</li>
      <li>It does make you need to wash your hair a little more often, but it also does a good job holding in place all day and sometimes for two.  </li>
      <li>kids\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate and the smell quickly fades so that it does not irritate those with scent sensitivities.</li>
      <li>It happens to been plentiful and super silky.</li>
      <li>The fact that the gel is alcohol free and dye free and basically as safe as they come was a total bonus.  </li>
      <li>After a few squirts in the palm, I was able to give my daughter a bit of a beachy look and the wavy part I gave to the top of my daughter&#x27;s hair held for most of the day.  </li>
      <li>This Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel is fine, as good as your average low-priced gel.</li>
      <li>Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel for hair is an alcohol-free hair gel with a mild, gender-neutral, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>This is a good gel that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it to dry out your hair.</li>
      <li>This is a fun product.  </li>
      <li>Oh yeah, for all the same reasons why an adult will like it, it is great for kids.</li>
      <li>Had a blast creating fun designs in the hair.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Ocean Blast\\&quot;, which is like a powerful Drakkor Noir.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was a fun product, if you use hair gel I think you will like this one.</li>
      <li>Suave Styling Gel for kids is a fun product.</li>
      <li>It took about 5 mins to do, and I did use a brush since my comb was missing in action, however I was very impressed with the result.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a fairly simple, working, effective product.</li>
      <li>My hands were sticky and I knew that normally, it would be a couple of times with soap and water, but this product washed easily away with just water.</li>
      <li>The size is just right.</li>
      <li>if the youngsters don&#x27;t normally use gel, they will enjoy playing \\&quot;beauty parlor\\&quot; and styling each others&#x27; hair with this.  </li>
      <li>For more heavy duty hairstyles, of course, you will need more.</li>
      <li>this is a good medium hold gel for little boys.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and simple, it just smells like clean.</li>
      <li>He had a lot of fun with this gel and wants to use it again.</li>
      <li>I did not use a great deal of it-I merely wanted it to hold my hair better in a straight style.  </li>
      <li>It helps make a messy style fairly well</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant enough for girls or younger boys.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s learning how to tame it himself and this Suave gel is a good tool for him.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s just a light to medium hold gel in cute packaging for little kids.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my girls, whose unruly hair (sadly) needed product. I really held out as long as I could! My husband also started using it because it smells awesome, not too sticky and is alcohol free. The price is also right, especially with subscribe and save. It is now our family hair gel.</li>
    <li> Suave Kids ocean blast gel has a nice fragrance. But it doesn&#x27;t provide a good hold. I Like it because the gel is alcohol free and washes out easily</li>
    <li> It smells good, but after just an hour, my son has flaky hair. We use the amount it calls for, yet flakes are everywhere.</li>
    <li> It flakes really easily even when you use 1/2 the product they suggest. But it holds the hair in place well.</li>
    <li> it smell and hold well, but after hours left white flakes in the hair  &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> But I love this stuff.  I love the entire Suave kids hair product line and buy it in preference to heavier adult shampoos, conditioners and gels.</li>
    <li> First of all, I really like this gel, it is very light, has no strong persistent smell and gives just enough hold to keep the frizz out. It is a relatively generous package and can be affordable. If you need a very light gel that will hold the fizz down or the puffy morning hair, but won&#x27;t look greasy or over done with paste, then this is your stuff. Oh yeah, for all the same reasons why an adult will like it, it is great for kids. When you run your fingers through your hair, it doesn&#x27;t come off with a bunch of residue .... nice and light .. clear and functional.</li>
    <li> I keep my 3yo son&#x27;s hair on the longer side. It happens to been plentiful and super silky. I was hoping this gel would allow for some more formal&#x27; styling options my mostly results in a kind of greasy look that falls apart in short order. I suppose if his hair was courser or shorter it would work better, but with his hair it&#x27;s a no-go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Suave products for years, and have loved their stuff. It&#x27;s great quality and budget prices. I jumped at the chance to try Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel, because I sometimes like to use a hair product that will give me a little more definition and control of my hair, but hate that crunchy, stiff look. This kids gel fills the bill, and I love the fresh scent. I can use it on the curls around my face and at the nape of my neck when I pull my hair up, and I won&#x27;t come out looking like I&#x27;m headed for a prom in the 1970&#x27;s!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that I would definitely purchase again, and I just hope they don&#x27;t decide to \\&quot;improve\\&quot; it by ramping up the holding power. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel is fine, as good as your average low-priced gel. The thing that makes it stand out is the scent: \\&quot;Ocean Blast\\&quot;, which is like a powerful Drakkor Noir. Keep in mind, THIS IS A KID&#x27;S HAIR GEL, not an aftershave or cologne. It just smells too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poor son was horrified by the strong scent and screamed \\&quot;EWWWWW!\\&quot; when he first whiffed it. Please, Suave people, lighten up on the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> The minute I opened my box from Amazon to see the Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel, my 14 year old daughter saw it and grabbed it as she shot over her shoulder, \\&quot;What&#x27;s this?\\&quot;  She spent a half hour in the bathroom playing with the gel and coming out with all kinds of hair styles she was playing with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says that it smells similar to Feria Hair Dye perfume oil that comes in the box from the drug store.  I think she has a point there and do agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter really loves this hair gel (which she has claimed as her own) because it is not sticky or stiff, but it helps you to style your hair and not stick it like glue.  You can comb through it, but you can also count on some good hold.  She is almost impressed because there is not and residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worked with my daughter&#x27;s hair a lot and have to say that this gel is a nice styling gel.  It does make you need to wash your hair a little more often, but it also does a good job holding in place all day and sometimes for two.  The tube colors and design make it easy to identify and find too which is a huge plus, instead of being the typical plain mundane colors of so many hair products.</li>
    <li> When I got the opportunity to receive Suave Suave kids ocean blast gel, I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s been years since I used a styling gel in my hair.  Also, my 9 year old wanted to create a Elvis style hairstyle, and you can only do that with hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel works well.  It dries quickly, but does not leave a greasy residue behind in your hair. I did not use a great deal of it-I merely wanted it to hold my hair better in a straight style.  The gel did not make my hair brittle, or cause tangles in my hair, as some of the other gels did in the past (which is why I stopped using hair gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 9 year old wanted the hair gel for a school dance, in which he wanted to slick his hair back like Elvis.  The gel worked fine, but my sons&#x27; hair is very thick-we could not style it in the desire that he liked. I don&#x27;t think that is the gel&#x27;s fault, I think his hair is too thick for any type of hair product to make a difference at times.  My 11 year old was not adventurous enough to try it unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a fun product, if you use hair gel I think you will like this one.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old has all these crazy hair days at school. I am always getting wild colored spray for his hair, which he loves, but always wanted a spike to go with the look. I have never been successful with hair sprays and although I tried using my gel once, it became a mess for him since he was so active. The suave kids gel is so much easier to work with, especially as it dries and does not leave that hard texture or even slick dirty look that I detest on a child. With my redhead, I needed about a quarter sized amount to give him a top spike. It took about 5 mins to do, and I did use a brush since my comb was missing in action, however I was very impressed with the result. My hands were sticky and I knew that normally, it would be a couple of times with soap and water, but this product washed easily away with just water. Not sure if it would last long in the rain but definitely worth having around for the kids!</li>
    <li> This is a great kid&#x27;s product- it smells nice for boys and girls. The fragrance is definitely there - if fragrance bothers your kids you might want to find something else. Works good on short hair to spike it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not super strong hold and doesn&#x27;t feel stiff - it&#x27;s just a light to medium hold gel in cute packaging for little kids.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not going to hold long hair but it can give it a wet look if it isn&#x27;t combed after it is applied and you let the hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t flake- it&#x27;s a fairly simple, working, effective product.</li>
    <li> This is still of course kid friendly and as I pointed out in my review of the cocanut gel, it&#x27;s old folks friendly too with the lack of abrasive chemicals and gentler effect of the skin and less threatening to eyes.  So if you&#x27;re a grandpa or grandma, you don&#x27;t need to feel silly or senile to give this a try...you just might find it preferable to adult shampoos.</li>
    <li> This is a fun product.  It holds the hair well and doesn&#x27;t have that strong alcohol smell that is in most adult gels.  Had a blast creating fun designs in the hair.</li>
    <li> My kids loved this, and so did I. First, it is good &#x27;everyday&#x27; hair gel -- not just for the school &#x27;crazy hair&#x27; days, because the hold is not too firm and crunchy. It has a nice scent that both my kids (boy and girl) liked and they enjoyed using it. The best part? It is Suave so it is very affordable. A great hair gel for kids.</li>
    <li> This is a fun scent and engaging bottle for young kids (my 8 year old granddaughter however thinks it is for \\&quot;little kids\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate and the smell quickly fades so that it does not irritate those with scent sensitivities.</li>
    <li> I am not into spending lots of time or money on a hairstyle for boys. But I used this styling gel on my grandson&#x27;s hair when he came to visit and before we took him for photos. He&#x27;s almost 3 and loves the spiky look. The gel smells great and goes on easily to keep the hair in the style we wanted. It&#x27;s alcohol free, which helps to prevent drying. It washes out easily and there were no flakes in his hair and it did not look or feel crunchy or stiff as with some other products. I also like the fact that it is hypoallergenic and dye free. You only need to use a small amount to get the effect you want even on thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the Ocean Blast Gel did not have much of a scent. I was expecting it to have a strong smell, but happy to note that there was no overpowering scent, thus making it appropriate for both boys and girls. I mostly use this on my son&#x27;s hair, and it helps hold the style for most of the day (I say most, because by the time he gets home from school, his hair does not look as good as it did when he left). It is not sticky, nor does the gel leave the hair feeling crunchy either. My daughter likes me to use it in her curly hair sometimes too, instead of mousse. It holds her style as well as mousse or the spray gel I sometimes use. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel.  This is awesome gel for styling kid&#x27;s hair.  You can do a lot with it.  It isn&#x27;t too greasy (that would be horrible!); it is just the perfect amount of \\&quot;wetness\\&quot;.  It does good at styling the kids&#x27; hair.  You can do a lot with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We only use hair gel for sporting events where the kid&#x27;s hair has to be seriously controlled. Ocean Blast gel is a low hold gel that just didn&#x27;t have enough grip for our needs. This would be good for smoothing flyaway hair or putting in a part, but it isn&#x27;t suited to sports or sculpted styles. I appreciate that it was alcohol free as other gels can irritate my kid&#x27;s scalp, but we went back to an adult gel for our household. On the plus side, it was pretty easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the smell of this kid&#x27;s hair gel.  It didn&#x27;t appeal to me or my girls.  In terms of holding power it does it&#x27;s job but we can get past the smell.  I think this would be better if they had made it in one of the fruity scents instead.</li>
    <li> Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel smells good. Yep, it smells good and it is easy to rinse. It is nice that the formula is alcohol free, too. All good things for sure but none of them matter much when the gel doesn&#x27;t provide a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions suggest using a nickel-sized amount. Our experience was anything less than a silver dollar wouldn&#x27;t produce the results we wanted. We tested Suave against two other gels, [[ASIN:B005659H3U Johnny B. Mode Styling Gel Medium Hold]] and [[ASIN:B000EZU8O4 DEP #11 Gel Sport Endurance]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnny B. Mode provided the best results. DEP #11 Gel Sport Endurance was better than Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel but neither of these held a candle to Johnny B. Mode. (Take a moment to look at the photos we posted, comparing Johnny B. Mode and Suave.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you simply want a wet look, Suave does fine. If you want spiking, you need something stronger. That said, we still like Suave shampoo and conditioner and will continue to use those products. We just won&#x27;t be buying the Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Two stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback.

    <li> Suave Styling Gel for kids is a fun product. My nephew is ten and has shortish hair. I gave him the styling gel and told him to go to town. He put some in his palms and started rubbing it into his hair. He spiked it out and it looked kind&#x27;ve funny to me, but I didn&#x27;t say a word until he was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He looked at himself in the mirror, smiled and said, \\&quot;I look good!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is  medium weight and it drys looking wet. It leaves no white flakes and the gel holds up all day. At bath time he washed it out of his hair with nothing by warm water. He had a lot of fun with this gel and wants to use it again.</li>
    <li> Suave Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel is formulated especially for children. Kids Ocean Blast Gel is designed for mild to moderate hold, so if you&#x27;re trying to spike your kids hair or other dramatic styles this isn&#x27;t the gel for you. However it works well to hold stray hairs in place and is a must for \\&quot;Picture Day\\&quot; or special events. I would recommend it for parents who are blessed with children with unruly hair.</li>
    <li> My two oldest sons are like night and day. That includes their hair. One has dark, thick, wavy hair. The other has fine, light, curly hair. What they have in common, though, is that both of their hair can easily look like a rat&#x27;s nest. I have the hardest time managing their hair. This gel helps keeps it looking a bit more decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get their baths at night, so I&#x27;ve even put some in their hair at night just to see if it would help manage it the next morning. It wears out of their hair pretty easily. This isn&#x27;t a heavy duty gel. It&#x27;s very light-weight. It does help, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that this gel has a more sticky like quality in my son&#x27;s fine hair, as opposed to the one with thick hair. It really doesn&#x27;t take much if your child&#x27;s hair is fine and you&#x27;re simply looking for hair management. For more heavy duty hairstyles, of course, you will need more.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my seven year old as she always wants to do her hair up like mommy and I definitely didn&#x27;t want her using my harsher stuff on her baby fine hair. This works pretty good and does what she wants it to do, and yes, the best part, for her, is that she can do it herself! It also washes out no problem and leaves no residue! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Nothing beats a well groomed child!  If they look good, they feel good, right?  There is something about sending your tot off to school with unruly hair. It is one of my pet peeves I guess. I tried this on the little guy and it worked GREAT! There was no crunch, just a medium hold in his hair to keep him looking \\&quot;neat\\&quot; all day!  5 stars - great product, great fragrance!  (You don&#x27;t need to use a lot! Keep it on the smaller size to start!)</li>
    <li> My son watches me put gel in my hair every morning, so he was ecstatic when he got his own gel.  Its packaged much like other kids products with great colors and cartoony kids on it - they gravitate to such things.  The gel is clear and not very thick, probably the consistency of a hand lotion.  Once its worked in, it doesn&#x27;t shine, but dries matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good gel for getting rid of bed head and cowlicks...</li>
    <li> My son, with his cowlicks, has some pretty wild hair in the mornings. He&#x27;s learning how to tame it himself and this Suave gel is a good tool for him. It&#x27;s not overly thick or heavy. As long as he starts with a pea-sized dollop, he&#x27;s able to gently smooth it into his hair to keep it down. Even if he does go a bit overboard with the quantity, it doesn&#x27;t look greasy and get crunchy. It keeps his fly-aways down for the duration of the day and washes out easily with his shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave gel has a very nice fragrance. It&#x27;s light and simple, it just smells like clean. It&#x27;s easy to squirt out the appropriate amount and my son can handle rubbing over his fingers and smoothing it through his hair. It works well to keep his hair down, which is what he needs. I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be if he were looking to style it in an upward fashion, but that&#x27;s probably a few years down the road for us.</li>
    <li> This is a decent enough hair gel if you don&#x27;t need firm or long lasting hold. The smell is pleasant enough for girls or younger boys. My 8 year old doesn&#x27;t mind it. My 11 year old won&#x27;t touch it with a 10 foot pole but has become rather picky since introduced to Axe products. The tube provides easy dispensing. It helps make a messy style fairly well but.. if you are looking for a gel that will spike and hold this is not it. I think the level of hold it provides is more about hair managability than about acheiving a style. On the plus side it doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling icky and hard.</li>
    <li> Suave Kids Ocean Blast Gel for hair is an alcohol-free hair gel with a mild, gender-neutral, fresh scent.  A dab is enough if applied with the tips of the fingers.  It holds the hair well but isn&#x27;t stiff and doesn&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if the youngsters don&#x27;t normally use gel, they will enjoy playing \\&quot;beauty parlor\\&quot; and styling each others&#x27; hair with this.  This seems safe enough for them to play with and a spray bottle of water makes a good substitute for a can of hair spray.</li>
    <li> This is a good gel that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it to dry out your hair. It has good hold and helps to control my toddlers curls.</li>
    <li> This item works well and smells nice to me despite what others have complained about.  I found that it did get a bit stiff, but honestly I put too much on intentionally to see how it would flake, which it passed the test on.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> My daughter is getting to that stage where she longs to be a teenager, and yet she&#x27;s a good seven years away from actually being one, and so whenever she can get her hands on a product that makes her feel bigger than she really is she&#x27;s in love.  So, when I showed her the hair gel I got her she was ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially really excited about this as well.  My daughter has beautiful curly locks and with the right ply I felt as if she could have some really pretty looks.  The fact that the gel is alcohol free and dye free and basically as safe as they come was a total bonus.  With the promise of no visible residue (because who wants clumps of gunk in their hair?) I squirted the recommended &#x60;nickel-sized amount&#x27; in my hand, rubbed them together and began to feed it through my daughter&#x27;s curls.  It didn&#x27;t do anything.  Apparently this is made for children with finer hair.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is VERY thick and so the recommended amount of gel didn&#x27;t do anything but get a small patch on the top of her head wet.  I used another squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair still needed more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros here are the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clump.  That isn&#x27;t false advertising there!  It washed out really easy and the smell of the product is subtle and appealing.  For children with finer hair or even less hair, I&#x27;m sure this works great, but for thick, long curls, this doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot.  I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the hold the gel had.  After a few squirts in the palm, I was able to give my daughter a bit of a beachy look and the wavy part I gave to the top of my daughter&#x27;s hair held for most of the day.  I just wish that I didn&#x27;t have to use half the bottle (exaggeration) to get the effect.</li>
    <li> Purchased in: 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought for: My nephew, as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works as described, and smells great! The size is just right. My nephew loves it of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No cons at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I liked this purchase. I will consider buying this product or something similar from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping/Handling: The product arrived on time, in new condition, with no problems. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this gel worked great on my sons hair. he only uses very little to keep the hair above his forehead to the side. the suave doesn&#x27;t dry hard and shed the white dots everywhere later on. this is a good medium hold gel for little boys.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a bob hairdo - really cute and easy to maintain, but man oh man is it difficult to keep her bangs out of her eyes.  This is becoming an increasing medical concern as well, as she&#x27;s much more prone to eyelid styes when we&#x27;re not good about keeping her bangs in their proper place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this product, and voila! - the bangs in eyes problem is reduced substantially if not completely.  The bonus is that this product isn&#x27;t anywhere near as slimy or oily as other more infamous hair gels I have known, and even smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite winner here.</li>
