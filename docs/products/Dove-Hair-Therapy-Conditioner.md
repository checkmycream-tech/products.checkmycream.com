### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Kudos to Dove for making yet another great product!</li>

      <li>But the conditioner is awesome.</li>
      <li>It smells great too!  </li>
      <li>Just add a bit of your semi dye to the conditioner and your color will be perfect for months!</li>
      <li>But it was agreed that it was a very pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>This works very good.</li>
      <li>But I am very impressed with this product and feel like it is a good replacement for my salon conditioner.</li>
      <li>This Dove Hair Therapy conditioner works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with Dove products after comparing with others.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for a great conditioner.</li>
      <li>It had a really great and pleasent smell.  </li>
      <li>I assumed the great feeling my hair has is a result of both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>The Dove Color Care Conditioner is another great product from that</li>
      <li>It gets rid of frizz which is great</li>
      <li>I love the smell and perfect items to use to repair your hair.</li>
      <li>I like that the fragrance is pleasant and not over powering.</li>
      <li>Our family&#x27;s hair is good looking, shiny and manageable, and the product has a pleasant floral fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I can style and manage my hair good,</li>
      <li>The conditioner rinses out easily which is good if your water pressure isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>This is a nice lightweight conditioner.</li>
      <li>I really liked the way this conditioner worked.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks just as nice as it did out of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now instead of going to the salon each month and paying a ton for coloring, I dye my own hair.</li>
      <li>scent was a tad strong but after you rinse it out the smell is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>That it instead felt soft and looked shinier was a very pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>This product is very light, it comes in a sturdy packaging that will not leak inthe shower and it is not too bulky to squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Our family was glad to get a chance to try this conditioner and its matching shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I like the conditioner much more than the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dove hair products are probabaly the most understated products on the market today.  </li>
      <li>I love that there are no residues as well.</li>
      <li>The conditioner smelled okay</li>
      <li>I love how it works and makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>THe shampoo is very rich and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Dove Hair Therapy Conditioner is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>It is light, yet effective and moisturizes well without requiring a huge amount of product.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner spread through my hair quite nicely, and rinsed out quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was pleased with the smooth feel of my colored hair after using this, both before and after drying.  </li>
      <li>Loved the fast shipping from Amazon too.</li>
      <li>I love the clean, tropical scent of this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love how Dove gets your hair squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It distributes easily through the hair and rinses out easily.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, color treated hair...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the color aspect of this, as I don&#x27;t color my hair (or have problems with coloring), but as a conditioner it seems to work just fine.</li>
      <li>I used about a dime sized portion of both the shampoo and conditioner, and they did just fine.</li>
      <li>conditioner is smooth with a not-too-thick texture.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, it just smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>B000GCY224 Dove Advanced Care Color Repair Therapy Shampoo for Colored or Highlighted Hair,</li>
      <li>Nothing special, but perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>All in all, a good general purpose hair conditioner even if you don&#x27;t color your hair.</li>
      <li>The downside to the clean rinse is that my hair is a bit frizzier than with heavier conditioners, but it can go longer between shampoos.</li>
      <li>As it turns out, some sulfates are needed to clean the oils and styling products out of hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean, smooth and fresh smelling.  </li>
      <li>Nice scent and leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s basically just a good conditioner, especially when used with the matching shampoo.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good option for regular conditioner for colored hair which I will continue using.</li>
      <li>After a few washes, my brilliant color has stayed.</li>
      <li>It applies very easily and leaves hair feeling very soft and manageable after use.  </li>
      <li>Some years ago I learned about a new shampoo/conditioner that was only sold in certain salons that was said to be the best shampoo and conditioner ever for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>It also leaves my hair smelling fresh in clean.</li>
      <li>and I love the way they both leave my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a solid performer that gets good reviews from the whole family, plus it&#x27;s color-safe,</li>
      <li>This left a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>soft and tangle free!  </li>
      <li>I was able to use a small amount on my shoulder length hair and got amazing results.</li>
      <li>Although we don&#x27;t color our hair, the conditioner seems to be formulated to be gentler than many major brand shampoos.  </li>
      <li>I really like Dove&#x27;s line of shampoos and conditioners, but I think this one is my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner left my hair soft and looking good.  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells ok, leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t remove as much color per wash.</li>
      <li>Overall I am a big fan of Dove products and this was is great as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it hasn&#x27;t affected my fly-aways, my hair does feel silky smooth, and looks amazingly soft.</li>
      <li>and I really like it!</li>
      <li>It feels like a regular conditioner but it works so much better.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using Dove conditioner</li>
      <li>This is a great  Color Care Conditioner that gives those of us with dry , dyed hair the extra boost.</li>
      <li>After using it straight for several days, I am satisfied with the result.  </li>
      <li>So honestly if you color your hair or if it is naturally dry I highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>My hair seemed silky, and was very straight with no tangles visible (I have straight hair anyway).</li>
      <li>It went on easily, and I rinsed it off one to two minutes later in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the red in my hair color, which is prone to easy fading, stayed well-preserved while using this.  </li>
      <li>and it seems just fine when product is used on daily basis.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Using this for the first time, the smell was my main problem.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You certainly don&#x27;t need to use much product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While that shampoo did an amazing job of retaining my pricey hair color, my hair started getting a less-than-clean feeling to it after a few weeks of use.</li>
      <li>and this left the tips of my hair in fabulous condition.</li>
      <li>It left my hair tangle free silky and moisturized through the ends.</li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have come to really respect the Dove brand.</li>
      <li>and my whole family can use it as well.</li>
      <li>Dove conditioner is very nourishing for the hair, just like the soap for the body.  </li>
      <li>It is formulated to be gentle on color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>Keeping my color in wasn&#x27;t as important as having my hair be cleaned properly.</li>
      <li>As far as the color portion I haven&#x27;t noticed my color to be very different or that it has stayed any better.</li>
      <li>must say, however, that my hair feels less dry and more healthy.</li>
      <li>Its fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming, a little goes a long way, and it rinses very cleanly, leaving hair soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Dove hair products, since they make my hair very soft and easy to control.</li>
      <li>I want to preface this by saying that I dye my hair a dark but bright red.</li>
      <li>It smells ok and does not weigh my hair down.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this conditioner! I have fine, color treated hair...and this Is the only conditioner that really works  for my hair! Loved the fast shipping from Amazon too.</li>
    <li> For my daughter who practiced swimming regularly, I purchased this conditioner. This works very good.</li>
    <li> Any time I used Dove products in the past, it usually was limited to their soaps.  I love the packaging of Dove products and its subtle fragrance.  Dove hair products are probabaly the most understated products on the market today.  I decided to try this product because I color my hair on the regular basis.  In the evenings I exercise and I wanted to use affirdable shampoo and conditioner for shower after I return home from the gym.  This product is very light, it comes in a sturdy packaging that will not leak inthe shower and it is not too bulky to squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair loves the product.  It is moisturized well and it seems just fine when product is used on daily basis.  This product can also be used by other family members.  Its ingredients will complements any hair type, not just the color treated one.</li>
    <li> I want to preface this by saying that I dye my hair a dark but bright red. I am not sure how this product would do on someone who dyes their hair a lighter color. For me, this is a miracle conditioner. My hair is naturally dry as has a coarse texture. I am always looking for a great conditioner. I typically use a regular conditioner and a deep conditioner twice a week. I was able to use a small amount on my shoulder length hair and got amazing results. As far as the color portion I haven&#x27;t noticed my color to be very different or that it has stayed any better. However, it is red and it naturally fades quickly. So honestly if you color your hair or if it is naturally dry I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This review is for \\&quot;Dove Damage Solutions: Color Care with Vibrant Color Lock\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the accompanying shampoo, and between the two, I&#x27;m quite enthralled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just abused my hair with yet more coloring, this time a well done ombré job, and was not excited for the fading aspect. After a few washes, my brilliant color has stayed. My hair looks just as nice as it did out of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this for the first time, the smell was my main problem. It smelled like hair dye, although i think they may have been going for coconut. Not to worry though, the smell didn&#x27;t even last through my styling process, and certainly didn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You certainly don&#x27;t need to use much product. I used about a dime sized portion of both the shampoo and conditioner, and they did just fine. The conditioner spread through my hair quite nicely, and rinsed out quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it hasn&#x27;t affected my fly-aways, my hair does feel silky smooth, and looks amazingly soft. I plan on buying this more often, especially when I do my crazy dye jobs. Kudos to Dove for making yet another great product!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Dove conditioner and I really like it! I use it in combination with the matching shampoo and I love the way they both leave my hair feeling soft and clean. It also leaves my hair smelling fresh in clean. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I really liked the way this conditioner worked.  It had a really great and pleasent smell.  It applies very easily and leaves hair feeling very soft and manageable after use.  It also seems to be very reasonably priced with other product and seems to work okay about keeping your hair from fading while being in the sun and such.  It also works well when paired with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have come to really respect the Dove brand. The Dove Color Care Conditioner is another great product from that brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it just smells fantastic. It is a beachy scent but not overwhelming. You don&#x27;t end up smelling like tanning oil. THe shampoo is very rich and moisturizing. But the conditioner is awesome. It left my hair tangle free silky and moisturized through the ends. I have very long hair and this left the tips of my hair in fabulous condition. This left a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use really expensive hair products because long hair is a pain to keep in good condition. But I am very impressed with this product and feel like it is a good replacement for my salon conditioner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the color aspect of this, as I don&#x27;t color my hair (or have problems with coloring), but as a conditioner it seems to work just fine. Nice scent and leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I love how Dove gets your hair squeaky clean. I love that there are no residues as well. I like that the fragrance is pleasant and not over powering. After a work out this removes all the smells of sweat and oil that built up. Large enough to last and my whole family can use it as well. Overall I am a big fan of Dove products and this was is great as well.</li>
    <li> Some years ago I learned about a new shampoo/conditioner that was only sold in certain salons that was said to be the best shampoo and conditioner ever for color treated hair. Back then, I paid a LOT of money every month to have multiple colors of highlights and low-lights put into my hair, and spent hours sitting in the chair at the salon to get the style I wanted. So I went ahead and paid a small fortune for a tiny bottle of the miracle shampoo and conditioner, since it was supposed to retain my hair color better than any other. To my surprise, it did. Then the secret was revealed, it was a shampoo without any sulfates in it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While that shampoo did an amazing job of retaining my pricey hair color, my hair started getting a less-than-clean feeling to it after a few weeks of use. As it turns out, some sulfates are needed to clean the oils and styling products out of hair. So after a while, I went back to my normal shampoo and conditioners. Keeping my color in wasn&#x27;t as important as having my hair be cleaned properly. After some time, other companies started making hair products with lower sulfates in them, to help preserve color, but still keep enough in them to clean hair, which is exactly what these Dove Color Care shampoo and conditioners do. The sulfate levels aren&#x27;t as high as regular cleansers, so it helps retain your hair color, but there&#x27;s just enough still in the formula to cleanse your hair, leaving it soft and not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Dove hair products, since they make my hair very soft and easy to control. Now instead of going to the salon each month and paying a ton for coloring, I dye my own hair. But I still prefer using shampoos and conditioners that will help retain my hair color, and this Dove Color Care formula does just that.</li>
    <li> I tried both the shampoo and conditioner from this color care line from Dove.  I like the conditioner much more than the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is smooth with a not-too-thick texture.  It distributes easily through the hair and rinses out easily.  The apple scent with a touch of vanilla is enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the smooth feel of my colored hair after using this, both before and after drying.  I noticed the red in my hair color, which is prone to easy fading, stayed well-preserved while using this.  My hair is fine, but was not weighed down by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good option for regular conditioner for colored hair which I will continue using.</li>
    <li> Dove released a new shampoo for dyed hair and this is the counterpart in conditioner.  It is formulated to be gentle on color treated hair.  After using it straight for several days, I am satisfied with the result.  I notice very little fading if it does at all.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightweight conditioner. Its fragrance isn&#x27;t overwhelming, a little goes a long way, and it rinses very cleanly, leaving hair soft and fresh. It leaves my straight, medium-thickness, long hair soft and shiny. The downside to the clean rinse is that my hair is a bit frizzier than with heavier conditioners, but it can go longer between shampoos.</li>
    <li> Our family was glad to get a chance to try this conditioner and its matching shampoo.  It&#x27;s a solid performer that gets good reviews from the whole family, plus it&#x27;s color-safe, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically just a good conditioner, especially when used with the matching shampoo.  Our family&#x27;s hair is good looking, shiny and manageable, and the product has a pleasant floral fragrance.  Recommended, particularly if other products are damaging your color.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say that this product is far better than other conditioners that I have used.  It smells ok and does not weigh my hair down.  It gets rid of frizz which is great and I can style and manage my hair good, but it&#x27;s just not outstanding.</li>
    <li> Dove Hair Therapy Conditioner is a pretty good product. It does seem to give the hair a healthier look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have regular thick asian black brown hair. I didn&#x27;t color it. I just used it. I have 5 shampoos. I just use this for wednesdays after shampoo. When midweek, I know I could use a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Dove products and while I did like this conditioner I didn&#x27;t feel like I received the same amount of shine as I do with some of their other products.</li>
    <li> I give the conditioner the same rating as the shampoo that it goes with.  I love how it works and makes my hair feel.  We won&#x27;t buy any other now.</li>
    <li> I love the clean, tropical scent of this conditioner.  In my mind I thought it smelled coconutty, but I have now been told that is not actually coconut. But it was agreed that it was a very pleasant scent.  The conditioner left my hair soft and looking good.  I have paired it with [[ASIN:B000GCY224 Dove Advanced Care Color Repair Therapy Shampoo for Colored or Highlighted Hair, 12 Ounce]]and I&#x27;m very happy with their performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will consider buying again.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner.  It is light, yet effective and moisturizes well without requiring a huge amount of product.  It smells great too!  I don&#x27;t feel like my hair picks up any build up or is weighted down using this conditioner.  As for helping my color last, I really don&#x27;t see a difference, but I&#x27;ve never seen a difference with any shampoo/conditioner that claims to increase color longevity.  I find that things like being in the sun, exercising, eating well, etc. have a much bigger impact.</li>
    <li> soft and tangle free!  I have highlighted hair and sometimes it just gets dry.  But moreso it get&#x27;s tangled up and it drives me bonkers trying to brush through it and I end up yankging my fingers through it as it&#x27;s damp trying to blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has singlehandedly solved that problem. It&#x27;s thick and luxurious and smells fresh and clean.  When they say \\&quot;COLOR CARE\\&quot; they mean it.  My hair looks healthier when I use this product.  And so far..no build up!</li>
    <li> I like to dye my hair sometimes with Manic Panic - I use this stuff instead of regular conditioner because semi&#x27;s are known to always fade fast because of the harsher normal ones with all the chemicals and things. This stuff smells ok, leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t remove as much color per wash. Just add a bit of your semi dye to the conditioner and your color will be perfect for months!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using this and the  [[ASIN:B000E0K7NQ Dove Hair Therapy]] together for about two weeks. The \\&quot;pomegranate and lemon verbena\\&quot; scent was a tad strong but after you rinse it out the smell is pleasant.  My daughter colors her hair so the \\&quot;Vibrant Color Lock\\&quot; is supposed to help the coloring last.  Probably this biggest comment either of us have is that together the shampoo and this conditional make you hair feel extremely soft.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is adequate for colored hair, and works well with the above mentioned product that is the title of my review.  This was another sample from the Amazon vine program.  This is a non-greasy conditioner, that I used a dime size amount of on my shoulder lenght colored hair.  It went on easily, and I rinsed it off one to two minutes later in the shower.  The conditioner smelled okay (again,I am not too wild about the smell of coconut), but there was not a noticeable smell after I finished rinsing it out of my hair.  My hair seemed silky, and was very straight with no tangles visible (I have straight hair anyway). I was able to comb my hair easily after drying it due to this product, and my hair stayed straighter without frizzing (as it does sometime in the humidity we have here in Charleston, SC) for a little while longer than it would have without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this from Amazon vine, and was not paid to endorse this product in any way.</li>
    <li> Dove conditioner is very nourishing for the hair, just like the soap for the body.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about their conditioner is the smell.  It feels weird to have the dove soap smell on my hair.</li>
    <li> My family tried out this Dove conditioner.  It&#x27;s formulated to help retain hair color for people who color their hair.  Although we don&#x27;t color our hair, the conditioner seems to be formulated to be gentler than many major brand shampoos.  It has a decent fragrance and leaves our hair feeling soft.  It rinses well, too.  All in all, a good general purpose hair conditioner even if you don&#x27;t color your hair.</li>
    <li> These two products work well together.  Yes, you will end up with soft silky hair.  And even us long haired guys can appreciate that...it does get us favorable attention.  I&#x27;m quite happy with Dove products after comparing with others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner a few times now and I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the results. I like color care conditioners because my hair is sensitive to damage. This Dove Hair Therapy conditioner works great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the results immediately after using it. The conditioner rinses out easily which is good if your water pressure isn&#x27;t great. The conditioner also smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a conditioner, give this one a try. It feels like a regular conditioner but it works so much better.</li>
    <li> This is a great  Color Care Conditioner that gives those of us with dry , dyed hair the extra boost. I use this conditioner for over a month and I find me dry hair is healthly and growing. I love the smell and perfect items to use to repair your hair.</li>
    <li> I really like Dove&#x27;s line of shampoos and conditioners, but I think this one is my new favorite.  I like the way it conditions/smooths and gets the tangles out, all without weighing my hair down.  It is also gentle on my color-treated hair (not sure if it has helped it, but it certainly has not hurt it).  It leaves my hair clean, smooth and fresh smelling.  I plan to continue using the shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
    <li> No hair product can actually repair damage, as this one claims to do. But it is a nice-smelling, effectively-moisturizing conditioner. Nothing special, but perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> This review goes hand-in-hand with my review of the corresponding Dove shampoo. I assumed the great feeling my hair has is a result of both the shampoo and conditioner. I have highlights in my hair so I must use a product like this. I have spent a lot of money on products to maintain my hair color so giving it a 4 star rating and not a 5 is simply due to the fact that only time will tell how long my highlights last with Dove in comparison to other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, however, that my hair feels less dry and more healthy. I noticed this immediately after blow drying my hair which usually results in my hair feeling dry. That it instead felt soft and looked shinier was a very pleasant surprise. I completely underestimated Dove, thinking it merely a soap product. But in conjunction with the shampoo, I would recommend this product to anyone with color treated hair; the only caveat being how the color lasts over time in comparison to similar products.</li>
