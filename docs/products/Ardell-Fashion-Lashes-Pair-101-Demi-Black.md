      <li>Great for everyday use, at a great price than regular stores.</li>

      <li>They are first rate quality and arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>I tend to get about 2-3 weeks of wear out of them, as long as I take good care of them.  </li>
      <li>I love these lashes and I receive regular compliments from strangers.  </li>
      <li>I have used these lashes for years and the ones that I have ordered for your company have all been made better than the ones I have bought in local CVS and Walgreen stores for years</li>
      <li>They feel soft &amp; light.</li>
      <li>Price is better than locally, even when they are &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted and it was delivered fast.</li>
      <li>I like them because they are full and look natural.</li>
      <li>The lashes are fine,, but the description says &amp;#34;Pack of 4&amp;#34; and there is only one set in the package.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
      <li>My girls need these for dance, so very helpful</li>
      <li>If you follow these steps, they&#x27;ll keep their shape for longer, which ultimately will keep them looking more natural and will make them easier to apply.  </li>
      <li>I have read reviews that they are very natural looking, but it doesn&#x27;t appear that way on me.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, these are so soft &amp; full, and they keep their shape very well if you look after them well.</li>
      <li>Ok really though, some I&#x27;m sure can wear this look but on Asian eyes it looks ridiculous.</li>
      <li>style I was able to cut each lash in half.</li>
      <li>They are nice and thick for evening wear.</li>
      <li>If you try to apply them right away, the glue will not be sticky enough and the lashes will slide all over the place and make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I really prefer the ardell wispies or pretty much any other eyelash made by ardell.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.</li>
      <li>These lashes have no curvature to them, once you remove them from the tray the strip springs into a straight position, I don&#x27;t know what the point of the design on these is because my eyelids are not flat</li>
      <li>The clear one doesn&#x27;t have staying power.</li>
      <li>They really feel like wings on the lids and you definitely know they&#x27;re there.</li>
      <li>removing the glue at the end of the day, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s very helpful to use a large safety-pin or other sharp tip to poke at the glue residue and lift it off gently.  </li>
      <li>If you only use your fingers and nails to remove the glue, you may yank at the lashes too much and affect their overall</li>
      <li>While a little longer than I expected (on the edges), these worked fabulously for my cosplay at a convention in Miami.</li>
      <li>The only reason I have this four stars instead of five is because the ones I received are the right style, but they were in a green package that was called \\&quot;naturals\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>There not too long, but longer than your natural lashes of course.</li>

<li> I usually buy then individually at my local drug store, and this price was basically the equivalent to \\&quot;buy one, get one free\\&quot; compared to what I normally pay.</li>
<li> They stay on all day long until I pull them off.</li>
<li> But they weren&#x27;t the ones shown in the picture in the regular pink package that the picture shows.</li>
<li> : Take them off slowly and pull off the glue residue gently every night</li>
<li> Also the lashes are short on either end and long in the middle which makes them look odd.</li>

<li> Harder to apply than others</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re curious, I&#x27;ve uploaded a customer image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
<li> I only have one pair, and I usually wear them for a night out because they look pretty dramatic on me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> They look natural but dramatic, especially with a smokey eye look.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Ardell&#x27;s 101 Demi lashes for the past five or six years, attaching them with the waterproof LashGrip adhesive made by the same company (not included with this product).  </li>
<li> am Asian, so my eyes are quite small.</li>
<li> I put these on after I have finished all of my other eye makeup, including my mascara.  </li>
<li> I am usually picky about lashes but these are now the only ones i would wear.</li>
<li> I typically replace mine every other month.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
<li> Needed a pair of eyelashes for my little dancer.</li>
<li> A heavy smoky eye would be needed to rock these lashes.</li>
<li> I think because how stiff the band is and did I mention the wing flap feeling?</li>
<li> They are only slightly dramatic and Id even go for a longer lash for nights out</li>
<li> I use the black glue and apply the lashes over a thin strip of dark eyeliner.</li>
<li> I wear lashes everyday!</li>
<li> Makes your lashes look like that creepy baby doll that when you laid it down it closed</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s really hard to put them on.</li>
<li> My step daughter didn&#x27;t even know they were false.</li>
<li> The eyelashes that were the wrong ones period.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Ardell lashes.  </li>
<li> My kids are in dance competitions and so they go through fake eyelashes quite a bit.  </li>
<li> and I have never been disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My favorite lashes in bulk</li>
    <li> I love these lashes I use them all the time. There not too long, but longer than your natural lashes of course. They go on easy, and pill off easy too. I would recommend you buy the Ardell brand lash glue with the lashes.</li>
    <li> The lashes are fine,, but the description says &amp;#34;Pack of 4&amp;#34; and there is only one set in the package.</li>
    <li> This is about the third time I have ordered these lashes and I have never been disappointed. They are first rate quality and arrived very quickly. Price is better than locally, even when they are &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34;.  Very happy and will definately order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much,&lt;br /&gt;Kathryn</li>
    <li> Wife has been using this brand of lashes for the last 3 years.  She also orders the glue for the lashes.  They stay on all day and look great.</li>
    <li> These lashes were exactly what i wanted and look great. They are only slightly dramatic and Id even go for a longer lash for nights out</li>
    <li> The eyelashes were different type rather than I what I have order. The eyelashes that were the wrong ones period.</li>
    <li> If you love wearing lashes like I do then you will love these. They are nice and thick for evening wear. I was able to re-use them 2 times. I did not have a problem putting them on at all.</li>
    <li> I loved the purchase. It was exactly what I wanted and it was delivered fast. Unlike a waist clincher I ordered the same time and it&#x27;s taken over a month to receive. Won&#x27;t do that again😔</li>
    <li> These eyelashes go on so easy and stays on, looks natural, love this brand.  The price was great for all these eyelashes and the shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Ardell&#x27;s 101 Demi lashes for the past five or six years, attaching them with the waterproof LashGrip adhesive made by the same company (not included with this product).  I love these lashes and I receive regular compliments from strangers.  I tend to get about 2-3 weeks of wear out of them, as long as I take good care of them.  Here are my recommendations: Take them off slowly and pull off the glue residue gently every night (see below); try never to sleep in them, not even for short naps; and never cry in them (or get them wet in any other way).  If you follow these steps, they&#x27;ll keep their shape for longer, which ultimately will keep them looking more natural and will make them easier to apply.

If you&#x27;re curious, I&#x27;ve uploaded a customer image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For removing the glue at the end of the day, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s very helpful to use a large safety-pin or other sharp tip to poke at the glue residue and lift it off gently.  If you only use your fingers and nails to remove the glue, you may yank at the lashes too much and affect their overall shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final point: A lot of people don&#x27;t seem to realize that when you put the glue on, you have to wait 40-60 seconds before you apply the lashes.  If you try to apply them right away, the glue will not be sticky enough and the lashes will slide all over the place and make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun!</li>
    <li> First of all, these are my favorite lashes of all time. I use these on a daily basis. They&#x27;re so easy and look natural, nobody knows they&#x27;re fake! I usually buy then individually at my local drug store, and this price was basically the equivalent to \\&quot;buy one, get one free\\&quot; compared to what I normally pay. The only reason I have this four stars instead of five is because the ones I received are the right style, but they were in a green package that was called \\&quot;naturals\\&quot;.  They didn&#x27;t quite seem the same as regular the normal ones, maybe they were a little thinner. But they weren&#x27;t the ones shown in the picture in the regular pink package that the picture shows. That&#x27;s my only complaint. But they worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Really good natural looking lashes(not my style) but definitely did their job. Would totally buy it again,but will double up this time.</li>
    <li> While a little longer than I expected (on the edges), these worked fabulously for my cosplay at a convention in Miami. I actually want to try to wear them out in public (beyond a costume) to see how they are perceived.&lt;br /&gt;These are strictly just the lashes - no adhesive. You&#x27;ll need to purchase that separately.</li>
    <li> Love the lashes. Make your eyes pop. Great for everyday use, at a great price than regular stores. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> These lashes have no curvature to them, once you remove them from the tray the strip springs into a straight position, I don&#x27;t know what the point of the design on these is because my eyelids are not flat and it&#x27;s really hard to put them on. Also the lashes are short on either end and long in the middle which makes them look odd. I wear lashes for work and I go for a semi-dramatic look 5 days a week so I guess I can wear them for the time being but I really prefer the ardell wispies or pretty much any other eyelash made by ardell. I&#x27;ve been wearing falsies for a couple years now and these are just not working that well for me.</li>
    <li> A heavy smoky eye would be needed to rock these lashes. I was looking for volume but didn&#x27;t care for that blunt cut at the ends. Makes your lashes look like that creepy baby doll that when you laid it down it closed it&#x27;s eyes and opened when you stood it up. Do they still make those dolls? Yikes. Ok really though, some I&#x27;m sure can wear this look but on Asian eyes it looks ridiculous. On me, I personally think anyways. They really feel like wings on the lids and you definitely know they&#x27;re there. Harder to apply than others I think because how stiff the band is and did I mention the wing flap feeling? Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal when u consider how much one pair costs.  My girls need these for dance, so very helpful</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. I only have one pair, and I usually wear them for a night out because they look pretty dramatic on me.&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian, so my eyes are quite small. I have read reviews that they are very natural looking, but it doesn&#x27;t appear that way on me.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, these are so soft &amp; full, and they keep their shape very well if you look after them well. They feel soft &amp; light.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> My kids are in dance competitions and so they go through fake eyelashes quite a bit.  This was a much better deal then getting them at the drug store.  Ardell lashes are very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have used these lashes for years and the ones that I have ordered for your company have all been made better than the ones I have bought in local CVS and Walgreen stores for years</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Ardell lashes.  They make you eyes pop.  They wash well and can be reused !! Love them!</li>
    <li> Love the lashes! Such a great deal (price) when ordering the pack on Amazon! So much more expensive to buy a pair of lashes individually!</li>
    <li> Needed a pair of eyelashes for my little dancer. This are great for stage makeup and really make eyes pop from a distance. I wouldn&#x27;t wear them when not on stage, though.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! Very natural looking. Lasts over multiple applications.</li>
    <li> Love the brand.&lt;br /&gt;This style I was able to cut each lash in half. So I had 2 sets overall.</li>
    <li> I wear lashes everyday! These are easy to put on and give the eye lid a great silhouette. I use the black glue and apply the lashes over a thin strip of dark eyeliner. They stay on all day long until I pull them off. If you keep them on the tray, they will stay in shape and can be used for a month or two depending wear. I typically replace mine every other month.</li>
    <li> Very good. Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
    <li> these a very nice eyelashes very comfortable and beautiful</li>
    <li> The product is great. I am usually picky about lashes but these are now the only ones i would wear. They look natural but dramatic, especially with a smokey eye look. I can re use them up to 2x or more. Also the price is reasonable and cheap!!!</li>
    <li> These are disposable. I like them because they are full and look natural. My step daughter didn&#x27;t even know they were false. Get the beauty supply ENVY lash glue. The clear one doesn&#x27;t have staying power.</li>
