<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was exactly what I was told to get by Dr. It worked great!</li>
    <li> My feet have never felt so smooth. I&#x27;m on my feet a lot And I&#x27;ve always had issues with dry skin. I used it about 3 times and noticed a significant difference. Now I only use it to maintain my smooth and soft heels.</li>
    <li> Have been useing it for a couple of months, it seems to work better than the 20 strength cream I was useing before.</li>
    <li> This is working so well for my daughter!</li>
    <li> WOOHOO! I really like this cream. I have had dry cracked heels for a very long time and it seemed no matter what I did no matter what lotion I used (even lotion specifically for dry cracked heels) They would just not get better or even more importantly stay better. I tried this on a whim because winter was coming and I knew my feet would only get worse with the lack of humidity. I wish I had tried it sooner because after using this product everyday for about a week they were so much better, and soon I found myself using it every other day then every 3 days. This product will help you achieve and maintain soft and smooth feet and heels. I have recently tried a different product that Amazon sells that is only 20% Urea and I am finding it to not be as effective. I have to use it every day twice a day and for the price I might as well just pony up the extra dough and purchase this. I would recommend this to anyone that wants smooth soft feet and heels.</li>
    <li> A wonderful, even miraculous, product for my skin condition. Helps soften it overnight. I highly recommend that you apply this product as the last step in your morning routine, as any other type of cream on top of it tends to leave streaks.</li>
    <li> It dries crispy and white on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help to remove old rough skin.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic it cleared up my dryness and scaling. Will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Helped with cracked dry feet after 2 applications.  Very thick but rubs in nicely, and no real scent. Like it</li>
    <li> Purchased upon recommendation from my my podiatrist for my chronically dry heels.  Living in the desert it is nearly always sandal weather and it felt like no amount of pumice would heal them.  This if used consistently each day does in fact make a difference in a way that traditional lotions just don&#x27;t perform.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used. It works.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of the other reviews I had seen for pustular psoriasis. After being in remission for over 30 years, it came back last spring with a vengeance. I love this product because of the exfoliation of the dead skin. No, it did not cure it, but in conjunction with other products. OTC and prescription, it makes life a lot better.</li>
    <li> Its okay I guess, if you stick with it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Works well on my dry skin and to soften the calluses  on my feet.</li>
    <li> 5th time I purchased it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my slightly dry heels nor my boyfriend cracked hands or his psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my feet were dry and cracked.  A foot doctor recommended this so I thought I would try it out.  I found it helps quite a bit although I&#x27;m not sure you would want to use it on any other part of your body.  I put the urea cream on my feet using my hands but noticed if I don&#x27;t wash my hands after I rub it on my feet, my hands burn slightly or feel uncomfortable.  Texture of cream is almost like think egg white. (Usually put socks on my feet after applying it.) So if your also looking for something to put on the rest of your body because of dry skin, I don&#x27;t think this would be the answer. I only use it on my feet because I have thick calluses and dry cracking feet.</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended this product to my husband and it worked, just fine!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cream and is the only one with 40% urea and tea tree oil! The 40% urea was recommended by a doctor. The tea tree oil is a bonus for healing and keeping feet healthy.</li>
    <li> This product made my feet ten times worse and even more cracked. I tried to get my daughter to try it to see if the results would be the same but she wouldn&#x27;t agree to use it. Very unhappy with this product</li>
    <li> Hi highly recommend this product for everyone so that the skin of their feet remains healthy, soft, and young throughout their lifetime.</li>
    <li> I have unsightly stucco plaques and exceedingly dry skin on my feet.  For years, I got this same product by expensive prescription.  I was delighted I could buy this on Amazon.  I rub the cream on my feet before bedtime and cover with socks.  The next morning, I use a warm washcloth to remove the cream.  In three or four days of use, you will notice smooth, unblemished skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my terribly cracked feet.  This product, when used twice a day along with a \\&quot;ped egg\\&quot; type tool, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s not a cure but when I&#x27;ve run out, my feet go back to cracked and sore so I&#x27;ll keep using it.  A 4oz jar lasts me about 2 months.  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> i will deffinately buy it again. Works good on my toenail fungus.</li>
    <li> Has not done anything yet. I used Urea before and worked but think this isn&#x27;t pure.</li>
    <li> My skin is always left feeling hydrsted and smooth! It becomes so much more easier to exfoliate, too! I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> the best cream for dry and scaly foot skin. the only thing that works.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s fingertips get dry and cracked, and this was recommended to her by a doctor.  She applies it every night by rubbing into her fingertip (not the nails of course), and she swears it keeps the cracking, dried skin away.</li>
    <li> This works better than most for dry callused feet. It&#x27;s not magic for calluses (there is nothing and apparently once you get them ... you have them for life). This does soften the skin though and I have only used it twice. I hope with regular use my feet get better! Very thick and moisturizing. I will warn you though to remove any silver jewelry. For some reason this and other foot creams with urea in it will tarnish silver. For this reason I wouldn&#x27;t use anywhere but your feet (don&#x27;t slap this on your face considering it causes silver to tarnish)!</li>
    <li> I have always had terrible cracked &amp; peeling heels and toes. After just 3 applications they look great!! I don&#x27;t even need pedicures anymore!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite do what I expected it to after reading through reviews, but maybe my skin is just too tough.  It is an excellent product which makes a substantial difference even though not quite as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly nice, rather lightweight heel cream.  For me, it is slightly *less* effective than Kerasal ointment.</li>
    <li> i read about this stuff in a review magazine, and it was preferred overall for dry feet and heels.  They didn&#x27;t lie.  this stuff really works and I&#x27;m a hard case.  Have tried everything.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I got it to soften a toenail for removal and it worked well.  My wife decided to try it on some areas of tough dry skin and was very satisfied.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by explaining that I have multiple autoimmune disorders, and once I develop a condition, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to heal. For example, I fell on my right knee 7 months ago and tore it in three places; the surgeon my neurologist referred me to wouldn&#x27;t consider an operation because he feared I wouldn&#x27;t recover from the procedure. I&#x27;ve had similar responses from a neurosurgeon who says operating on my spine would put me in bed for a year--minimum--and that&#x27;s the good prognosis. What does this have to do with a cream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plaque psoriasis:  The back of my heels (not the bottom pad that you walk on) builds up thick coats of skin that turn white and then, sometimes, crack and bleed. I went to a dermatologist, who prescribed a 40% Urea or Uric Acid lotion for psoriasis--another auto-immune disorder. It was VERY expensive. First, I found TOPIX-URIX-Urea-Cream (actually a lotion) at the drugstore, and it did a decent job as long as I continued to use a foot callus scraper EVERY day. It&#x27;s available at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve even tried to shave the skin off of my heels.  Don&#x27;t try this at home.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I&#x27;d try something different and bought the double pack of REVITADERM CREAM. What a difference!!!  Now I use the callus scraper (cheap plastic handle with two-sided glued-on file) about once every 8 days. I apply the Revitaderm cream morning and night and sleep with super soft socks. My heels are in better shape than they&#x27;ve been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT. GREAT PRICE. Now, if I could find something that works on the topical dermatitis (eczema) on my hands and fingertips....</li>
    <li> Profuct is used to soften foot calluses to facilitate their removal.  This product does a good job in this role.  After using many similar products, this cream will likely remain the treatment of choice.</li>
    <li> Smells funny, is expensive, and makes your skin feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum. The skin on my hands likes to act up, and when it does, I call on this little jar of lovely. I have never had a lotion that made my skin feel so much like a massage therapist&#x27;s hands. I loved this little jar for 6 whole months, after which the contents became solid and unusable.</li>
    <li> Great foot softner it does wht the manufaturer says it does, I have tried others but this works the best</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used for my heels, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I have very dry heels with deep cracks.  I use the pumice stone in the shower and afterward, but a small amount of the cream on each heel.  With daily use, my heels look better than they have in years!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my elbows after trying many other products to get rid of calluses caused by leaning on wicker chair arms. In a couple days I saw a signiicant improvment. I&#x27;m recommending it to others and trying it on other rough skin areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Topix Urix 40 cream for more than a year, but the last time I went to re-order it from amazon it was unavailable, so I got this as an alternative. My palms and soles are both covered with thick hard cracked skin, same as my mom. I use the urea products to attempt to break down the keratin, or skin overgrowth, and while these are not miracle products (for my specific problem) I think they do mitigate it a little. I always apply at night only because these products (the Revitaderm more so) are very thick and goopy and almost make my hands sticky. They definitely feel softer in the morning until I wash them for the first time at least. My feet do hurt less the next day if I put one of these products on my feet at bedtime. As compared to the Topix Urix, RevitaDERM is definitely more moisturizing but also greasier and stickier (I think it has a higher petrolatum content), making applying any time I would have to touch things just uncomfortable for me. Maybe if Topix is available again I will get that one or mornings and keep Revitaderm for nights and finally follow the directions on both to apply twice daily...</li>
    <li> Recommended by our doctor. We like it.</li>
    <li> My foot doctor recommended this product to soften rough skin on my feet. Softens rough skin on the ball and heels of feet. Some lasting benefit. The only product I have use that actually solves rough, dry &amp;#34;ashen&amp;#34; heel issue, but must keep using at least a couple of times a week if not more.</li>
    <li> Say goodbye to dry scratchy feet. I use this regularly to soften my soles and it works wonderfully. It rubs on easily and drugs like a powder not an ointment...so you can wear socks with it at night or not. It comes with a pummice stone to help remove the dead skin....but the cream alone seems to work fairly well without the stone.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on my foot and this cream is the only thing that gets me through the week. I put it on before I go to bed and my foot is smoother by morning.</li>
    <li> treats cracked, dry skin and nourishes skin at the same time</li>
    <li> My husband and I both saw a tremendous difference in the cracked dry skin on our feet after just a couple of uses.  I have ordered a 2nd jar so we each have our own!</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel very soft.  Very absorbent, skin just soaks it in.</li>
    <li> It works really well, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but it works and it works great.</li>
    <li> Works pretty darn good</li>
    <li> Before this cream my feet felt dry and I would get cracks especially at the base of the pinky toe and the heel, it was painful. I use it nightly before bed and my feet are thanking me for it. Finally convinced my wife to use it, she is starting to believe&lt;br /&gt;we will have to get some more soon.</li>
    <li> wonderful alternative to very very expensive prescription urea cream love it!must use this product sparingly and neversharein a meta lcontainer</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for dry skin anywhere on the body. It makes a difference within a few hours. Yes, it is a bit expensive, but well worth it. I have used it on knees, elbows, and the back of my heel with great success. I also found it helpful with dry skin resulting from bandages in the vicinity of a wound. It should never go into the wound, but for problem skin around it, this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Softened the hard, cracked skin on my feet within a few days of use.</li>
    <li> this cream does everything it said it would. I love it!</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Takes away the scaly and dry skin on my feet that lotion can not.</li>
    <li> Got rid of that cracked skin on my heel super fast!  I noticed the difference the first time I used it!  Excellent product.  It should last a long time, since you only need a little bit.  Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> same cream my podiatry office sells, works great.</li>
    <li> For years, I have tried to soothe the dry skin on my heels.  This cream is by far the best on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for rough heels!  Makes them soft in no time.  Better price than at the podiatrist.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Fast and accurate. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Extra thick cream,... mild, but not terrible odor...</li>
    <li> Seems to do the trick with calluses.  Good product.  I will buy again when I need it.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I had really bad cracked heels and after about 2 weeks of using RevitaDERM every morning and washing my feet every night with Johnson&#x27;s baby soap, and then using the scrubber that comes with this cream and then applying RevitaDERM my cracked heels were healed! A month later since I started using RevitaDERM my heels are perfectly smooth. I also have Keratosis Pilaris (goosebump like rash on certain areas of my body) and after a month of applying RevitaDERM on the areas twice a day as well, some areas are completely clear of the goosebumps and the ones that aren&#x27;t have greatly improved and are definitely a lot less red. Definitely recommend this cream! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Does wonder to my feet</li>
    <li> This cream was used in place of a prescribed product form drugstore. It seems to work just as well and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Softens calluses so that you can more easily remove them, which then helps heal cracks. Comes with a pretty nice pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Pricey but well worth it. Smoothed deep and I mean deep heel cracks in 2 applications (with socks of course).</li>
    <li> This cream ,in use with the brush that comes with it , is the first lotion that has reduced my dry cracked heels.  I originally was given this cream as part of a treatment regime prescribed by my podiatrist. However when I moved states my  new General Practitioner  was not familiar with it so she suggested I &amp;#34;Google&amp;#34; it.  There it was on Amazon for less than the podiatrist charged me!  I ordered 2 and they arrived in less than 5 days and my feet are happy again!</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be ok. I have not used it long enough to see how well it will work.</li>
    <li> I like this and have purchased this a few times. It does help with softening, but truthfully it is not a cure all for callouses.</li>
    <li> My doctor diagnosised me with itchyosis of the ballgaris region. After removing my underwear I could see large silvery flakes of ithyosis and large pink spots of new skin on my ballgaris region where the ithyosis flakes had come off. This product cured me - thank god. Make sure to scrub hard with the pummice stone.</li>
    <li> Cracks I had in my heels are gone. I am pretty much amazed.  Thanks and I will continue buying this product</li>
    <li> I first learned of this cream through a podiatrist who gave a jar to me, so this is our second experience in using it.  Both my husband and I battle tough and dry skin on our feet.  This is the only product that seems to have the immediate positive effect it claims.  Slightly pricey but a little goes a long way and is, thankfully, available without a prescription.  Will purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a podiatrist to prevent fungal infections from taking hold so if you are using a public shower or walking barefoot a lot, this may be a good foot creme for you.</li>
    <li> Wife said it works great... just ordered another. Works better than expected.... great great  great  great  great  great  great  great great great great</li>
    <li> My daughter has exfoliative keratolyisis (skin peeling on hands) and this product was recommended to help heal skin. Within three days of starting to use it, her skin was on the mend. Probably the best product I have ever bought on amazon as it really DELIVERED !!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff has been a miricle for me. A week ago my feet were so cracked they were bleeding, I had to walk on my tiptoes. Now they are cut, crack and pain free! One week of use and my feet are like they were 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> It works, the podiatrist was pleased</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. No better than most other skin creams used frequently.</li>
    <li> works great, will order again</li>
    <li> My Dr. prescribed urea 20% for Keratosis Pilaris on my arms.  It helped mildly.  This helps much more- definitely not a cure, but I feel comfortable enough to wear sleeveless shirts.  It smells pretty good too.  I just hate the white residue it leaves behind(I think all Urea does this) and then it gets on your clothes.  But do recommend for KP.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay, but it can&#x27;t compare with Footsmart&#x27;s night time heel cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this foot cream for several years, as recommended by my podiatrist.  I USED to have cracked, painful heels...  BUT, now they are so soft and smooth!  Just recently, I was at my drs office, and the nurse commented on my beautiful SOFT feet.  Highly recommend and I have given this cream as a gift in a basket with foot care products.</li>
    <li> My podiatrist had given me a prescription for 40% urea cream and when that ran out I thought I would try this product.  This works better than the prescription product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cream I have ever used. I use it morning and evening and my skin feels firmer every time I put it on. Finally, a cream that works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 40% urea cream that is by prescription, but this product has it beat. It comes with a nice pumice/brush that really increases the effectiveness. The cream is very luxurious, nice feel, smell and the combination is right on. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this as living in a dry climate + I love to swim, now I can avoid the pain of cracked feet and toes.</li>
    <li> This cream works like many others; if you use it nightly you will get smoother feet. My problem areas are the heels and the inside edges of the ball of my foot. But, the real test will come when we are back to sandal weather.  I&#x27;ve only used it one month.</li>
    <li> Could not refill my prescription as no pharmacy carried urea 40%. This works just as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but everyday, nite, day, nite. Quit one day. And the skin problem goes back to the same problem it started with.</li>
    <li> Not much to say..it&#x27;s a good product.  A bit greasy when you put it on, but then it soaks in.  It&#x27;s a price/performer compared to other 40% Urea products.  recommended</li>
    <li> I bought it for the rough dry discolored skin on my feet.  I have been using for about two weeks or so and I can tell a difference.  My feet are softer and some rough skin is smoother and more supple.I don&#x27;t think its a miracle worker but so far its doing better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I think it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> my feet are the worst ever. Doctor recommended buying it. I use it on before I go to bed and put on lightweight socks. My feet look amazing better. Takes a little time but well worth it.</li>
    <li> does great job no complaints..Goes on smooth, no smell</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream.  Within 3 days my feet were becoming softer than they have been in years.  My pedicurist did not have to file as she usually does.  I&#x27;ve told the family about this cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is very effective with everyday use after a shower to soften callused skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for years but would get it from my Dr so it&#x27;s great to order when I need it instead of getting an app and perscription</li>
    <li> This is amazing cream I&#x27;ve had cracked heals for a long time and this has completely removed them. Love it</li>
    <li> Thankful to find this product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
    <li> Works slowly over time to reduce callouses.  However, callouses are merely a symptom of a more fundamental underlying problem.  In my case a problem not easily or safely resolved.  This product is the best I have used for tough skin build-up.</li>
    <li> I purchased the cream with reservations. I didn&#x27;t think it was 40% urea .but I said what the heck. I need some thing. No it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, It far exceeded my expectations. I am very happy with the product and will be purchasing another one today. I have only used prescription Urea in the past I believe this one out performs the Rx,</li>
    <li> Love this for repairing the cracks in my heels. bought my first jar at my orthpedic&#x27;s office, Will be buying it here from now on. Best stuff for heals and feet!</li>
    <li> This cream works quickly and is so much more effective than a 20% urea cream. It has a really nice feel and smell. I love that it has natural products. The service was tops and they sent a pumice stone along with a handwritten note. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very rough cracked feet and this is the only cream i have found that can get me through the winter without immense pain. My podiatrist sells it for 25 plus tax so getting it almost 10 dollars less is a great deal.</li>
    <li> My wife has used about half of her first jar and she says she is seeing good results so far.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s podiatrist gave him a prescription for 45% urea cream for his cracked heels.  He also told him to check on Amazon.  We are glad we did, as the prescription for 45% at COSTCO on prescription was over $200.  This cream is 40% and was less than $30.  Leave to Amazon to find us good deals.  The doctor was pleased to find out what we paid.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for it to work.</li>
    <li> First bought this through Doc&#x27;s office, was happy to find it on-line.  Works really well, better and less expensive than the prescription I had used before.</li>
    <li> I have had a persistent dry scaling patch on my heel and tried just about everything I could find.  This cream was recommended by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s worked better than any of the others.</li>
    <li> I had some allergic reaction on my one foot, the heel was cracking and it would hurt to walk on it. I had this problem for almost a year. I have only been using the cream for a couple of weeks and made a big improvement in the healing process.  it really softened the skin on my heels and made it possible for it to heal faster.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s podiatrist recommended this to treat and prevent painful cracked heels.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I used it on my feet and they are very smooth now. Problem is if you stop using it they become dry again very fast.</li>
    <li> I have had cracked heals for years and this cream healed my feet.  Best stuff on the market for cracked heals.</li>
    <li> This was used to soften a large (~2 in diameter) thick callous on the ball of the foot. Applying twice a day for about 2 weeks made a significant difference. The callous was nearly gone. I would definitely recommend for callous problems.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great with the special sox</li>
    <li> This cream works okay, not as effective as others I have tried. Since many people respond differently, I suggest that if you see results using urea based creams/ointments, then possibly give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great, although I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times.  Softens the dry, tough skin on my heels.  I went to a dermatologist and he said to get a cream that was high in Urea and this fits the bill!</li>
    <li> I first bought this from the Dr. I went to see and after using the entire bottle I found it on Amazon and have been using it ever since. The skin is fine now, I am using it more as a preventive measure now.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I will continue buying. thanks, bruce</li>
    <li> Not greasy and noticed a difference in two days. My diebetic feet feel great and noticeably smoother than ever. Thanks. Worth the price</li>
    <li> WIfe had a dead fingernail. This product helped soften the nail for removal.  You really need a strong urea cream to treat nails. Applied twice a day over two weeks. My understanding after doing some research, that this 40% cream would be similar to the creams prescribed by a doctor for the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also beneficial to help soften / remove callouses and to help soften / moisturize dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand some people may have an allergic reaction to urea. So, you might want to try this strong urea cream on a small area to see how you do. Also, you might have some burning or itching from the cream. And, be careful applying around your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
    <li> Husband using it he told me to give this rating. He&#x27;s on second jar</li>
    <li> Works great on very dry skin and especially for the dry feet</li>
