<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really liked this diffusor. I have long wavy/beachy style hair and I was pleased with the curl that the diffusor allowed the top of my head to maintain. My only recommendation is to ensure you spread products evenly enough--I tend to skimp on the top of my head and it can get a little frizzy, but for me, it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the perfect combination of product to add in. My waves were consistent from top to bottom and that is unheard of with long hair in the winter.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as I hoped but maybe there is a learning curve? I get more defined and fuller curls with my bowl type defuser.</li>
    <li> I have had the Devafuser and adapter for about 2 months now.  I LOVE the diffuser.  I have natural ringlets, but fine hair so it tends to frizz up with regular bowl diffusers.  The Devafuser makes my curls soft and frizz-free.    My one complaint is the adapter.  I found a hairdryer that it fit on and had no problems...until yesterday.  I put the adapter onto my hairdryer and several of the little prongs that holds it in place snapped right off!  I didn&#x27;t use excessive force, so I&#x27;m not sure why that happened.  Now it is useless and I had to hold the diffuser over the hairdryer with my hand to use it this morning- not exactly convenient.  I love the diffuser too much, though, so I am going to purchase the hairdryer that is made to go with it.  I only wish I could get my money back for the adapter!!!      Bottom line, if you&#x27;re balking at the pricey Devasun hairdryer like I initially did, you may wind up having to get it anyhow!  Save yourself the time and hassle and just buy the hairdryer/diffuser set.</li>
    <li> Previously, I used a bowl diffuser to give my curls lift.  But the DevaFuser has replaced the bowl diffuser easily. I love the way it can dry the curls at the base of my scalp to keep the curls consistent all the way down my long hair. Because I have long hair, it would normally be that 3/4 of my hair was curly while the top 1/4 was not as curly due to the weight of my hair.  Not with the DevaFuser!!  And yes, the adapter does work as it fits my non-Deva hairdryer nicely.  I also tried the spray that came with the DevaFuser along with my DevaCurl Angell and it works great.  Adds a lovely shine to the curls and gives them a bit more lift and tightness without any sticky or heavy mess.</li>
    <li> It took me a little while to figure out the best way to use the DevaFuser. Now that I&#x27;ve got it, I think this is the best diffuser out there. Unfortunately, the adapter is not made for dryers that get hotter than the extremely expensive Deva Dryer the diffuser was originally made for. The adapter eventually melted most of the teeth that hold it in place and the interior silicone band has come off. I hope they fix this flaw and until they do, I&#x27;m back to my traditional diffuser.</li>
    <li> I bought this diffuser and didn&#x27;t expect it to be as good as it is.  It cut my drying time in half! It dries my roots without frying my ends, perfect! luckily it fit on my hairdryer without the adapter (the adapter is really weird, I don&#x27;t understand how it would fit on any hairdryer, seems like it would fall off)</li>
    <li> I bought this DevaCurl Devafuser - it comes with a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; adapter and a tiny bottle of Set It Free.  The Devafuser itself is a wonderfully creative item that works well, especially in the fall/winter when you don&#x27;t want to leave the house with wet hair.  The adapter, however, does not necessarily fit all hair dryers (despite claims that it will fit 99% of dryers).  I have a little tiny grey travel dryer (I think it might be Conair).  Well I wasn&#x27;t up for buying a new hair dryer just to use this defuser, so I stuck it on there and used packaging tape to keep it in place.  Cheap?  Maybe, but it works perfectly!  I have no complaints.  Especially I got this whole package for a great price on Amazon.  Other places sell it for $40+ but I got it for less than that (around $30).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Set it Free is a good product too.  I didn&#x27;t anticipate using this much, but I often spray it on my wet hair after using the DevaCare Arc Angell leave in gel.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad - it smells a bit like candy.  At first I thought it would be too overpowering for me to use (I am very sensitive to perfumes and scents), but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Like some of the reviews here, I hate that it barely fits on my blow dryer. It starts out great, but then pops off midday through drying and it&#x27;s too dang hot to put back onto the dryer. Plus, in the looks department, it looks inappropriate. Why they couldn&#x27;t just make the hand part a little longer/wider and have that fit most dryers instead of a SUPER LARGE attachment that may or may not fit.     I bought mine at my salon and I feel like I was suckered into it. It may be the last straw for me to realize my hair is going to look how it looks, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what the diffuser does. the only benefit I will give this thing is that the top of my hair gets a better curl than it does with other diffusers. But this takes soooooo long to dry! And my hair DOES NOT dry on a cold, low setting. So I have to use the medium heat and it still takes forever. With my regular diffuser, I use medium heat on a low blow setting... the devacurl diffuser seems to double my time blow drying my hair (low heat might triple or quadruple it!).     Not really worth the money if you have something that works for you right now. and it&#x27;s crap that they say \\&quot;buy the products so it truly works\\&quot; not everyone with curly hair can use the same product.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser.  I was hestitant to spend the $ on yet another diffuser, but the shape of this one is really what makes a difference, drying the curls so close to the scalp.   I have long, fine curls, which can look limp as the day goes on - so this really makes my hair look more vibrant and curlier at the roots since mine often gets weighted down by its length.  Also, in terms of fit - Try Ceramix Xtreme BaByliss Pro (an amazing hair dryer on it&#x27;s own and a perfect fit with the diffuser adapter).</li>
    <li> I LOVED this diffuser when I tried it. It seemed to fit well on my Conair Ion 1875 blow dryer. However, after a few days of using it at low heat, the diffuser started to pop off while I was using it. And it seems that the heat would cause the prongs in the adaptor to break off. I started holding the diffuser onto the blow dryer and using it that way. And then as suggested at another review website, I bought the Conair Yellow Bird Dryer, but the diffuser did not fit on that at all.Then I just gave up and returned it. Until DevaCurl can come up with a better diffuser, or tell customers EXACTLY which type of dryer to buy, I will wait to buy this item again. If it stayed on a dryer, I would rate it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I was somewhat satisfied with the regular finger diffusers, but they never quite gave me what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve been wanting the Deva brand hair diffuser but I couldn&#x27;t justify paying upwards of $185 for it.  When I saw Deva finally came up with a DevaFuser attachment I had to get it.  I love it, absolutely love it.  The universal attachment fit my Vidal Sassoon Professional Diffuser Dryer perfectly.  The modeling of it being more of a hand cradling the head rather than a regular diffuser awkwardly sitting on the scalp has offered a tremendous difference in how my hair is gently dried.  Since I started using it I&#x27;ve been able to wear my hair down again.  Also setting my hair by \\&quot;plopping\\&quot; also called \\&quot;plunking\\&quot; before using the diffuser has added to amazing results.  When using the DeveFuser keep in mind to switch between the warm and cool setting on a medium speed, and never use the hot setting.</li>
    <li> I love the diffuser, it dries my hair evenly without parching the ends. Much better than a traditional diffuser, this can be inserted into the bulk of the hair to dry from the roots down. I would give it 5 stars, but the elastic band on the adapter broke after 2 months of use. Before, I had some trouble with the adapter sliding off. No worries, I duct taped the sucker onto my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser! With it I am able to dry the roots of my hair first and quickly!  My drying time is cut and my hair looks good when I am done.  With my old diffuser I would dry my hair and then have to wet my ends again because once my roots were getting close to dry my ends were very dry and thus frizzy!  That does not happen with this diffuser.  In addition, my hair has more volume at the roots because of how this product lays in the hair and my hair is softer and not dried out.  It is true that not all dryers work with this diffuser.  I had to buy a new dryer, but because of it I had an opportunity to purchase a new dryer that is ionic.  I haven&#x27;t tried the spray that comes with it yet, because AnGel was actually terrible on my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the defuser- the fingers enable you to really dry the roots and get lift. I have hair that wants to fall flat on top - so i use the defuser whether I am going to wear my hair curly or straight. No more flat top for me !!!</li>
    <li> I love the deva curl hair product line..finally products that DONT make your hair look and feel like a football helmet!(ex kinky curly!)..I purchased the deval curl diffuser and would like to say I love the product and also offer some advice. FIRST, some people report that it doesn&#x27;t fit. I used it on my dryer, which is REVLON and from Walmart, and it fit perfect, never popped off! SECOND, when using the dryer keep it on a low heat setting. This works fine to dry your hair and as you know with curly hair, HIGH HEAT&#x3D;FRIZZ!..the diffuser distributes the low heat evenly so drying it perfect. THIRD, do not LAY THE DIFFUSER DIRECTLY ONTO let the fingers of the hand rest on your head..the heat will flow from the middle of it into your hair..If you lay the diffuser hand DIRECTLY onto your scalp you may end up getting that area of your hair STRAIGHTER rather than curly...I give the product 5 STARS..the deva line delivers what it promises...</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!!  Fits right on my Conair dryer, no problems.  My hair has never looked better and I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments.  So happy I found this product and recommend it to all curly girls.</li>
    <li> Diffuser works great but the adapter not so good. Will shop w/adapter so as to get a blow dryer that will fit right. Refuse to pay for their dryer that fits!</li>
    <li> I loved the results I got from this diffuser! I have never had success with using a hair dryer before on my curls, regardless of what kind of diffuser I was using. This diffuser changed that for sure! I was finally able to have well-defined curls without waiting for them to air dry. I&#x27;ve found that if I don&#x27;t have time to dry my curls completely using the dryer (I have long hair), I use the diffuser to dry the hair at the scalp and \\&quot;in the bulk\\&quot; of the hair and let the outside and ends dry by itself. My only complaint, like most of the other reviews, is the \\&quot;universal\\&quot; adapter. It did not fit my dryer, and no matter what I tried it would not stay on, it just slid right off. I think part of the reason it didn&#x27;t fit is the end of my dryer is tapered. But, I just use packaging tape and it stays on that way! I plan on getting a new hairdryer eventually and when I do I will plan on getting one that fits either the adapter or the diffuser itself. The Set-it free is an awesome product too, and I would buy it to use regularly except it&#x27;s a bit pricey for my budget.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is a god-send.  It is light weight and fits perfectly on my brookstone travel dryer.  Scrunch and then let the jolly green hand do all the work, producing perfect curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit a few weeks ago and have been using it twice a week ever since.  It&#x27;s been a fantastic addition to my extensive hair gadget collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have semi-kinky hair that I have been relaxing for over 20 years.  My hair is a tiny bit below shoulder length.  December was the last time I relaxed my hair since I&#x27;ve decided to grow out the relaxer and go back to my natural curls.  This means drying those roots gets harder and harder since they are THICK and not relaxed.  My hair routine involved using a bowl diffuser with \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; until my hair was almost totally dry.  The big problem was that by the time the roots were dry enough, the rest of the hair was TOO dry and essentially frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DevaFuser has fixed that problem for me.  I wash my hair with conditioner only, rake in Palmer&#x27;s coconut pomade and Twisted Sista curl activator cream with some regular conditioner as a leave-in.  I then take the DevaFuser and starting at the top of my head, I begin to dry the roots by shoving the diffuser&#x27;s \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; into my hair.  I do this all around the edges of my head until the roots are dry.  The rest of the hair is still very damp by the time the roots are dry because all it takes is about 5 minutes to dry the roots.  I then switch back to my bowl diffuser to finish off the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DevaFuser with its attachment fits just fine on my standard-sized hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give this product a total 5 stars because a) I have to switch out to my bowl dryer, and b) the curl activator spray does nothing for me, although it smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m going to try to upload a pic of my hair after I finish this.  I&#x27;m the one in the white t-shirt with pink stripes.)</li>
    <li> Have utilized a bowl diffuser for years on my curly hair; due to its limitations it took a lot of time to get all of my hair dry (my arms got tired too).  The Devafuser allows me to get to the root of the problem in half the time without having to engage in various head positions to try to reach all the damp parts of my hair.  Works great with, and stays attached to, the Conair Ion Shine 1875 on the low/warm setting.  (Can also use the low/hot setting every once in a while when you are running short on time.)  The dryer is lightweight so no more tired arms either!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now. After 2 months the prongs to the adapter started to break off. Now too many have broken off and it is no longer useable. It&#x27;s too bad really because the Devafuser is great! It keeps my hair from frizzing, however for the price I expect it to be of better quality. I decided today, before I throw it out, to give gorilla glue a try,,, lets see if I can get this adapter to remain on my hair dryer forever!</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser. I have used others in the past and they always worked well on the ends of my hair, but left the top flat. This one actually gives some lift to the top of my hair with out making the sides poof out. After blow drying my hair with the DevaCurl Devafuser I haven&#x27;t had frizzy hair. The Set it Free really helps when you get that crunchiness that comes with using too much gel. This isn&#x27;t something I have to use everyday. Just be careful and not use too much. I have fine, curly/wavy hair and only have to use a small amount. Too much and it makes my hair look a little greasy. I know the price on these products are high, but they are worth every penny. It doesn&#x27;t take me any time to fix my hair anymore and I have had more people compliment my hair since I decided to go curly.</li>
    <li> I had read about the DevaFuser quite a while ago in a magazine and considered buying it ever since, hoping it would make it easier to dry my curly hair during the winter months when I can&#x27;t let it air dry.  I waws excited when it arrived and immediately read the directions and tried it.  What a disappointment.  First, with the extra attachment, I got it to fit on my blow dryer, but had to hold it very carefully since it kept falling off.  The instructions and a label on the dryer itself stated that it could only be used on low heat and low air setting.  This made it virtually useless.  It took forever to dry and did not do a good job with  my curls.  My regular diffuser that I&#x27;ve had for years does a much better job.  I thought this could help make drying quicker and the curls look better because the fingers would get into the middle of my hair.  That did not turn out to be true at all.  This was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> works well, even though it occasionally jumps off the hairdryer.  Really nice to go out with a dry scalp in the winter... does a good job and does not frizz your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this all excited to use. I used it ONCE and loved the results. However, it kept falling off the dryer and when I went to put it back on, it was so HOT that I burned my hand. This would be great if they had some sort of rubber on it where you wouldn&#x27;t burn your hand.      I tried to return it, but they won&#x27;t take it back because of \\&quot;health\\&quot; issues. Its not like I used to to dry other parts of my body hair...All they would have to do is use steam to clean it. I&#x27;m not sure if it says anything about the return policy prior to buying and if it does, my fault for not reading it first. But for an item that can burn you, they should take it back. To me, this is a bad design when it comes to safety.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this diffuser, hoping it would cut down on frizz, and help my curly hair look more defined. Wrong! It seems to make my hair MORE frizzy, and it doesn&#x27;t dry any faster than my bowl diffuser does.     I don&#x27;t have any problems in the adapter fitting my Revlon 1875 blowdryer, but even on the low heat/low flow setting, my blowdryer over heats and turns itself off when using the Devafuser. Very annoying! And on low heat/low flow, it certainly isn&#x27;t fast to dry my hair.    Because the Devafuser is quite thick, I really can&#x27;t fit it up and into my hair by the roots. I definitely cannot dry the top of my head without flipping my head upside down, and ending up with big, frizz head. Maybe those with really thick curly hair can use this up against their roots, but not my thinner curls.     What a disappointment and a waste of money. I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one  because the hand shape is convenient for cupping the ends of my hair to dry, but not that much better than the bowl diffuser.     Overall, I am sorry I spent my money on this.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to buy it because I didn&#x27;t know if it would fit my blowdryer but I decided to take a chance and buy it. It actually fit one of my blowdryers and unlike the useless other reviews that claimed it fit their blowdryers and didn&#x27;t provide any information for the rest of us I&#x27;m actually going to tell you what blow dryer I have. I have an infiniti nano silver by conair, it is a white blowdryer that comes with a diffuser. I bought mine at tj max for $25 but I know they sell it at target also but its a bit more pricey there. For the reviewers that said it came off you need to put the adapter on the blow dryer first and then tap it against the floor to make it secure. Then I attach the difuser and it doesn&#x27;t fall off. As for the diffuser itself it is ok. I like that it dries my roots first and gives more volume to my root area, but now I have trouble drying the tips of my hair. I have to go back and use my conair euro style diffuser to dry the tips thats why I give it 4 stars. Ok product but not amazing like everyone said.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first saw this thing, but a friend swears by it, and I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  WOW.  Am I glad I did!  The ability to dry my roots first, and not have to touch my hair as much during the drying process really makes a difference to the volume and spring of my curls.  My only complaint would be that with the universal adapter attached, the unit is really long and kinda awkward to handle.  But it&#x27;s easily rotated to work with the curve of your head wherever you&#x27;re concentrating on at the time.  I would recommend this to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair.  It&#x27;s very fine and the hair on the top of my scalp is curly, while the hair underneath is wavy/straight.  My entire life I&#x27;ve struggled with the variety of curl in my hair because it varies from almost non-existent to botticelli curls.  I&#x27;ve always felt like I either had to straighten my hair by blowing it out or getting it super curly by using a diffuser and loads of product on my hair.    No longer!    The DevaCurl diffuser is great because it has allowed me to relish my natural curls.  They&#x27;ve NEVER LOOKED BETTER!  Although my roommate and then my husband took one look at it and wondered what on earth was attached to my blow dryer, I&#x27;ve never looked back to my old diffuser!    The Devafuser is great because it helps to dry my hair from the scalp out.  There are holes in the diffuser all the way around, so it&#x27;s drying in ever direction.  The attachment that came with my diffuser fits perfectly onto my blow dryer, so fitting is not an issue.  I love my Devafuser!!!  I&#x27;ve embraced my natural hair, rather than fighting against it.      HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece as a Christmas present.  It looked cool in the magazine, but when it arrived in the mail it was weird looking and awkward to handle.</li>
    <li> Disappointed is my main reaction.  The devafuser is not good for shorter hair.  I was expecting a softer plastic and this is hard, hard, hard.  My old difuser works far better primarily because it has more pliable protusions.  And \\&quot;Set it Free\\&quot; works well for the first day, but does not bounce back to life with damp fluffing the next.</li>
    <li> Here is a little back ground on my hair&lt;br /&gt;3a3b3c hair shoulder length and fine.&lt;br /&gt;I have another diffuser and thought oh well&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s try this one as it is very interesting and my&lt;br /&gt;Work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here has been my finding after using it for three weeks&lt;br /&gt;Use it with you cold/cool setting, your hair will come out&lt;br /&gt;Curlier and lovely... on Warm/medium heat it kind of made my hair frizzy. I use two diffusers, my other one first and then this&lt;br /&gt;One on cold when my head is upside down so the nape of my hair&lt;br /&gt;And then I flip my hair over and work on the crown area and then on the side of my head.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a total of 10 minutes alternating positions.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought this was a piece of junk until I figured out how to use it now I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> When I went to my salon last time, my stylist used the Deva Diffuser.  Wow! What a difference in my hair.  I was curly, thick, and it dried quickly.  I also love the Set it Free spray.  It holds the style in for two or three days and does not feel gunky like a lot of products do.  I think it&#x27;s a gas that the Devafuser looks like a hand.  It&#x27;s almost like a caress when I dry my hair.  I have no trouble with it fitting onto my dryer.  The adapter holds it in place just fine.  I highly recommend both products - the Devafuser and Set it Free.</li>
    <li> I love the Devafuser. It makes my hair look great. Adds a lot of volume at the roots. I have a professional hair dyer, and it fits without the adaptor. It doesn&#x27;t slip or fall off. I love it. I even recommended it to my stylist today. It is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!!</li>
    <li> I really loved this diffuser! It creates great volume without making my hair huge and I really didn&#x27;t get a lot of frizz. I will agree with other customers that the attachment peice is not good... my husband was holding the hair dryer and the devafuser shot off and hit me in the face... it was like a projectile. I also do not recommend the spray that comes with it... I like the Deva Curl gel.</li>
    <li> I use a Solano Ticino dryer, and I looked up the list on Deva that says what dryers they have tested to see if the adapter works (I don&#x27;t know the link, but google it), and Solano was on there so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It fits great, so I can&#x27;t concur with other people&#x27;s complaints that the adapter falls off, I&#x27;ve never had that problem.    The diffuser itself is wonderful. I have medium-tight curls, and I usually get out of the shower and just leave my hair soaking wet with gel on it with a t-shirt on my shoulders to get drips until I&#x27;m ready to go, but I would always end up going to class with wet hair. Now, it takes only about 10 minutes with this thing to get my medium-length hair mostly dry, and it gives it great volume at the roots and perfect curl definition. It&#x27;s big and green and looks totally weird, but hey, it works.    I am also in love with the set it free (it smells so good I want to eat my hair!) and have almost used all of it . . . debating whether I want to pay the high price for more, but that stuff&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> All of the Deva products have done wonders for my curly hair.  Once frizzy and crunchy, my hair is now completely frizz free and soft.  And I don&#x27;t have to use silicones or hairspray to keep it in shape.  I use the No-poo, One Condition, Arc Angell, Set it Free, and Mister Right.    The fuser provides a means to dry my curly quickly without frizz...don&#x27;t have to turn my head upside down anymore, like with my old diffuser.      PERFECT!  Every Curly Girl should own one of these and a second as a backup!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to use the product yet (I have the wrong hair dryer and need to get a new one!).</li>
    <li> I think the DevaFuser is the best thing since sliced bread. Heck, it may even give it a run for its money because sliced bread doesn&#x27;t give me fabulous hair.     I have long (almost waist length), fine, thin, wavy/curly hair. With a regular bowl diffuser, I get great curl enhancement on the ends but by the time my roots are dry, my ends are parched and frizzy.   My main concern is my sloooow drying roots and this diffuser is *perfect* for that. Other diffusers just leave me with dry, poufy ends and damp, limp roots; this one makes my hair happy, top to tip. Speeds things along too!      On the downside, the darn thing won&#x27;t stay on my dryer! I have a Revlon tourmaline ionic and I had to literally hold the diffuser onto the end of the dryer with both hands the whole time or it would pop off. We&#x27;re talkin&#x27; flying across the room here. Not cool.    I considered a new dryer and took the diffuser and adapter to Ulta to try a few. There were a couple it seemed like it *might* stay on (Rusk Speed Freak is the one that comes to mind) but none it was secure enough on that I felt comfortable with it.       BUT it must say something about this product because although I returned this kit, I just went ahead and ordered the DevaSun Dryer with the diffuser so I know they&#x27;ll work together. Not too happy about dropping the better part of $200 on a hair dryer but after trying the DevaFuser, it was either that or duct tape that sucker to my Revlon. I hope the dryer is as good as the (also expensive) Rusk one I was considering.      I can&#x27;t comment on the Set It Free yet because I returned it with the kit before trying it out. Went ahead and bought a bottle though.</li>
    <li> Well, I was dying to get this diffuser, and decided to ignore all the reviews that said the plastic pieces holding the adapter to the dryer broke.  I shouldn&#x27;t have, because mine lasted 3 weeks.   Amazon customer service was great, though, and said to send it back and they will credit my account.  Aside from all that, it was good for drying the underside and roots, but seemed to cause frizz when held on top of the head.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I was concerned about it fitting my existing blow dryers, but it fits both of them and cuts my drying time in half!!</li>
    <li> Invest in duct tape if you&#x27;re going to buy this product - the term \\&quot;universal adapter\\&quot; is not true. I have no idea if the diffuser works or not because I&#x27;m physically incapable of holding the diffuser on my hair dryer - some $200 device that I honestly cannot afford to replace due to the diffuser adapter limitations - while, in parallel, drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Does not fit my hair dryer...</li>
    <li> I used this product ONCE for 5 minutes total. I read through the pamphlet looking for any warnings or instructions I should be aware of, and there were none. I used the product on medium heat (I have cold, medium and hot...and you can&#x27;t even try to tell me that cold will dry your hair!!) I used it for 5 minutes... All of a suede. My dryer stopped all together. This stupid product MELTED itself, AND my dryer that i&#x27;ve been using for years, with many many diffusers over that time, mind you. After this happened, my husband and I examine the diffuser and the adapter, to find a tiny warning where the \\&quot;made in china... Or wherever\\&quot; print should be, saying to use on a low setting!? Well , my \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is COLD, so I used the next one up, logically. One cannot dry hair with cold air, my good friends, so unless you have found some magic way to accomplish this, DO NOT buy this product!!! To make matters worse, I have emailed [...] advising them of what I have written here, and they have not had the courtesy to even email me back to advise me that they would be helping me with this situation, which I think would have been a good faith act, which I&#x27;m pretty sure, after spending $[...] on the diffuser and $[...] on shipping, that I am entitled to... Don&#x27;t you think?</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair more frizzy than using the typical diffuser.  Not happy I spent money on this product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent solution to make your curly hair gorgeous! Easy to use, simple instructions and wonderful curling spray!</li>
    <li> This would be great if it would stay on the dryer. It pops off so I have to hold it on with my hand. Even doing that it pops off from time to time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type to blow dry my hair, so I may not have the patience for it.  This thing takes for EVER!  You have to hold it still for a few minutes before moving it, or you&#x27;ll make the curls frizz, which defeats the purpose of the whole process.  I&#x27;m still learning how to deal with this, but usually, I don&#x27;t bother and let my hair air dry.</li>
    <li> My stylist had used the Devafuser on me before, and I loved it.     Before I bought it, I looked on the DevaCurl site to make sure my hair dryer model fit the adapter that comes with it. Mine was listed. And guess what? It doesn&#x27;t fit. My dryer doesn&#x27;t even go half an inch into the adapter. So since I&#x27;ve bought this thing, I&#x27;ve been holding it in place while using it. Completely misleading.    Though: if I resolve this and find a hair dryer that does fit the adapter, it&#x27;s a great product. People who hate it in comments seem to not know how to use it properly - I hold it against different sections of my head (at the scalp/from underneath) for a minute or two, without moving it around while it&#x27;s drying or holding it onto the top/outside of my hair. I&#x27;d recommend a regular diffuser for the rest of your hair, if you want to dry all of it in one go (I just let the rest of mine air dry).</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser - it works great on my curly hair.  it slides up to my scalp and dries the roots, but leaves the ends alone so they don&#x27;t get dried/fried/frizzed.  I&#x27;ve been recommending it too all of my curly friends.  As a side note, my son thinks it&#x27;s too cool and gives it high 5&#x27;s all the time :)</li>
    <li> The order arrived in good time! Pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there were only 2 items, the Venturi-like connector was not sent and the DevaFuser was not able to be used.</li>
    <li> Your picture shows three items. I only received the finger diffuser and the bottle of spray setter. Therefore, I am puzzled.</li>
    <li> The Set It Free Moisture Lock Spray that comes with the DevaFuser is great. I have course wavy hair that is curly underneath and live in San Francisco - think fog. This spray is amazing at taking the frizz out of my hair and it smells great. I really loved it. However, I can&#x27;t really even use the Fuser as it doesn&#x27;t fit on any blow dryer I&#x27;ve tried. The box says it will fit on 99% of all dryers, but that has not been true at all.[[ASIN:B001H88JEI DevaCurl DeevaFuser Kit]]</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. The diffuser fits to both my dryers with adapter included. I am a big fan of Devachan (the salon, products, and now the diffuser). DevaFuser is very convenient for drying curly hair: it drys hair fast and does not ruin your wet hair styling. I am glad that Devachan products are now available at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Could not make it fit on my hair drier, I guess they want to sell you their drier as well.  Did nothing for my hair, sorry I got it.</li>
    <li> I think my hair is the type of hair against which all curly products should be tested. My hair is course, thick, fine (the actual hair), and fluffy. Too much fussing with it just sends it out of control. That is why I love, love, love the DeevaFuser! It dries my hair from the roots out without a lot of movement. Have you ever tried to dry your roots with a typical diffuser without over-drying your ends? Almost impossible. Not with this one. I do wish it fit my hair dryer without the adapter but that is a small price to pay for how much healthier my hair has become. I also love the \\&quot;Set it Free\\&quot; that it comes with and I look forward to trying more of the Deva products.</li>
    <li> At first, I couldn&#x27;t fit the diffuser to my Vidal Sasson air dryer. I went to the local pharmacy and bought an inexpensive store brand air dryer and fit the diffuser onto it. It fit very well. I also tried it on a Conair travel dryer and it worked. Good luck!</li>
