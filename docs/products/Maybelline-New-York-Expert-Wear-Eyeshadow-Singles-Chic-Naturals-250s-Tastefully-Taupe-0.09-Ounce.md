<li> I like the fact that this eyeshadow comes in a SINGLE, and that I don&#x27;t have to buy one container with several different colors just to get the ONE color that I want.  </li>
<li> I live in a small town and the merchants here did not have this product</li>
<li> This looks very classy with pale skin, brown eyes, brown eye liner, and black mascara.</li>
<li> Not worth my time or expense to return it.  </li>
<li> I always throw out the applicators eye shadow comes with and use a small damp makeup brush to apply it, pat moisture with fingertips, and blend it all out with slightly lager dry brush.</li>
<li> Very disappointed that such a simple transaction could get goofed up.  </li>

    <li> This is a nice addition to my eye shadow collection. It serves well as a medium shade over the lid for darker, smokey eye looks, or as the darker shade in the crease for a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; look. I really like that it can pair with warm or cool palettes.</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you expect</li>
