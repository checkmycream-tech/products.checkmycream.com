      <li>Works great looks great</li>
      <li>These work great</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m SO happy I found these.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This is very handy for making sterile pads and compresses.</li>
      <li>Good product for the price.</li>
      <li>And they fit perfectly in my train case.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with them.</li>
      <li>Bottles are great no complaints... wish I had more.</li>
      <li>Makes it very easy to pump up just the amount that you need.</li>
      <li>far, I&#x27;m very happy with these bottles.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of pumps were very nice.</li>
      <li>I love my nail art</li>
      <li>I love the flip top and then the pump.</li>
      <li>I bought them for personal use, so I use it once a week for my nails, works perfectly...</li>
      <li>I love the bottles.</li>
      <li>Plan to purchase more.</li>
      <li>but they are working good right now.</li>
      <li>The other one is still in perfect condition, though.</li>
      <li>I also would have preferred the embossed writing to be easier to read, but that&#x27;s easily corrected with a label or marker.</li>
      <li>and this makes it so easy to use my polish remover and acetone while I am working on my nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, convenient, and makes me feel like a nail technician.</li>
      <li>This works well for what I purchased it for I am a sleep tech and use alcohol to clean areas where leads are place the the wipes I go through so many</li>
      <li>They work just fine and have made doing my nails easier.</li>
      <li>Speaking of which, the concaved button is firmer than I&#x27;m used to but works fine.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless FWIW, I think it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>I have been using one of these bottles for several months now and have had a great experience with them.</li>
      <li>They were easy to fill, clean, and use.</li>
      <li>drawback is that the bottle itself is quite light, so you&#x27;ll want to keep it filled to give it some substance so it stays in place as you use it.  </li>
      <li>I needed some for Hydrogen Peroxide and therefore had to cover the bottle to keep the light out.</li>
      <li>so far, so good.</li>
      <li>I use it for a home-made TendSkin liquid, I have had no clogging or leaking issues at all, and it pumps the liquid to the top easily and consistently.</li>
      <li>They are surprisingly durable and I plan to buy more for other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used one for the first time last night and it works great.</li>
      <li>so make sure they are standing straight up if they are full of liquid.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>I like the idea of these pumps, but these were pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>Just right for this particular purpose, which is quick access to some readily available alcohol.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t matter really what you put in it!</li>
      <li>The item is exactly like the product promised in the picture.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Shipping was SO fast!</li>
      <li>, I would have preferred a freer-flowing loosey-goosey pump button (similar to the large metal dispensers), but for the price, you really couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
      <li>and I was expecting it to be very flimsy</li>
      <li>Anyway, I really like these for my toner and use with cotton pads.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these little bottles.</li>
      <li>so it is safe to say that it&#x27;s tight and won&#x27;t spill your liquids.</li>
      <li>Love these little pump.</li>
      <li>I ended up using for alcohol and they work great and makes my job much easier then with the other fiber cleaners i have used in the past.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s very efficient, so far I have not had any problems with acetone evaporating</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s not a complaint.</li>
      <li>Pumping is easy so long as you keep the hole covered entirely with your swath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t super thin cheap plastic as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I use one for regular nail polish remover and one for pure acetone.</li>
      <li>I have traveled with these a few times already (filled with witch hazel)</li>
      <li>So much easier using the pump dispenser than a bottle, especially when you just want to do one nail.</li>
      <li>I was concerned about the alcohol possibly evaporating, but it absolutely has not.</li>
      <li>So far they work as advertised.</li>
      <li>The fliptop lid snaps into place and is neither too hard or two easy to operate.  </li>
      <li>So much simpler to get a paper towel corner wet for wiping something off than putting it against the bottle opening.</li>
      <li>The bottles are bigger than I expected, and feel pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t like these types of flip top caps (similarly used on shampoo squeeze bottles), as they will eventually fail over time, the bottle without it will still function fine to dispense small quantities of alcohol.  </li>
      <li>A couple of pushes will dispense approximately 1 milliliter of fluid, which isn&#x27;t very much but just enough to wet a cotton ball or folded KimWipe, say, to clean an injection wound or solder joint.  </li>

    <li> Intended for use with acetone and was a little skeptical because it was labeled &amp;#34;alcohol.&amp;#34; No problems however,  the plastic did not melt when acetone was stored. I shook the bottle and let it stand on its side for 5 minutes for spillage check and found no trace of liquid.  This sucker&#x27;s sealed! I&#x27;m worried about how long the cap will stay on since the structure of its attachment looks weak but I guess I&#x27;ll get to that if/when it comes to that. It will not however compromise it&#x27;s purpose cap or no cap.</li>
    <li> This is very handy for making sterile pads and compresses.</li>
    <li> I use one for regular nail polish remover and one for pure acetone. So much easier using the pump dispenser than a bottle, especially when you just want to do one nail. They work just fine and have made doing my nails easier. Very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. I needed some for Hydrogen Peroxide and therefore had to cover the bottle to keep the light out. They should offer a brown bottle version as well.</li>
    <li> Love these little pump. Just what I wanted. Makes it very easy to pump up just the amount that you need.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it does what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I needed.  I actually needed two alcohol dispensers, but since the word is simply embossed on the bottle, you could use one for makeup or nail polish remover.  I have actually traveled with one of these in a zip-lock bag and it did not spill at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these dispensers for over a year and they are awesome! I use one for nail polish remover and another for eye makeup remover. They will leak if you place them on their side so make sure they are standing straight up if they are full of liquid.</li>
    <li> I bought these dispensers for use of other liquids (make up remover and toner).  They were easy to fill, clean, and use.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size and pump doesn&#x27;t splash when you use it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used anything similar before, I bought this because I was a bit fascinated with the idea of a pump dispenser. I think it&#x27;s very efficient, so far I have not had any problems with acetone evaporating com it so it is safe to say that it&#x27;s tight and won&#x27;t spill your liquids. It has &#x27;alcohol&#x27; embossed on it but you could say it is transparent and it doesn&#x27;t matter really what you put in it!</li>
    <li> The item is exactly like the product promised in the picture. I find them extremely useful and less messy when doing nail art!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, convenient, and makes me feel like a nail technician. The only complaint is that after several uses one of them started to have problems closing and some spilling will occur if tilted. The other one is still in perfect condition, though.</li>
    <li> These work great, I put 99% alcohol in one and acetone in the other. So much simpler to get a paper towel corner wet for wiping something off than putting it against the bottle opening. I use far less solvent this way.</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for. I bought them for personal use, so I use it once a week for my nails, works perfectly... so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using one of these bottles for several months now and have had a great experience with them. I use it for a home-made TendSkin liquid, I have had no clogging or leaking issues at all, and it pumps the liquid to the top easily and consistently. I was concerned about the alcohol possibly evaporating, but it absolutely has not. Great product.</li>
    <li> got a pack of 2 so I could use 1 for nail polish remover and 1 for witch hazel for my face.  they work well.  can&#x27;t say how long they will last cause I have had them only a short while but they are working good right now.</li>
    <li> I bought a double set of these. I used one for the first time last night and it works great. Much larger then I had thought from online pic&#x27;s. But that&#x27;s not a complaint. I love my nail art and this makes it so easy to use my polish remover and acetone while I am working on my nails.</li>
    <li> I have traveled with these a few times already (filled with witch hazel) The pump works well and they did not leak. I did have them in a case that was not pver packed so there wasn&#x27;t a lot of pressure on them. I assume that might matter. Anyway, I really like these for my toner and use with cotton pads. I wish there wasn&#x27;t something preinted on the side, but it doesn&#x27;t matter as this is for personal use for me and I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> Be careful about tilting, it does leak everywhere</li>
    <li> I like the idea of these pumps, but these were pretty cheap. The protective lid on one broke off, the other hasn&#x27;t been used yet. The first couple of pumps were very nice. Since then, it has taken a few pumps to get up liquid.</li>
    <li> Shipping was SO fast! I love the bottles. I love the flip top and then the pump. I read some reviews about the the ones that twist to lock and people were complaining so I&#x27;m SO happy I found these. I use these for eye makeup remover and skin toner in my Pro MUA kit. The bottles come with alcohol engraved on both sides so labeling is a must even if the color of the contents are different. The bottles are plastic yes and I was expecting it to be very flimsy but that isn&#x27;t the case. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these little bottles. And they fit perfectly in my train case.</li>
    <li> So far they work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ended up using for alcohol and they work great and makes my job much easier then with the other fiber cleaners i have used in the past.</li>
    <li> The bottle itself is actually quite stiff, although still flexible. It just takes quite a bit of effort to squeeze. it&#x27;s not what you would think of as a squeezable bottle.  The cap seems durable enough. The fliptop lid snaps into place and is neither too hard or two easy to operate.  Just right for this particular purpose, which is quick access to some readily available alcohol.  The hinge is plastic so it&#x27;s highly doubtful the hinge will last forever. Nevertheless FWIW, I think it&#x27;s fine.  While I don&#x27;t like these types of flip top caps (similarly used on shampoo squeeze bottles), as they will eventually fail over time, the bottle without it will still function fine to dispense small quantities of alcohol.  Speaking of which, the concaved button is firmer than I&#x27;m used to but works fine.  A couple of pushes will dispense approximately 1 milliliter of fluid, which isn&#x27;t very much but just enough to wet a cotton ball or folded KimWipe, say, to clean an injection wound or solder joint.  Pumping is easy so long as you keep the hole covered entirely with your swath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very happy with these bottles.  They weren&#x27;t super thin cheap plastic as I was expecting. They are surprisingly durable and I plan to buy more for other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that the bottle itself is quite light, so you&#x27;ll want to keep it filled to give it some substance so it stays in place as you use it.  That&#x27;s the advantage of a glass &amp; SS pump dispenser, along with the larger pump volume.  But those ones are about 3 times as expensive, just for one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had my way, I would have preferred a freer-flowing loosey-goosey pump button (similar to the large metal dispensers), but for the price, you really couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  I also would have preferred the embossed writing to be easier to read, but that&#x27;s easily corrected with a label or marker.</li>
    <li> Bottles are great no complaints... wish I had more. Plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I got this to use for my eye makeup remover. The bottles are bigger than I expected, and feel pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> The lids are a bit flimsy. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This works well for what I purchased it for I am a sleep tech and use alcohol to clean areas where leads are place the the wipes I go through so many so this along with gauges works well</li>
    <li> perfect for my toner and nail polish remover</li>
    <li> Works great looks great</li>
