      <li>LOVE!!!!  </li>
      <li>Fekkai products are very good.  </li>
      <li>a great hold!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
      <li>not sticky holds great all day.</li>
      <li>but it holds and gives body and makes my wavy hair look great.</li>
      <li>THis is a great hair spray.  </li>
      <li>It smells so drop-dead gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Their hair spray is good but still has a stickiness in my humid weather.</li>
      <li>Its a good hairspray.</li>
      <li>Shipped on time and all is good.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t replace my Sebastian hair spray but is a nice lighter alternative on days when I don&#x27;t need a superior hold.</li>
      <li>Great for fine hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great light hair spray works well</li>
      <li>Nice hold but not sticky or helmet</li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice, as well.</li>
      <li>Has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>The product itself is very good and right for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I like the way this spray dries quickly and provides flexible, lightweight, great hold.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>repeat buyer and generally buy 6 at a time just because it&#x27;s the best product like this I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try a slightly more high-end hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>,it doesn&#x27;t make you hair sticky &amp; it looks healthy</li>
      <li>I have tried many.  </li>
      <li>Frederick Fekkai&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for dry/colored hair (looks pink/peach color product bottle) is also phenomenal.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I Love this hair spray, but it would be a lot better if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great hair spray, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Lives hair looking natural.</li>
      <li>This hairspray Smells Great, holds great and does not get hard and crunchy .</li>
      <li>It also brushes out easy.  </li>
      <li>I love this hairspray it has a soft feel, a good smell, not sticky and</li>
      <li>Perfect hold not super sticky.</li>
      <li>Fekkai hair spray gives my fine straight hair body and luster.  </li>
      <li>I just lift my roots on the top of my head with my fingers, let it go, and then spray the fine mist about three inches above it.</li>
      <li>The spray is more of a fine mist with a nice, subtle scent.</li>
      <li>The hold is somehow light, yet strong at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I hope they do not decide to discontinue making it, since I have had problems in the past with things I love becoming unavailable!</li>
      <li>I got this because I had purchased a little travel size one at a department store, and I straight-up loved the way it smells.</li>
      <li>It seems like it holds very lightly at first</li>
      <li>so I certainly needed something that would add some moisture while holding the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What I like about this hairspray is that it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to create the hold I like.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping...</li>
      <li>Smells good, but not for thick hair.</li>
      <li>Fekkai Sheer Hold can be found reasonably-priced on the internet and it is far and away better than any drugstore and many other department store hairsprays.</li>
      <li>Great and light but too expensive!</li>
      <li>I like semi-big hair to give me a little height on top</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the Fekkai does not dry my hair out like many of the other better brands, it doesn&#x27;t hold the style for long and definitely does not warrant the VERY high price.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it holds and gives lift to my hair without being heavy.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price and goes a long way.</li>
      <li>By the way, the sprayer on the 1.5 oz. can works fine but too costly for everyday use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not stiff</li>
      <li>Not heavy or tacky, but holds all day.  </li>
      <li>I really like this sheer hold hair spray -</li>
      <li>One problem has developed --- There has been a consistent problem with the functionality of the sprayer with the last several cans I have purchased.  </li>
      <li>Hair feels soft even the next day.</li>

<li> Hair feels soft even the next day.</li>

<li> And again, it looks natural and a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> but then you notice your hair stays the way you started out for a long time.</li>

<li> Or long locks.</li>
<li> I would NOT spend $25 on this or any other hair spray of this size in the future!!!</li>
<li> I had also tried other brands but all those seemed to dry my hair out also .  </li>
<li> I was skeptical when I first bought this</li>
<li> Not for thick coarse horse hair like mine.</li>
<li> The new product is such a disappointment.</li>
<li> Can be sprayed often without weighing it down.</li>
<li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy perfume odor.</li>
<li> it holds well without being overly stiff.  </li>
<li> I used Kenra in the past and it was too crunchy for my tastes.</li>
<li> and I have a hard time with my bangs not &amp;#34;falling&amp;#34; after about 30 minutes.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive but it works extremely well..</li>
<li> Maybe for thin hair.</li>
<li> Too expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used it for years. I don&#x27;t use anything else. Perfect hold not super sticky. Love it. Hair feels soft even the next day. No residue feeling.</li>
    <li> I like the way this spray dries quickly and provides flexible, lightweight, great hold.  I used to use Halo, and this is the only spray I have found that is comparable.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray it has a soft feel, a good smell, not sticky and a great hold!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I really like this sheer hold hair spray - it holds well without being overly stiff.  It also brushes out easy.  No complaints - I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> The product itself is very good and right for my hair.  I have used it for quite a long time.  One problem has developed --- There has been a consistent problem with the functionality of the sprayer with the last several cans I have purchased.  I will look for another product that works for me if this continues.  By the way, the sprayer on the 1.5 oz. can works fine but too costly for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This holding spray is the only one I have used for a number of years, and I will continue to do so. I hope they do not decide to discontinue making it, since I have had problems in the past with things I love becoming unavailable!</li>
    <li> I like the Fekkai products, so decided to give the spray a try.  I like it. It holds well, does not make my hair look like a helmut, and brushes out well.</li>
    <li> What I like about this hairspray is that it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to create the hold I like.  I like semi-big hair to give me a little height on top and this does the trick without showing any residual goo.  I just lift my roots on the top of my head with my fingers, let it go, and then spray the fine mist about three inches above it. Unless you are exposed to a lot of wind, this will keep all day.  And again, it looks natural and a little goes a long way.  The fragrance is nice, as well. Frederick Fekkai&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for dry/colored hair (looks pink/peach color product bottle) is also phenomenal.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairspray and I have tried many.  Not heavy or tacky, but holds all day.  Definitely worth the price and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> repeat buyer and generally buy 6 at a time just because it&#x27;s the best product like this I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s expensive but it works extremely well..</li>
    <li> Not for thick coarse horse hair like mine. Maybe for thin hair. Smells good, but not for thick hair. Or long locks.</li>
    <li> The spray is more of a fine mist with a nice, subtle scent. The hold is somehow light, yet strong at the same time.  I must have this hairspray in my life forever!</li>
    <li> Great and light but too expensive!</li>
    <li> Fekkai products are very good.  Their hair spray is good but still has a stickiness in my humid weather. (Texas)</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair. not sticky holds great all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great light hair spray works well and you can still brush your hair it&#x27;s not stiff</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I Love this hair spray, but it would be a lot better if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive,&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying it though,it doesn&#x27;t make you hair sticky &amp; it looks healthy</li>
    <li> Nice hold but not sticky or helmet like.  I would recommend. I used Kenra in the past and it was too crunchy for my tastes.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product!  I tried every hairspray at the drug store, but not a one would truly keep my hair in place.  I decided to try a slightly more high-end hairspray.  Fekkai Sheer Hold can be found reasonably-priced on the internet and it is far and away better than any drugstore and many other department store hairsprays.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping...Quality item</li>
    <li> I got this because I had purchased a little travel size one at a department store, and I straight-up loved the way it smells. I can&#x27;t even tell you if it performs well or not. It smells so drop-dead gorgeous. I don&#x27;t think anybody notices or cares except me.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and all is good.</li>
    <li> Fekkai hair spray gives my fine straight hair body and luster.  It allows me to brush my hair, keeping the shape.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy perfume odor.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first bought this but I have now redordered and will order again. I love the way it holds and gives lift to my hair without being heavy. It seems like it holds very lightly at first but then you notice your hair stays the way you started out for a long time.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and I have a hard time with my bangs not &amp;#34;falling&amp;#34; after about 30 minutes.  This hairspray works wonders - it holds them in place all day!  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its a good hairspray. Has a nice smell. Too expensive. It doesn&#x27;t replace my Sebastian hair spray but is a nice lighter alternative on days when I don&#x27;t need a superior hold.</li>
    <li> This hairspray Smells Great, holds great and does not get hard and crunchy . Can be sprayed often without weighing it down. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying Fekkai products I had gotten samples of after the salon brand I regularly use seemed to dry my hair out.  I had also tried other brands but all those seemed to dry my hair out also .  I color my hair so I certainly needed something that would add some moisture while holding the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Fekkai does not dry my hair out like many of the other better brands, it doesn&#x27;t hold the style for long and definitely does not warrant the VERY high price.  I would NOT spend $25 on this or any other hair spray of this size in the future!!!</li>
    <li> THis is a great hair spray.  Someone gave me a sample of this at Christmas time.  OMG!!!  LOVE!!!!  Thats why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product but you can&#x27;t get it anymore because they changed it.  The new product is such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Great hair spray, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Lives hair looking natural.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. You can&#x27;t even tell there is hairspray in your hair but it holds and gives body and makes my wavy hair look great.</li>
