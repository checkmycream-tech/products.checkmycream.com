### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used - holds a curl and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
      <li>even with the best eye makeup removal products out there-</li>
      <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
      <li>My search for the perfect mascara is over!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and then recurl for best results.</li>
      <li>Perfect for dewy skinned gals like me!</li>
      <li>This mascara is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I saw an awesome review on YouTube and wanted to give it a try.</li>
      <li>others have said, it&#x27;s awesome at holding a curl all day.</li>
      <li>The mascara itself feels really nice and the packaging was perfect.</li>
      <li>Looks really great on...</li>
      <li>Like what everyone said before me-if you have hard-to-curl (or stay-curly) lashes, this is great for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I came across this product.</li>
      <li>Amazing mascara!</li>
      <li>and this mascara is amazing!</li>
      <li>which is good ...</li>
      <li>this mascara that was 14 dollars isn&#x27;t nearly as good as a 5 dollar Maybelline mascara..</li>
      <li>I had to buy the brands own special mascara remover( which is wonderful btw) to help take it off completly.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>The first time I used this, I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but I figured out how to angle the brush</li>
      <li>Its amazing.</li>
      <li>its amazing.</li>
      <li>amazing mascara.  </li>
      <li>one  coat lasts all and really looks great!  </li>
      <li>They hold a curl forever and they apply nicely on my lashes.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m fortunate in that I can compare the two and can say that the volume version is a bit clumpier and does not do as good as a job curling the lashes.</li>
      <li>Now with the clear mascara it takes a fraction of the time it used to and the curl is perfect.  </li>
      <li>May not all come off even after a thorough clean, the staying power is that good.</li>
      <li>This mascara did a perfect job applying and grabbing my thin bottom lashes perfectly without any smudging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Before applying mascara, make sure to wipe most of the product off onto the edge of the tube.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more items in their product line.</li>
      <li>Much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>However, this stuff WILL maintain the curl hours after application and stay on regardless of how many times you&#x27;ve cried/jumped into the ocean/got stuck in the rain, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Better than my mother Dior and Estée Lauder &#x27;re mascaras.</li>
      <li>This is seriously my favorite mascara ever.</li>
      <li>Will order more for sure.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>After, you can apply as many coats</li>
      <li>the more I use it.</li>
      <li>Also, he suggested that you use a waterproof mascara because they tend to contain more wax that helps to hold the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Omg love this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I like how it applies smoothly!</li>
      <li>More</li>
      <li>Mostly because i&#x27;m inept and can&#x27;t apply mascara without making it clump.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Clean Artiste waterproof makeup remover works fantastically well for this Isehan waterproof mascara!  </li>
      <li>I got this mascara because I saw someone get magical massive beautiful lashes because of this on a reddit thread.</li>
      <li>you really need a good makeup remover though.  </li>
      <li>it wipes right off!!</li>
      <li>After doing more research on waterproof makeup removers, I decided to give L&#x27;Oreal Clean Artiste Eye Makeup Remover - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LFQ0ME/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i00 - a try.  </li>
      <li>but it removes easily with an oil based remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>It stays in place all day but still comes off fairly easily with the coconut oil that I use to clean my face each evening.</li>
      <li>I also switched to a Japonesque Power Curl eyelash curler - http://www.amazon.com/Japonesque-Power-Curl-Eyelash-Curler/dp/B002UXRDPA - which is a fantastic beauty implement</li>
      <li>Great for my short lashes.</li>
      <li>I very rarely repurchase a mascara</li>
      <li>Unique mascara.  </li>
      <li>Very good mascara, glossy black</li>
      <li>HAVE to use eye makeup remover to clean.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a special makeup remover for it, but I don&#x27;t have it</li>
      <li>I already used jojoba oil regularly, and I found that it does a good job in removing this mascara.</li>
      <li>NOT* coming off without either a good makeup remover or facial oil.  </li>
      <li>its just ok and very thing</li>
      <li>My eyelashes didn&#x27;t really curl up but the mascara is definitely better quality then ones I have used before.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly which retains the curl.</li>
      <li>It is a bit hard to remove, make sure you have good makeup</li>
      <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
      <li>It takes some maneuvering and prep work to not over apply but the end results are totally worth it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m writing this review because it&#x27;s worth writing about.</li>
      <li>And, if I didn&#x27;t have the right mascara, they&#x27;d straighten out immediately after application.  </li>
      <li>This was the first mascara I&#x27;d ever used that I actually liked and defined my eyelashes and made me think i might actually like mascara!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order a few more :)</li>
      <li>But so far, easy to take off.</li>
      <li>That aside, this mascara is fantastic in giving your lashes that extra boost and is smudge free.</li>
      <li>but I personally use baby oil and it works just fine!</li>
      <li>I started searching for foreign made waterproof mascara and found this one had pretty good reviews and a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so in love  with this product definitely ordering.</li>
      <li>love how the bristles grabs on to every lash possible.</li>
      <li>This is my first review on amazon</li>
      <li>With this, I can curl first, put on the mascara</li>
      <li>While my lashes are hopeless and will never be massive, I still love this mascara because once it dries, it is *</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about it is that I can put it on in the morning, go about my day, go to bed, wake up, and have NO smudges, NO flakes and NO irritation from it getting into my eyes, which means I can put it on only every couple of days.</li>
      <li>Pretty much waterproof.</li>
      <li>It makes my lashes so long and with two or more coats it starts to give me volume.</li>
      <li>I love the thinness of the formulation, but it wasn&#x27;t long before it started clumping.</li>
      <li>whenever I use it, my eyes feel so dry which also hinders me from using it more.</li>
      <li>and it certainly delivers in holding the curl.</li>
      <li>I look like a panda by the time I&#x27;m ready to wipe off the oil/mascara mixture with micellar water.</li>
      <li>It really is waterproof and as an added bonus it curls my lashes, too?</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re so stubborn, it used to take a whole 20 minutes out of my makeup routine just to curl them and apply mascara.  </li>
      <li>However I cannot complain too much at this discounted price.</li>
      <li>This works like gel on hair and really helps to set the curl.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I just apply a bit of the remover onto a cotton ball, hold it onto my eye for about 15 seconds, and then gently wipe off my eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>and it really does keep them up nd curled.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had good experiences with most Japanese mascaras, but this one wasn&#x27;t particularly smudge-proof; I still had to use eye primer to prevent panda eyes, but the whole purpose of wanting to pay the extra money for a Japanese mascara was so that I would not have to also use primer.</li>
      <li>Like the really hard to remove waterproof mascara that most of us are familiar with.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t flake off like a lot of other mascaras.</li>
      <li>Making sure my lashes are dry, I then apply 2 coats of clear mascara.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its amazing. Love it. Will order more for sure.</li>
    <li> I was getting really frustrated trying to find truly waterproof mascara as it seems most have been taken off the market. The new generation of USA mascaras may claim to be waterproof but my constantly watering eyes and I beg to differ. I started searching for foreign made waterproof mascara and found this one had pretty good reviews and a reasonable price. Finally! It really is waterproof and as an added bonus it curls my lashes, too? It stays in place all day but still comes off fairly easily with the coconut oil that I use to clean my face each evening. If I had one complaint it would be that I don&#x27;t care for the stubby mascara wand but I started using disposable wands years ago so that&#x27;s not an issue for me. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more items in their product line.</li>
    <li> Amazing mascara! Some others said it didn&#x27;t curl their lashes... it doesn&#x27;t CURL them, it holds curl. So you have to curl them beforehand. If you do that you WILL definitely have curled lashes that stay that way. My lashes are pretty long but heavy mascaras weight them down and the curl comes out of them quickly. With this stuff? All day curl. It is tough to get off, but that&#x27;s with any waterproof mascara. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it and I am repurchasing! I very rarely repurchase a mascara and I am a makeup artist so that says a lot.</li>
    <li> Omg love this I literally just got this not even 20 min ago and I had to try it rite away I&#x27;m a big person when it comes to mascara and normally I have to put so many coats on just so they will look thick and curly not with this I&#x27;m so in love  with this product definitely ordering. More</li>
    <li> I HATE mascara. I abhor it. I detest it. Mostly because i&#x27;m inept and can&#x27;t apply mascara without making it clump. This was the first mascara I&#x27;d ever used that I actually liked and defined my eyelashes and made me think i might actually like mascara! It&#x27;s pretty amazing. but you do need an oil-based makeup remover to get it off - use DHC!!</li>
    <li> It lasts all day and curves your lash well. It is kinda hard to remove at the end of the day though.</li>
    <li> Looks really great on...Can&#x27;t remove entirely...It is impossible to remove all of this mascara from your eyelashes...even with the best eye makeup removal products out there- like Shiseido&#x27;s. I really do not like this feature because not removing makeup before sleeping will lead to aging your skin and clogging the pores. The mascara will smudge around your eye skin as you rub to remove it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; Mascara instead. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the quest for a volumizing mascara that will hold its form until the end of the day without any smudge. I&#x27;m so happy that I came across this product. This is my first review on amazon and I&#x27;m writing this review because it&#x27;s worth writing about. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the bristles grabs on to every lash possible. Due to the thinness and scarcity of my lower lashes, I rarely ever do them since the brush tends to smudge and smear against my bottom lids. This mascara did a perfect job applying and grabbing my thin bottom lashes perfectly without any smudging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japanese girls know what&#x27;s up with them mascaras. I am an instant fan.</li>
    <li> this mascara that was 14 dollars isn&#x27;t nearly as good as a 5 dollar Maybelline mascara.. its just ok and very thing.. it gives a decent curl though.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara because I saw someone get magical massive beautiful lashes because of this on a reddit thread. While my lashes are hopeless and will never be massive, I still love this mascara because once it dries, it is *NOT* coming off without either a good makeup remover or facial oil.  All mascaras flake to some degree on my eyes and eventually cause slight black smudges on my lower outer eye. I still have that with this mascara but it is the least problematic there. I already used jojoba oil regularly, and I found that it does a good job in removing this mascara.</li>
    <li> It does what a waterproof mascara does :) no more, no less</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this mascara I&#x27;ve received mine today and it was squashed I&#x27;ve wasted $ 13.00 on this mascara I&#x27;m extremely upset the packaging was muddy it looked like it got squashed by a car so don&#x27;t buy this mascara such a waste and so disappointing</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> The brush is small enough to get the tiny lashes that most brushes miss.  The first time I used this, I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but I figured out how to angle the brush and this mascara is amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the thinness of the formulation, but it wasn&#x27;t long before it started clumping. Still happier with this than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> The mascara itself feels really nice and the packaging was perfect. My eyelashes didn&#x27;t really curl up but the mascara is definitely better quality then ones I have used before.</li>
    <li> This product is waterproof so I won&#x27;t be using it every day as my Bioderma won&#x27;t remove it but it removes easily with an oil based remover. After it dries on the lashes it stays put without flaking. Wonderful product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Being Asian its very hard to keep my eyelashes curled with any kind of mascara. When I found out about this product I was skeptical but after using it.. I absolutely love it! It keeps your lashes curled all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge and is water proof.</li>
    <li> My HG, Ive bought this maybe 8-9 times now..</li>
    <li> My wife likes it!  My wife may keep continue to order and use this items.  But I feel like price is little bit hight.</li>
    <li> The only reason I knocked a star off is because of how difficult it is to remove LOL even with mac cleanse off oil! AND because I can&#x27;t stand the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hard to curl lashes and I usually always wear waterproof because of that. This mascara lasts all day and is a drier formula. As you put it on- it goes from nothing to VA VA VOOM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a makeup artist,&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of gratis to try different things and nothing comes close to this mascara. It makes my lashes so long and with two or more coats it starts to give me volume. It doesn&#x27;t flake and it doesn&#x27;t lose my curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this mascara!!</li>
    <li> its similarish to benefit lashem but its not a miracle product for my asian lashes. i use it mainly on my bottom lashes (i then do a second coat using maybelline falsies) and sometimes on my top but rarely...it doesn&#x27;t run at all and is very dry which is good ...its like its waterproof without being it impossible to take off with a makeup remover wipe</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that really holds the curl and lasts all day with minimal flaking. My only complaint would be that the formula is a bit runny so a lot of the product ends up on the brush. It takes some maneuvering and prep work to not over apply but the end results are totally worth it.</li>
    <li> lengthens and volumizes without clumping or smearing throughout the day</li>
    <li> It curls well, doesn&#x27;t smudge, lengthens and volumizes a bit. the only problem is it makes my lashes so stiff. But that&#x27;s probably the price you pay by curls some straight asian eyelashes</li>
    <li> This is seriously my favorite mascara ever. It&#x27;s blacker than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s EXTREMELY waterproof. You can go to the beach with it without worrying about it coming off. You can cry your eyes out and you&#x27;ll still look like you did when you put it on. I love that it doesn&#x27;t flake off like a lot of other mascaras. Even if they claim to be waterproof, they&#x27;re not flake-proof, and I still find myself picking off little black flakes from under my eyes at the end of the day.My favorite thing about it is that I can put it on in the morning, go about my day, go to bed, wake up, and have NO smudges, NO flakes and NO irritation from it getting into my eyes, which means I can put it on only every couple of days. I take it off eventually but I usually only wear mascara so I don&#x27;t even bother taking it off at night. The only &amp;#34;downside&amp;#34; to all this is that it&#x27;s quite hard to take off. There&#x27;s a special makeup remover for it, but I don&#x27;t have it so I use a cleansing oil or whatever other oil I have lying around and micellar water to take it off. The trick is to let the oil sit on your lashes for a couple of minutes before you try to rub it off. I look like a panda by the time I&#x27;m ready to wipe off the oil/mascara mixture with micellar water. But hey, it works, and it&#x27;s not too bad a price to pay for a mascara with this kind of staying power.&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, it&#x27;s awesome at holding a curl all day. The only other potential problem is that it can get a little clumpy if you&#x27;re not careful, but that&#x27;s easily solved by brushing your lashes through with a lash comb.</li>
    <li> Hard to remove, but resists water and oil.</li>
    <li> amazing mascara.  lengthens and curl stays (after you use an eyelash curler). you really need a good makeup remover though.  This stuff does not rub off or flake.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this mascara not knowing that it is waterproof. Like the really hard to remove waterproof mascara that most of us are familiar with. I assumed it was similar in formula to my other fav japanese mascara brands like DHC and Canmake, but no it isn&#x27;t the same. Also, I do not know how to read in japanese. So yes, that is clearly my fault. But I do like the mascara. It darkens my lashes and slightly keeps its curl. I had to buy the brands own special mascara remover( which is wonderful btw) to help take it off completly. I will not be repurchasing this mascara again.</li>
    <li> I have puny eyelashes. Most mascaras weigh them down even after curling. This mascara is AMAZING!!! It doesn&#x27;t have fumes that irritate my eyes. It dries quickly which retains the curl. It lengthens them without looking spidery or goopey. I highly recommend purchasing the mascara remover too. Once you apply this mascara, it stays put!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pain to remove but it does work....just not worth the hassle of cleaning out every tiny remnants that clings to your lashes.</li>
    <li> I like how it applies smoothly!</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I tried so far which could hold my monolid eyes without fail. But there is only one drawback for me, whenever I use it, my eyes feel so dry which also hinders me from using it more. Try it, maybe you will feel different.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. stays on but didn&#x27;t make my lashes that long or thick.</li>
    <li> I am Asian and I have very straight lashes and use a lash curler daily. With this, I can curl first, put on the mascara and it really does keep them up nd curled.  I would suggest curl before applying, let dry a little bit and then recurl for best results. I will put another review when tried and tested through long days. But so far, easy to take off. It is a little clumpy and I need to see how the smear factor tests out.</li>
    <li> The product itself works wonders. Like what everyone said before me-if you have hard-to-curl (or stay-curly) lashes, this is great for you. It freezes your lashes without a stiff clumpy feeling and makes them stay curly for at least 6 hours. Also it really volumizes your lashes at least 1.5 times. I have natural long lashes and this only made them thicker and fuller. It is a bit hard to remove, make sure you have good makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this a 3 star is because the package itself came without any sign that it was new or unused. I am skeptical of the state of the item I received because neither its plastic case nor the cap to the mascara tube was sealed, meaning anyone could have totally used it, put it back and mailed it to me. However I cannot complain too much at this discounted price. But I will likely order my second tube from Amazon instead, to insure the quality and state of my product.</li>
    <li> Pretty much waterproof. Difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Very good mascara, glossy black and it certainly delivers in holding the curl. May not all come off even after a thorough clean, the staying power is that good.</li>
    <li> I found this in Japan while visiting my grandmother and I have got to say... This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!! I have thin, straight lashes, and this stuff works absolute wonders! Unlike other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, this stuff makes my lashes look fake, but in the most natural way possible. No more weird triangle lashes cos they all stick together, and no more crazy fiber lashes either. The only downsides to it is that you can&#x27;t curl your lashes after you&#x27;ve applied it since it gets suuuuper sticky, and it&#x27;s pretty hard to remove without eye makeup remover. However, this stuff WILL maintain the curl hours after application and stay on regardless of how many times you&#x27;ve cried/jumped into the ocean/got stuck in the rain, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another mascara ever again.</li>
    <li> Better than my mother Dior and Estée Lauder &#x27;re mascaras. I can keep the make up while day. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Unique mascara.  Can&#x27;t find in California stores.  I&#x27;m liking it the more I use it. I saw an awesome review on YouTube and wanted to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Very thin formula left my eyelashes looking spider-y.  Didn&#x27;t add that much length and definitely did not add volume.  The search continues....</li>
    <li> I will never buy drugstore mascara again....this mascara hold a curl, separates, doesn&#x27;t smudge...its amazing. Difficult to remove but i found that if you put Nivea Lotion on your lashes for about 5 minutes....it wipes right off!!</li>
    <li> This is my only mascara since I tried it! Great for my short lashes. It makes my lashes long, volume and curl all day.</li>
    <li> I like how this mascara thickens, lengthens, and curls the lashes but I hate how it sheds off my lashes to my under eye area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had good experiences with most Japanese mascaras, but this one wasn&#x27;t particularly smudge-proof; I still had to use eye primer to prevent panda eyes, but the whole purpose of wanting to pay the extra money for a Japanese mascara was so that I would not have to also use primer.</li>
    <li> the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used - holds a curl and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I&#x27;m going to order a few more :)</li>
    <li> So I bought this mascara after hearing some people rave about the long and curl version&#x27;s hold. Man. These *do not* come off. I was so relieved because I bought them just so they would stay on my asian lashes while I&#x27;m at the beach + water park. They hold a curl forever and they apply nicely on my lashes. You will need to use a cleanser to get rid of the mascara but I personally use baby oil and it works just fine!</li>
    <li> I am Asian. I have stubby lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several brand mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;This actually works well compare to mascara that lot of people recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I have is it is hard to wash later.&lt;br /&gt;You HAVE to use eye makeup remover to clean.</li>
    <li> one  coat lasts all and really looks great!  Only issue is that it is a royal pain to get off! I might get the remover next time!</li>
    <li> Had I not tried the Long and Curl version of this mascara I would&#x27;ve given this on five stars without hesitation. However, I&#x27;m fortunate in that I can compare the two and can say that the volume version is a bit clumpier and does not do as good as a job curling the lashes. That aside, this mascara is fantastic in giving your lashes that extra boost and is smudge free. Perfect for dewy skinned gals like me!</li>
    <li> For those of you who have resistant, hard to curl lashes that straighten out the minute you apply mascara, this is the product for you!  A little bit about me:  Being Asian, I have very hard to curl lashes that grow straight down.  They&#x27;re so stubborn, it used to take a whole 20 minutes out of my makeup routine just to curl them and apply mascara.  And, if I didn&#x27;t have the right mascara, they&#x27;d straighten out immediately after application.  So frustrating!  After doing a lot of research, I found that with lashes like mine I needed to use waterproof mascara to help set the curl.  I spent a lot of money on product after product, because not all waterproof mascaras are made the same, yet I still encountered the same problems with most of them.  Finally, I thought I had settled on one drugstore product, but with this summer&#x27;s heat and humidity, it wasn&#x27;t doing the trick anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to remedy the problem, I set out to extensively research my options.  A few fantastic bits of advice came from a makeup artist on Youtube.  He suggested a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Using an oil-free makeup remover, brush gently onto the lashes with a Q-tip and let dry for a few minutes.  Apparently hard to curl lashes are often oily, which makes them resistant to curling.&lt;br /&gt;- Apply 1 or 2 coats of clear mascara, making sure to allow each coat to dry.  Any brand will do.  This works like gel on hair and really helps to set the curl.&lt;br /&gt;- Then curl your lashes at the base, midway and then close to the tips.&lt;br /&gt;- Before applying mascara, make sure to wipe most of the product off onto the edge of the tube.  You want the least amount of mascara left on the brush as possible.  Then apply a thin coat and allow this to dry.  After, you can apply as many coats as you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also recommends that you avoid watery mascaras because just like hair that has just been curled with a curling iron, if you apply water (watery mascara), the curl will just straighten rightback out.  Also, he suggested that you use a waterproof mascara because they tend to contain more wax that helps to hold the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, since I usually wash my face before applying makeup, I&#x27;ve found that I can skip the oil-free makeup remover step.  Making sure my lashes are dry, I then apply 2 coats of clear mascara.  Once this is dry, curling is a breeze.  In the past I had to curl, curl and curl some more.  Now with the clear mascara it takes a fraction of the time it used to and the curl is perfect.  I also switched to a Japonesque Power Curl eyelash curler - http://www.amazon.com/Japonesque-Power-Curl-Eyelash-Curler/dp/B002UXRDPA - which is a fantastic beauty implement I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of my research, I found that there were many other Asian women dealing with the same hard to curl lash problem I was.  This Isehan Kiss Me Heroine Volume &amp; Curl Mascara came highly recommended as their holy grail product, and I have to say that I completely agree!  Although the texture of this mascara is very similar to products I&#x27;ve used in the past that didn&#x27;t work (made my lashes straighten out), this stuff totally keeps the curl intact.  My search for the perfect mascara is over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only tiny drawback is that it&#x27;s not the easiest mascara to remove, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay to have full, lush, dark lashes that stay curled no matter how hot and humid it is.  I usually use coconut oil or Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream to remove my makeup. The cold cream seems to be more efficient at removing this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10-18-2012&lt;br /&gt;ETA - After doing more research on waterproof makeup removers, I decided to give L&#x27;Oreal Clean Artiste Eye Makeup Remover - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LFQ0ME/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i00 - a try.  The one I bought is specifically for waterproof makeup removal.  They also make a remover for waterproof and long wearing makeup, but since I haven&#x27;t tried that one I can&#x27;t really comment on its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean Artiste waterproof makeup remover works fantastically well for this Isehan waterproof mascara!  Much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I just apply a bit of the remover onto a cotton ball, hold it onto my eye for about 15 seconds, and then gently wipe off my eye makeup.  Removal is very quick and thorough with minimal tugging.  Something I was concerned about with other removers.</li>
