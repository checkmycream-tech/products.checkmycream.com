    <li> excellent for crowns!</li>
    <li> This is a little on the pricey side for tooth paste at a little over 10.00 a tube but well worth it. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months and lightened my teeth a full shade. Great for sensitive teeth as I haven&#x27;t had any problem with sensitivity since I started using it. If you every use whitening on your teeth only to have your teeth ache, try this stuff for relief.</li>
    <li> Have been using Brite Smile Toothpaste over 4 years. It really keeps my teeth pearly white and my 2 1/2 year old daughter loves the taste. Which is great because her teeth look amazing as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 8 years. It has a good taste and keeps my teeth whiter than they would be due to my cigar smoking and wine tasting.</li>
    <li> Product does the trick! Delivery is always prompt!</li>
    <li> One of the best on the market!</li>
    <li> I use BriteSmile Whitening Toothpaste every day at least twice.  Have for maybe 5 years.  It really helps keep the yellow down.  I have not found anything off the shelf to compare.</li>

    <li> Whitens and cleans. Expensive but worth the money.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe this is out of stock, as well as the mouth rinse.  Both are superb products.</li>
    <li> This product is non-irritating, good-tasting and does a good job of making pearlies pearly without hydrogen peroxide.  The price has skyrocketed over the past few years, however.  Maybe that&#x27;s thanks to Carrie Underwood&#x27;s endorsement?  While Carrie keeps her BriteSmile, I went to the drugstore to buy some Crest.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Gets your teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;I interchange this toothpaste with regular toothpaste. Morning is the only time I use it. At night I use regular toothpaste. This toothpaste has worked well for whitening only. Still need to use regular toothpaste for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Did brighten my teeth like I thought it would. I really take care of my teeth. I go and get them checked regularly.</li>
    <li> very popular product. Works fast too.</li>
    <li> I been using this product with my two children for more than a week. And my husband noticed the difference of our smiles...It works and we love fresh menth flavor.</li>
    <li> It was okay. Not work the money; crest whitens my teeth more at half the price. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t whiten as I expected, it is just ok.</li>

    <li> My wife and I did a trial with this toothpaste. We only ordered one tube since it was very expensive for toothpaste. I didn&#x27;t really notice any changes in whitening. We both have a pretty good set of white teeth anyway so I gave it 3 stars. Maybe if you have more stains it is a better toothpaste? Still expensive.</li>
