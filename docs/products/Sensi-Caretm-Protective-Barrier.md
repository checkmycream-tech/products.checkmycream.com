<li> and it was very painful.  </li>

    <li> Have used this product for years for handicapped family, works better than prescribed products for body sores. Recommended by nurse friend.</li>
    <li> Great for stubborn diaper rashes.  Works better than anything else.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BF1FRQ Sensi-Care Protective Barrier Cream - 4 Oz Tube - Each]]  I have had  J-Tube for 15 years and this barrier cream is the most effective in caring for the condition of the skin around the tube site.  I would not even consider changing products since I found this one.  The Doctors at University Hospital in Ann Arbor Michigan introduced me to this product.  Please pass my appreciaton along to the manufacturers.  G. Stevens, Flint Mi</li>
    <li> My son was in the NICU for a week when he was born.  When they put him on formula (versus donor milk) he had a bad reaction (diarrhea) that left his little bottom raw and sore.  The hospital used this on him and it cleared it right up.  It is thick so it won&#x27;t rub on on the diaper and protects from wetness.  It also has an ingredient that helps heal diaper rash faster.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> best diaper cream for serious rashes!</li>
    <li> Not quite what I wanted, but it worked. My fault.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended  by a nurse in the hospital when our son got diaper rash as a newborn. It is VERY thick, but that provides the coverage needed to protect the skin and allow it to heal. I have recommended this product to everyone with babies and have only received positive feedback.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I use it in my baby&#x27;s diaper area and it works great. Is as good as Desitin but without the strong smell.</li>
    <li> First got this from hospital and have been using it for years, great stuff!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it to sooth burns from radiation. This is the only product that gives her relief. Number 3  is the only one that works. #2 does not work.</li>

My 6 week old daughter had a diaper rash that Desitin, A&amp;D Ointment, Triple Paste, or Calmoseptine could not clear up.  A friend told me about this and that he was given it for his daughter when she was in the NICU.  Willing to try anything, I ordered it.  After just a couple of uses, I could see major improvement and her diaper rash is finally cleared up after almost three weeks!  An added bonus is it is unscented and doesn&#x27;t have the medicinal smell that other creams have.  If you purchase this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>

Try this people and you will never go back to Preparation H.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the skin. If you have a sore on your skin it will help you heal it</li>
    <li> Best barrier cream around!  So happy that I could find this on line.  It was used on my father in the hospital and was effective.</li>
    <li> My LPN daughter suggested I order this for our 91 year old father&#x27;s sore behind.  He had a stage one bed sore and it was very painful.  After the first application it got better and subsequent applications have almost made it non-existent.  We use it everyday - he&#x27;s not complaining about pain but it isn&#x27;t totally cleared up - but certainly better!  I would recommend this to anyone who is advanced in age and can&#x27;t move around too well.  Its primarily used to prevent pressure sores.</li>
    <li> I love it! worked well on patient 96 years old with bed sores.</li>

    <li> Love this product its a little pricey. But they used it with my youngest daughter in the NICU.  It does a great barrier between skin, helps with acid poops. Everything it doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily. I love it!</li>

When you clean, just wipe off the surface material and NOT all the cream down to the skin.  The cteam hardens somewhat and forms a protective shell until any irritated or broken skin heals and pushes it off from underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin care nurse specialists are amazed that i have prevented butt skin breakdown on a bedbound patient for almost 2 years now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for my baby girl&#x27;s diaper rash. It&#x27;s the only thing that really works and isn&#x27;t irritating to her skin. Clears up her rawest rashes in no time :)</li>
