### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>For best results, you will need to apply a generous amount of Hair Milk, allow it 15 minutes to work, and then run a wide-toothed comb through it before shampooing.</li>
      <li>and this seemed like it might be the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>The best way to use it is to put it on your hair about twenty minutes before you wash it.</li>
      <li>It worked so wonderful</li>
      <li>My daughter is bi-racial and I am very happy with this detangler.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the results!</li>
      <li>Hairwashing and combing has been a bit of a chore, which is why this detangler is so great.</li>
      <li>We are having great results, even though we don&#x27;t use it with every shampoo -- which saves a bit of money on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A great find.</li>
      <li>Where I did find this to be a great product was on the Shi Tzu&#x27;s tail,  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this is great stuff</li>
      <li>Pleasant</li>
      <li>has a pleasant smell and does work well, helping keep hair detangled and softens it as well.</li>
      <li>The scent is quite pleasant and summery.</li>
      <li>; That is a good description.</li>
      <li>This product, if used in fairly liberal quantities, seems to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is really good too.</li>
      <li>This Just for Me pre-wash softening detangler works surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect product for days out having fun in the sun without damaging your hair.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;re glad to have found these products!</li>
      <li>handy</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, too.  </li>
      <li>There are many good conditioners on the market</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice product, and it&#x27;s Made in the USA- another plus for me.</li>
      <li>This is a good product if you have hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Getting this product for free through the Vine program has been nice, but the question is, would I pay my own money for it?  </li>
      <li>I liked this product for my fine, thinning hair.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not terribly convenient to use.  </li>
      <li>I sure do.</li>
      <li>I saw the advantage of this product when I shampooed--much better to wash hair that is already detangled than to detangle it as it cleans and conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This, in turn, allows me to have a better chance of applying the conditioner JUST to the ends of my hair, and not getting it on my root area.</li>
      <li>The 20 minutes did provide better results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more jars.)</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The conditioner alone seems sufficient for most tangled hair situations and more routine use.</li>
      <li>When I opened the jar, I loved its fresh, coco-nutty tropical scent.</li>
      <li>Once in the shower, it rinses out nicely and my hair feels smooth</li>
      <li>This is a lovely product with a deeply satisfying scent to it.</li>
      <li>The product itself would get five stars, the product at this price point is more like three stars</li>
      <li>She has fine, curly hair that gets matted and snagged very easily.</li>
      <li>But, I am able to smooth it on very easily</li>
      <li>This is especially wonderful after a day at the beach when your hair is rough as horse hair.  </li>
      <li>My wife said that it worked better than expected-made her hair lightly wavy instead of kinky curled and was easy to change the style she wanted it to be.</li>
      <li>My house is filled with kinky, curly haired critters so my wife and daughter were very excited to be trying this.</li>
      <li>Other than that I feel that this Just For Me product works flawlessly in doing what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
      <li>This is especially true when I have to wash my mane more frequently in the summer, so I welcomed this product.</li>
      <li>It tangles easily, causing damage when I comb it out.</li>
      <li>My hair  tangles easily, and I have a tendency to overuse conditioners in an attempt to avoid tangles.  </li>
      <li>The smell is a bit strong (to me....</li>
      <li>The result, for me, was that I had smooth, shiny hair that was easy to comb without being over conditioned.</li>
      <li>I have waist length hair, fine and prone to snarls.</li>
      <li>I waited 15 minutes then ran my fingers through it (not a comb as recommended, because with fine, easy-to-tangle hair, I get a lot of breakage with a comb).</li>
      <li>Do I want easy to comb, manageable, tangle free hair?</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it sure is nice to be able to comb out their hair more easily.  </li>
      <li>(I need a huge jar please!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can really smell the shea and honey, it’s a nice, light scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost  in love with this product, but let me relate my experiences so you can see if it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>(Available elsewhere for 1/4 the price.</li>
      <li>results are fantastic.</li>
      <li>However, I still want to have nice hair if at all possible, and I still want to be able to use a conditioner without my fine hair becoming oily.</li>
      <li>and it makes her hair nice and soft and so easy to brush.</li>
      <li>The smell of the prewash is sweet and light.</li>
      <li>On the dog,  this is really great,  allowing me to comb the long hair on her tail with ease.  </li>
      <li>then shampooing  added more time  to the routine that I am willing to put in .</li>
      <li>my hair, the Just for Me Detangler by Paris Hilton was fine,  nothing extraordinary.</li>
      <li>This unique consistency enables it to penetrate hair shafts.</li>
      <li>So my wife vetoed the original plan to try it on our four year-old, who whines (and sometimes screams) her way through any attempt to comb her hair.</li>
      <li>Thank heavens for useful products!</li>
      <li>This product washed clean away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product is white and fairly scentless.  </li>
      <li>I have bought so many detanglers for my 2 yr old and nothing has worked for her fine hair.</li>
      <li>but I think I could have if I wanted a super saturated head.  </li>
      <li>It makes it very easy for a child to inadvertently dump out the whole contents or take too large a quantity.</li>
      <li>Once you have waited a minute or two or more, then you get in the shower, rinse and shampoo like normal.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and not too overpowering, and it is easy if a bit messy to apply.  </li>
      <li>and I could easily have used twice as much to throughly saturate my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is nice and soft for the first time after a day at the ocean</li>
      <li>It really helps with the knots and snags and it has a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>This smells nice , but did not make enough of an improvement  to be worth the hassle for me .</li>
      <li>Still, this is effective as a detangler, but not one I think I will purchase in the future.</li>
      <li>It went on easy, it rinsed out easy and it really made her hair soft and lacking in tangles.</li>
      <li>that my large tooth comb went through pretty smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It is like a conditioner, in that it makes your hair slippery and the tangles come right out in the shower.  </li>
      <li>Just what you needed, right?</li>
      <li>and it starts to remove tangles right away.  </li>
      <li>I put a HUGE amount of this on a big knot, worked it in thoroughly, and left it sit for a good 15 minutes before showering...</li>
      <li>Another thing that they both said was they liked the smell that lasted long after the product was done</li>
      <li>been using this on my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair and loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>/&gt;This would be great for those who go hiking, motorcycle riding, bike riding, or a wild child who plays rough.  </li>
      <li>Milk Pre Wash is a nice product because it allows me to put the conditioner on my hair dry.</li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised at how easy the product is to use, and how little I need to get good results.</li>
      <li>but it might very well be worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As it was I used about 1/4 of the jar, which would be a problem if the cost was higher.  </li>
      <li>but this is the first pre-wash detangler I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I do wish there was a larger size available!</li>
      <li>will most likely buy this.</li>
      <li>Am I willing to pay $1-4 per wash to get it?</li>
      <li>It was ridiculously soft and easy to comb through, the next day after bed head, her hair was still easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And what&#x27;s really nice is that this JUST FOR ME product leaves my hair shiny and very soft without being flat.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is especially wonderful after a day at the beach when your hair is rough as horse hair.  I put it on when I was about 15 minutes from home and just let it set until we got home and unloaded the car.  It worked so wonderful I can&#x27;t believe it.  My hair is nice and soft for the first time after a day at the ocean and it&#x27;s not tangled to look like a rats nest.  The fragrance is so Summer smelling almost like suntan lotion that smells of coconut.  This is the perfect product for days out having fun in the sun without damaging your hair.  I will keep this in stock from now on especially since the price is right.</li>
    <li> If you have tangled, dry hair that is hard to brush through before you shower, then give this a try.  You apply it to your hair before you wash it.  It is like a conditioner, in that it makes your hair slippery and the tangles come right out in the shower.  It is like a conditioner that you use in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I applied this, I shampooed my hair as usual, and then used my normal conditioner.  This product washed clean away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be great for those who go hiking, motorcycle riding, bike riding, or a wild child who plays rough.  Instead of having to rip through your tangled mess of hair with a brush, just apply this, and jump in the shower.  It also saves your hair from breakage, which is great especially if you have thin hair like I do.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, and long hair so many times I put conditioner on my hair and let it sit before I wash my hair. It helps with extra conditioning. I’ve never used a product like the Just For Me Pre-Wash Softening Detangler that is specifically designed to be used pre-wash before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are to put a generous amount onto dry hair for up to 20 minutes. I’ve left it on my hair from just 3 minutes up to 20 minutes. The 20 minutes did provide better results but I did get results from even leaving on for just 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are fantastic. I really love this stuff. My hair is much softer when I use this. I can really tell a difference when blow drying and styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really good too. It has shea butter, soymilk, and honey. You can really smell the shea and honey, it’s a nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> My daughter is bi-racial and I am very happy with this detangler. She has fine, curly hair that gets matted and snagged very easily. Hairwashing and combing has been a bit of a chore, which is why this detangler is so great. I used to use Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s spray detangler, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything unless you used a lot of it. This is a thick creamy pudding like texture that you scoop out and work into hair and leave on for a little prior to washing. It really helps with the knots and snags and it has a light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just For Me Detangler Hair Milk Pre Wash Softening.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this on my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair and loving the results.&lt;br /&gt;We do not use it each and every time we wash her hair due to her hair is thin&lt;br /&gt;and we often have issues with build up when we use any one product too much.&lt;br /&gt;So for us we use this product about once a week and it has really helped us&lt;br /&gt;with managing her hair and it makes her hair nice and soft and so easy to brush.</li>
    <li> This is a good product if you have hair that gets tangled easily. However, it&#x27;s not terribly convenient to use.  I have moderately long hair that gets difficult to comb through the longer it gets. I prefer my hair long, but I finally give in to frustration and get it cut when it gets too tangled.  This product helps because it really does make a difference. The scent is quite pleasant and summery. The best way to use it is to put it on your hair about twenty minutes before you wash it. Personally, that&#x27;s a pain to me. However, for those times when it&#x27;s difficult to get a comb through my hair, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I liked this product for my fine, thinning hair. My hair  tangles easily, and I have a tendency to overuse conditioners in an attempt to avoid tangles.  The scent is pleasant and not too overpowering, and it is easy if a bit messy to apply.  The only bad thing is that this product seems to leave a film that is very difficult to rinse out.  Also, I do not like this container.  It is not convenient for use in the bathroom and I would have appreciated something more along the lines of a conventional conditioner bottle.  Still, this is effective as a detangler, but not one I think I will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;It is summer, it is hotter than the surface of the sun, and I am sweating. However, I still want to have nice hair if at all possible, and I still want to be able to use a conditioner without my fine hair becoming oily. Just For Me Detangler Milk Pre Wash is a nice product because it allows me to put the conditioner on my hair dry. This, in turn, allows me to have a better chance of applying the conditioner JUST to the ends of my hair, and not getting it on my root area. Once you have waited a minute or two or more, then you get in the shower, rinse and shampoo like normal. The result, for me, was that I had smooth, shiny hair that was easy to comb without being over conditioned. The smell is a bit strong (to me....I don&#x27;t like heavy scents), but most of it washes out, and what is left over on my hair is much more toned down. It was much easier to comb, as I said, and I found that while it took some of my curl out, I still had plenty of body. I am pleasantly surprised at how easy the product is to use, and how little I need to get good results.</li>
    <li> This Just for Me pre-wash softening detangler works surprisingly well. I don&#x27;t have super thick or wavy hair, but as I&#x27;ve aged and have gray my hair is coarser and frizzier. I blow dry my hair straight for work every day, and my hair still looks fuzzy and I&#x27;ve been having breakage issues. So, while enjoying a leisurely Sunday, I slathered Just for Me on my ends and worked it through all of my hair, eventually using a wide tooth comb to work it all the way into the roots to the ends. I left it on about 15 minutes and shampooed and blow dried as usual, and my hair came out so smooth and frizz free. The ends look alive again. It&#x27;s a really nice product, and it&#x27;s Made in the USA- another plus for me. Just one problem- I just detest the smell of coconut and fragrance that smells like tropical suntan lotion. The scent of Just For Me isn&#x27;t heavy, but it&#x27;s distinctively coconut. So while I really like the results, I personally won&#x27;t buy this unless it&#x27;s made available in a different fragrance.  I still recommend the product for others as it works well, but only buy it if you like the smell of coconut.</li>
    <li> I actually ended up purchasing this product before I received it from Amazon in a desperate attempt to tame my unruly &amp;#34;hypothyroid Summer hair&amp;#34; that leaves my long hair in knots (little tiny ones) in the morning. This product works so well, and in my opinion, is essential for anyone with longer hair that tends to mat for whatever reason. Even with braiding my hair at night, I get tangles and this product makes combing out my hair so much easier. I&#x27;m losing a lot less hair, too! It&#x27;s easy to use, you simply apply then rinse (combing out while it&#x27;s in the hair first) then shampoo and condition as usual. I feel no residue in my hair after using it. This pre wash smells a bit like a pina colada rather than the flowery scents that are typical of hair products and doesn&#x27;t linger after cleansing the hair. I intend to stockpile this detangler since I have very thick hair and will most likely go through it pretty quickly with regular use. I do wish there was a larger size available! Other than that I feel that this Just For Me product works flawlessly in doing what it&#x27;s intended to do. A wide tooth comb is a must for using this properly. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair, fine and prone to snarls. This is a lovely product with a deeply satisfying scent to it. When I have the time, I like to use it as directed, apply to my hair, wait 20 minutes and then rinse out. For me it acts as a deep conditioner and also tames flyaways. It leaves my hair as smooth and silky as any other deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I often don&#x27;t have the time to sit around with this product in my 4 feet of hair ( I wrap the whole lot in a towel to keep it contained) for 20 minutes. Certainly not in the mornings when I am trying to get to work. This remains a weekend pleasure, taking the time to use this product when I am less rushed. It definitely detangles and makes my hair softer and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Be careful when initially opening the jar or you may have a similar experience as mine.  I guess it was shaken up quite a bit on the journey here because when I unscrewed the lid,  a substantial amount of the aromatic white product flew out of the jar and onto the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, the Just for Me Detangler by Paris Hilton was fine,  nothing extraordinary. I waited about 15 minutes with the thin cream on my hair before combing and then washing as usual.  Where I did find this to be a great product was on the Shi Tzu&#x27;s tail,  an application I tried after using the product on myself.  On the dog,  this is really great,  allowing me to comb the long hair on her tail with ease.  Much less hair was combed out even after I finished bathing her! Bottom line is that the product performs.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that has a variety of textures.  (Looking at you mom.)  At this point in my life it&#x27;s looking a bit frazzled and swimming this summer hasn&#x27;t helped.  I have broken hair (yes, due for a major cut) and the result of heredity and daily life is that I have hair that really tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost  in love with this product, but let me relate my experiences so you can see if it&#x27;s worth you trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is white and fairly scentless.  It looks like conditioner, being thick but still flow-y.  I put it on the ends of my hair and then kept putting it on.  I was trying to not use one-quarter of the jar but I think I could have if I wanted a super saturated head.  As it was I used about 1/4 of the jar, which would be a problem if the cost was higher.  As it is, with my daughter and myself we&#x27;ll probably go through a jar a month.  (I need a huge jar please!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I waited and then washed my hair like normal.  I had serious doubts that this Detangler would work for me because I normally have to use IT&#x27;S A TEN and a SUAVE leave-in to use my large tooth comb.  I expected that it would all wash out and I&#x27;d regret it.  As it turns out that was not my experience at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shower I found that my hair did detangle easier and not just that, I also had fewer broken hairs on my wide-tooth comb.  I had to use IT&#x27;S A 10 in one spot but other than that my large tooth comb went through pretty smoothly.  And what&#x27;s really nice is that this JUST FOR ME product leaves my hair shiny and very soft without being flat.  My hair had body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how well this worked.  For really long hair you are going to have to use quite a bit but it might very well be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY THIS and see if it works for you. (Available elsewhere for 1/4 the price. I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 more jars.)</li>
    <li> I tried out this detangler today. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how well it works. I have thick, sort of curly, long hair. I applied the floral scented product to my dry hair prior to showering, leaving it in for about 20 as they recommend. I rinsed it out prior to shampooing and conditioning my hair as I normally do. I didn&#x27;t have a wide tooth comb handy so I &#x27;combed&#x27; my hair with my fingers before I let it soak. I could tell even when shampooing that my hair was smoother and less tangled. I brushed out my hair as usual and it was noticeably easier to brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this stuff really does work well I had to use quite a bit of it to get that result. My hair absorbed it readily while dry. I used about 1/4 to 1/3 of the jar and I could easily have used twice as much to throughly saturate my hair. I don&#x27;t plan on using it agin myself but do plan to use it just on the bottom half of my daughter&#x27;s curly hair where it tends to tangle easily. I&#x27;d say a full jar would last her 10-12 washings with that type of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is great stuff but it comes at a price. Do I want easy to comb, manageable, tangle free hair? I sure do. Am I willing to pay $1-4 per wash to get it? Not so much. The product itself would get five stars, the product at this price point is more like three stars so I&#x27;m compromising and giving it a solid four stars.</li>
    <li> This smells nice , but did not make enough of an improvement  to be worth the hassle for me . Rubbing it into dry hair waiting and combing  then shampooing  added more time  to the routine that I am willing to put in . my daughters who both have very long thick hair were not even willing to try it. I did not notice any positive  difference between this and  my regular shampoo and conditioner routine.</li>
    <li> Just what you needed, right? Another step in the hair care process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters are biracial (black/white) and as a white mother, I&#x27;ve always found their hair to be, well, intimidating.  Although I&#x27;m certainly not looking to lengthen the hair care routine in our house, I am looking for anything that will make combing their hair more do-able and less painful.  This product, if used in fairly liberal quantities, seems to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both girls recently had their hair in braids for about three weeks straight due to summer camp, vacation, etc.  As we took their hair out, we rubbed this product on each braid and combed it out.  The comb seemed to slide through a lot better than usual and we got a lot less whining and complaining.  We then waited a bit and had them wash their hair.  After washing, their hair seemed a lot softer than usual and it was pretty easy to pull the comb through, and the detangling effect seemed to last overnight before we re-braided their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting this product for free through the Vine program has been nice, but the question is, would I pay my own money for it?  And the answer is, I&#x27;m not sure.  We went through nearly a third of the jar just on two heads of hair, so using this product regularly would quickly add up.  On the other hand, it sure is nice to be able to comb out their hair more easily.  And it really doesn&#x27;t add that much time to the process, since we have to take the braids out and comb them anyway.  I guess we will have to see how it goes the next couple times we comb out their braids and how much easier this product makes it.  We will try using a little bit less and see if we still get the same good results.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my five year old, tender headed child. To say she was elated with the product was an understatement. Normally it is always a battle working with her extremely curly hair, and she loves to wear it straight therefore a detangle process is a must. This product exceeded my expectations as well. A great find.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because I often get HUGE knots in my long, thick, coarse hair at the nape of my neck that are a HUGE pain to get out (I don&#x27;t wash/condition/comb) every day - probably only once a week) and this seemed like it might be the perfect solution. I put a HUGE amount of this on a big knot, worked it in thoroughly, and left it sit for a good 15 minutes before showering...and it did nothing to help untangle the knot that my regular conditioner couldn&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it as an all-over detangler because I&#x27;d have to use half the container for one treatment (I have A LOT of hair).</li>
    <li> Thank heavens for useful products! My wife&#x27;s hair is luxurious, to be sure, but quite thick &amp; wavy, so this Just For Me Detangler arrived just in the nick of time. Far less of her locks are lost when she combs conditioner and other products through her hair each day after using this pre-wash softener. Very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> My house is filled with kinky, curly haired critters so my wife and daughter were very excited to be trying this. We had tried the brand &amp;#34;just for me&amp;#34; years ago on a product but did not care for it so our standards going in was low trying this time. My wife said that it worked better than expected-made her hair lightly wavy instead of kinky curled and was easy to change the style she wanted it to be. Another thing that they both said was they liked the smell that lasted long after the product was done testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would use again!</li>
    <li> This product line is targeted toward 5 to 14 year old girls but the jar says \\&quot;for all hair textures\\&quot; and I figure hair is hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use coconut oil to deep condition my hair and this has the same non-greasy feel.  Pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detangler left my hair soft and easy to manage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s my \\&quot;don&#x27;t- dip -your- fingers- in -cosmetics\\&quot; paranoia but I dislike dipping the stuff out of a jar with my fingers. I would much prefer a pump bottle. Just a personal problem, I guess.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I have bought so many detanglers for my 2 yr old and nothing has worked for her fine hair. You put this in before washing. I left it in for a couple minutes, rinsed and we shampooed her hair. It was ridiculously soft and easy to comb through, the next day after bed head, her hair was still easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big complaint is that this does weigh down her hair, and after I washed it off my hands, it left a slick film on it. I had to wash several times to get rid of the slickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely buy this. It&#x27;s a fairly large tub and will probably last forever, I&#x27;ve purchased Bobo and it&#x27;s $13 a bottle with horrible results.</li>
    <li> We have tested both this product and the Hair Milk Detangler Conditioner, and found that both worked very well to detangle our daughter&#x27;s hair. It was always a painful process for washing her hair, but she really likes using this, and is relieved from the tangles. The prewash doesn&#x27;t seem necessary as a regular part of the washing routine, unless you have just come from the beach or unbraided hair that might be extra tangled. The conditioner alone seems sufficient for most tangled hair situations and more routine use. My wife didn&#x27;t particularly care for the open container on the pre-wash and having to dip into it--would have preferred it in a squeeze bottle or pump instead. It makes it very easy for a child to inadvertently dump out the whole contents or take too large a quantity. The smell of the prewash is sweet and light. We&#x27;re glad to have found these products!</li>
    <li> This works very well to detangle my long and thick hair.  At first, it seemed strange to put this on my dry hair before showering.  But, I am able to smooth it on very easily and it starts to remove tangles right away.  Once in the shower, it rinses out nicely and my hair feels smooth and I can run me fingers through it.  After shampooing, my hair is still soft and manageable, with no tangles.  The scent is nice, too.  Not overpowering or too perfumy.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, she has thick straight hair that tangles easily! We have been applying it every other shampoo and it makes the combing of her hair so much easier. We are having great results, even though we don&#x27;t use it with every shampoo -- which saves a bit of money on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We applied this and let it sit for 15 minutes before rinsing and washing as normal. It went on easy, it rinsed out easy and it really made her hair soft and lacking in tangles. A girl who used to cry through every hair brushing now smiles and chats while we do her hair. Another bonus, her hair is easier to style since it is not tangling as we try and style it!</li>
    <li> We use this on our 5 year old daughters hair to help keep it detangled.  It&#x27;s recommended to use on dry hair before you wash it (i.e. why it&#x27;s called a pre-wash), the downside of this is you&#x27;re putting a lotion like substance in your hair which is a bit odd.  Would be nicer if it could be sprayed, or had a different applicator other than it just being in a tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell and does work well, helping keep hair detangled and softens it as well.</li>
    <li> There are many good conditioners on the market but this is the first pre-wash detangler I&#x27;ve used.  When you open it the two things you notice are that it looks like cold cream (but is not as dense when you scoop it with your fingers) and that it smells like coconut oil (to me at least). I prefer unscented products, but since this is a product that you rinse out almost immediately with your regular shampoo and conditioner, the smell (not unpleasant, just unwanted) wasn&#x27;t really a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a half cup for my hair (below shoulder-length) which is easy to tangle. I waited 15 minutes then ran my fingers through it (not a comb as recommended, because with fine, easy-to-tangle hair, I get a lot of breakage with a comb). There was no problem, and it definitely had detangled. I saw the advantage of this product when I shampooed--much better to wash hair that is already detangled than to detangle it as it cleans and conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it dried, it seemed softer and was easy to comb, but I think the main advantage is the way it helps with a shampoo. I used it for myself, but I see much of the literature is about children, and I could see that would be helpful (if they don&#x27;t mind keeping it on for 15-20 minutes before shampooing) . So often children complain about having their hair washed because it tangles and the hair pulls and hurts during the shampooing. This product helps solve that problem.</li>
    <li> I have collar-length coarse hair. It tangles easily, causing damage when I comb it out. This is especially true when I have to wash my mane more frequently in the summer, so I welcomed this product. When I opened the jar, I loved its fresh, coco-nutty tropical scent. Notice that it is called &amp;#34;hair milk.&amp;#34; That is a good description. It doesn&#x27;t have as much body as a cream, but it comes in a jar because it is a little too thick for a bottle. (see picture) If you pick up a little with your finger, it will soak in. This unique consistency enables it to penetrate hair shafts. More an occasional treatment than a daily aid, it will not replace your regular conditioner or split end leave-in serum. For best results, you will need to apply a generous amount of Hair Milk, allow it 15 minutes to work, and then run a wide-toothed comb through it before shampooing. Realistically, most people don&#x27;t have that much time to spend on an ordinary shampoo session. However, if your hair is stressed by too much sun, salt, or chlorine and you notice it turning to a tangled mass even as you wash it, this would be worth a try every few shampoos.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re a curly-haired family; I&#x27;m of Italian ancestry, my wife is South Indian, and our daughter is the resultant mix. We all have coarse, thick, curly hair (well, what&#x27;s left of it, in my case). We decided to give this a try to see if its claims of making hair-care easier for people like us panned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my wife and for me, the product works as advertised. You apply it to your hair while dry, just before wetting your hair for shampooing. It conditions the hair well (it&#x27;s basically a conditioner that you use first, instead of last), and makes it much easier to get a comb through the hair, without leaving hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One setback is that the product makes it pretty clear that it can irritate the eyes, and should be kept away from children. So my wife vetoed the original plan to try it on our four year-old, who whines (and sometimes screams) her way through any attempt to comb her hair. We&#x27;ll give it a try on her in the future, but for the grownups in our house, it works as advertised.</li>
