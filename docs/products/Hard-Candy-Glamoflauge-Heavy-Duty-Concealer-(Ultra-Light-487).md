### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Corners of eyes, to neutralize eyelid color and even a touch under lip color ...endless and awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very impressive for 5 or 6 hours.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, I don&#x27;t have to keep layering the stuff on -</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>so I am always on the look out for a great concealer.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>good coverage for a bit but</li>
      <li>Coverage is good</li>
      <li>Works really good, covers all my scars.</li>
      <li>For the price, this product is certainly worth the time and effort to perfect application techniques.</li>
      <li>Color is very good, opacity is excellent, but since the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; is relatively brief, I cannot give it the fifth star.  </li>
      <li>Anyone who is not familar with the finite applications of any kind of concealer will have difficulty with this product and it may take her a number of &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; applications to learn some of the tricks of the trade.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes you have to kind of knead the tube before application so it doesn&#x27;t come out too runny.</li>
      <li>This is probably the best concealer that I have tried thus far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost too good to be true...</li>
      <li>The concealer in the tube was a perfect color, as advertised: very light, and not yellow.</li>
      <li>No way you&#x27;d be able to touch it or wear any clothing on it</li>
      <li>Once I tried dabbing it on instead of spreading it around or brushing it on, it really looked great.  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried it, I was impressed by the coverage, but found that it looked pretty cakey.  </li>
      <li>i bought this awesome concealer at walmart here recently and i tried it out today</li>
      <li>Still have most of the tube and it is April.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is an awesome product</li>
      <li>I think this concealer&#x27;s performance is outstanding.</li>
      <li>Love.  </li>
      <li>I topped it off with a LIGHT dusting of powder, and it looked very smooth.  </li>
      <li>Covers dark circles and looks flawless.</li>
      <li>I pat it on with my fingers and then apply a light dusting of powder to set.</li>
      <li>But make sure you moisturize good or it will cake up after a long day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
      <li>The top layer of foundation rubs off on my clothes after a while even when I seal it with hairspray so by the end of the day you can kind of see it, but I don&#x27;t really care that much.</li>
      <li>Coverage is very good as I have very dark under eye circles.</li>
      <li>will re-purchase this awesome product from hard candy.</li>
      <li>Intense coverage without the garbage that generally comes with great coverage....</li>
      <li>none of that ..just smooth moist cover that stays fresh all day.</li>
      <li>Bring on the pimples (OK, but don&#x27;t really)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s TRUE.</li>
      <li>Not a bad concealer</li>
      <li>This was adequate as brow highlighter but, to use as concealer, I had to powder and reapply.</li>
      <li>&quot; For this reason, it won&#x27;t work for my under eye circles (I&#x27;m very fair-skinned), but it is awesome on small pimples.  </li>
      <li>That being said, however, it looks great for that time frame, and just a dab of light weight, translucent powder after the initial application extends the overall time frame another hour or so.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I sometimes will add a light dusting of a shimmery eyeshadow to highlight the area even more, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
      <li>I have an advantage, as a former professional model many, many years ago.  </li>
      <li>Covers well but is kind of dry if you don&#x27;t use primer</li>
      <li>I am very fair and my dark circles show up so much more on my pale skin</li>
      <li>The Hard Candy Glamoflauge Concealer is really a great concealer.</li>
      <li>and I really hope it is never discontinued!</li>
      <li>However, I have noticed that exfoliating with face wipe and applying a face primer first solves these issues.</li>
      <li>bought this product for $6 at Walmart, but would gladly pay the Amazon price if Walmart decides not to carry it in the future.  </li>
      <li>although this gives you good coverage, it starts to look choppy and patchy and makes my face break out.</li>
      <li>Glamoflauge couldn&#x27;t comeat a better time, as I am in the public eye, but not so much that I can afford to have a makeup artist all the time.  </li>
      <li>it did a very good job of covering up my dark circles and other skin imperfections.</li>
      <li>like I do, this product will absolutely cover them.</li>
      <li>just one pass of dabbing the product really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>This concealer is very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Covered well but never dried so it would smear right off even after I let it set and tried powder.</li>
      <li>Still, a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;bonus&#x27; pencil was a bust: too dark, too yellow, and too chalky on application.</li>
      <li>Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t even had it long enough to use the pencil yet, but the actual bottle is amazing.</li>
      <li>use this every day, and only about the size of a pin head on my index finger, then blot it around my under eyes and eyelids, and i get the exact coverage</li>
      <li>For instance, after my first use of this product, applying it as I would any other concealer (A dab on one finger of each hand), I looked an absolute ghost.</li>
      <li>The coverage is fantastic and a little goes a loooong way.</li>
      <li>All other concealer that I have used has been way too yellow for my light skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this to cover up a small tattoo at work and when first applied it works really well!</li>
      <li>Anyway, it was worth what I paid for; it will last me for a long time.</li>
      <li>The products have improved considerably, but the basic application rules remain the same.</li>
      <li>Then I watched a youtube video review of the product in which the young woman dabbed the concealer over her entire under eye area (this is similar to the upside-down triangle technique and creates a highlighted effect).  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s pale enough for me (very pale/olive)</li>
<li> My circles are so dark that nothing will cover them up 100 percent, but Glamoflauge comes closer than any product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;m 30 years old, so I have years of trying to fix this problem under my belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but it is thick error at first then wears off after a couple hours.  </li>
<li> Covers extremely well but very very oily :/</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t stay put long term</li>
<li> Took a very long time to get it and the coverage wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped for.</li>
<li> If you have any redness, dark circles or the occasional breakout</li>
<li> it&#x27;s purely pale, rather than tinted too yellow or pink</li>
<li> The concealer also does not move when a BB cream is applied, which is an issue I have had with other concealers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However, a little goes a long way!!!</li>
<li> I have red discoloration on my neck and face that is hard to cover even with color correction.</li>
<li> you also have to scrub extra hard soap or not to get it washed off..</li>
<li> I am 31 and have dark circles under my eyes.</li>
<li> But that&#x27;s only because its insanely thick.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t find the pencil to be hard to use, as other reviewers have mentioned, but the color is slightly darker than the concealer.  </li>
<li> It is way too heavy and oily in appearance.</li>
<li> which often pale shades do.</li>
<li> I bought the medium shade a few months ago and I can believe how LITTLE you need!!</li>
<li> Apply a small amount and it lasts all day.</li>
<li> after that its not ok for me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s THAT pale and still has uh-mazing coverage!</li>
<li> Looks awkward even after it has dried.</li>
<li> But it went on thin.</li>
<li> I layered it on but it didn&#x27;t cover the picture, it also smelled weird.</li>
<li> I hate the texture of this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wish I had found this way sooner! Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t even had it long enough to use the pencil yet, but the actual bottle is amazing. And even on my outrageous pimple this morning, I only needed the tiniest bit to cover it PERFECTLY. It was a miracle! Truly, a miracle... #1 It&#x27;s pale enough for me (very pale/olive) #2 it&#x27;s purely pale, rather than tinted too yellow or pink which often pale shades do. #3 It&#x27;s THAT pale and still has uh-mazing coverage! It&#x27;s almost too good to be true... but it&#x27;s TRUE. I&#x27;m so excited. Bring on the pimples (OK, but don&#x27;t really) because I&#x27;m finally prepared for them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I use the pencil, I&#x27;ll update with my thoughts.</li>
    <li> although this gives you good coverage, it starts to look choppy and patchy and makes my face break out. you also have to scrub extra hard soap or not to get it washed off.. good coverage for a bit but after that its not ok for me.</li>
    <li> i bought this awesome concealer at walmart here recently and i tried it out today and i&#x27;m amazed by its performance. it did a very good job of covering up my dark circles and other skin imperfections. will re-purchase this awesome product from hard candy.</li>
    <li> Covered well but never dried so it would smear right off even after I let it set and tried powder. No way you&#x27;d be able to touch it or wear any clothing on it</li>
    <li> Took a very long time to get it and the coverage wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any women that has a p,ace on her face she doesn&#x27;t want!!! I&#x27;ve been in beauty business for 40 years...Ive used products from Paris to Walmart . This concealer/ contour/ highlighter will DO it. I bought the medium shade a few months ago and I can believe how LITTLE you need!! Intense coverage without the garbage that generally comes with great coverage....CREAPING , blow up lines..none of that ..just smooth moist cover that stays fresh all day. Corners of eyes, to neutralize eyelid color and even a touch under lip color ...endless and awesome. Ive recommended this on my face book page...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to cover up a small tattoo at work and when first applied it works really well! The top layer of foundation rubs off on my clothes after a while even when I seal it with hairspray so by the end of the day you can kind of see it, but I don&#x27;t really care that much.</li>
    <li> The concealer in the tube was a perfect color, as advertised: very light, and not yellow. But it went on thin. This was adequate as brow highlighter but, to use as concealer, I had to powder and reapply. Still, a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;bonus&#x27; pencil was a bust: too dark, too yellow, and too chalky on application.</li>
    <li> Covers extremely well but very very oily :/</li>
    <li> Works really good, covers all my scars.</li>
    <li> Too oily. It doesn&#x27;t stay put long term</li>
    <li> I hate the texture of this product. It is way too heavy and oily in appearance. It will cover what ever you want it to of course! But that&#x27;s only because its insanely thick. Looks awkward even after it has dried.</li>
    <li> The Hard Candy Glamoflauge Concealer is really a great concealer. It comes in a tube with .71oz of concealer. I am very fair and my dark circles show up so much more on my pale skin so I am always on the look out for a great concealer. This concealer is very pigmented. I pat it on with my fingers and then apply a light dusting of powder to set. I think this concealer&#x27;s performance is outstanding. Sometimes you have to kind of knead the tube before application so it doesn&#x27;t come out too runny. I am including before and after photos of this concealer.</li>
    <li> Apply a small amount and it lasts all day. Coverage is very good as I have very dark under eye circles. But make sure you moisturize good or it will cake up after a long day.</li>
    <li> I bought it to cover a tattoo but It didn&#x27;t work. I layered it on but it didn&#x27;t cover the picture, it also smelled weird.</li>
    <li> Coverage is good but I wish it were creamier. Don&#x27;t appreciate the texture.</li>
    <li> Covers well but is kind of dry if you don&#x27;t use primer</li>
    <li> I have SEVERE under eye circles and have never found a concealer that works on them.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of highlighting effects, colors, techniques, etc. and still find myself having to cake on layers and layers of concealer, only to still have visible circles.  Enter Glamoflauge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for $6 at Walmart, but would gladly pay the Amazon price if Walmart decides not to carry it in the future.  This concealer has been life changing for me!  The first time I tried it, I was impressed by the coverage, but found that it looked pretty cakey.  Then I watched a youtube video review of the product in which the young woman dabbed the concealer over her entire under eye area (this is similar to the upside-down triangle technique and creates a highlighted effect).  Once I tried dabbing it on instead of spreading it around or brushing it on, it really looked great.  I topped it off with a LIGHT dusting of powder, and it looked very smooth.  Best of all, I don&#x27;t have to keep layering the stuff on - just one pass of dabbing the product really does the trick.  I sometimes will add a light dusting of a shimmery eyeshadow to highlight the area even more, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.  My circles are so dark that nothing will cover them up 100 percent, but Glamoflauge comes closer than any product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;m 30 years old, so I have years of trying to fix this problem under my belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the pencil to be hard to use, as other reviewers have mentioned, but the color is slightly darker than the concealer.  The concealer color I got was \\&quot;Ultra Light,\\&quot; which comes with a pencil in the color, \\&quot;Light.\\&quot; For this reason, it won&#x27;t work for my under eye circles (I&#x27;m very fair-skinned), but it is awesome on small pimples.  I tend to have eczema breakouts on my face at this time of year, and the concealer and pencil both cover all that up without adding a bunch of buildup that would attract the eye to the problem.  Glamoflauge couldn&#x27;t comeat a better time, as I am in the public eye, but not so much that I can afford to have a makeup artist all the time.  Overall, this is an awesome product and I really hope it is never discontinued!</li>
    <li> I have red discoloration on my neck and face that is hard to cover even with color correction. This product was recommended to me online and helps cover up the additional red that the color corrector does not. However, a little goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> I am 31 and have dark circles under my eyes. All other concealer that I have used has been way too yellow for my light skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day, and only about the size of a pin head on my index finger, then blot it around my under eyes and eyelids, and i get the exact coverage i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying to find this al walmart, because it is only 6 dollars in store, but sometimes they are out of this shade. Anyway, it was worth what I paid for; it will last me for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best concealer that I have tried thus far. The coverage is fantastic and a little goes a loooong way. For instance, after my first use of this product, applying it as I would any other concealer (A dab on one finger of each hand), I looked an absolute ghost. If you have any redness, dark circles or the occasional breakout like I do, this product will absolutely cover them. The concealer also does not move when a BB cream is applied, which is an issue I have had with other concealers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con here is the texture. After applying it I found it to be both a bit oily but a bit gritty at the same time. However, I have noticed that exfoliating with face wipe and applying a face primer first solves these issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Color is very good, opacity is excellent, but since the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; is relatively brief, I cannot give it the fifth star.  It&#x27;s very impressive for 5 or 6 hours.  That being said, however, it looks great for that time frame, and just a dab of light weight, translucent powder after the initial application extends the overall time frame another hour or so. Anyone who is not familar with the finite applications of any kind of concealer will have difficulty with this product and it may take her a number of &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; applications to learn some of the tricks of the trade.  I have an advantage, as a former professional model many, many years ago.  The products have improved considerably, but the basic application rules remain the same. For the price, this product is certainly worth the time and effort to perfect application techniques.</li>
    <li> Love.  Works great.  Hides my under eye circles.</li>
    <li> Not a bad concealer but it is thick error at first then wears off after a couple hours.  I was looking for something different</li>
    <li> Bought this in December. Still have most of the tube and it is April. Worth every penny. Covers dark circles and looks flawless.</li>
