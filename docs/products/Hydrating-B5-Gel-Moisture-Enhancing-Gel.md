      <li>The combination of CE Ferulic and the B5 (as suggested by many previous reviewers) is the most amazing thing that has happen to my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazingly good product</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Have purchased this product before on the recommendation it should be used with CE Ferulic. My skin is normally awful at this time of the year dehydrated and wrinkled with central heating but I have to say that with the combination of these two plus Revele and Prevage my skin looks so much better.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician turned me onto Skinceuticals.Because I have so many problems with break outs and very sensitive skin she switched me from a acne moisturizer to this gel. It takes a bit of getting used to - the gel has a strange texture. But it absorbs quickly. My face is hydrated without being oily. I notice that my skin produces less oil throughout the day since I started using. A little goes a very long way - you only need 1-2 drops to cover your face and chin-line so it&#x27;s worth the extra money. I use this in conjunction with their SPF 50 sunscreen and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> It goes on very smoothly, and it does a very good job hydrating my skin.  I follow the recommendation by applying it after an antioxidant and before a regular moisturizer.  A little bit goes a long way, so the product lasts several months.</li>
    <li> I have started to use this product since 2005 recommended by my dermatologist, and it is a great moisture to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals Hydrating B5 Gel for over two years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. A couple of drops a day is all I need. Yes, it is somewhat expensive, but the product lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve tried other products, thinking that I could save some money, but I&#x27;ve always come back to Skinceuticals. Simply the best!</li>
    <li> Great for moisture. Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling like it has a heavy film on it. Nice and light. Well worth the price. I have acne prone/oily skin and this product did not cause any breakouts.</li>
    <li> I had asked my Derm Doc if he thought I should have a laser treatment. He suggested that I use this product in conjunction with Skincueticals CE-Ferulic, NIA24 Skin Strengthing Complex, Revaleskin Day and Night Lotion along with Atralin Gel (an rx retinoid product), and forget the laser. I was told that after using these products in the regimen he prescribed for 18 months everyone would be asking me what I have done to my skin. He was right. My skin looks amazing and I get soooo many compliments. My Dr. could have done the laser treatmens and charged me thousands of dollars. Instead I took his advice and I am thrilled with the results. PS. Don&#x27;t forget a very strong sun block.</li>
    <li> I had such a high expectation on this procuct but not sure about &#x27;hydrating&#x27; or &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; my skin. This will be suitable for oily skin who can&#x27;t have rich or thick serums.</li>
    <li> Over the past year, my skin has changed from oily to dry and I have noticeable fine lines around my eyes.  I have tried every product out there, many over $100.  Not one product has made any sort of difference to my skin other than making it dryer or irritated.  I took a chance with Skinceuticals, and went with the faith of reviews on Amazon.  I might never go back to or have to try any other product.  The combination of CE Ferulic and the B5 (as suggested by many previous reviewers) is the most amazing thing that has happen to my skin.  I&#x27;m getting compliments again and the fine lines are less noticeable.  Finally, a great product that works!!!  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this product that worked really well.  So I ordered a bottle.  The product I received does not hydrate like the sample.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this after I continued to break out from moisturizers and other anti-aging prescription products. It&#x27;s weird at first for me to understand because it&#x27;s an acid and it doesn&#x27;t make sense that it would moisturize. I&#x27;m not sure how it works but I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months and have had no adverse reaction. Like other reviewers - especially those who reviewed the 60 ml bottle - the dropper goes a long way. Use sparingly. It&#x27;s expensive through my doc, so happy to find it here for $20 less than what I paid. One other note - according to the website cosmetic data base which ranks thousands of cosmetics for their toxicity - this product received a rating of 1 (zero is the best score, 10 the worst). I was really thrilled to discover this because I feel that it is safe to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for anyone who has problematic skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer.  Easy to use for evening moisturizing</li>
    <li> I have a oily skin, I use it at night, it feels so smooth and absorb good, my skin feels like silk.</li>
    <li> Just started using it under my moisturizer.  My skin seems to be less dry.  I don&#x27;t see a significant difference yet, but I use Skinceutical products and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is great product. It can be used alone or with another moisturizer on top. I am in my early 30s and have oily skin, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily, also I have extremely sensitive skin, eczema and acne prone - this product doesn&#x27;t cause or inflame either. It lasts a really long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product at a \\&quot;med-spa\\&quot; after getting a microdermabrasion.  I loved it, but it&#x27;s very expensive!  When I started to run low I immediately checked to see if I could purchase on Amazon.com and save some money.  I could and I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, if used daily, makes your skin feel better and hydrated. Give it a week or so to really feel the effects and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and thought that this product would be a good moisturizer.  I was wrong.  I will not recommend it for someone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I definitely will order this again,  The price was right good deal.  It works well as expected from a Skinceuticals product.</li>
    <li> healthy way to moisturize my skin, which is getting older. a bit on the expensive side, so finding it on amazon helped.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hydrating product; I live in the dry weather and it helps my skim absorb my creams.</li>
    <li> This serum really helps skin hold in moisture and plump up the skin.  A little goes a long way.  Its not greasy.</li>
    <li> Okay the reason why i given it a 3 star is because:&lt;br /&gt;This products uses phenoxyethanol as one of it ingredients. From what i have read it causes Neuro damage. There it will attach itself to your DNA and causes long term damage. Also \\&quot;Serious damage to eyes can also occur.\\&quot; Please be advise on this.&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a try and then re-rate this product. Apparently it is the only preservatives better than parabens in the market.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why i am still going to try this product is because it contains:&lt;br /&gt;1: Hyaluronate&lt;br /&gt;2: Pantothenic Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients in this product is:&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Sodium Hyaluronate, Pantothenic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the ingredients listed is small and they dont try to hide Phenoxyethanol. I am willing to give it a shot. Please do your own research a bit before buying.</li>
    <li> this is the best moisturizer ever! i have very oily skin thats dehydrated so i need a good moisturizer...and i found it!!</li>
    <li> This keeps my skin so soft and smooth. It is now a permanent part of my routine. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Great for Day time use. I use with a moisturizer. Light and noticeably improved my skin&#x27;s texture. Will continue to purchase. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Just an awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for hydrating the very dry skin!  Love IT and recommend to all who have dry skin!!!</li>
    <li> This product, when used with other Skinceutical products is very effective.  Recommend that a dermatologist or esthetician recommend specific Skinceutical products as it can be confusing.  I use the B-5 Gel over the corrective products and under the moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I apply it in the mornings and at night,  it  moisturizes the skin for many hours.  I recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this skin line. I have been using this gel for many years and could not go without it. I tried other lines with the same ingredient and they do not compare to SkinCeuticals. This is very pure and you can use it on burnt skin and acne without irritating either condition.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.Nothing special.Good alternative to rich moisturizers for those with oily skin or combination skin like mine.Why,why,why is it $58?Try IQ Natural Argireline Anti-Aging Serum 1.2oz for $20 less instead.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this but I&#x27;m not sure it does anything to my skin.  Pricey.  Even two drops twice a day doesn&#x27;t last long.  Think I will discontinue buying it as an unneeded, unproved luxury.</li>
    <li> I love the hydration it gives to my skin.... especially since I use the Skinceuticals retinol 1% at night.  I read about the skinceuticals products in Marie Claire magazine.  I also use the C E Ferulic.  I am a women of color and these products works well on my skin.  I would purchase these products again.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use this for long flights to and from Europe to preserve my facial skin under the drying circumstances. It was quite remarkable how well it worked. I shared it with several flight attendants who were duly impressed and planned to purchase this product when they arrived at their home cities.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past. Though it doesn&#x27;t take away wrinkes, it softens them. I see a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. It works wonders. I have recommended this product to many people.</li>
    <li> I liked this product although it hasn&#x27;t changed my skin at all.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because it is probably more for combination skin.  My skin is extremely dry and it didn&#x27;t really deliver for me.</li>
    <li> Before putting on your moisturizer this product feels like silk on,I love it my skin feels great! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I order on line because I don&#x27;t have time to go shopping. I was very disappointed when I got a totally different product. It is called &amp;#34; IS CLINICAL / an active serum in a blue bottle. It doesn&#x27;t compare to the B5 gel</li>
    <li> This product was a indication of my dermatologist, it will be my 1st time using this product, I saw some interview and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
    <li> Have been using this brand for a few years now and an undecided with this product, would recommend the brand to anyone with aging skin looking for a high quality product. Have not noticed the results I am looking for with this particular product - yet. Following up with professional to ask if I am applying correctly.</li>
    <li> The B5 moisture is just what my skin needed It is light and leaves a very smooth and glowing feel and look.  I will continue to use the B5 moisture to maintain this look and feel.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that really improved my skin.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s expensive and I&#x27;ve had to give it up.....sadly.  I highly recommend it to anyone especially w/dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this hydrating serum!  It adds moisture and is not oily. It works well in combination with other Skinceuticals products.</li>
    <li> What a great , light weight serum. Wish it was a little less$ but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the suggestion that it be used in conjunction with C E Ferulic (which I LOVE). Prior to using the B5 Gel, I was simply applying moisturizer right over CE Ferulic. I&#x27;ve been using the B5 Gel for a month now and am pretty sure I won&#x27;t buy it again because I don&#x27;t find it to be any better than using moisturizer alone. I will say that it is moisturizing in it&#x27;s own right and I can imagine that for people who hate heavier creams or are acne prone this is an excellent light moisture gel...but again...unless you have a problem with that, I don&#x27;t see much benefit from the extra purchase.</li>
    <li> I first tried this almost a year ago and found it to be the final step in moisturizing my dry, aging skin.  My dermatologist stared me on the C E Ferulic which is antioxidant.  My skin still seemed really dry.  So after a little research I ordered this.  It lasts a really long time and really adds an improved level of moisture.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years in conjunction with Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.  The Hydrating Gel is light, absorbs quicky, and makes makeup application easier.  I recommend this product to anyone who tends to have  normal-to-dry skin.</li>
    <li> First ingredient is water!! That pretty much sums up my experience with this product!! I&#x27;m sure Skinceuticals would say it&#x27;s one part of a bigger skin care program where all products are designed to work together... That said! Each product should be able to stand on it&#x27;s own and provide value for investment!! I think there are better products on the market to invest time and money on!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this along with the CE Ferulic and I hated the CE Ferulic so I sent it back. I used the B5 Hydrating gel alone with the Skinceuticals evening moisturizer and I absolutely love what it&#x27;s doing to my skin. I am waking up with rosy cheeks that feel comfortable.i notice imperfections on my face are fading and I am getting compliments. The CE Ferulic was way too irritating but the B5 Gel is the complete opposite. I must add that in the morning when I put it on it leaves a perfect canvas for my Tizo sunscreen!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful compliment to the CE.... Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two years now, and wouldnt go back to any of the&lt;br /&gt;other products I have used over the years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that it is meant to stay on your skin so long or have the rest rubbed in instead of washed off.  At least for me.  It burned my skin, gave me flaky, rough, alligator skin which lasted for weeks.  It was highly damaging and did the opposite of what it claims.</li>
    <li> Adds moisture to plump up dry skin without oil. Perfect for Florida. Perfect under sunscreen, or makeup. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really find that it hydrates as stated.</li>
    <li> I use B5 every mooring along with he PHLORETIN CF.  I have been using these two products for years now and have no wrinkle or dark spots on my face and I am 52.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use other products that also contribute to my good results because as we know, or should know, the morning time regime is different to the night time regime.  Overall, SkinCeuticals works for me so I stick with it.  Amazon usually has the best prices for both B5 and PHLORETIN CF.  For example the PHLORETIN CF costs approx. $150 on their web site and on amazon I have purchased it for approx. $106 and the B5 is $78. and I get it on Amazon around $68 to $75.</li>
    <li> I have chronically dehydrated, oily skin - which is a really tricky thing to correct, so this product has been a game changer.  I feel like this has really added the moisture that I needed, my skin feels quenched, without adding anything oily or breaking me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something completely unexpected, though appreciated, has also happened from this product - the entire texture of my skin changed within a couple of days of adding this to my regimen.  I can&#x27;t really even describe it, other than I guess the texture feels like all of my skin cells are plump and soft with moisture, instead of deflated and rigid with dehydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Skinceuticals for coming out with such a much-needed product!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. Great!</li>
    <li> LOVE SKIN CUTICLES. IF I COULD BATH IN THIS STUF I WOULD. I HAD BAD ACNE AND USED THIS ALONG WITH THE OTHER PRODUCTS AND IT WORKED</li>
    <li> Great for rehydrating skin. Suggested by my plastic surgeon&#x27;s nurse who uses it herself.</li>
    <li> Works well alone during hot days in TX, but can be used as a layered moisturizer when it is cold.</li>
    <li> So far it seems good. I need more time with it, but everyone says that it is great, and with skinceuticals it is hard to wrong. I know this will be a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue. Perfect for men and women both. You can wear it under makeup or alone. It&#x27;s like a drink of water for your skin.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Dermatologist, and I have used it for several years.  I am delighted to find it on Amazon where it is a savings to purchase.</li>
    <li> Made my skin ich  Used w the skinceuticals oil control pore reducing lotion and it was a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;The lotion burned and made my skin raw. I tried this with w the moisture enhancing gel and it made my skin itch. I then tried alone and my skin still itched. I use retina and clarisonic at night and used these two products in the am under makeup together and or alone. I have oily and sometimes sensitive skin in the winter. I then tried this moisture gel w other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used before and the itching still happened&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m out $ for these expensive products-  i now feel why do u need a gel and a moisturizer anyway?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found a moisturizer called Atopalm I&#x27;m so happy with! I&#x27;m done w fancy sounding gels and lotions!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with RetinA and it&#x27;s helped drastically reduce any peeling (which is usually a side effect from retinA). I bring it with me in my make up bag and at first sign of dry or flaky skin, I put a little bit on. I really like this stuff. I just purchased my second bottle and recommended it to a few friends.</li>
    <li> On my first use, it feels like it cured my dryness condition.  My dry patches on my face disappeared.  I am a believer.&lt;br /&gt;I actually had another product by Skinceuticals from a long time ago.  My friend who worked at a professional salon introduced me to it.  I didn&#x27;t think too much of it at the time.  But this hydrating moisture gel sold me to Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> This product is good to use in the morning after cleansing your face. I use it right after cleansing- I don&#x27;t dry all the water off completely- I use this  product and then finish with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love the results I am getting from using this product under my Skinceuticals Phloretin CF! I can definitely tell a difference in my skin. It is less dry. In fact, it is glowing! This bottle will last forever. I only need two drops to cover my entire face!</li>
    <li> average there are better products around.</li>
    <li> Skinceutical hydrating b5 gel is the best hyaluronic acid serum on the market today.  Ive tried quite a few out and none come close to this one.  Absorbs quickly into the skin and leave skin feeling supple and hydrated after.  Just be sure to put a moisturizer on AFTER you apply this. It will make your moisturizer work a million times better without leaving your skin feeling greasy...I PROMISE. Try it, you&#x27;ll be hooked for life.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a dermatologist specializing in both medical and cosmetic skincare.  It provides light moisturizing over my vitamin C product that keeps my skin happy, even in the desert Southwest!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about a year, at suggestions of my facialist. I use it underneath my daily moisturizer as well as whenever I use retin-A.  Really helps to keep my skin moist and avoid dryness/flakiness.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin moist during dry winters.  Have used for years.  Wish it was a bit less expensive.  Makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and I love it! My face was so dry and irritated, but thanks to this product, it feels like skin again! It goes on very lightweight - no sticky heavy creams. It feels very soothing. I put it on twice a day, and use it with the phytocorrective gel at night. My face still has some red marks (I was last diagnosed with keritosis pilaris), but most of the general redness has faded, and it feels smooth!</li>
    <li> Love this company and this product. Was so excited to find this deal on this product with free shipping for Prime members. This makes my skin absorb moisture and my blemishes have all but disappeared after one month of use. I recommend this product highly!</li>
    <li> It is light and administers the right amount of moisture for combination skin during the summer months.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I mix it with hylauronic acid every morning and find it hydrating.  On its own, I didnt see much of a difference, but with moisturizer and hylauronic acid it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four starts because I&#x27;m sure that B5 gel can be found for less than $60/bottle.</li>
    <li> This gel makes your skin so soft and hydrated without giving you the weight of heavy cream.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this particular product and will continue to buy it as long as the price stays within reach. It really hydrades my skin in a way that seems to be different than most lotions or creams.&lt;br /&gt;P. Mayer</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this stuff!! It was reccomended to me at a spa after a facial and after using the sample I bought a bottle online. This is the fourth bottle ive purchased! Ive also got my mom, my best friend and my fiance using it. I feel like this makes my skin healthier and it has a smoother texture!! Love it during the winter! Also if I have a pimple or mark I found that it helps my skin heal faster. Ive even used it on irritations and rashes and it helps soothe and heal them faster as well.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> This product hydrates and helps control oil throughout the entire day.  Have used this for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much that I decided to buy it again.  When I use it my face is looks and feels better.  This product is not heavy on your face so it does not clog pores.</li>
