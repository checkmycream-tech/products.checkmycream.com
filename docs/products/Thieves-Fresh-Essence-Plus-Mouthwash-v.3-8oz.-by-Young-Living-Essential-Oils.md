<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> can&#x27;t get past the taste. not minty or refreshing at all. i really wanted to love this product the way i do their soaps, oil, spray, and and gel.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Cleans very well.  Actually helps with tooth pain.  I don&#x27;t know how.  It just does.  It leaves a smooth clean feel.  One of those products that almost work like magic</li>
    <li> A couple reviewers mentioned that the clove taste is strong... and it&#x27;s true. If you don&#x27;t like the taste of cloves, you&#x27;ll be horrified. I was a little shocked by it with the first couple uses, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it already and I kind of like the lingering taste to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give any feedback as far as longterm results since this is my first bottle, but I&#x27;m happy so far after using it a few days. My mouth feels and smells clean, without being left stinging like most mouthwashes do. :)</li>
    <li> I use daily, love it. Great product</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is all natural and has no alcohol. It tastes wonderful and freshens breath effectively. It also helps to keep mouth and gums healthy. It is by far the best mouthwash I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I spent a fair amount of time researching mouthwashes before I purchased this.  I was looking for one that not only freshened breath but kept it fresh and one that promoted good oral health - this fit the bill, at least according to the reviews that I read.  They weren&#x27;t wrong.  I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Fresh Essence Plus Mouthwash.  The taste is a bit different than what I had become accustomed to, but it&#x27;s not bad.  It leaves behind a minty citrus aftertaste, and the best part?  That minty citrus taste is still present for at least 3 hours after I swish.  I&#x27;m also a fan of the fact that this is an all-natural product and does not contain ingredients that are harmful or toxic to our bodies.</li>
    <li> This as with most of the Young Living products is excellent, it has a bit of a kick to it, but is long lasting with a fresh breath!</li>
    <li> Ok, so it may have a different taste, but, its not bad at all. My mouth actually tingled after using it! I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff works and feels. I had gum problems, however, with this product the problems are clearing up!</li>
    <li> Love my Thieves Mouthwash.  Good thing to have every morning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is spicy!, but practically a vaccine against respiratory illness. Used it regulary daily every night while two people in the house contracted and suffered with strep throat (which I catch almost instantly if I am exposed to it at all). Both individuals received treatment (antibiotic), but astonishingly, I did not contract strep! First time that has happend and this is what I look at as the major change in my actions that might have been the changing factor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a year now and I&#x27;m more in love with it than every.  My last cleaning confirms the benefit of Thieves Oil Mouthwash.  It&#x27;s reduced the pockets and plaque greatly, so much so I&#x27;m brushing with it twice a day now after toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;For those commenting &amp;#34;it&#x27;s too strong&amp;#34; all I can say is &amp;#34;do you want to kill bacteria and candida or not?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Refreshing and long lasting!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Keeps my mouth and gums healthy!</li>
    <li> The taste is def. different.  I&#x27;m not quite used to it yet. I bought this after reading reviews about it helping gum recession.  I have one tooth that has a little bit of recession and my dentist mentioned if it didn&#x27;t get better I may have to have gum grafting surgery.  After googling that I decided I will try anything and everything first to avoid that.  This has not helped at all with that issue.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff however, when I recieved my last order the bottle did NOT have a safety seal.  Into the trash it went. Will not buy from that seller again.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel cleaner. This product was recommended to me by a friend who said her dentist ask what she used because her gyms looked great and she had less tarter. Can&#x27;t wait for my dental appointment.</li>
    <li> While great for you im sure, I found it too intense to want in my mouth. Very spicy and almost burning? Its taken me forever to get through a bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash.  It&#x27;s a natural product, and helps improve gum disease.  I&#x27;ve struggled with slight gum irritationg for a couple of years and Thieves mouthwash a long with the Thieves tooth paste has improved my gums.  As a diabetec good oral hygene is critical.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. So far, it&#x27;s the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few days ago after my herbalist told me it would help with my reoccurring gum infections. It cleared the current infection right up, so I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it. My only complaint is the strong taste of cloves that lasts for hours. I hate cloves. Other than that, it&#x27;s great. I found it a little strong (it made my eyes water. lol) so I water it down a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mouthwash for a while now. It is very strong at first, but I would recommend you dilute it with a little water, also you don&#x27;t need a lot of the mouthwash, a little goes a long way. I would advise using it before bed so the oils can penetrate the gums and heal...you will notice a huge difference in your breath and overall oral hygiene in a week or two of consistent use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  This is a MUST for anyone who has gum issues ! This product  along with proper  brushing and flossing , spaces out the dental cleanings that I used to have to fo Every 3 months , now I go 2 X&#x27;s a year...pair it with Thieves dentarome ultra tooth paste  for better results!  Dose have a very very strong clover flavor.</li>
    <li> This continues to be one of my favorites.  Company produces good quality products from oils.  Would recommend to everyone who wants a quality mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Strong flavor but appears to b effective in keeping teeth clean. I also use it to gargle during flu season.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Thieves essential oil before and had great results, so when I saw this pull up while I was looking for mouthwash to lessen the inflammation in my gums until I could get to the dentist, I was very excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a total waste though.  Not only did it fail to *improve* the health of my gums, it didn&#x27;t even prevent the inflammation from *getting worse.*  It literally did nothing.  Hugely disappointing.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is amazing... you only need a small amount and it takes care of mouth sores, tooth issues, gums, it&#x27;s really fantastic!</li>
    <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean and I feel good using it knowing the essential oils are good for me.  If I ever have any kind of toothache, I swish with this mouthwash and it takes the pain right away.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this stuff, I am going to get more, someday!!! makes Your mouth feel great, &amp; it last a long time...</li>
    <li> I had adult tonsillectomy and I wanted to keep good oral hygiene without hurting myself by gargling any of those harsh, alcoholic mouthwashes. I decided to buy one of these to keep my breath fresh but inadvertently found that it also helps me heal a whole lot faster. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier. Definitely recommend this product especially to anyone planning any type of oral surgery.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend hoping to help with her periodontal situation. So far she said it is ok, it just seems really expensive....since then I&#x27;ve discovered an essential oil blend I can make that is just as good as this for a fraction of the inflated prices that these multi level marketing companies charge</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Will see what the next trip to the dentist shows!!</li>
    <li> After I read all the harmful ingredients of regular mouthwash, I found Thieves to be refreshing and lasting compared to the normal mouthwash. I know I am getting all the benefits of organic living.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so good. My favorite mouthwash every.  The only kind i like to use anymore.  Just great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer in Thieves Oil.  I use it in an infuser to purify the air in my home.  I love the scent.  The mouth wash, with Thieves Oil as one of the main ingredients, adds some real power to my oral health routine.  I like this so much, I also bought some for my mother who, like me, has periodontal disease and could use this extra help.</li>
    <li> Good does the trick but also the regular thieves does the trick too</li>
    <li> I have used mouthwash for years.  I am trying to get better at not using so many chemicals or products with preservatives so I am using a lot of essential oils for various conditions I have.  Well, I got the toothpaste in the Thieves and it is excellent.  I got a great cleaning report and will continue to purchase it, but this product is not that good.  If you get beyond the shock of the horrible  taste vs the regular mouth washes you have used you may can tolerate it.  The price for the 8 oz bottle of $20.00+ will be a one time purchase by this lady.  It may do quite well and for the price I will learn to tolerate it, but this is not going to be my go to mouth wash going forward.</li>
    <li> mouthwash spill, not wrapped good. was not sterile. the top was not on good!!</li>
    <li> Love thieves!!  the moment I start getting a scratchy/sore throat, I start gargling and it goes right away!  Keeps me from getting full blow colds a lot!!  I recommend it to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> The fresh clean feeling I get from using Thieves is fantastic. I have one gum area above a tooth that is slightly receding and I’m finding that the sensitivity is going away as I continue using Thieves. I walk around the house swooshing for at least three minutes.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it.  Long lasting effects.</li>
    <li> Great product! We&#x27;ve been using this and find it highly effective!</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash on the market.</li>
    <li> TASTE:&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the extremely strong clove taste. If you don&#x27;t like cloves, do not get this, as it will gag you. I happen to like cloves, so this is ok for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed, was... vetiver? Did they actually use vetiver in a mouthwash? Looked at the label, and yes they did. A very weird taste, and will probably turn some people off. I happen to like vetiver, so this is mostly ok for me. Usually it&#x27;s a cologne smell though, a smokey grass aroma, not a flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may not be any alcohol in this product, but any cuts or abrasions in your mouth will burn like crazy when rinsing with this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that the taste stays in your mouth for a very long time, and that your mouth feels &#x27;clean&#x27;, or at least, scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPANY BACKGROUND:&lt;br /&gt;Here is their official page:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the family who makes this product, which mentions their Thieves Oil was used to &#x27;fight off the black plague&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a very, interesting, essay written by one of the family members, which asserts that the &#x27;flu season is caused by Thanksgiving dinner&#x27;, using the logic \\&quot;If cold weather contributed to the flu, then why doesn&#x27;t everyone in Canada have the flu all the time?\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;Is this different enough from normal mouthwash, to at least try one? Sure, why not. You may actually love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this going to provide the endless miracles suggested by the makers of this product? There is not a chance, though its anti-microbial action may be legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you use this product bottle after bottle without really looking into the ingredients or the company who makes it? I would suggest no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YMMV</li>
    <li> Too much clove for me. Worked well after diluting by 60% with a minty mouthwash. Actually, I really like the mix.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on over the years and highly recommend it. This product complements any of the Thieves toothpaste products. I do find it rather strong so I dilute it with water and find it very effective at half strength. I have used this product as a base for making a larger container of mouthwash by adding water and extra essential oils such as peppermint, lemon and clove. I used this alone with my toothbrush and baking soda and found it very effective.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of dental work lately, and this has sped my recovery each time.  The taste is not bad either.</li>
    <li> Have heard that the clove oil taste is strong, however, I use clove oil and do not find it to be a bad taste.  This is clean and has a pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> During chemotherapy treatment for cancer, I developed painful mouthsores.  The only product that touched the pain was Thieves Fresh Essence Plus, and as I have continued using it the frequency and intensity of mouthsores has dramatically increased.  I do, however, dilute it with approximately 1/3rd warm water.</li>
    <li> Any &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; products by Young Living are fabulous.  They are antibiotic/anti-viral … taste great … and are a good item to have.  This mouthwash is VERY strong, but then again … so are the germs in your mouth.</li>
    <li> it is THE best, but expensive. You use less of it though. It tastes fantastic.</li>
    <li> Ohhhh....Soooo Gooooood!&lt;br /&gt;Highly concentrated formula...very refreshing taste...I would recommend this product to anyone without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of solution goes a long way as this is a premium priced product.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!! I use all YL Essential oil and this stuff is everything it says it is.I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This essential oils mouthwash is the best.  Great tasting, leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, naturally.  Love Thieves!  Fast shipping, good price.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the Young Living/Thieves products, this one takes a little getting used to but im hopeful in the long run that its a healthier alternative to the usual mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing wrong was that the scanning label placed on the product was placed directly over the ingredients and directions. please fix this small issue. other than that Very Awesome Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s outrageously expensive for mouthwash but so fantastic that I keep buying it over and over again.</li>
    <li> Great, long-lasting, fresh mouth feeling.  I use it right after flossing, before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have never used it before - BEWARE - it has a strong flavor, and a bit of a &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders for my gums- after a month I could see tell they had grown a little. Also, my husband was the first to notice that when we wake up in the morning our mouth doesn&#x27;t taste like death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is not that bad- they&#x27;ve added an ingredient that&#x27;s iffy for health (can&#x27;t recall right at the moment) that&#x27;s used to keep the ingredients &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d much rather they omitted that bad and unnecessary chemical and I would just shake the bottle before use instead. Also, the taste is... well, I kind of imagine it&#x27;s like what a recent wrapped mummy would taste like, it does take a bit of getting used too but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this mouthwash daily. Its when I do not use I get into trouble with a toothache or gum ache whatever... Keeps your mouth healthy between dentist trips. I have gotten way cheaper though that on Amazon. Make sure you check around.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Fresh.  No alcohol.  I dip my toothbrush in it once and use the same bottle for a year.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I tried using this straight but have found that I must water it down somewhat. That said it leaves my mouth feeling very clean. Even watered down the taste will not appeal to many.</li>
    <li> as a Dr I am in close contact with people all day, this gives me confidence I am not offending anyone.  Alcohol free and it works, 2 thing not often found in mouthwash</li>
    <li> I have been using this company&#x27;s mouthwash for years. I stopped for a few years because it did get really costly. I missed it all that time and decided to indulge in a bottle. this was a bit disappointing. The formula has changed. Either that, or I got a bottle that was past its prime. The essential oil in it now separates and must be shaken up. This was never the case before. Also, I do not find it to be nearly as strong as it used to be. All in all, I still think it&#x27;s good, but nowhere near as good as it used to be. Not sure I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> taste is different,it is pretty strong,so i dilute it,but i think it works well,i do not use it every day</li>
    <li> Wow! I really like his mouthwash. I&#x27;m going back to natural oils for a number of things. I find this really keeps plaque and swollen gums at bay. The price is too high, and for that, I took off a star.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dentist and proven effective for condition.</li>
    <li> Love this...keeps away the stank and makes my mouth feel clean and healthy. Burns a little bit sometimes, but if I dilute it a tad with water it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> It is OK but expensive.  We gave it a chance through two bottles&#x27; worth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on my experience with Young Living Essential Oils and customer reviews. I was diagnosed with gum disease and wanted to prevent further problems. I use it with the Thieves toothpaste, and together they seem to be doing a great job reducing plaque build up, killing  bacteria, and keeping my breath fresh for a very long time. I have reordered 5 more bottles!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash was first introduced to me by my dentist in&lt;br /&gt;Costa Rica.  I was so impressed with the way my breath tasted&lt;br /&gt;that I ordered it when I arrived home from my vacation.</li>
    <li> No other mouthwash like it. Well worth the price.Very smooth, clean and crisp</li>
    <li> The label on this says \\&quot;no alcohol, synthetic dyes, artificial flavors or preservatives.\\&quot; Sounds good and natural, right? WRONG! Imagine my surprise when the ingredient list includes polysorbate 80, an emulsifier that has been shown to be hazardous on skin contact, inhalation and ingestion. Further, it&#x27;s been shown to cause sterility in rats when injected. I was really excited about trying this product, but I cannot recommend it under these circumstances. I&#x27;d rather have a brand that you have to shake before using than something that uses chemicals to keep the solution uniform.</li>
    <li> I love the product!  You can feel it working! I would re-order, but the only issue is when you pour out the product, much of it leaks out of the top and down the side.  The bottle needs to be re-worked!  The product is so expensive that you don&#x27;t want to waste a drop and I find that I can&#x27;t help but waste some almost each time because the neck of the bottle causes slight spillage.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I love the mouthwash!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product. It&#x27;s very strong and you only need use a small amount. It is a bit more expensive compared to other natural mouthwashes.</li>
    <li> great! this is a really nice hygiene product. I love the quality.  I will be buying more in the future.</li>
