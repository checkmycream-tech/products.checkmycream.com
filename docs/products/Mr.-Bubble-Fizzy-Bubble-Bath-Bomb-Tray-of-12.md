      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Kids love it.</li>

      <li>The tub cleans easily with no residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but it was fine.</li>
      <li>I think kids will enjoy it.</li>

      <li>They smell good and don&#x27;t bother my sons sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The kids loved the fizzy-ness of the bubble bombs, but unlike the liquid Mr. Bubble, these bombs created no lasting bubbles.</li>
      <li>This is trash try out bath bombs they can do more then just fizzy and change colors bath bombs are relaxing for adults and fun for kids kids bath bombs have toys in them for the adult bath bombs there are so many of them all of them are so relaxing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own) at my local grocery store.</li>
      <li>We discovered her love of these with one of the bath bombs from Lush.  </li>
      <li>only complaint is that they need more bubbles, but still a good product!</li>
      <li>but our daughter does love them and turns the water a nice pink or Blue color</li>
      <li>Pretty neat.</li>
      <li>They work get you super clean and have fun at the same time also.</li>
      <li>My niece LOVES her fizzy baths so much we can pretty much bribe her with these to get her to do anything when it&#x27;s time for us to watch her.</li>
      <li>but they do dye the water a vibrant pink or blue and have a very nice smell.</li>
      <li>Just something that could make bath time a little more fun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different bath fizzers with my little girls and they love these ones the most.</li>
      <li>They do not bubble or fizz a whole lot</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fizz as much as it said it would.</li>
      <li>I should have read the other reviews more closely.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t very fizzy or bubbly, but the hot pink and ocean blue baths that result are still pretty fun for the 10 and under crowd!</li>
      <li>Great smell tough!</li>
      <li>I tried to break it up a little to spread the fizzing sensation throughout the bath but by the time I was able to it was almost gone.</li>
      <li>we tried pink and blue at the same time and bath water turned bright purple.</li>
      <li>Ours turn our water color (blue or pink) but they don&#x27;t make many bubbles at all, which is what my toddler was after.</li>
      <li>and they were completely underwhelmed.</li>
      <li>As far as fizzy, that is debatable too.  </li>
      <li>even my 8 yr old son enjoys them.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a direct quote from them.  </li>
      <li>Stick with the old fashioned bubble bath</li>
      <li>Maybe it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>and they are not oily, But Myself and my son Loves them they are worth the money for 12 you get 6 pink and 6 blue..</li>
      <li>The bath bombs didn&#x27;t fizz much, and I expected them to make bubbles, which they didn&#x27;t do at all.</li>
      <li>The pink didn&#x27;t really show up that well.</li>
      <li>They turn the bath either blue or pink very vibrantly (and purple if you mix them).  </li>

<li> It did turn my bath very pink though.</li>
<li> Bath bomb is a misnomer, they barely fizzled and slowly dissolved, with no bubbles and dyed the water slightly.</li>
<li> These little guys have a chalky smell.</li>
<li> and I have trouble finding them in the store</li>
<li> They are not really fizzy either - just a very small amount of fizzing going on.</li>
<li> These fizzy bombs have very, very little fizz.</li>
<li> Very few bubbles or fizz.</li>
<li> Very hard to to get out of packaging, and doesn&#x27;t fizzle</li>
<li> It smells fake, to the point</li>
<li> These are terrible, create no bubbles at all</li>

    <li> These are so-so. We were disappointed as we love Mr. Bubble bubble bath.  These fizzy bombs have very, very little fizz. The blue is very blue in the bath. They liked that. The pink didn&#x27;t really show up that well. We won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Not too many fizzies, but the smell is nice.</li>
    <li> It did fizz but that is about it.  Stick with the old fashioned bubble bath you&#x27;ll get more for your money</li>
    <li> My son loves mr bubbles fizzy bath bombs. It is the only way I can get him in the tub without a fight! They smell good and don&#x27;t bother my sons sensitive skin</li>
    <li> These color the bath water without staining the tub. They aren&#x27;t very fizzy or bubbly, but the hot pink and ocean blue baths that result are still pretty fun for the 10 and under crowd!</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for your kids.  The price for these make it easy to give as a gift or reward for good behavior without breaking the bank.

    <li> It didn&#x27;t fizz as much as it said it would. It still smelled really good though.</li>
    <li> First of all, there are very few bubbles with this product.  The amount of foam is minimal, so if that&#x27;s why you are buying it move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I still give these a good review.  They turn the bath either blue or pink very vibrantly (and purple if you mix them).  They smell really good.  Your child can use any bits of undissolved bath bomb to finger paint on the side of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And mom&#x27;s favorite thing?  The tub cleans easily with no residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit it....I&#x27;ve used them myself.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they need more bubbles, but still a good product!</li>
    <li> While this turned the bath color it produced no bubbles which defeats the purpose of bubble bath.</li>
    <li> My Grandson loved it!</li>
    <li> These are terrible, create no bubbles at all</li>
    <li> Good value for the money. Kids love it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! This is trash try out bath bombs they can do more then just fizzy and change colors bath bombs are relaxing for adults and fun for kids kids bath bombs have toys in them for the adult bath bombs there are so many of them all of them are so relaxing. Don&#x27;t buy this buy bath bombs there so much better for kids and adults</li>
    <li> Gift for grandchildren. However they cannot use them due to a skin allergy. Given to a child who loves it.</li>
    <li> My kids will only use the blue bubble bombs...because the pink ones make the water in the bathtub look like blood.  That&#x27;s a direct quote from them.  I have no problem with it and use those myself, but I wish you could buy the blue ones separately.  If you don&#x27;t have anyone in your family who would call the water &amp;#34;bloody&amp;#34; using the pink...then you will enjoy it.  The bubbles smell nice and it makes a relaxing bath.  A good product but not the best thing you&#x27;ve ever experienced in your whole life.  Nice for the price, though.</li>
    <li> These little guys have a chalky smell. They are not really fizzy either - just a very small amount of fizzing going on. The most impressive think about them is the clear bright color that they give off - we tried pink and blue at the same time and bath water turned bright purple. Pretty neat.</li>
    <li> great motivation to make bath time fun! even my 8 yr old son enjoys them.</li>
    <li> Ours turn our water color (blue or pink) but they don&#x27;t make many bubbles at all, which is what my toddler was after.</li>
    <li> They work get you super clean and have fun at the same time also.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make bubbles or fizz.  It does color the water.  Made my skin feel itchy after I got out of the bath.  The shrink wrap around the bombs says made in China......  Over priced.  Won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different bath fizzers with my little girls and they love these ones the most. They smell nice and the girls like to play with them in the tub. Also seems to take awhile to dissolve so the \\&quot;fun\\&quot; isn&#x27;t over in like 10 seconds like some fizzers. Just wish they weren&#x27;t quite so pricey.</li>
    <li> This stuff is gross. It smells fake, to the point it turns my stomach to smell it. As far as fizzy, that is debatable too.  I was expecting something along the lines of an alkaselter tablet, these are more like opening an unshaken soda can. I threw the rest away and obviously do not recommend.</li>
    <li> smells delicious the pink ones do not look like blood in the tub as from a Previous comment, they do not bubble as much as they should but I love them, they do not stain your tub and they are not oily, But Myself and my son Loves them they are worth the money for 12 you get 6 pink and 6 blue..</li>
    <li> The kids loved the fizzy-ness of the bubble bombs, but unlike the liquid Mr. Bubble, these bombs created no lasting bubbles.</li>
    <li> The bath bombs didn&#x27;t fizz much, and I expected them to make bubbles, which they didn&#x27;t do at all. They just changed the color of the water.</li>
    <li> My daughter thinks these things are great and I have trouble finding them in the store so I bought them on here.  They do not bubble or fizz a whole lot but they do dye the water a vibrant pink or blue and have a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> Very few bubbles or fizz. Great smell tough!</li>
    <li> I bought one of those (98 cents on it&#x27;s own) at my local grocery store. I&#x27;ve been looking at bath bombs online and wanted to sample what one would do. It did fizz but there was no lather. It fizzed in place. I tried to break it up a little to spread the fizzing sensation throughout the bath but by the time I was able to it was almost gone. It did turn my bath very pink though. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected but it was fine. I think kids will enjoy it. Just something that could make bath time a little more fun.</li>
    <li> Very hard to to get out of packaging, and doesn&#x27;t fizzle but our daughter does love them and turns the water a nice pink or Blue color and it doesn&#x27;t stain the jacuzzi or cause any issue with filter and jets in the tub.</li>
    <li> Very little bubbles and barely changed the water colors....just buy some bubble bath and some mood lighting.</li>
    <li> These make your whole bathroom smell good. Good bubbles too! Got them for my husband, but I think my grandkids will like them too!</li>
