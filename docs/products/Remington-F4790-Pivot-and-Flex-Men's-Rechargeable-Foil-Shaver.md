      <li>I must say, the battery life on this shaver is remarkable.</li>
      <li>The shave is good and the ability to use the rechargeable battery instead of needing a plug came in very handy when over in Europe and didn&#x27;t have the plug converter.  </li>

      <li>Good weight</li>
      <li>This is a good electric shaver for the price.</li>
      <li>I bought this one because Remington is supposed to be a good name in razors.</li>

      <li>a close, smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer is also excellent.  </li>
      <li>This is really a good trimmer.</li>
      <li>The Remington F4790 Pivot &amp; Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Foil Shaver that I purchased does not give me a good shave.</li>
      <li>This is a good razor.</li>
      <li>I happen to have a separate beard and sideburns trimmer that I prefer to use, and that&#x27;s good because I would never use the one that comes built-in with this.    </li>
      <li>That is how good it is.  </li>

      <li>Good shaver for price.</li>
      <li>Good ergonomics.  </li>
      <li>He especially liked the light weight.</li>
      <li>I get ALMOST as good a shave as with a blade</li>
      <li>I like this razor because it does a good job on my whiskers.</li>
      <li>A good shaver for the money.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly good  </li>
      <li>Razor works good how ever the screen did not hold up well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good close shave</li>
      <li>br /&gt;never felt as if a shaver did as good a job as a blade.</li>
      <li>Good trade-off?</li>
      <li>It is not flimsy or made cheaply the best that I can</li>
      <li>So why do I say it&#x27;s still a good shaver?  </li>
      <li>Great ergonomics -- very comfortable to hold</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver</li>
      <li>So glad we tried this route!</li>
      <li>It still makes a nice close shave as maintain per instructions.</li>
      <li>However, if one does a good job of skin conditioning, one should be okay.  </li>
      <li>In addition, it has a floating head that went over the contours of his face, effectively.</li>
      <li>I used to own a Norelco two years ago, and it shaved closer than this Remington model.  </li>
      <li>, trimmer is handy and works well.</li>
      <li>which is nice.</li>
      <li>The pivoting acton is nice.</li>
      <li>After giving this the requisite 4-6 weeks of adjustment period, I can honestly say that I might just keep going with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the money though this seems to be a nice sturdy shaver.</li>
      <li>That is nice when you are traveling.</li>
      <li>is the best I could do, the man is very frugal with words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with a lot of extras.&lt;br /&gt;However, it feels nice and sturdy when you use it.</li>
      <li>pop up trimmer is a nice touch as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He was very favorably impressed.</li>
      <li>Kind of a pain</li>
      <li>The shave fits nicely in your hand and glides over all the angles on your face.</li>
      <li>Quick Efficient Cleans easy &amp; Best of all</li>
      <li>It charged very quickly and felt good in his hands.</li>
      <li>It recharges quickly and works great.</li>
      <li>well I recommend it, and it&#x27;s very easy to use price</li>
      <li>This shaver may not be perfect, but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it so far and think I&#x27;ll be sticking with foil for awhile.  </li>
      <li>There is a plastic cover on top of the foil part, but it pops off very easily.  </li>
      <li>It delivers  a consistently close shave; others have needed screen or blade changes after 6 months, and this is still showing no signs of needing a change after 7 months; the instruction manual says you can get 1 year on the blades &amp; screen, which is a great savings when blades/screen cost $20.   </li>
      <li>I found it to be a solid choice, blending together a good price, good quality and good ergonomics.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this shaver performs very well, providing a nice close shave, as good as the shave by Braun&#x27;s best, but at a quarter of the price.</li>
      <li>It is very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>The shaver head enclosure is made of a very cheap material and is flimsy, no design thoughts given to cleaning it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice razor but to be honest I didnt find it to be anything special.</li>
      <li>The battery life is really good and the battery pack re-charges quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to replace blades and screen when needed, pivoting head is nice</li>

    <li> Good shaver for price. Be careful with cleaning blade assembly they are very fragile.  Use compressed air to clean.  Too much handling with sreen off will break the blade attachments and you will need a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Razor works good how ever the screen did not hold up well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m keeping this razor but I believe that the older TC-series is better.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is louder, but does have a pivoting  head.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two of these in the last 3 months.  Apparently, the foil is allowed to come in contact with the vibrating cutters as the screen \\&quot;burns out\\&quot; and develops a whole rather quickly.  And forget about just getting the new foil heads, as they cost nearly as much as the razor itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to shaving with a disposable razor and using a beard trimmer to keep my beard in shape (right now I keep it at about a \\&quot;2.\\&quot;) So when I saw this, with a \\&quot;three position trimmer,\\&quot; I thought it would be a perfect one-stop shop for all of my facial grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not how it worked out.  The three positions for the trimmer are actually 1. Off 2. Keep head from pivoting 3. On.  So I feel the \\&quot;three position trimmer,\\&quot; even if factually correct, is a bit of false advertising.  That being said, this isn&#x27;t an awful electric shaver--it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it works fairly well.  But I&#x27;m not going to be using it much anymore, because a plain disposable does the job much better.  If you miss one day, you&#x27;ve got to use the trimmer blade to cut the growth down to a level where the razor can get it, which in some cases makes shaving take twice as long, and sometimes three times: shaving, circling back with the trimmer for long bits that the shaver didn&#x27;t catch,then shaving again.  It&#x27;s much easier with a blade.  Also, I feel like I have to really put pressure on the razor to get a clean shave, which can&#x27;t be good for my skin--it feels like I&#x27;m jamming a meat tenderizer into my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I made the mistake of shaving with this before putting on some sunscreen.  OUCH!  I hadn&#x27;t realized how bad the razor burn was--I won&#x27;t be doing that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be a good travel razor, if you don&#x27;t want to mess with shaving cream on a trip, but I gave this thing a 2-3 week chance as my everyday razor and it just didn&#x27;t pass muster.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy compared to my old electric shaver from Braun, but it is quick and close shaving.  The shave fits nicely in your hand and glides over all the angles on your face. This is important on those mornings when your eyes are barely open.  The real question is does it shave as closely as a good blade shaver. My scientific tests indicate that it does not. However, it certainly does well enough to get you through the day, and even through the night with the right woman. Some like it rough. For those that don&#x27;t, a quick 30 second touch up more than does the job. This is a good razor.</li>
    <li> It has been a long time since my old shaver died, I&#x27;ve been getting by with a blade but decided to go back to electric, so I was curious to see if shavers have changed in a while. Short answer, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and if you looking for a product that gives you a close comfortable shave this one is just fine. I&#x27;ve used a number of shavers over the years and this one is pretty much like the rest, nothing that really sets it apart from others or makes it worse. The pivoting acton is nice. It glides across the face without pulling. The shave is close (but not Gillette Mach III close)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real beef with the unit is the power button is sometimes a little hard to press but that&#x27;s no big deal or even enough to knock a star off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Close comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;Nice piviot action&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None really for a shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion- A good shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so bitter that I bought this.  Was in a hurry and grabbed an average priced razor for travel. This thing managed to irritate my skin, miss a ton of hairs and give me a rash. I rarely review things so the fact that I&#x27;m on here speaks volumes.  Awful pos.</li>
    <li> The battery seems to hold the charge for good 10 days for my normal shaving. The trimmer could have been designed better. It does not extend out far enough for timmer my side burn.</li>
    <li> I purchased the F4790 shaver seven months ago when on a trip and had forgotten my other rechargeable shaver, and am surprised that such an inexpensive shaver  could be so great.  When I purchased mine, there were two almost identical shavers...one box said it had titanium blades and the other did not.  I opted for the 4790 with the titanium blades.  Unlike some of the other reviewers who were first time users of cordless shavers,  I have shaved with a cordless shaver most of my adult life.  I have tried rotary shavers which did not deliver a close shave, and finally settled into Remington screen shavers.  My most recent shavers were in the Remington MS series deluxe shavers at around $89-109 each, that I compare this shaver to.  In brief, there is no comparison.  I have found this shaver to be the best for the money in spite of its relatively inexpensive cost compared to some of the other shavers available.    Advantages:  * It delivers  a consistently close shave; others have needed screen or blade changes after 6 months, and this is still showing no signs of needing a change after 7 months; the instruction manual says you can get 1 year on the blades &amp; screen, which is a great savings when blades/screen cost $20.   * Surprisingly good  on  getting a close shave on neck  * I get 15 daily shaves out of one charge; my previous Remingtons started out with 5-6 days per charge and within a year were down to needing a charge every 3-4 days.    * the trimmer does not seem to utilize any extra drain on the battery.  Previous shavers seemed to quickly drain the battery when using the trimmer, even briefly.  * the flexible head seems to glide effortlessly along the face, chin, and neck.  Have never nicked myself with this shaver along chin line, which was pretty typical of previous shavers.  * I always thought 3 blades was better, but this shaver shaves closer with the two blades than previous much more expensive shavers with 3 blades.  * Can be rinsed under the faucet.  I&#x27;ve had bad luck doing this with other shavers, as the ground hairs would cling to the blades and eventually clog them.  So every few days I just clean the heads with the provided brush and by gently tapping the foil assembly on the sink.    * Can be used AC if necessary, and has an LED light to indicate when it needs to be charged, which takes less than an hour.  Disadvantages - Hindrances - IMHO should not be deciding factors in purchasing this great shaver:  * does not have a case.  But if you have cases from old shavers, most likely will fit..  For me this was not an issue.  Or buy a $100 shaver that might not shave as close and they will throw in the case.    * the shaver head clear plastic shield only fits on the shaver with the word REMINGTON right-side up facing you.  If you don&#x27;t take the time to be sure it is right-side up, the cover could fall off the shaver and damage the foil.  * when removing the foil assembly to clean, it only fits one way as well.  One side of the assembly has 2 lines on it and the back side has 3.  You need the 2 sides facing you in order to easily snap on the foil assembly after cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned electric razors my whole life, most of which were Remington models.  This one has a design flaw.  The flaw is that it is awkward to remove piece containing the screen for cleaning.  All of the OLDER models I used were designed better because the tabs you pressed on to remove the piece containing the screen were located so that your fingertips were not near the screen.  With this  model you have to press on these two big pieces of plastic near the screen which is awkward and not as easy as with the older models.    It was awkward removing the piece that holds the screen for cleaning, and in less than 2 weeks my fingers slipped and crushed the screen.  I don&#x27;t really recommend this razor.    Update: Due to my issue, Remington is sending me new screen/cutters.    I also discovered that if you leave the plastic cap on and press the edges of the cap, it is easier to remove the piece holding the screen (and would make it unlikely that you would accidentally crush the screen). However, the user manual doesn&#x27;t mention this. Granted, I still prefer the way older models were designed in which you simply had to press 2 tabs on the sides to remove the piece holding the screens.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Remington Microscreen 2 (DA-307) because it was only a few dollars more than the replacement screens and the battery in my old one was finally going out after 3-4 years of constant use.  Overall, I like the new F4790.  It cuts about as good as my old one, but it doesn&#x27;t do quite as well on my neck...it requires multiple passes and still leaves a fine stubble.  I think it&#x27;s because of the pivoting head.  The old shaver didn&#x27;t pivot, which allowed me to keep more pressure against the skin.  Another minor minor irritation is the ergonomics...it&#x27;s not as comfortable in the hand as the DA-307.  The pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pop up\\&quot; very far.  I like a pop up that projects away from the body of the shaver which makes it easier to trim around ears, etc.  You can still do it with this one, but it&#x27;s just not as easy.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the F4790 since I only paid $29 (local retail store) but I&#x27;ll probably look for something else when the screen on this one needs replaced.</li>
    <li> My boys are coming of age and I was looking to get a new razor for the oldest, so I was glad to get to check out the Remington F4790. I found it to be a solid choice, blending together a good price, good quality and good ergonomics. Certainly there are other razors that do better in any one category, but combination of the three in this unit makes it a great choice in its price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked were the ergonomics, the independent pivoting blades (titanium, compared to cheaper models), and how easy it is to clean up - you can even run the foils and blades under the faucet. Charge time was quick too and seems to last longer than many other razor batteries. It can easily be used cordless or with the cord. On the not-so-great side, I found the unit to be quite a bit louder than my old razor, and the pop-up trimmer was rather close to the body of the unit. The quality of the shave itself was in the middle - certainly not bad, but not the best I&#x27;ve had with electric models either. Overall, a solid choice and pretty good value.</li>
    <li> My teenage son has a bit more than the light peach fuzz, so it was time to pull out the razor! Instead of having him spend ten-fifteen minutes shaving with cream and a regular razor, I thought we&#x27;d try the electric razor. The Remington is perfect! It&#x27;s easy on his skin, and easy to use. It recharges quickly and works great. No complaints. So glad we tried this route!</li>
    <li> I had my husband give this razor a whirl. He hasn&#x27;t had an electric razor in a long time. He has always had to get razor burn to achieve a close and clean shave. We thought we would try this one out. He said it was better that the others he has tried. As far as those in it&#x27;s class, it seems to be of a decent quality. But... the ultimate answer was, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll stick to my X-Treme&#x27;s.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wife&#x27;s observance: His face, upon shaving with this razor, did look rather red. Since shaving is a daily thing, over time, perhaps his skin would \\&quot;toughen-up\\&quot;. Maybe it works better on other skin types?</li>
    <li> Another great product by Remington. Delivered as promised.  A great shave and the cleaning of the razor was excellent. A smooth shave that didn&#x27;t pull the hairs. A razor worth investing in.</li>
    <li> While this shaver has the good points of: working strongly from the battery; a washable feature; and gives a decent shave it also has the downsides of being too powerful when plugged in (like a weed-whacker whacked out) and rough on the skin. Compared to my previous razor (starts with a B and rhymes with dawn) this razor has power, but lacks refinement. I found it too harsh on my skin for my tastes. If you are someone who has worked up a bit of calus upon the skin, this might work for you. My desk-job baby-face just doedn&#x27;t prefer it. It works for the money, but it seems designed more for the hard-working man.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shaver and he and I have been talking about this product quite a bit lately. And in fact, I plugged it in and tried it out on my legs. Nice and smooth with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a frilly shaver. It doesn&#x27;t come with a lot of extras.&lt;br /&gt;However, it feels nice and sturdy when you use it. You can pick it up and you know you have something in your hand. It is not flimsy or made cheaply the best that I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have found that you can keep it unplugged and use it for about two weeks without needing a charge. That is nice when you are traveling. It also works on the cord. This is a nice thing because we have had one shaver that would not work on the cord, the cord was ONLY for charging the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that my husband  has been complaining about and it seems many other reviewers are as well is the trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t pop out very far and it was in the wrong place according to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money though this seems to be a nice sturdy shaver.</li>
    <li> Since you asked (I was sent an email request by Amazon to review my purchase...), this is not a very good shaver, even after giving my face 3 or 4 weeks to get used to it, as the instructions request.     Weak shaver that can only handle a one day \\&quot;beard\\&quot;. If you have more than one day&#x27;s growth, like not shaving for a weekend, you first need to use the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; to get it down to a length that the main shaver can handle, which is kind of rough. And the shaver itself is mediocre on all shaves -- not a very close/clean shave; loud and unpleasant to use.    My 20 year old electric rotary Norelco was far better until it finally gave up the ghost.    I&#x27;ve turned to using a Gillette Mach 3, which works great even without using shaving cream (for real) since it has a built-in lubrication strip; just warm up your face with a hot/warm face cloth and moisten the strip for a moment in the hot water, too.  Only about $1/week for cartridges (which last 8-10 shaves), and a very fast, easy, close and quiet shave.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail and doest even work.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Having been a user of relatively expensive shavers from Braun, I was rather skeptical that this very inexpensive shaver could provide as good a shave. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this shaver performs very well, providing a nice close shave, as good as the shave by Braun&#x27;s best, but at a quarter of the price. The battery life is really good and the battery pack re-charges quickly. The only cons I can list is that the overall curved shape is a little awkward to hold and the whole thing feels a bit \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot; and cheap. The pivoting head works nicely, but the sides of the shaver (on either side of the foil) do tend to scratch a little as you shave as they extend out further than the foil. Nothing painful, just a little annoying. And finally, it is decidedly more noisy than the top of the line Braun models I&#x27;m used to using.    Overall though, for the price, there is little I can find to complain about.  I most certainly recommend this shaver to anyone on a budget that&#x27;s looking for a nice close shave from an electric razor. It beats any shaver I&#x27;ve tried in the under $50 price range.</li>
    <li> When I had purchased this shaver I had expected it to easily transition from shaving from my neck to my face because of it&#x27;s pivot design.  However I found that the pivot function was actually much more of a useless feature (figured it was more of an advertising gimmick than an actual feature )  This is because it took a lot of effort for the actual shaver head to pivot.  I felt like i had to manually move the head in order for it to pivot instead of just gliding it over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it does provide a pretty comfortable and close shave.  It doesn&#x27;t pick up everything and a few passes are necessary but that is expected from a cheap to mid-range shaver.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased at how close it shaves but disappointed in its so called \\&quot;pivot\\&quot; feature.</li>
    <li> Throughout the 19 years I&#x27;ve been shaving, I&#x27;ve tried four or five electic razors - of various styles and price points. A couple have been decent, one was good, but I always returned to the manual razor for one reason or another. After giving this the requisite 4-6 weeks of adjustment period, I can honestly say that I might just keep going with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you&#x27;ll never get as close a shave as with a manual razor, this electric gets closer than I&#x27;ve ever seen - and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face irritated, bumpy, red, dry, etc., which is always the result (even if only a bit) of manual razors. Good trade-off? I think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, I love the fact that it&#x27;s washable, it charges quickly (5-minutes for a one-use quick charge), and holds a charge long enough for most normal travel plans, so you don&#x27;t need to bring a charger base/cord when you&#x27;re on vacation or traveling for work. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price- at less than $40, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> My husband used this razor and it gave him razor burn!  The shave was very uncomfortable.  Although it did give him a pretty close shave the pain was not worth it.  He has gone back to his Gilette Fusion.</li>
    <li> Extremely loud, does not shave the under-chin and neck areas well at all and caused a burning sensation on the cheek areas which were the only areas shaved well.</li>
    <li> Great shave.  Great price.    Easy to use.  Easy to maintain.    Replace cutter assembly every twelve months.  Head guard easily snaps on and off.    Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I used to have the cheap F3790. It died. I bought this &#x27;new and improved&#x27; model today. Does it give a close shave? Yes. It it unwieldily, clunkier and larger than older models? Yes. Are the blades so deeply recessed that incredibly annoying plastic edges poke and scrape at your face while you are trying to shave? Yes. I find it impossible to believe that any men actually tested this razor before they put it on the market. Pass on this, it is terrible.    Thanks to Amazon, I just found and ordered another of my old model, the F3790, and a replacement blade and foil for TEN dollars less than I paid for this one.</li>
    <li> My nephew has just started shaving and his mother was biting her nails over the thought of using a razor, so I thought what better introduction into the world of shaving than the Remington F4790 Pivot and Flex Rechargeable Foil Shaver-I have included his review and as you can see, he is quite charged over the gift.      \\&quot;When I got this electric razor I was able to use it right away and found it was already charged  pretty well. Also, when I did have to charge it, the razor was ready to go again very  quickly, which is good if you need to shave on-the-go. As for the shave quality, it is a   pretty close shave for such an inexpensive electric razor however, the foil part doesn&#x27;t always get the hair on the first try, so you have to run it over a few times. The pop out trimmer does  not come away from the actual razor, which makes it harder to trim around beards. I   found the light design fits very nicely into your hand and is easy to clean. You can rinse the blades and foil in water, but not the actual razor itself, since it is electronic. Also it comes with a cleaning brush that you can use to get the stubborn hairs off  the blade. It doesn&#x27;t come with a case though, so if your picky about stuff like that or if you travel alot that could be a problem. There is a plastic cover on top of the foil part, but it pops off very easily.  Overall, I think this razor is a good deal for its price.\\&quot;    I couldn&#x27;t have said it any better myself.  Good job!</li>
    <li> I shave once every 3 to 4 days. When using this shaver, it just takes too long to get a reasonable shave. To top it off, I have to finish the job with a razor to remove the few hair strands left. I like the trimmer though (therefore the 2 stars). This product delivers on the other claims such as washable, 5 minute quick charge and ergonomic design.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from an old remington which had lost some parts.  It was about 20 years old.  This new one is great.  Love the moveable heads.  The shave is good and the ability to use the rechargeable battery instead of needing a plug came in very handy when over in Europe and didn&#x27;t have the plug converter.  I was able to buy the razor and a pack of replacement heads for the same price as just the razor at Walmart.</li>
    <li> This shaver is many steps backwards in design from the other 3 foils shavers that are now discontinued. The shaver head enclosure is made of a very cheap material and is flimsy, no design thoughts given to cleaning it. - almost impossible to clean the heads.  The trimmer does not extend enough for proper use. I am disappointed in this product, not certain why management would discontinued the older units which work very well. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap - costs less than the replacement blades for more expensive razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can run off power cord or rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough on face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer to get a smooth shave which means it irritates the skin more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side-burn trimmer next to useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this razor as it was pretty cheap and it certainly has not dazzled me.  It does not give a very close cut; I have owned foil razors in the past that did a much better job thsn this one.  On pro is that it does seem to hold a charge for a long time and it does have a notification when it needs to be charged.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my son and have not used it myself; however, his enjoyment of the shaver was very clear.  This is his first rechargeable shaver and he was very impressed at how gentle the shaver was on his skin.  Once he got used to the feel of the shaver, he found that it was faster and smoother than anything he had used before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as other reviewers have noted the shaver is not very effective on the neck and it does, of course, require some cleaning every now and then.  It does seem a bit pricey but the pivot and flex features of the product do seem to work very well and men with sensitive skin, in particular, will like this product -- as long as they are the kind of men who don&#x27;t mind cleaning the shaver out every now and then (as opposed to throwing something away and grabbing a fresh razor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good but not excellent product -- according to my son.</li>
    <li> For the price this a very good shaver. It does nick me every once in awhile. That is because I never prepare my face first, I just pick it up and shave. Never used an electric shaver before and it is easy to use compared to the shaving cream and blade I was using. For the price you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver new for a month now, i had given it to my son to use, it is way too noisy and not smooth operating unit, you pay for what you&#x27;ll get, the head is not really flexy, the trimmer is not clear out for trimming.  I rather buy the Norelco any day.</li>
    <li> For the past twenty or so years I&#x27;ve bounced back and forth, shaving with a blade for a few years and then shaving with a Norelco-style rotary for a few years.  I got this razor for Christmas last year, to see how I like a foil electric for a change.  I wish I had known what I was missing!  This shaver may not be perfect, but I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it so far and think I&#x27;ll be sticking with foil for awhile.  Here are what I&#x27;ve found to be the ups and downs with this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;(1) I had heard that the trade-off with foil shavers is that they give you a closer shave, but at the expense of more skin irritation than a rotary.  Your face may vary, but I instead found the best of both worlds.  I get ALMOST as good a shave as with a blade (the neck is still a difficult area), but after 4 or 5 months of use there&#x27;s still no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Supports cordless AND corded operation.  This is a big deal for me because getting the best mileage out of a rechargeable battery means letting it run down as close to empty as you can.  But if you let the battery completely drain, some shavers won&#x27;t let you run off the wall outlet (the cord is only for recharging the battery).  With this shaver you can treat the battery right and still not worry about getting stuck without a shave one morning.  The battery life itself is awesome, by the way... I&#x27;m averaging around three weeks of use between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Good ergonomics.  Not too heavy, but has some substance to it... feels great in the hand.  Seems sturdy and well-built.  I can&#x27;t decide if the pivoting head helps or is just a gimmick, but for me at least it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;(1) I don&#x27;t expect the ultimate in frilly luxuries with a mid-range shaver, but I do expect it to come with at least a cloth or nylon fitted travel case.  This comes with NOTHING... just the shaver, a cord, and a plastic foil cover that would pop off after 10 seconds in a suitcase.  Those fitted nylon bags that Norelco shavers come with can&#x27;t cost more than a few dimes apiece, so I was really disappointed to see them cut corners on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) I agree with another reviewer in that I prefer sideburn trimmers that pop-OUT, away from the shaver, rather than pop-UP right alongside the foil.  I happen to have a separate beard and sideburns trimmer that I prefer to use, and that&#x27;s good because I would never use the one that comes built-in with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Apparently Remington revamped their men&#x27;s shaver lineup last year, and it&#x27;s still EXTREMELY difficult to find replacement foils and cutters for the new models!  I cannot find replacement parts for this shaver in any local store.  When I first got the shaver last Christmas, the only source I could find was an online store operating out of England.  Now you can find them in a wider number of boutiques, one of whom sells through Amazon.  However, even today (April 2010) Remington still hasn&#x27;t updated THEIR OWN online store with the replacement parts yet!  This isn&#x27;t the dealbreaker that it was before Amazon starting carrying them, which is why I held off on writing a review.  But it still a little irritating, even if the shaver itself has been irritation-free.th can&#x27;t cost more than a few dimes apiece, so I was really disappointed to see them cut corners on this.

    <li> The Remington F4790 Pivot &amp; Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Foil Shaver that I purchased does not give me a good shave. In fact, I have used it only a few times and have discarded it. It is very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington&#x27;s MS series of shavers for a few years, and got tired of looking for replacement blades and screens. Because it&#x27;s barely more for another shaver than replacement blades, I decided to get the F4790 instead of the F3790, because it has the Titanium blades, and pretty inexpensive replacement blades and screen.     Pros: It shaves as close as the others I&#x27;ve used (MS290 and 390), battery lasts at least a week, lightweight, and easy to handle.    Cons: It&#x27;s loud, comparatively, because the \\&quot;clamshell\\&quot; swivel head acts like a megaphone! It&#x27;s pretty hard to get the screen off to clean the blades (no quick-release buttons), and hard to get in the corners to clean.    Overall, for the price, you get a good shaver, with a few quirks. Find me one that doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This is really a good trimmer. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has to trim his/her beard daily. Except for the skin below the neck it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Great Razor! Shaves very close!</li>
    <li> Needing an electric shaver in a hurry, I bought this Remington at Target for about $40.  That was about six months ago.  It has worked OK, doing the basic shaving job four or five times a week.  But as other reviewers have said, it doesn&#x27;t shave close on the neck, requiring repeated passes to get it close.  I have to use a soap-and-water razor a couple times a week to get things right.    When I bought this shaver, I knew not to expect much for the price -- fair enough.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was the poor quality of the foil screen.  The package clearly states \\&quot;Replace your heads and cutters every 12 months . . . .\\&quot; and I was prepared to do that.  But after about four months, it started developing tiny holes, which made shaving difficult, to say the least.  Two months later (a total of six months after purchase), the foil is unusable.   So I contacted Remington Customer Service, and their response was \\&quot;We are sorry to inform you that the replacement screens and cutters need to be replaced every 4-6 months.\\&quot;  I responded by asking them to explain why their packaging says \\&quot;every 12 months\\&quot; and have not heard back.      I bought a replacement foil, and will keep this shaver for occasional use.  However, given the very brief life of the foil and the fact that their Customer Service brushed me off, my next shaver will be a different brand.</li>
    <li> This is a good electric shaver for the price. My son also tried this shaver; he has an average beard, and shaves daily. He said it worked fine compared to other electric shavers he has used in the past, and in some ways it even performed better than most, so he was pleasantly surprised. If you are looking for a super electric shaver with more bells and whistles, then this is probably not the model for you. It makes a good back-up shaver for those who normally shave with a disposable razor, especially when time is short, and it does work in the shower. Likewise, it would be perfect as a first time shaver for any young man, because it is easy to use and to recharge. All in all, a very good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for many years (more than 20) and the Remington 4790 is better than any Braun 700 series or Panasonic wet and dry top of the line shaver I have used. The shave is close and fast with very little irritation--closer and faster than any other shaver I have used. I only wish this was a \\&quot;wet and dry\\&quot; shaver since I prefer to shave with gel or cream . Otherwise, no complaints. David in Florida.</li>
    <li> I have used a Remington Shaver(different model)for at least 15 years. This one is terrible. The heads are recessed just enough to allow the supports on either side to scrape across your face and irritate your skin. By being slightly below the supports the cutters cannot get close enough to your skin without the supports gouging you. Much less get right up under the nose area. This is the only model I have ever had where I HAD to use a talcum powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this thing even though it has a terrible design flaw.  While it shaves OK and holds a charge well, the foil head has to be held on the body to work.  The stupid little metal nubs that hold the foil head onto the shaving body don&#x27;t stick out enough anymore to dig into the foil head holes, causing it pop off instantly. I have to hold the thing together with my thumb to use it.  Bought from Target and within 6 months was a problem. Spend a couple more bucks and buy a Braun like I&#x27;m about to.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after my Norelco finally gave out on me. I had never tried a Remington but the price was low and because of the economy I&#x27;m trying to pinch pennies. So I gave this one a try thinking \\&quot;Who knows, maybe I don&#x27;t really need an expensive razor?\\&quot;. Unfortunately the saying is true, you get what you pay for. The razor is extremely loud (If the house is quiet and my toddlers are still sleeping down the hall I have to shut the bathroom door while I shave for fear that the noise will wake them up). It also doesn&#x27;t do a very good job cutting. It handles the hair on my cheeks but when it gets down onto my neck I have to go over certain areas repeatedly, and even then there are usually a few stray hairs that seem to stubbornly resist being cut by the Remington. I can only get them down by using the pop-up sideburns trimmer on the back of the razor.     I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 3 weeks but will be taking it back to the store this afternoon. From now on I&#x27;m spending the extra money for something quiet that cuts well.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this shaver for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;The first time or two that I asked he simply shrugged and said it&#x27;s just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to hear more, of course so I waited patiently.&lt;br /&gt;I am used to waiting to get answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently asked again how he liked this shaver. He was finally ready to talk.&lt;br /&gt;He said that he was reluctant to start using it ( true, it took a while ) because he&lt;br /&gt;never felt as if a shaver did as good a job as a blade. He is also a bit old fashioned&lt;br /&gt;( my observation) and doesn&#x27;t like change. Apparently what happened is that he ran out of the&lt;br /&gt; disposables he had been using, and so picked this up. ( Thanks to my foresight, it was all&lt;br /&gt;charged and ready to go.) There has been no turning back. He said it is quick, comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;That is the best I could do, the man is very frugal with words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be honest with you, he still looks exactly the same as he did before starting to use this item.&lt;br /&gt;So it does not perform a lot differently than any other shavers. He is hairier before using it than he is after.&lt;br /&gt;So be it. I asked him to rate it on a scale of 1-5 and he shrugged and gave it a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> Just bought this razor at Wal-Mart and so far I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it. It&#x27;s a good close shave and it&#x27;s not too messy which is nice. It feels solidly built with a nice heft to it, it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll break in your hands like some other electrics I&#x27;ve had. There&#x27;s a a couple draw backs though. First is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pouch. Kind of a pain but I&#x27;ve been accruing so much camera equipment over the years (flashes and lenses tend to come with a little pouch) that I&#x27;ve got plenty of extra felt pouches laying around. The second problem is the clear plastic protector that comes with the razor. It doesn&#x27;t really stay on the razor very well at all, but when you do get it to stay on when you take it off it tends to take the foil guard and hair cup with it. This could be potentially disastrous, let&#x27;s say you wake up and in your grogginess you take the cap off and start shaving not realizing the foil guard isn&#x27;t there and you gash your neck open. If you&#x27;re not a total idiot like I am it&#x27;s not that big of a deal but you&#x27;re better off just tossing the thing. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> The Remington products are outstanding and I purchased via amazon.com the Remington F4790 shaver and it was  received in a few days and good instructions. Works great and very happy with the purchase. I recommend Amazon.com  for good products to purchase at reasonable prices. Thanks    Lightbulb Ralph</li>
    <li> I must say, the battery life on this shaver is remarkable. It has been sitting unsused for several months and still has plenty of charge. The reason it has been sitting is that after only a month or so of infrequent use, it started to do a poor job of shaving. The blades appear to have dulled already. While the instructions made no mention of how to keep them sharp, we did our best to keep the blades clean and dry to prolong their life. The shaver still sort of shaves, but it misses hairs and doesn&#x27;t provide a smooth shave, which makes it pointless if you have to go behind it with another razor.</li>
    <li> First the negatives.  The protective cover for the shaver screens does not fit and falls off all the time.  Then when you do remove it to shave, it pulls out the screens lol!  It&#x27;s clunky (too large) and way too loud.  Power switch positioned poorly and overly sensitive-keeps getting accidentally turned off while shaving.  The manual says you&#x27;re supposed to wash the blades after every use but I just tap/blow the stubble out so that&#x27;s not a big deal.  Pop-up trimmer is helpful but again it could have been positioned better for side burns.  Also, you&#x27;ll need to unplug the shaver every time you use the electric cord to shave, otherwise if left plugged in the battery will eventually overcharge.  So why do I say it&#x27;s still a good shaver?  Because it&#x27;s a foil (beats a rotary design), it&#x27;s powerful (whether using the cord or the battery), and it gives a clean, close shave.  Must add that my old Remington Microscreen MS2-100 (corded only) shaver had all of the power and none of the flaws of this new shaver.</li>
    <li> The Remington&#x27;s shave is not as close as a blade, but then again, what is?  Cleaning is a snap, as you can wash out the blades.  I haven&#x27;t run it enough to determine how long the charge holds.  A couple of quibbles:  The sideburn trimmer is awkwardly placed and hard to use.  Also, they could have included a travel case.  Generally, I use this when I don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to break out my safety razor and the need for a super-close shave isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  3 1/2 stars</li>
    <li> Because of my beard, which is very coarse, it took several weeks for me adapt to this razor.  When I logged in to finally review it, I was floored at the price.  I completely expected this to cost as much as my other razor: [[ASIN:B000TFJDZY Philips Norelco 8020X Cool Skin Moisturizing Men&#x27;s Shaving System]].    So the first thing I have to say here is that this is a real bargain.    It has a much improved screen over the last foil shaver I used in 1999.  Battery life is excellent, and unlike other rechargeable razors I&#x27;ve had, you can still use it after the battery depletes if you plug it in.  This is a critical feature, in my opinion.  It is extremely frustrating to have your shaver die when you&#x27;re in a hurry.    I think shaving quality is a personal issue that will be different for each man.  The primary difference between this style and the 3-head style I&#x27;ve used for ten years is that this style shaves much closer, but also misses more, and thus takes more time to shave.  It also took over a month of shaving before my skin wasn&#x27;t irritated by using this model.  I&#x27;m probably pretty unusual, though.  I have very curly and nearly indestructible facial hair.  This is not some sort of macho bragging, but if this razor can shave my beard, it&#x27;s strong enough for 99.9% of beards.    The only time I really notice that it&#x27;s missing a lot of hair is if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days, such as Monday mornings.  So I&#x27;m shaving every day, and not experiencing much trouble.  The only other major con I experienced is that the pivoting head really only pivots in one direction... I have to push it back (I mentally just apply pressure with a finger when I shave).      Cleaning is easy, since I just rinse it off.    What&#x27;s the best thing about this razor?  [[ASIN:B003S54I02 Remington SP290 Replacentment Screen and Blades for Series 4 Foil Shavers]]  Replacement blades are inexpensive.  In the long run, I&#x27;m going to be more inclined to keep replacing these blades than I was with myNorelco, which costs several times more to maintain.    When you combine the convenience with the price, I think this is the best shaving solution out there.  There is no doubt that I would buy this product.</li>
    <li> My review here is simple:  the Remington would work very well on a clean-shaven face, but with beard...not so well (little control, and the trimmer is not precise enough).  Otherwise, it is a solid shaver, built like I remember them in the 1960s and 1970s:  heavy, solid feeling, easy to clean, and seems like it will last for a generation.</li>
    <li> Very good it shaves well I recommend it, and it&#x27;s very easy to use price is also good go buy it now.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve owned 3 so far and have been happy with them.  Easy to replace blades and screen when needed, pivoting head is nice, trimmer is handy and works well.</li>
    <li> I understand that your facial skin takes a few weeks to adjust to an electric razor before you can get a close shave.  I used to own a Norelco two years ago, and it shaved closer than this Remington model.  Maybe if I would have bought a more expensive model, I might  have gotten better results.  I&#x27;m still using the Remington and trying for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> A good shaver, long battery time between charges. Not as easy to use as older models, and the trimmer is difficult. All said,  I&#x27;ll buy another when this one dies. Great value.</li>
    <li> another great Remington shaver.  This one gets my neck much better with the pivot head.  The battery lasts for about 6 shaves and the cord will work if the battery is low.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington razors and shavers for several decades, and the F-4790 is a very good, basic shaver. It is light and a nice shape to hold. The shaving head pivots so it follows the contour of your face, so shaving well. Unlike earlier shavers, the cutting blades only need to be replaced once a year (depending, I suppose, on how coarse your hair is). It comes with a brush for cleaning the cutting heads and assembly, and the cutting assembly, including the foil can be rinsed under the water tap to clean out the cut whiskers. It can be used plugged or unplugged, and it has a green led to indicate that it is charging, as well as a red led to indicate that it needs to be charged. The charger is also included. I am very happy with it and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two and a half years of use I have down-graded this from 5 star to 4 star. A piece of metal in the foil screen broke and stuck out of the screen and began to scratch my face. This prompted me to change razors to avoid this problem in the future. I don&#x27;t know if I used the razor improperly or if this is a common problem, but it&#x27;s one that I don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> This is a no frills electric rechargeable shaver.  That said, this is a great electric razor that delivers a very close shave and also works well on several days growth.</li>
    <li> I like this razor because it does a good job on my whiskers. However I have used it only twice with good results. I like the little pocket where the shaved whiskers go.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for my husband&#x27;s use. He was very favorably impressed. It charged very quickly and felt good in his hands. He especially liked the light weight. In addition, it has a floating head that went over the contours of his face, effectively. The only drawback (and the reason we gave it 4 stars) is that it did not come with any type of carrying case. But overall, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This shaver was the worst electric shaver I have ever tried to use. No matter how many times I went over my beard it felt like a two day growth. It barely cut the hair of my beard.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly.  I like it fine.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer -- I&#x27;ve long been a foe of Remington Foil Electric Razors.  My first razor was a Remington, a gift from my grandfather on the first Christmas I needed to shave.  That was what he&#x27;d used for years -- the $19.99 special of the early &#x27;80s.  He&#x27;d gone through countless ones, and that was my rude introduction to \\&quot;The Rechargeable Electric Razor.\\&quot;  It was so underpowered it couldn&#x27;t cut, and I ended up with chronic razor-burn from the seemingly endless sanding and sawing on my face with that foiled beast, and I hated Remington razors ever after .... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to 2010 when I&#x27;m offered this Remington F4790 to review, and I jump at the chance to try it out and tell you what I really think about Remington razors.  But....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works....  Hmmm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d guess the now-successful product owes much of its success to the advent of the lithium battery.  This razor has plenty of power to spare; in fact, that is one of my two small criticisms of this reasonably-priced product.  The first time I used it, it cut with such power that it shed blood, leaving my upper lip bleeding.  It cuts, but sometimes overly-aggressively for my now-Norelco-shaven visage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;overly-aggressive\\&quot; issue has left me with some razor-burn, though not from the razor&#x27;s being underpowered as in the past.  First time I used it, I was shocked at the intensity of the burn of the after-shave.  Ouch.  However, if one does a good job of skin conditioning, one should be okay.  Pre-shave, I use [[ASIN:B000052Y6Z Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave, Original, 3 fl oz]] or [[ASIN:B0013NB7DW Williams Lectric Shave Original with Green Tea Complex - 7 oz.]], and after the shave, I have had great results with [[ASIN:B00005U8WP Neutrogena Men Razor Defense, Post Shave Lotion - 2.5 fl oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;flexing\\&quot; foils and 2-way pivoting head (it&#x27;s essentially a post-pivot running parallel to the beard) do a good job for a razor in this price bracket.  I prefer the floating heads design on my Norelco SmartTouch 9160XL, but that razor cost about 4X the price of the Remington F4790.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems substantial, even in what seems like its default hyper-power mode.  Be prepared, though, for at least an overnight initial charge, 24-hours is recommended, and my second complaint is that there&#x27;s no telling when this razor is done charging.  The charge light just keeps lighting up to tell you that you&#x27;re charging it, which is rather obvious, seeing the cord coming out of it!  Not really helpful there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing is that you can rinse it out under the faucet rather than having to dry-brush it completely clean as was the case with the older models.  However, I&#x27;d recommend that you DO \\&quot;pop the hood\\&quot; and brush out the blades while dry first, or else the trimmings will just gum up the works.  In short, it works, but it&#x27;s not self-cleaning or even handy-cleaning like a Norelco.  But then, you&#x27;re not paying for a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summation -- I&#x27;m greatly surprised (in a pleasant way) by how Remington has improved its age-old design.  Thought I&#x27;d hate this one too and tell you why, but I really can&#x27;t complain for a razor at this price.  It does what it says it will do -- no more, no less.  That makes it worth 4 stars.  Not the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but you get what you pay for, and this would serve well as an inexpensive or second travel razor (sorry -- no travel bag, though!).  Again, you get what you pay for.  The upside, as I see it, at least, is that today&#x27;s Remington actually works!design on my Norelco SmartTouch 9160XL, but that razor cost about 4X the price of the Remington F4790.

    <li> I replaced an older Norelco triple floating-head razor with this Remington and so far I&#x27;m satisfied. Although neither razor produces results as close as a blade does, they&#x27;re both pretty close.    Although this Remington razor came charged, the manufacturer said to charge it for 24 hours before use, so I did. It&#x27;s been more than a week of (almost) daily shaving and I&#x27;m still working off the initial charge.    I move the razor in circular motions, as recommended for a close shave by both Norelco and Remington. The Norelco \\&quot;triangle\\&quot; design made this motion more comfortable, but I&#x27;m getting used to the motion with the Remington now, too.     I also think the Norelco&#x27;s floating heads worked a bit better than the Remington design when I&#x27;m working on my neck -- always my trouble area -- but the difference isn&#x27;t too great. (The current Norelcos that basically match my old one are more than twice the price of this Remington, so the fact that the two are comparable at all is a good sign.)    I like that the blades can be washed under the faucet after using a dry brush -- the Norelco design was more of a pain to clean if you clean the heads after every use like I do.    I also like that the razor has a power source that automatically adapts to the local current, which makes it good for travel (I haven&#x27;t tested this feature yet, but I will soon when I travel out of the country this fall).    Overall, the Remington F4790 feels solid for a razor of its price and I would recommend it. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I hope to someday find a rechargeable shaver that works as well as a disposable razor. Even after using this for many weeks to allow my skin to get used to it, it still isn&#x27;t cutting the hair at skin level and leaving quite a bit of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dislike how loud this shaver is. Everyone in the house knows when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor in February 2010 and have NOT one negative comment.  That is how good it is.  The recharge light comes on after 7 days use.  After the 4th charge, I clean PER instructions and use a toothbrush on the cutters every morning.  I get just as close a shave as did with my Gillette Fusion.  I also shower every morning before using my Remington.  The cutter head and screen are just as responsive when bought new.  This was the best investment I ever made!    PS: Remember to use light pressure per instructions with rotating motion per instructions and go slowly.  Most people do not read the instruction booklet before using an appliance and wonder why when.............    1-13-11  I have had this electric razor for almost a year and use every morning.  It still makes a nice close shave as maintain per instructions.</li>
    <li> Seen this at a few stores and never cheaper than $40. I travel alot and wanted something inexpensive that i could take on the road and get a quick shave when I needed one.  This razor leaves my face feeling like I shaved with a traditional blade.  Paid $29 for this here on amazon, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> this is my 4th Remington F4790, and I love them b/c of the slide up trimmer and the value. however this particular product I rec&#x27;d is broken (the pivotable head is broken). the way the product was wrapped inside the box (had plastic wrap around it) leads me to believe it was shipped this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this review is not actually on the shaver as I like this make and model</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for about twenty years, and I&#x27;ve gone through more than a couple in that time. I bought this one because Remington is supposed to be a good name in razors. Maybe they dropped the ball on this one. It&#x27;s the only Remington I&#x27;ve used, so there&#x27;s no way for me to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things that I do like about it. One is the fact that it&#x27;s a dual voltage razor. This is important to anyone like me who doesn&#x27;t live in the US but does visit. Another positive feature is that you can use it with the cord or without. This is nice if your battery runs down and you haven&#x27;t finished shaving yet. A third positive is that it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean, either with the brush or with water. The way that the body of the razor is curved is also nice because it&#x27;s easy to get the right angle without cranking your wrist into awkward positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, the reasons I detest this razor. It gives me some razor burn and seems to nick me more than other electrics I&#x27;ve owned. I seem to have to press harder into my face with it than with other razors, and that&#x27;s probably what produces the razor burn. It&#x27;s very rough on my face. Your results may vary. Another thing I dislike is the size of this razor. It&#x27;s bigger than other razors I&#x27;ve used, which is not desirable for something you have to hold against your face every day, and because it takes more space in your bath kit. That&#x27;s important when you travel frequently, as I seem to do. However, the biggest reason I can&#x27;t stand this razor and am throwing it away is because of how loud it is. To see exactly how loud, I downloaded a decibel measuring app to my iPhone. This razor came in at 95 dB, sometimes as high as 98. I saw one chart that listed a jackhammer at 100 dB. Imagine that right next to your ear every morning. I finally started wearing earplugs to shave because I couldn&#x27;t stand the noise. Even that doesn&#x27;t make this razor acceptable, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this razorto a friend? I wouldn&#x27;t even recommend it to an enemy.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic and Braun razors, and now tried this one out.  This is not to be confused with a $300 Panasonic, it is not feature laden with LED screens and what not.  However, it will give you a good shave, not great, but good, and it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.  I found it easy to clean, and simple to maintain.  It holds a good charge going over a week, at least for me, before needing to be recharged.    I did not care for the way the beard trimmer comes out, it makes it awkward, but not unuseable by any means.    This would be a great back up razor, travel razor if you don&#x27;t want to risk your good one with those folks from the TSA who rifle through bags.  Also, this would be a very good choice for a first electric razor for a young man.    Overall, a solid product that performs well.</li>
    <li> My last remington didn&#x27;t require as many passes in order to get a clean shave.  Kinda bummed that they decided to change their design.</li>
    <li> First off, this is my favorite electric razor i have used/owned. I have experience with most braun and norelco razors under $100. I had a cheap norelco i used for a while until it was stolen then got a higher end norelco, but it just tore up my skin. I have very sensitive skin and have had trouble finding the right shave system. I chose remington after using a portable foil shaver they make and being very impressed with the result. I have only had the 4790 for a couple weeks, but love how it shaves. Close and comfortable with no irritation so far whatsoever.  I had the 5790 for a couple days which comes with 3 foils instead of 2 and just found that it was too much...that is why i went and got the 4790. I recommend this product for anyone looking for a razor for sensitive skin and who do not want to break the bank. I have not used a razor over $100 so i cant speak for the brauns or norelcos in that price range...but no razor can beat this one for $30-40!</li>
    <li> I have always used Remington brand electric shavers and loved them - close, good, but dry shaves. When my last old Remington finally died, on the recommendation of my son-in-law plus the idea of a wet shave, I bought a Panasonic ES8103. At 77 years old, I do not have a difficlut beard to shave but no matter how I lathered, or how many passes I made, I could not get anywhere near the close shaves of my good-&#x27;ole Remingtons plus the ES8103 irritated my face. S-o-o, I bought this F4790, that advertised the blades could be cleaned in water, and I use for wet, lathered shaves - just not in the shower. aah! great, smooth, irritation-free shaves again and best of all the Remington was one-quarter the price of the Panasonic. You can now find my ES8103 on eBay at a VERY reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of electric shavers - I prefer a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works ok.  Not as well as my fusion, but gives a reasonably close shave if electrics are your thing.</li>
    <li> Quick Efficient Cleans easy &amp; Best of all Gives a close Shave On top of it Almost want to get another to Use as Backup Happy to forego Disposable Razor for This One  Everyday  &amp; Price &amp; speedy ordering &amp; fast delivery from Amazon.com worked Great</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these shavers over the years.  I used one for several years (3+) while my son is using the newer one.  It&#x27;s rather noisy and large, and gets warm quickly due to friction with the foil.  I will shave reasonably well once you get used to it.  It doesn&#x27;t always catch everything by the ears and isn&#x27;t useful if you have a partial beard.  By far the largest problem is how rapidly it goes through foils.  6 months would be the longest to expect one to last, with 3-4 months more likely.  They usually go while your in the middle of dragging the shaver across your face, so don&#x27;t get too vigorous.  This is the shortest lived foil of any shaver I have ever owned.  My Braun shavers lasted at least twice as long, and my newest Braun Series 3 shaver has lasted over 3 years and just now formed a small hole in the foil due to wear while giving a much better shave.</li>
    <li> Still using this shaver and going strong. Good product and good everyday shaver. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great Razor! Gets the job done! Love the flip up trimmer...... Great price. Will order again when blades are no longer sharp.</li>
    <li> Last August, 2011, my two year old fancy Braun shaver, which I bought in Europe, suddenly wouldn&#x27;t charge. I ran out and bought the F4790, needing a quick cheap replacement. I have since managed to bring the Braun back to life - it turns out the thing isn&#x27;t waterproof any more, and for as long as I don&#x27;t wet clean it, it works fine - but much to my surprise, the Remington is a much better shaver than the Braun ever was, and with some time spent shaving, I get my face \\&quot;smooth as a gravy sandwich\\&quot;, as they&#x27;d say Down Under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The F4790 is large, not to say ugly, but fits in the hand well, and as it has nickel-cadmium (the old technology) rechargeable batteries, it has more power available than a smaller shaver with lithium-ion batteries would do, and I have (we&#x27;re in December 2011 as I write this) recharged it only once! Nickel-cadmium technology does suffer from the memory effect, so you&#x27;re best off running the shaver down until it dies, and then fully recharging it overnight, at least periodically. But I am well pleased, and haven&#x27;t used the Braun since, except for when the Remington is charging. Note that I have light beard and moustache growth, I am not in the lawnmower category.</li>
    <li> This is my third Remington shaver and clearly the best one I&#x27;ve owned. I have a fairly heavy beard (8 on a scale of 10), so my shavers get a good workout. The F4790 works quickly and smoothly to give me a very close shave. If you follow the directions, using circular motions, clean it regularly and keep it charged, you will have an amazingly effective device for providing incredibly smooth skin with no irritation. The only criticism I can find is very minor. I have a difficult time snapping the plastic head cover on. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but most times I have to fumble with it a bit to get the cover on.</li>
    <li> I will stick ro the rotary 3 head shaver . This shaver was no where near the close shave or as painless as my rotary models. No matter if it&#x27;s the cheaper or most expensive rotary shaver it is still the closest/smoothest and the most painless shave.</li>
    <li> The title says it all -- this is without a doubt the best electric razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Looks great -- very nice curves and countours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great ergonomics -- very comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good weight -- I like the fact that it has a little heft to it, but it&#x27;s not heavy enough that it would be a problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- High build quality -- This feels like a professional electric razor. The quality of the materials feels high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Great shave! This razor gives me the best/quickest shave that I have ever experienced. It is also an extremely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer is incredibly useful and very easy to use. The trimmer on this razor is one of my favorite features -- I love the fact that it goes straight up and down instead of popping out; it gives it more of a solid feel and you can go both directions without worrying about it folding back up into the razor. The trimmer is very good for getting stubborn hairs (especially on the neck), but you may not even need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a bit on the loud side, but not unbearably so. As far as I know, it could be quieter than other razors, but I have noticed that it does get a little noisy when close to my ear. Don&#x27;t let this alone deter you from purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the pros far outweigh the con(s). I recently got a Norelco AT830 for Christmas which I promptly returned for a $15 set of replacement blades for my two-year old Remington F4790, and it performed 100x better than that brand new Norelco.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is garbage. It is so loud. Sounds like a mini lawn mower. Wakes up the whole house and neighbors. As far as actually doing its job....Its decent. I always have to go over my face multiple times. It always misses hairs, or pulls them. I would not reccomend this razor to anyone! Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used  Remington razors for many years and I have always found them very satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;By buying through Amazon ,you can be assured of fast service .I would recommend this razor to any one.</li>
    <li> As far as foil shavers go, it&#x27;s a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;The corded/cordless option is nice and it does hold a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer is a nice touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice razor but to be honest I didnt find it to be anything special.</li>
    <li> I bought this Remington Electric Shaver and used it once and took it back. The Pivot head is too delicate and will break over use and time.    The ability to clean it has a drawback. When you remove the top you hit the Foils and misplace them. Overtime that will cost you much more money to replace those foils.    Even worse, unlike the Cheaper Version the inability to remove the entire top and blades makes it far harder to clean. Thus, it is not worth the extra money and only worth 1 star.    Remington does not include an Automobile Charger either. This alone could add an additional cost worth the higher price, but Remington is not smart enough to do it?    Finally, it was harder to shave under my nose and will be tougher to do it with the pivot function.    Therefore, save your money and buy the cheaper non-pivot version. Yet, it is far better than the Norelco Electric Shavers.</li>
    <li> This is the one he wanted and thank goodness  Amazon carried it because no one else did.  It is exactly what my Dad wanted. He says it provides a smooth shave without pulling or nicking.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for work and needed a reliable, long-lasting, quick-shaving cordless shaver.  This one turned out to be better than I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;-I use it once a day for a quick 1-2 minute shave and it will last me 2 weeks before I need to charge it.  That&#x27;s around 20 minutes of constant use without needing a charge.&lt;br /&gt;-The foils &amp; cutter seem to work very well, leaving no irritation and a close, smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer is also excellent.  It doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;bogged down&amp;#34; or get caught in thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;-I throw this thing in and out of my suitcase and I&#x27;m sure it gets banged around through baggage handling...yet still intact after 2 years.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver and I will certainly purchase another one if/when this one quits.</li>
    <li> The Remington F4790 Pivot &amp; Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Foil Shaver was purchased for my teenage son. He uses it regularly and is satisfied with the shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor has taught me what a racket rechargeable razors are. Despite having a cord that goes from the wall-wart transformer to the shaver, as best I can determine from the manual, this razor relies on the internal batteries to operate whether plugged into the wall or not. I cannot fully test my hypothesis because, according to the manual, removing the batteries requires physically cutting internal wires. Because the batteries are apparently not user replaceable and the shaver apparently will not run without them, I must conclude that when the batteries are no longer able to hold a charge after a few years it becomes more doorstop than shaver, forcing the purchase of a new unit. If anyone has information to the contrary, that the batteries can indeed be replaced by the user, please comment on this review and share the information with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shaver, it is neither compact nor lightweight owing to the internal battery pack. It makes a loud buzzing sound and gives a shave that is somewhat close but not great, with little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a mistake to buy this razor, but I was looking for a foil razor to see if it would give a closer shave than a rotary. Close shave or no, I would rather have a razor which operates from wall current like my Norelco does, without batteries that eventually conk out and can&#x27;t be replaced by the user.</li>
    <li> I ordered a new Remington 4790 shaver from Brittany Beauty, through amazon.com.  My understanding is that the item was supposed to be &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; as was stated.  After I opened the USPS mailing envelope (which was perfectly intact) I was surprised to see the original shaver box torn up with tape all over the box, like the item had been opened and used and returned.  The shaver itself looked suspiciously used, and did not have the clear shrink wrap plastic on it like it does in the store, and like it has had from other sellers on amazon.com.  In generally I like this specific electric shaver, and will continue to order this shaver in the future, just not from this company, as I cannot bring myself to use a used shaver.&lt;br /&gt;JDL</li>
    <li> Broken when received.</li>
    <li> When it actually shaves, it shaves extremely close.  But about 10% of facial growth it simply skims over and never cuts.  The coarse trimmer is painful to use.</li>
    <li> Sooo, sue me I;m biased. I have been using them since 1984. One corded model lasted 15 years and the it was the cord that frayed and shorted out. The shaver was still fine. This one  shaves close, and all the bells and whistles work great. I especially like the trimmer on this one.  Not too sure the swivel head design is necessary. Might be gilding the lilly. It seems to work counter to my angle of attack. But the trimmer can be used to steady the swivel head so, no problem.  Charge on the battery seems to last forever. 1 months at least and that&#x27;s with a shave every day</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Has a very useful pop-up trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but always go back to Remington!!</li>
    <li> It works well on less than 24hrs worth of whiskers. Reliable. I dropped it several times, once in a sink full of water and this thing is still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor for the money. Great close shave and great trim. No skin burns. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> It was a good price for the work it does, but I actually expected more from it, because when shaving, it still doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as I thought it will be.... so a regular razor needs to be used anyways after all</li>
    <li> I have had this same razor for around 2 years and thought I would order another since I really like the old one.  The new one does not have the power and the foil screens are not as comfortable.  I do not think it does as close a shave as the old one.  I am thinking about returning it.  I would not recommend this razor.</li>
