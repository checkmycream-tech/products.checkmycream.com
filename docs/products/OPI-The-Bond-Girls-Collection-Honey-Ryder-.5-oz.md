    <li> Never tried liquid sand......it is Fantastic.  Ladies with no time will love that it dries quickly.  It adds pizazz to your fingertips.  I rub my finger on it constantly because it is so textured it doe not seem like nail polish at all.  The have many other colors in the OPI brand.  Everyone that loves to change colors often must try liquid sand.  The look is automatically dressy and classy!!  I received so many compliments I had to buy my own bottle.</li>
