    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for years. Elizabeth Arden no longer makes it and it is no longer sold in stores. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon. This fragrance is very sensuous and nothing else compares to it!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent but was charged 49.50 so be sure to check the bill when it arrives, my email comformation even says I was charged 28.49 but I wasnt and I don&#x27;t know how to get my money back, I cant seem to get ahold a anyone to fix this. I really like this site but now I&#x27;m a little afraid to order again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  Its discontinued so good luck finding it in the future.</li>
    <li> The only store I can find this at is Dillard&#x27;s for $70, plus a two hour drive just to get there. This is the only perfume I use so I was excited to find it so cheap.</li>
    <li> This perfume was discontinued at least 5 years ago after my searching more than 2 years for a scent that didn&#x27;t overwhelm me. I was very happy to find it online. It took a 3 years search before it showed up again.  I bought 3 just in case.</li>
    <li> This is my wifes favorite perfume.  Happy wife,,,,Happy husband</li>
    <li> This is the perfume that I wanted and it&#x27;s not made anymore so I am really glad that I was able to get it still.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.  If you want your man to notice you, wear this perfume.  You will sure to have your own provocative interlude.</li>
    <li> Amazing price and I finally found my favorite perfume</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find this wonderful perfume in the stores......So happy I was able to find it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I wish they still made this.  I&#x27;ve been stockpiling it for my wife to wear.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite purfume! I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 years. I was so happy I was able to get it on here since it&#x27;s not made anymore!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent! I found it was discontinued a couple of years ago. I&#x27;ve recently gone to Macy&#x27;s in search of it with no luck. The woman at the Elizabeth Arden counter had never even heard of it so I am assuming it is still discontinued. I just purchased a bottle online &amp; feel like I should stock up! I haven&#x27;t found it at such a low price since it has been sold in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I found out it was discontinued that I only saw it for hundreds of dollars on eBay. I ordered Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s 5th Avenue Nights which is supposed to be a similar fragrance however it is NOTHING compared to this scent. I am very excited to receive my order because I haven&#x27;t worn this perfume in years and I always got complimented on it. Also, it has a long fragrance life. It doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly and it seems to almost change in scent throughout the day but always smells out of this world.</li>
    <li> I thought it would smell more like Interlude.  Smells NOTHING like it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent that my wife loves, great price too!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing!!!!!! Great price!!! It&#x27;s the real deal not that fake stuff!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance and I love smelling it on her is very hard to find so get it while you can</li>
    <li> Love the fresh flowery smell, great spring/summer scent!</li>
    <li> Ordered it. Fridayreceived it today and Nietzsche one I have been lookin for. I have always loved this scent and receive compliments from a lot of my coworkers and friends</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this!!! I buy it every chance I get! I lost count of how many great compliments I get when wearing it. I wish they still produced this, but am thankful I was able to find it here! I&#x27;ll continue to buy them until they&#x27;re gone.</li>
    <li> Very nicely scented. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it - Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
