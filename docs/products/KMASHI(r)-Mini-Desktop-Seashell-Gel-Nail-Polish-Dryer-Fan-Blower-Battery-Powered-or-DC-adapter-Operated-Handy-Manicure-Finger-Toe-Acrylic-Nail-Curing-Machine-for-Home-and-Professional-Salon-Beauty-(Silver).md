    <li> Hi I received the lamp but it did not come with the electrical output cable can you please send me it</li>
    <li> Reading the other reviews on this product can be miscougaring in buying this product and at first I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it but comparing it and looking at other nail dryers I took a risk on this ... And I am so glade I did it was more then great ! Better then I expected ! The fan was pretty strong and it dry nails in a reasonable time . The only thing I wish is that it came with the 3V DC Adaptor but other then that a cute good nail dryer for a good price .</li>
