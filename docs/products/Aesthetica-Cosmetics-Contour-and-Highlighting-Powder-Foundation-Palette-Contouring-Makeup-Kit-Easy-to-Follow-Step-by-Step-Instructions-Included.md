<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> something so small that cost so much&lt;br /&gt;found a no brand foundation just the same with 4 extra shades for 8$ and works just as well</li>
    <li> This is a great concept but unfortunately the colors were too dark for my skin tone so there was no way to use any as the highlighting portion of the contour. May be good for those with a darker complexion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is even worth it :/ Didn&#x27;t like it at all :(</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fast.  It&#x27;s a very good product.  The colors are good.  I was expecting it to be liquid but it is powder and goes on great if you dampen your brush.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product... it wasn&#x27;t even visible on me. I would only suggest this product for people with oily skin. Any other skin type should be using the skin versions.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed.</li>
    <li> Very good color selection and guides are very helpful to application</li>
    <li> very good product! Go for it!</li>
    <li> Great pigment.  Velvet texture.</li>
    <li> Excellent product: it doesn&#x27;t crease, contours delicately, highlights professionally and doesn&#x27;t leave your face shinning like a traffic light at night. All this for an affordable price. Buy it.</li>
    <li> The darker colors are too orange, rather than bronze.  Does not apply easily.</li>
    <li> Works great! Colors are great for purpose intended.  So glad I got this</li>
    <li> Use every day.  I got the Aesthetica brush set as well. Once you learn to do it, it takes just a couple of minutes. Works great!</li>
    <li> Excelent my Aesthetica Cosmetics Contour and Highlighting:Thanks very much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product I wear it every time i go out it&#x27;s no different from the Anastasia contour kit it&#x27;s actually better.</li>
    <li> This contour kit is awesome!! Very blendable &amp; no orange tint!! Love, love it!</li>
    <li> I love the shade the texture its not creamy yet not powdery mixed between the two&lt;br /&gt;Very good condition</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a palette of cream foundations and highlighters, however it&#x27;s powder which is barely visible. Not what I was looking for in a contour kit at all.</li>
    <li> This is really great and I love how well it blends in with my skin tone that is olive tone. Thank you</li>
    <li> perfect match for my skin...love it!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and nice kit. It works very well to cover my uneven skin tones. Goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t accentuate facial lines as some powders tend to do on me. This kit is well packaged, ready to give as a gift.  Makeup artist  kit comes with a step-by-step instruction guide to use the 6 contouring, shading, concealing and blush matte shades.  The instruction guide demonstrates how to highlight, define, or diminish facial features. It is lots of fun to use and does not give the heavy makeup appearance. It really does enhance good qualities while playing down other features. I received many inquiries as to what I had done.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> VERY nice contouring kit.  It&#x27;s powder, so I find it more forgiving than the typical liquid contouring kits I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using everyday this kit, and I love it. It goes on smooth, the shades available are a great selection to adapt to different skin undertones. I think the price is good for what you get, the booklet explains you step by step how to do the entire highlight and contour, and it has a very useful drawings so you know what is better for your specific face shape. I will totally re purchase.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and in great shape. It does what it should do and I really like it. I haven&#x27;t used anything else similar so it would be hard to compare the quality of the product but all in all..I am happy with it and for sure recommend it.</li>
    <li> This item is EXACTLY the same as the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit if not better because it comes with a mirror and a diagram on how to apply the kit based on your face shape.  I bought it for my niece and she loves it! !!</li>
    <li> I was eyeing this palette for so long and finally decided to pick it up. Just received it today and I can say I absolutely loved it! It&#x27;s has beautify colors that will be perfect for ever skin tone out there. I find the consistency better than the ABH contour kit ( that one is very powdery) the Aesthetica is very creamy and blends beautifully. We&#x27;ll be ordering again once I hit pan!! Grab one while you can.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in a perfect condition and I love it. It is really easy to apply specially it is the first time that I use a contour and it lasted all day. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got for my Mum, she loves!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It is more a pressed powder than a cream. I thought it would be more of a cream. But I like the product. There are a couple colors that I will not be using, but that is expected when you buy a combo pallet. It comes with easy directions to follow, and a how to picture for where to put the different colors. It is great for the price. I did receive this product with a coupon code that took the price down a bit. I am very happy that I decided to give this product a try!</li>
    <li> This is not heavy looking on ur face if that makes any sense.  My sister got me this kit and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Very natural looking against ur skin.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you looking cakey.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this - but the pigmentation is just too light for me to be excited. I feel like I&#x27;ve really got to work to get it on my brush and have it show up on my skin. I also purchased the brushes designed to go with it - they were &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t provide much control. Overall glad i tried it, but i&#x27;m going to use other products to achieve.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected...</li>
    <li> I love this product. It slims my face and blends very nicely.  There are instructions for different face types to help as a guide and also a mirror inside. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> i thought this product would be bad because of the low price but its actually a great product. I would compare it to the anastasia beverly hills contouring palette! Great product! Will definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to play around with the colors as of yet. So far I love it.</li>
    <li> my fav kit hands down..will buy again soon</li>
    <li> Powder product. Works fine.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Not as good as Anastasia contour kit but I love the facial diagram that came with the kit.  Very handy!</li>
    <li> This kit is great, it makes contouring easy!</li>
    <li> Love it! Just make sure you have your own brushes</li>
    <li> I like the color variation but it was a bit smaller than I expected. The colors are great and it goes on really nice. Plus the picture and direction are really useful if this is your first time contouring.</li>
    <li> Learning to use this and loving it!</li>
    <li> I have never used a contour and highlighting product like this before. I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and this is not something I grew up knowing and knowing how and what to use this for. Now on the other hand, my 18 year old is a pro! She watches alot of online tutorials. So when I was chosen to test and review this product, I was excited to try and learn something new and have my daughter help by giving me pointers! I agreed to share my results and let others know how it worked for me. First of all I do believe you need good quality brushes! I will be reviewing the set that I was working with here on Amazon as well. The palette is very nice, and the instructions are very helpful, especially for a beginner like me. I have a little darker skin tone than my daughter(more italian), and this palette worked very well for my skin tone. My daughter on the other hand is very pale, and these colors were a little too dark for her liking, on her skin tone.The product goes on nice and smooth. I love that it is cruelty free! Overall, I&#x27;m very please with this product and will recommend this to others. Whether you are a beginner like me or an experienced contour product user, this is a wonderful set.</li>
    <li> Very light and subtle. Ive only used it once, but I think it appears to make a difference</li>
    <li> The look of the product is nice, but for me being a women of color, there was not a darker shade for contouring. I prefer the liquid Foundation over powder.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. I found it very effective. I use it along with other beauty products from other brands and im very satisfied with the result every time. Very practical and easy to carry around. Easy to apply and I love that it comes with introductions on how to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> Takes practice, but practice makes perfect</li>
    <li> I love this contour palette! It goes on so smoothly and perfect and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the look that you want. I recommend this to anyone that wants to learn the ways to contour and highlight!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s nice, though not as pigmented as I wanted it. Overall it&#x27;s still a good product</li>
    <li> Makes contouring for beginners so easy and look as if you&#x27;ve been doing it forever! Highly impressed with this product and quality.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem very pigmented to me.</li>
    <li> This is powder based when I thought it would be creme based. Since I&#x27;m new to conturing, I&#x27;m glad its light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Blends perfectly and affordably priced!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powder, not cream. The light color&#x27;s don&#x27;t even show at all. The only reason why I even give it 2 stars is because I like the packaging and nice step by step directions but other than that, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the makeup and yes, I got it for free.</li>
    <li> It tells you where to apply the make up but it is very difficult and not as easy as they make it sound. I would not waste your money on this</li>
    <li> Great Seller - Wonderful product!  Just as described.  Quick shipping and great packaging.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Very natural looking and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! Just a tad bit makes a big difference. It stays on for several hours as well.</li>
    <li> Use it every day!!! I love this kit! Sometimes when I travel I even use it as eye shadow. I have light peachy European skin and the colors are perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love I will order again !!!</li>
    <li> Like the color , very good</li>
    <li> LOVE it. Watched some videos on how to apply and did a few trial and error test runs.</li>
    <li> I could not get this to work.  I think that powders are harder to keep in the right place on you face when blending.  Then I blended the highlights and shadows away trying to make it look natural... and any facial contouring disappeared.  Probably it is my technique, but I didn&#x27;t have much success.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and a great product, I would highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I was worried it would be too dark, or that it would  be hard to blend, but it was very easy! Also, the seller sent me an email to make sure the product was what I expected and instructions for beginners. It was fantastic. I would recommend for beginners as it&#x27;s easy to use and not too heavy. The price is also great for what you get!</li>
    <li> This stuff helped clear up my face from a prior foundation. It&#x27;s very light and allows your skin to breathe. I live off of this now. Great buy def worth the money.</li>
    <li> Awesome product at great price!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to learn how to contour, and i guess its harder than it looks, somehow i made my nose look bigger than it actually is lol&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is it made my skin break out really bad :( but other than that its great, seems to need to be reapplied alot tho.. but Im still learning.&lt;br /&gt;arrived undamaged in great condition</li>
    <li> i was so excited to try this highlighting kit. most of these kits are too expensive for me to want to purchase and try out. this product is reasonably priced and the quality is amazing. the colors works so well on your face to bring out your best features. the pallette itself is very nice and well put together. the colors last and you only need to apply it once during the day after putting on a primer. it comes with detailed directions and it is really easy to follow along with which is great for the ladies who aren&#x27;t so familiar with this kind of makeup such as myself. i reviewed this product and gave my honest opinion and i recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> Exactly like the Anastasia Contour Kit. In every way. Just less money! I love this! Lasts all day! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves hers. Haven&#x27;t tired mine yet</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE WORST! No color what-so-ever. Can&#x27;t see it on my skin. I have an olive complexion and this doesn&#x27;t show up at all. Waste of money. I also don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews for this product. Makes me weary now of reviews on amazon. A lot of people&#x27;s pants must be on fire.</li>
    <li> Not a makeup prom but hard to blend in without completely getting rid of the contour lines.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and damage free.  I really like the variety of shades.  I have fair to light skin; I can use the darkest of shades and blend with the lighter shades.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend a powder contouring kit. I assumed this one would be cream but it is powder and does not work very well at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s poweder and not really pigmented. Works okay though for a beginner. Came fast.</li>
    <li> Love it same quality as Anastasia but for half the price</li>
    <li> Awesome contouring kit, there are essential instructions included to help you learn how to apply the makeup.  Simple instructions for a great look.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price. I could do without it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 21 y.o. granddaughter who loves this product.  Pricing is extremely fair as other comparable contouring kits are double this.  Nice item.</li>
    <li> Love this contour kit</li>
    <li> Love this palette! I have been looking for the right product to use for contouring for a while. I tried using a darker shade of foundation, cream concealer palettes and didnt really like using them. The powder is perfect. Easy to use, blends really well and much easier than a liquid or cream. Comes with detailed instructions so even if you are a newbie youll have no problem achieving the look you are going for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what they are referring to by &amp;#34;good for all skin tones&amp;#34; cause that&#x27;s a big load of rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;This kit is suited for medium and light complexions only. I am fairly brown skin, by no means dark and this for me is a complete waste of money. The dark shades blend (disappear) into my complexion to say the least. They variety and colours aren&#x27;t nearly diverse enough for it to qualify as suitable for all skin tones. I should&#x27;ve know from looking but given the ranting and raving I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt; Foundations come in different colours for a reason, as should contouring kits. Light, medium, dark, etc. One kit does not fit all and I find it nothing short of ignorant that that is how they try and sell a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money brown bunnies, this is not for us.</li>
    <li> I am just learning to contour with makeup so when I recieved this kit for my review, I was ecstatic! The colors are perfect! The directions were extremely easy as well. I have a long heart shaped face and I was utterly AMAZED at the diffence the contouring added to my face. It really brought out my features and made my face appear totally diffent! I looked like I stepoed out of A magazine! The compact is very durable and is easy to open. The makeup is a powder so it&#x27;s easy to apply and looks more natural. This is definitely high qulity make up. I highley recommend it!</li>
    <li> Hindsight is that it is a pricey product for what little I take the time to use.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and the price is too</li>
    <li> still learning how to apply it, but it gives a very nice and natural look. I love it and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Contouring is not something I excel at, but this kit makes it a much easier process. It includes six shades, which ensures that I can find the perfect ones for me. A few of the shades are a little too dark for me, but I&#x27;m incredibly pale. I think that for the majority of skin tones, this would be perfect. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not brave at all when it comes to makeup and I stick to a very natural look so this was a big step for me when ordering this kit. I can honestly say I absolutely love it. The steps made it really easy to apply and I get better with every application. I highly recommend this kit - especially for anyone nervous to test the contouring waters.</li>
    <li> It a little confusin and doest really give that good instructions to follow. Plus for a really light person some of the colors r to dark. Should have lighter colors for different skin tone</li>
    <li> This pallet is not what I expected at all. Made my face look so tan almost like an orange tan. So not cute! Will give it away or return it soon!</li>
    <li> Great contouring palette, I think this may be a dupe for the Anastasia contour palette but I don&#x27;t have hers. I&#x27;ve used this palette for almost two weeks now and the darker colors blend beautifully on the skin like butter (I&#x27;m light skin tonned), not sure how much the AB countour palette is but if it&#x27;s too expensive then I would definitely give this a try!</li>
    <li> First I was so excited due to the great reviews and I&#x27;m new to countour so I didn&#x27;t want to waste 50$ on Anastasia or Kat Von d palette. This palette don&#x27;t stay for long only for 1-2 hrs then fades. After wearing it a couple times it also made me break out! So dissatisfied I rather buy brands that are actually known than have my face break out ! Be aware!</li>
    <li> By far the best contour kit I&#x27;ve tried thus far! The colors are great for my fair skin and the powder applies perfectly. I have gotten many compliments on my skin. I am by no means a make up artist and applied this with real ease.</li>
    <li> I am a dark skin African American woman first off and the product worked well with my skin tone. I am about the complexion on Cecilia Tyson the actor. I like the product. It does everything I want it to and I like the step by step direction. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome palette. Just what I was looking for. Suits my fairly pail skin really well. These powders are not extremely pigmented so they require some building up for a noticeable effect. That&#x27;s not such a bad thing though, especially if you want a light application or want exact control over your look. Very very similar to the ABH powder contour palette. Obvious dupe at a lesser cost. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love it! It really helps in embracing the form of your face and I love the case it came in! I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;m deffinetely buying again!</li>
    <li> Nice Colors to choose from. I love the fact it came with picture instructions to go with each face type. That helps a lot for a beginner like me recently introduced to contour makeup.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. The color is great and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Bad is not worth buying these. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> The colors are a good mix, there are also good directions if you are not sure the best way to contour your face. Doesn&#x27;t give as much definition as the cream contouring but still a good luck and a little more subtle; you don&#x27;t look like make up is caked on.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price especially for daily wear instead of using your more expensive makeup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I think next time I&#x27;ll buy a cream contouring kit instead. For the price it didn&#x27;t work well. I have to use tons of it to cover and a cream product I use less of.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this palette. I use it every day and I love it for night/special occasion as well. I was a bridesmaid in 3 weddings this year and all of the girls used my palette and most got their own soon after.  Love the instructions. Love the face diagram also. I think its a great product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great silky texture and good colors for light/medium tones. I wish the colors were a little more buildable regarding the highlighting shades. Nice product I will probably buy refill pods when the time comes. I just got into highlighting and contouring and this product has simple instructions and is great for beginners! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This Aesthetica contouring kit is great,it helps me achieve the look I want and the colors are perfect. It&#x27;s easy to use and has extra info inside to help if you need it.</li>
    <li> The Dark goes on easily, the lighter highlighting doesn&#x27;t...But the brushes are great . It would be perfect otherwise</li>
    <li> I bought this and was very disappointed. It&#x27;s supposed to be for all skin tones but you can&#x27;t barely see it on my skin. If you are light skinned this will be good.</li>
    <li> The colours are not good!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I was hoping it would&#x27;ve been a thicker powder bc i do have to use a bit more than i expected,  but i still love it! Highly recommend and the seller shipped lightning fast! Thanks!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this but I watched a few YouTube video&#x27;s on different techniques and now I&#x27;m in love.  I get so many compliments and ppl even notice the difference when I don&#x27;t wear it.  I love,  love,  love this</li>
    <li> I love this set! So easy to put on!</li>
    <li> The makeup is not as great as I expected. Doesn&#x27;t really blend too great. I have tried on many different surfaces. For example, I have tried on different foundations, bases, primers. Still not that great.</li>
    <li> I learned to contour when I was younger. Your face charges as you age. The instructions were easy to follow and helped. The colors are really nice and the finished look is very good</li>
    <li> Fell in love with this kit. So easy to apply.</li>
    <li> its just a perfect contour palette</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the ABH cosmetics one, but my friend does have it. You cannot tell the difference, and if you&#x27;re saving $10 bucks.. jokes on them. Am I right?</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Great results and I can say it is almost exactly the same as the Anastasia Contour Kit but at a lower price.</li>
    <li> Very upset with this product. Left my face very powdery and cakey. Would never recommend this product to a friend and never plan to buys make up product from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great product, comes with pictorial directions, which I love!</li>
    <li> Great product - every makeup artist worth their salt should definitely have this in their kit.</li>
    <li> I thought these were liquid, works good but probably won&#x27;t order anymore</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I love the colors and quality of the product.  Fast shipping too.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Beautiful,  finely milled pressed powders. Works great!</li>
    <li> It came with an easy to follow contour sample.  Nice.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it everyday. I was trying to order a cintour set from off of the Wendy Williams show but was sold out so I went on Amazon and bought it without the brush set. Love Love Love it</li>
    <li> Love this! It makes contouring very easy!</li>
    <li> bronzes are really good, highlighters are okay. not much of highlighters though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and I love it. It&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> **Pros**&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;Easy instructions&lt;br /&gt;Matte finish&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful finished look&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Cons**&lt;br /&gt;Hard to blend in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen numerous Pinterest posts on contouring and have even watched a few YouTube videos on it because the before and after pictures are always outstanding. I was completely daunted about contouring when I received this. I&#x27;ve never tried to contour so I had no idea what I was doing. After reading the instructions I decided to dive in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my makeup like normal excluding my lipstick. Then I opened the contouring kit and chose the the color that was about 3 shades darker than my natural skin tone and mimicked the picture that is included with the instructions. By the time I was done I found that it was hard to blend the colors in. It either went away completely and you couldn&#x27;t tell I did anything or you could still see the lines of it. It took a little practice and I&#x27;m sure the more I contour the better I&#x27;ll get at it. After playing with it a couple of times I finally got a finished look that had me surprised. I have included pictures of me with my normal makeup on and then what that looks like after contouring (a before and after). It&#x27;s obviously not a Pinterest worthy picture, but I was surprised by how it brightened my face and added that &#x27;natural&#x27; glow, I didn&#x27;t look washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with 3 beautiful illuminating highlight colors and 3 matte contouring colors to choose from. I immediately knew that I was going to love this. I have extremely sensitive skin and saw this was paraben free, gluten free, and most importantly Talc free! My face didn&#x27;t break out after wearing this! Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free, which is something I&#x27;m passionate about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say this is a great contouring kit, especially if you&#x27;re new to it. The powders will last a while and you can really practice and master the art of contouring while knowing the product is made ethically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a promotional period I received this contouring kit at a discount in exchange for an honest review.is made ethically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a promotional period I received this contouring kit at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Great item for beginners</li>
    <li> This is a dupe to the anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pigmented and blendable, also it comes with a contour guide to how to apply the contour and highlight colours also it provides the suitable contour tutorial for every face shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shades should suit fair to medium skin tones I can see it suitable for darker skin tones as it would look ashy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will provide new shades to suit darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> Not good pigment. Can barely see it.</li>
    <li> Doesnt blend  well not worth the money</li>
    <li> Excellent kit. Very similar to the competitors at a cheaper price!</li>
    <li> really good for the price. I havent tried the anastasia beverly hills one but i do really like this one.</li>
    <li> Cheap and unwearable !!!!!</li>
    <li> Just got in the mail .so excited to use. Great colors!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great item. I recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m light skin and the powder won&#x27;t really stay on my skin..&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected</li>
    <li> Perfect for starters, love it!! My face looked flawless!</li>
    <li> This contouring kit was highly rated and discounted by 50% which was why I purchased it. It came on time as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit does come with diagrams of different face shapes to illustrate which parts of your face to add contour or highlights. I recommend that you watch the video provided on Aesthetica&#x27;s Web site to learn about contouring techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are step by step instructions that are really generalized. You really learn the most information from watching the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to buy a large blush brush and an eyeshadow brush for use only with the kit. This isn&#x27;t mentioned until you watch the instructional video. Obviously, they&#x27;d prefer it if you bought their 2 headed brush, but you can find good cheap brushes from Target or Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to practice a few times. What&#x27;s not mentioned is that the top 3 colors are only for highlights and the bottom 3 are for contouring.  I&#x27;ve practiced twice since I got my kit, but will be playing around with it some more.</li>
    <li> This is money well spent. I was not sure how this was going to turn out, but I am in love.  I was worried about the product at first because I typically breakout from makeup, but i haven&#x27;t broken out once. The powder lays on nice and it does not irritate my skin. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and the arrival time! It is also fresh and it wasn&#x27;t broken when it arrived!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the powder Contour Pallet and absolutely loved it, so I did not have doubts about the Cream Contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frequently, I face irritation and acne from make up products. That is just how my face works. It is hard for me to find make up that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, rashes or acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are times where I can find make up that works and DOES NOT cause me any problems. This is one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product DOES NOT cause irritation. It is extremely comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;This product DOES NOT cause acne (For me at least) which is rare.&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on smooth. It does NOT clump and it does not stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone looking for a GREAT contour cream.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical before purchasing this and especially for the cost. However I love this product and it is so worth the money. This is my first contour pallet and it did not disappoint. It comes with a picture guide which was fool proof. Buy the right brushes for it and you&#x27;re good to go. I was shocked at the outcome and I use it frequently now. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love the item. Extremely fast shipping. Fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> Tried the Kat Von D contouring kit and this worked just the same.</li>
    <li> Product is average in my opinion. It does give definition and highlighting, however I have to apply a lot more product than expected to get the desired effect and the end result looks a little caked on. I found that spritzing my face with toner after the application is complete, helps a lot to keep the color on my skin longer and the contour to not look as powdery. I was a little disappointed for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> My first highlighting kit I&#x27;ve tried. All the colors were in-tact and packaged nicely.  There is a guide/instructions on where to put what color until you get the hang of it.  Got lots of compliments when I wore it for a military ceremony.&lt;br /&gt;The only critique I would have is there should be a VERY light color for people with even lighter skin than is in this kit.  I stay out of the sun when able and take care of my skin in order to not get burned/tanned.  I am a very light skinned individual, so I would have liked an even lighter/whiter color for highlighting contrast around my eyes, but this works as long as I get the dark correct.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, easy to use!</li>
    <li> Meh.............just thought this was ok.......I feel like I could have gotten some at the dollar store for each shade and paid a quarter of the price</li>
    <li> I work as a makeup artist in Qatar where women love their contour. Like, Kim Kardashian contour. This does the job perfectly! It does appear ashy on darkest skin tones, but on all of the other ones is amazing. I like highlighting colours also; they are pigmented, but not cakey. Yellow one in a middle is great for under eyes.</li>
    <li> this product  did not work for me, i even bought brand new brushes, because it didn&#x27;t come with any, and its a powder contour set that doesn&#x27;t show up on your skin, they make it look so easy but it sucked. i have light skin they colors were right but it was not easy to apply it didn&#x27;t show up and didn&#x27;t work. waste of money.  it would be better if it was a cream kit. package and shipping came fast though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used contouring before and this product didn&#x27;t convince me that I should spend the extra time to do so. From reading the other reviews this seems like a good kit if you know what you are doing, but I found everything a little confusing. There are 6 colors, but you are likely only going to use 2 of them - one for contouring and one for highlighting. The video on their website helps, but it keeps referring to a double ended brush I don&#x27;t have. In the end I just looked like I had lines on my face and blending it just made them less obvious. I&#x27;m really not going to blame the product for this, because I think girls with a little more makeup experience could get this down - I&#x27;m just not that motivated.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife and older sister and they love it so it&#x27;s good for me well worth the money</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS AND IT IS SO EASY AND WORKS GREAT!  WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Still getting the hang of contouring but this kit sure makes it easy and fun to play with! I mean who does&#x27;nt love to play with makeup?!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okey, I will rebuy it.</li>
    <li> I received this earlier this week and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I love that there is a diagram as well as an instruction book on how to achieve certain looks for certain face types.  My only complaint about this, is that it does not last very long.  I work pretty regular 9-5 hours, and by lunchtime, there is no trace of the contour at all.  Not sure if that&#x27;s because of the other face products I use before hand (as instructed-I use my normal lotion, primer, foundation and powder before applying the contour).  But so far, so good!  *UPDATE*  I took this down from a 4 to a 3 because it leaves my face so incredibly shiny.  I&#x27;m actually open minded to any ideas or products on how to combat this.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PALETTE ! Colors are perfect, HIGH QUALITY makeup, will definitely purchase again !</li>
    <li> product as described!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m very pale so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the colors but they work very well. Also, I love that it&#x27;s powder because it blends very well. After I did my makeup using this kit, everyone wanted me to do their makeup. My delivery came fast and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Love this contour kit! I bought mine for $20 off Groupon a while back &amp; could not be happier with it! I use it daily and have had it for several months but still have lots left. It&#x27;s got the perfect amount of pigment and I love that the dark colors do not look orange. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use &amp; deposits just the right amount of color so your whole face is done &amp; flawless in no time! I will definitely buy this again... it quickly became a staple item.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this contour palette. Buttery, blendable and not chalky at all. I like it even better than my ABH palette. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> You gotta reapply CONSTANTLY it&#x27;s annoying. Knock off version of the Anastasia one. Don&#x27;t buy if you have oily skin. Get the cream one, this one is good as a finishing coat but remember to take it with you everywhere</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great directions included</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about this but really wanted to try contouring. I love it! Wonderful product! Easy to apply and perfect results every time! I also bought the brushes.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased to have received the Aesthetica Contour &amp; Highlighting Palette, without incident, that I recently ordered online from Amazon.ca. It arrived much quicker than I had anticipated, and the shipping costs for me were free, which was fabulous! I have had so much difficulty finding a contour product that works well for me as I have a very fair &#x27;Winter&#x27;, pink-toned complexion. Everything I have purchased, to date, turns incredibly orange on my skin. The middle contour shade, &#x27;Picture Perfect&#x27; is just the colour that I have been trying to find, and it is a lovely, medium taupe-toned shade. The other colours &#x27;Sunkissed&#x27; and &#x27;Flawless&#x27;  appear as having a fair bit of orange in them when applied on my skin, but they may be suitable for bronzing shades if I use a lighter hand. The highligher colours work well as subtle highlighting on me, but I have really enjoyed using the middle &#x27;banana&#x27; yellow shade of powder to set my undereye concealer. The hard cardboard palette is compact, and sturdy, which is great for travel. The powders are pigmented, and there is no difficulty with application and/or blending. The only criticism that I have, and it is minor, is that the names of the six powders included are only written on the envelope cover of the palette, and not on the palette itself. I have not checked to see if Aesthetica Cosmetics sells replacement contour and highlighter shades, individually, as they appear to be removable. There again, having the names of the shades on the actual palette would have been helpful in this regard. Included is an educational pamphlet indicating how best to contour and highlight the face with this palette, and they also include an acetate picture of the contour and highlighting areas of the face.  I would highly recommend this palette to anyone who is having difficulty finding appropriate contour and highlighting shades, and also to those who are looking for an affordable, yet quality contour and highlighting palette in powder form.  The free shipping, and a reduced retail price are added bonuses, for sure!

    <li> For my first time contouring it works really well and you cannot beat the price! If you are looking for a contour kit to buy; I would deffinitly suggest this one.</li>
    <li> I was looking around for a nice contour palette and of course the majority of them were soooo EXPENSIVE!!! I finally came across this one and LOVE IT!!! Best contour palette and it actually stays on! I was expecting this to fade away or rub off, but it doesn&#x27;t!!! It blends nicely and comes with 6 different colors. There is a light shimmer one for highlighting as well. I am so glad I spent the money on this one! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS instead of the top brands like Smashbox palette (runs about $45) or Anasasia Beverly Hills. This one works just as well. So glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> Love this contour set. This was my first time using any type of contouring and I absolutely love it! Easy to use and goes on nicely! !</li>
    <li> Not good for tan to darker skin tones. Guess I should have researched a little more.</li>
    <li> This kit is AMAZING! Especially for beginners like myself, it comes with a pamphlet that is so easy to learn from. This arrived SO quick and came in perfect condition. It&#x27;s really a good size and should last me a while. I would definitely buy from this seller again, and probably have no need to step foot in Sephora after discovering this. Definitely try it out, it won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Awesome! Looks great and doesn&#x27;t look red on my skin tone like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This contouring thing is all new to me. After watching a few videos and learning how, I turned to Amazon to pamper myself with some contour/highlighting makeup of my own. I really like this product, it&#x27;s easy to apply and appears to stay on all day. Get yourself some good make-up brushes, watch a tutorial or two, give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a contouring product. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;m very fair complexted and it looks great. Contours my face without making me look orange.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for a good price but I will need to practice a lot to get the proper effect.</li>
    <li> I like the illustrations it comes with, but that&#x27;s about it. I am a beginner and have watched tons of videos after getting this and trying this out. I can NOT see the light tones at all on my skin. I don&#x27;t want to have to cake it on in order to see it. I am fair skinned and had no idea which light color to use. The pinkish one, the yellowish one or the other? No helpful instructions there. Same for the darker colors. I got the darker colors to show up just fine, but still really had to use more than I expected. I would not recommend buying this and I wish I had gone for liquid. WAY too expensive to just waste practicing on.</li>
    <li> I am very fair so I only use the dark color sparingly. Nice kit with a mirror and instructional picture included. A bit pricey</li>
    <li> Very light. Maybe, if you&#x27;re a first timer at contouring this would be good to work with.</li>
    <li> This is the first contour kit I&#x27;ve bought. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great quality. Goes on like cheap eyeshadow and it&#x27;s very difficult to blend in. I use it anyways but only until I find something better.</li>
    <li> Love it if applied right u get a Hollywood look will continue to buy</li>
    <li> This is just what I was waiting for!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I read all of the great reviews for this product and decided to try it. The shades pictured aren&#x27;t exactly as shown, and if I can say one thing about this product it is, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE FAIR SKIN. After applying ( and blending ) I looked like the woman pictured in the card showing where you are supposed to apply the product, dark streaks everywhere, and that&#x27;s using the lightest of the deeper shades. Other than the misrepresentation that this is suitable for all skin tones and the price, the yellowish highlighting shade works well for undereyes and would be good if you have darker skin. But for all you fair/very fair skinned women- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Super easy to use, clear instructions- does not cake which was my concern--Love, Love, Love it!!!!!-- will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It came exactly when it said it would. I&#x27;m a huge makeup collector and have been wanting this for a while. I have the powder now along with the concealer version. Very pigmatated but is not a coverage product. It you at looking for acne or facial coverage. Do not buy this for that use. I suggest doing a normal face routine then adding contour form this product. A must buy</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive ones!  Buy it! :)</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot! Bought it around Christmas and still using it.</li>
    <li> The powder suck 😞&lt;br /&gt;Does not look right at all on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;When I got it I was WTF???&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that say it&#x27;s a great product I guess they must got  it for free</li>
    <li> The colors are perfect. However, I found it clogged my pores. I broke out only in the areas I applied it.</li>
    <li> Great for beginners ! Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The price is great and once you read all the instructions, you have good brushes to work with the results are incredible. I feel like a celebrity now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to contouring but this pallet seems good to me. I use it regularly &amp; it has several different colors for me to try. Shipped fast as well.</li>
    <li> Best make up I&#x27;ve ever had! Came on time, intact.</li>
    <li> I can say it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I use it more for eye shadow because contouring in a way that it doesn&#x27;t make you look like a clown is very difficult and time consuming.</li>
    <li> Great for contouring beginners! Offers a step by step guide to make it easy.</li>
    <li> it goes on so easy and my favorite contour palette</li>
    <li> Great product.  Lots of highlighting colors, stays on all day!</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of makeup but I&#x27;ve never contoured before this . Maybe I&#x27;m just really bad at it but no matter how much blending I do it just looks so unnatural and wrong.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected really dissapointing, two of my contour circles were cracked don&#x27;t buy. Wish I would&#x27;ve chose liquid instead..</li>
    <li> These are good powders that are very close to the Anastasia contour kit. I have no complaints about this kit. Well made, and the powders all look pretty natural.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just wish the pans were a little bigger. Beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> Almost no pigment. Very chalky, I gave it 2 stars because the dark brown works okay as a blending eyeshadow(also not great.)</li>
    <li> Literally the most amazing kit! The reviews on here aren&#x27;t as helpful as the ones on YouTube. I youtubed reviews about this product before I bought it. Definitely worth it! I got it super fast too! I literally get compliments on my makeup all the time now. The only thing I did different was use this kit instead of the ben nye concealer wheel.</li>
    <li> Very nice and soft&lt;br /&gt;I like it so mutch</li>
    <li> I bought this recently and was looking forward to trying it since I read good reviews on it. I was also nervous though, ordering online makeup can always be scary. But I am very pleased with the product. It lived up to its description and reviews.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought contour and highlighting makeup. It came in perfect condition. No breakage. Nice package. It has a step by step how to apply based on the shape of your face. I didn&#x27;t do too badly for my first time. I wouldn&#x27;t say it has high pigmentation, but in this case I think that&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m not trying to look like a clown. It does blend well. Over all I&#x27;m happy with it and will continue to practice. :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, easy to use and my face looks very natural with a beautifull countour,</li>
    <li> Amazing and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I bought this product through groupon and I just wanted to post how bad of a product this is. First of all is not for all skin tones. I wore this product 3 times and every single time I got nothing but an itchy face full of bumps. I do not have sensitive skin. I wear regular makeup (bare minerals mac younique anastasia etc etc). Worst contour kit I have ever tried. Not worth a penny. I do not understand how is it that it has so many good reviews.!!!</li>
    <li> Love using this product. Apply very easy and instructions are simple.</li>
    <li> i thought it was cream, but it&#x27;s powder.... I&#x27;ll make it work bc i prefer cream concealers...</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this contouring/ highlighting set. I love it when she does my makeup.  It makes my face look slimmer, younger and pronounces my cheek bones.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Really, just meh.  I have enough experience with makeup and contouring to know a good product when I have it in my hands. The product name is a misnomer, first off.  This is a powder contour kit.  Not foundation. Not concealer. Not blush.  Contour colours are fine.  Highlight does not have enough pigment to make skin pop. Packaging is nice. Powders are milled nicely. Product is over priced. Keep looking for a satisfying palette. I have a strong suspicion that commenters have all been given the product for free and are commenting as a result. Read through them - you&#x27;ll get the same idea.</li>
    <li> This product is a great start for beginners, I just started learning about contour and highlight. I know I know way behind everyone else. But it has a little instruction booklet that helps you figure out where to place the contour and highlight this is a god send and I&#x27;m so glad I have it now. Plus the pots pop out so if you wanted to depot or replace one it&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> Love the aesthetica kit just amazing</li>
    <li> This is just a matter of preference, but you have more application control with cream contouring and highlighting kits. I find using powder messy and hard to define facial areas, whereas blending with cream is exceptionally precise and has super great full coverage. Having said this, my initial reaction when trying this palate was, &amp;#34;Meh,&amp;#34; and the powder is chalky, and is nowhere NEAR the look or feel of high-end product, so don&#x27;t expect much in that department. I will admit, however, as the day passed, the application looks less powdery as the day progressed (I always spray set my makeup application in the AM). The contouring lasts and by 5 PM, it was soft and quite natural (I do have super oily skin and this product did improve with the oilier my skin became; big plus for me). The singular OUTSTANDING thing about the product is the contouring application guide, which helps make pro application easy for a novice.  It&#x27;s easy to understand and the visual guide is pretty foolproof! I bought this elsewhere online, and I was REALLY looking forward to being excited by it, but quite frankly, when done with this, I&#x27;ll never think to buy powder contouring from Aesthetica, so the search continues. If you are looking for an excellent product with super lasting effects, check out Mehron. Coloring matching is AMAZING, can&#x27;t rave enough about it, and no, I do not get paid for saying this!</li>
    <li> I purchased a contouring product for the first time, I&#x27;m overall pleased with this palette. It comes with some directions that help you identify your face shape and the best ways to contour for your shape. I like the lightness of the powders and the shades are not too overly pigmented so I&#x27;m not scared to apply it on my face. I liked the powder texture, so beginners like me can use more easily. I really recommend this with reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Love it worth every dime</li>
    <li> I really love this Makeup kit all in one&lt;br /&gt;I love the color&#x27;s and it blends in so smooth and natural. This doesn&#x27;t feel caked on at all. I have had no reactions from wearing this. This is a pretty big and will last for a while. Excellent quality and I highly recommend you try this Aesthetica Cosmetics Foundation, Blush, Shading and Concealing Makeup,.. I based this review with my honest opinion</li>
    <li> Not much pigment. I guess okay for the price - you get what you pay for. Good for beginners to try but it really needs a better formula.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loveeeeeeee. The banana powder color is my favorite for contouring!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are great, but I have very light skin and the darks are a little too dark for me, which isn&#x27;t horrible I can soften them up, but they are a little orange on my skin which is a little hard to cover.  But other than that I can&#x27;t complain.  I love this set.</li>
    <li> I am overwhelmed with how well this product makes you look natural and classic. The powders are light enough to go on effortlessly yet stay the whole day. And thank goodness for the detailed instructions! This brand does an amazing job making contouring easy and simple enough to apply every day, not just for special occasions.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good for the money, not the best but it does its job.  Its easy to use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product so I cannot say anything about the quality but do not mix this with Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit. At first I wanted to order this thinking I am getting the brand I want, but thank God, I noticed that the name is different. I think they do this to trick people. so be careful.</li>
    <li> not what I expected! going to ulta and getting the real deal! going to send it back! its messy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience. I got it right away &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Perfect for learning how to contour and shadow...worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> This product is good but i think the liqued works better then powder but product itself is very great quality.</li>
    <li> I have tried other contour kits out there and this one is by far my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;It includes:&lt;br /&gt;2 shimmery highlights (one cool, one warm)&lt;br /&gt;2 matte highlights, perfect for under the eyes (one cool, one warm)&lt;br /&gt;2 contour shades (one cool, one warm)&lt;br /&gt;and a easy to follow guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shades are perfect whether you are pale or medium complected, I would not recommend for darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, pigmented and blend like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that compared to other contour kits,  It takes me longer to hit pain on this one. It also comes with a guide inside&lt;br /&gt;to help beginners learn to contour like a pro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to try there cream contour kit next!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this pallete. In the past, I was using creams for my highlighting and contouring, which just wasn&#x27;t working for me. This is a palette of powders and was absolutely perfect for me. I love that there are three different contouring colors and three different highlighters. I live in Vegas, and my skin color varies radically from season to season. It&#x27;s nice to know that I will not have to by a different product for each season (another downfall of the cream that I own.) The case is slim and I love the way it fits in a sleeve. Thus keeping another deterrent for my wayward toddler. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice contour pallet!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I allows you to do all kinds of different looks and even has some how-to cards to help you out if you need it!</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for dry skin.  It is a powder that seems to really cling to any dry patches and makes them much more obvious. The colors are great,  and the pigment is good,  so if you have smooth skin,  this would probably be perfect.  I think I&#x27;m just going to have to stick to cream palettes.</li>
    <li> This is a good beginners kit for contouring because it is powder based and makes it easier to blend and not create too harsh of lines, but if you are familiar already with how to contour and blend I would not recommend this. The colors do not show well no matter what brush you use, especially the &amp;#34;highlighting&amp;#34; colors. I had to use so much highlighting because the color was so dull that I hit pan on every highlight withing 2 months!!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the contour colors are an odd brown which made my face look dirty all the time. It also made my pores very noticeable no matter how much primer I used.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper than an ABH or Kat Von D but a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this brand on youtube.  I decided to buy this since I wasn&#x27;t able to get the ABH ones.  It&#x27;s always sold out at all the Sephora&#x27;s near me, and for some reason, I had problems trying to purchase it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have gotten a bad one seeing all the rave reviews here.  The one I have has barely any color pay off ( I have used many different brushes to apply this with from synthetic to natural hair, fluffier brushes to very dense brushes).  Also, this does not last long on me as well.  By the end of the day, most of it has already faded (I usually do not have problems with products fading on me).  Lastly all the colors looked muddy on me which made my face look dirty.  It also made me break out in bumps everywhere it was applied which is weird since I read the ingredients, and it didn&#x27;t contain anything that I know would cause me to break out....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free though so 1 star for that.  I definitely would not repurchase this product at all though.  The price isn&#x27;t that cheap either (since you have to pay for shipping)  I will pay more and get the Kat Von D Shade Light Palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in China (Aesthetica)</li>
    <li> Great for night make up!</li>
    <li> I love this palette. It&#x27;s amazing the quality of it is great and there pigmentation of it is light to medium so you can add more or wear less. It sets nicely over creams. I highly recommend it. The shipping was fast and I live in Germany so I was surprised.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t started to use mines. The whole packet looks nice and easy to use, the direction is conveniently included so you can always take it with the palette. This is my first time to try contouring so I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> just okay, not so cool for the ebony/dark skin woman, the dark colours are hardly visible on contouring,  even with the help of a dark foundation.</li>
    <li> i love all the colours in it and it blends really well. Not chalky or powdery but smooth and easy to apply. Contouring is much easier with this kit for me now. I am really loving this kit. Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> This is not for everyday use but great for when you want that extra glamour look.</li>
    <li> Good combination and directions.  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Meh - colors are OK, but not great for very pale people. Also, the powders made my face itch like crazy. I have sensitive skin and had to wash this stuff off after I applied it.</li>
    <li> I am convinced that any reviewer who gives a positive review on this product has been paid to do so. I have a caramel/honey complexion, and I don&#x27;t think this product was meant for women with darker skin. This product, from the lightest to the darkest shade left a chalky, ghostly look on me. What&#x27;s worse in that the powders are not very pigmented, and so I&#x27;d have to pack on the powder, which would only fade within the hour! Please ladies, don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Invest in a better product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but if it was cream based instead of powder I think it would stay a lot longer.</li>
    <li> For contouring I think liquid is better but if you like powder it would be a good fit.</li>
    <li> Great colors and feels good on skin -</li>
    <li> Great colors and they match my skin tones perfectly.  Nice Nice set.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t irritated me yet.  I like it because I am NOT a makeup person but it is really easy to apply and blending isn&#x27;t too bad either.. It&#x27;s been my go to if I&#x27;m needing a pick me up.  I bought it because it was a middle of the line price range and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> great quality and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> I will definitely be ordering this again, it has surpassed my expectations for a product that was so inexpensive in comparison to its competition.</li>
    <li> I recently receive the Aesthetica Cosmetics contour kit for testing and to review, and fell in love! I have never found a foundation that works so well. It’s not cakey at all, doesn’t look fake, and stays on the entire day. That combined with the highlighter makes my face look healthy and fresh. It’s perfect for anyone looking to do contouring for themselves or as a new makeup artist looking for a good basic kit to start and experiment with. The colors are really pigmented and work with any skin tone. Wonderful Makeup Contour Kit!</li>
    <li> the color tends to look a little chalky</li>
    <li> Great product at a great value!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews ... I do love the contouring colors very nice warm matte shades of brown. However I&#x27;m not impressed at all with the highlight pigments it doesn&#x27;t really pop as much as I would hope...or really show at all. I think a lot of the reviews were given because of free merchandise.</li>
    <li> Love my contour make up.. Nice colors and also worth the price</li>
    <li> This works terrific.  No lines on your face when you use it.  And definitely gives you definition.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Pretty underwhelmed with the quality of this product...the darker contour shades show up but the lighter highlight shades are barely there at all. I would try this in a cream for instead, the powder is pretty much a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Definitely a must have for learning how to contour, powders rather than creams are easier to start with, and these are wonderful!  Highly recommend, can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> Love this contour kit! I used to use what ever make up I had lying around for contour, bit this kit makes it so easy! I love how natural it looks also! Highly recommend! I also got it super fast!</li>
    <li> nice, great selection of colors. easy to store</li>
    <li> No one is born flawless but this contour and highlighting powder foundation palette really showcases your natural beauty. It works great to help define your face and get that perfect finished look. The colors are very pigmented and I found it was easy to blend them out too. If I want to go for a really bold look I blend them out less but it also works well to get the subtle contours where it looks like you aren&#x27;t wearing any makeup if I choose to go with the more toned down side of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette has a well balanced color option. Three darker shades and three lighter ones, so many skin shades will benefit from using the contouring and highlight powder. The palette also has detailed instructions included for beginners to help explain how to use them correctly and also where to apply each shade. I like that each pan can be pulled from the palette in case I want to create my own custom palette. The packaging is great and you don&#x27;t need to pull the pans out though because it isn&#x27;t bulky and also they included a mirror on the palette itself. I can just include this in with my makeup bag and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space and helps me out if I forget a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great gift for any woman! Older teens just starting out and trying to build their makeup collection would be thrilled with what this palette includes since it offers so much variety for a great price. I do highly recommend this palette, and wish I would of had it much sooner. I included pictures so you can see how it looks against the skin and to show that the quality is outstanding. I received this for purpose of testing, an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for a beginner like myself. Definitely gives a natural light look. Does not cake at all and really make me glow.  My skin looks flawless. I&#x27;ve been using this pallet for a month now and although I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (Groupon) i definitely recommend to anyone who wants a easy way to look naturally flawless. If you are in the need of more coverage I wouldn&#x27;t recommend because this is a powder.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Aesthetica Cosmetics contour kit for testing and review purposes, and fell in love! I love makeup but purchasing every item separately gets pricey, plus I usually don’t end up with exactly what I wanted. The Aesthetica Cosmetics Contour has very beautiful, natural colors.  It’s perfect for anyone looking to do contouring for themselves or as a new makeup artist looking for a good basic kit to start and experiment with. The colors are really pigmented and work well with any skin tone. There&#x27;s also a pretty good chart comes with it that you can use as a reference to what features are normally highlighted/enhanced and contoured. I just started to use this product and haven&#x60;t notice any allergic reaction. I would recommend to anyone that are looking for a versatile item to add to their kit.</li>
    <li> Bought it because of the great reviews, wasted my money. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product, I should&#x27;ve done my research. This is not a creamy palette but a powder, I&#x27;m fair skinned, I attempted to put it on and it&#x27;s barely visible on me. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money like I did.</li>
    <li> I was excited when it came,i tried it on and i have all kind of bumps appearing on my face the same day. I washed it off and washed my face thoroughly and tried again a few days later and crazy huge bumps appeared again on my face. I dont know what it is.....but i am not using it again.</li>
    <li> Very good for oily skin</li>
    <li> I actually thought this was a cream, but it is a powder. I love the different shades. I use all. Love it cuz it works!!! I love to contour. I see it in my photos. My face has gained weight and this product helps slim the face and emphasize the cheek bones etc. Love it. Use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect shading! It lasts all day and was very easy to apply! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> The product was too light for my complexion</li>
    <li> Excellent contouring makeup! It comes with helpful step by step directions and ideas. Also helped me identify what type of face I have, and the best way to highlight my features. Their brush set is perfect combo, I am so glad I have them now! Quick and easy contouring :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I have not gotten the privilege to try this but from the reviews I see it looks great</li>
    <li> Works great for a few hours...so perfect for a night out. But doesn&#x27;t hold up for the whole day</li>
    <li> The powder didn&#x27;t show up on my skin, all it did was made me look ashy</li>
    <li> Great colors for contouring and highlighting. A great dupe for the Anastasia Beverly Hills contouring kit. I would have given it a five star rating but, it does break me out when I use it.</li>
    <li> I have not used it, but as I read it sounds good</li>
    <li> Not what I expected it&#x27;s very small but it&#x27;ll pull though for now</li>
    <li> Contour kit is amazing!</li>
    <li> Truly wonderful product. Blends easily. Instructions are easy to follow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to contouring and this kit made it easy and everything blended really well. I&#x27;ve honestly never tried contouring so I was really happy they included an instructional guide. I looked at almost every contouring kit available on Amazon and I am so happy I went with this kit!</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a mess and the colors were going to be too dark but it&#x27;s the opposite. This is such a great palette, the colors are very very blendable and not crazy pigmented and the shimmery highlighter is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I am in love, this went on so easily and felt butter soft.  The pigmentation was great, a little goes a long way. The pans are removable so that the ones that you use most (and we all have one we use most) can be replaced without having to buy the whole palette again. The packaging is sturdy and also it comes with a nice how to instruction sheet. This is going to be added to my regular line up of make up</li>
    <li> I just got into the whole contour thing. I&#x27;ve watched youtube videos and still couldn&#x27;t get it right until I got this! The directions are clear, the colors are great, and the quality is superb. I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> High quality and strong recommendation</li>
    <li> Shipped great and fast. I dont know much about it but my girl loved it. ( thats saying alot), she is so picky with makeup.</li>
    <li> Is exactly as described.  The facial guide included is very helpful.  A good starter for someone who doesn&#x27;t have experience with contouring yet.</li>
    <li> This is the first contouring kit that I&#x27;ve ever used. I like that it came with step by step instructions and pictures for contour novices. With the three different high light colors and shadow colors, you are able to find a color that goes well with your skin. I found this product easy to use and looks great on my skin. The only thing I wish it instructed me on was how to blend with a certain type of brush. Otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> I love it! Easy to follow directions. Only disappointment was the box that holds it came apart. That&#x27;s it. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s my first time doing the whole highlighting contouring deal so this is nice because it has a step by step explaining exactly how to do it based on your face shape even. Great product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Simply the easiest contouring makeup ever. Smooth and blends well!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a very good  quality contour powder. It goes on smooth and lasts till you take it off. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Got it fast &amp; love it! Will order again. The colors are perfect!</li>
    <li> Great product for me as I saw comparable ones for much more money in the marketplace.  So this was a bargain with the same results.</li>
    <li> Very pleasantly surprised with the quality. I&#x27;ve no professional experience but am just getting into doing makeup for clients, and it&#x27;s really come through for me and always looks great!</li>
    <li> Great product I can see why people contour now and it didnt take long to do and this kit comes with easy applying directions which came in handy for me since it was my first time.</li>
    <li> I love this it&#x27;s perfect has all the right colors and pigmented it&#x27;s a really good palette</li>
    <li> Sorry but it was to dry for my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to contouring, so I decided to go with a powder because I figured that it would be easier to use. There&#x27;s a little instructional booklet with a QR code you can scan to view a YouTube how-to video. The video moves sort of fast, but it shows the best application method, which I like. There&#x27;s also a film over the powders that shows application areas. The powders are easy to apply and blend. This is really a great set.</li>
    <li> Hi this palette is nice but I did think it was a powder foundation, the foundation part is not so as the powder is very soft and light, had I known it was so light I would have looked for something that was a bit more pigmented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to contour but so far so good!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Perfect for beginners to experts! I got the brush set that goes with this as well and they work so amazing together! I would definitely recommend. Don&#x27;t waste your money on products that are exactly the same, but so expensive</li>
    <li> Very, Very nice product ones you put it on your face your face looks very natural is like you don&#x27;t have any makeup on.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so i was worried I would break out. This is a great pallet. I use it every day and love it!</li>
    <li> Totally love it. I&#x27;m a blonde with fair skin and colors  works perfectly for me( I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist) it has a step by step directions inside, very easy to use and it helps to &amp;#34;instantly loose &amp;#34; like a pound of your face.</li>
    <li> Well its powder for you. Make sure you use a primer when using this or it wont hold for long periods of time. It works great for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product and got it super quick</li>
    <li> This stuff really does make a difference  in my appearance!! I applied like the instruction say and my cheekbones popped and my nose...which I think is big..it appears more slender. It&#x27;s great for special  outings or just when I want a more defined  look!</li>
    <li> The best contour kit i have ever use. The power is easy to blend with the skin for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> I love this product the colors are perfect and stay on all day. Perfect H&amp;C kit!</li>
    <li> I love this contour kit, I have been using it for a while...I just reordered another one.</li>
    <li> Good product. no problem with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found that I found this product. I was at Ulta almost ready to buy the Anastasia contour kit for almost double the price of this kit! Glad I changed my mind. I like how it comes with a booklet for the different face shapes and the small picture to follow as well. Since I really have no idea what to do I find these to be very helpful in learning to contour! I highly recommend it (plus the shades are pretty close to the Anastasia kit as well)</li>
    <li> I liked this pallet only the colors don&#x27;t really show up so good I usually will use a cream under it</li>
    <li> This item came in as expected. I have really fair skin so this product works for me, but I did notice that it takes a little bit more product then it normally would take to see on my face. That is why Ionly gave 4 stars. I hope i don&#x27;t run out too quickly. Otherwise, it is a great beginner contour kit.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it....no complaints</li>
    <li> Excellent to apply and it does make you look better. Just follow the chart that comes with it. The shades are very nice and match my skin.</li>
    <li> A really great pallete, I&#x27;m a contouring beginner and found the instructions included extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> Loved it, exactly as shown. The shipment was quick as well. Very impressed definitely re ordering .</li>
    <li> Good bronzer, the highlighter is okay. Does a great job with contour!</li>
    <li> First off I must say the delivery was very fast, when they said 2 days they meant it. And the product itself came in perfect condition. 2 problems I have. The first being I have very fair skin, and the contour shades are a bit dark, so I&#x27;m going to have to mix to get the shade I want. The second problem I have is there are six shades, so I wish instead of giving really obvious instructions on how to contour. I wish they recommended certain shades for certain areas/skin tones. I haven&#x27;t actually tried out the product. Overall I can see it working decently for contouring. Once I mix my shades</li>
    <li> Omg Love this Product Outstanding Loveeee It😗</li>
    <li> Product arrived early . and works great instructions are very clear .</li>
    <li> After watching a few contouring tutorials on youtube, using this set is a breeze. It goes on beautifully and lasts all day. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product just wish the highlighter came with a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I wish for the price it included brushes. The colors are great, a bit chalky but still looks good. I&#x27;m a light medium skin tone.</li>
    <li> relle good i love it will order agin</li>
    <li> The colours are as I expected  need to apply a little bit heavy for results,  but sits well on foundation. Works well makeup stays in place</li>
    <li> I love the effect I can get with this set, but I wish it was a bit more substantial than powder. Also, you must supply your own brushes / means of application. However, it comes with detailed instructions, which is partially what sold me on this item. I usually have no idea what I&#x27;m doing with make up, so this was helpful.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and she loves it. She loves to do her makeup and this is a great way to teach her how to contour like a pro.</li>
    <li> I like this. I really liked the color highlighter, but then I realized it started making me breakout with acne. Then after a while of using the palette I realized that the powders are too chalky. But overall this is great if you want to practice contouring while on a budget.</li>
    <li> Its really nice. And I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this contour an highlighting kit. Easy to follow directions on how to apply - love it</li>
    <li> I like the cosmetics contoured, I use everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this contour and highlighting powder. I use it every day, I figured out really fast how to apply it and am still coming up with new ways to improve my look. It last a pretty long time. It is truly worth the price. Lady&#x27;s your natural face has contours lets get away from one toned makeup.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be more of a cream/concealer texture but they are pretty much big eye shadows. Just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly, undamaged. There is a very nice instructional guide with pictures.  The only problem is that the lighter colors aren&#x27;t light enough to act as a higlighter for someone with very fair skin.  They were the same color as my skin and ineffective, which was disappointing.  I may keep playing with the kit but I don&#x27;t really see how it would be able to work for me.  (Maybe I just need to get a tan!)</li>
    <li> I thought that the pigmentation was lacking. I was disappointed. I&#x27;ll probably use these are eye shadows.</li>
    <li> First time using a contouring kit and I love this one!  Easy instructions and great colors!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powder, and does very little for contouring.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Worth the money for sure !</li>
    <li> I like it, but I prefer a cream based contour product, it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Not very pigmented. Chalky.</li>
    <li> Not for all skin types as suggested. I like all the guides provided for application which was helpful. But I did not like how it looked on my face after application.  My face looked lighter, and dry even with my favorite foundation. If your complexion is mocha - like, you may not like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best in the world, but certainly not the worst. The product is very shimmery at best and it takes a lot to apply. The reviews seem to be a bit over exaggerated: the instructions for contouring won&#x27;t magically transform your makeup skills. You probably could find better instructions online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s cheap. And it&#x27;s nice for beginners who don&#x27;t want to invest a lot in contour kits. It&#x27;s not the poorest quality, considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you really get what you paid for with this product. Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
    <li> Good contour kit! Easy to use!</li>
    <li> Very flakey powder. So cheap quality.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s better than the anastasia one!</li>
    <li> no pigment whatsoever... different than the ones they sell at sephora which is highly pigmented.  tossed</li>
    <li> VERY NICE AND i LOVE :)</li>
    <li> good dupe for anastacia contour kit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars simply because It&#x27;s my first kit,&lt;br /&gt;and although I&#x27;m seeing something happening with my face (lol), I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m a light skin African Canadian; so i&#x27;m still experimenting as to what shade is the best for me</li>
    <li> I honestly was expecting this to be a palette of different shades of bronzer but it is not. The powder creates shadows on your face, not harsh lines like a bronzer. Really great product.</li>
    <li> the quality of this product is not the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews but it seriously looks like I did nothing after I put it on.  I&#x27;ve followed the directions.  I just don&#x27;t understand where I&#x27;m going wrong.  I&#x27;ve tried using my expensive makeup brushes and my fingertips.  Nothing changes my final result.  I look exactly the same.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Yet again being a beauty obsessed junkie living in South African is a disadvantage due to being the last to catch on to beauty trends and corresponding beauty products becoming available. Thank god for Amazon, seriously! Arrived in under 2 weeks in perfect condition, I was eager to try this out as contouring is huge right now! I had my eye on the Anastasia Beverley Hills contour palette as my friend purchased one from a local site for the amount of R1250 (approx $108) which is crazy! Anyway, I gave it a go and the results were beautiful! I immediately went on the look out for a replacement, low and behold, the Aesthetica Cosmetics Contour and Highlighting IS IT!! The formula is amazing, super soft, highly pigmented, applies well to my skin and blends like a dream!!! The results are breath taking and allows me to create a flawless and polished look! I would recommend this product 10 times over, its such amazing value for money at $30 (approx R350). I would definitely recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> Really great contour kit.  Been using it daily for a week now.  Long lasting stays in place all day.  I have become a very big Anastasia Beverly Hills fan.  The little booklet included for tips on how to use this contour kit helped a lot. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> excellent... thanks!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Easy instructions and great color tones.  Would highly recommend for beginners!</li>
    <li> Loved the product and texture</li>
    <li> I love this set.  Its made my face look so much thinner.  I&#x27;m plus sized and have a very round face.  This set has made my face easily look 10 pounds lighter.  I love the template that comes with it as well.  Great different color palate.  Would easily work with many different color types.</li>
    <li> I only gave Aesthetica Cosmetics Contour and Highlighting 4 stars because while it is a nice product, I don&#x27;t find myself using it very much. There is a nice variety of shades for highlighting and contouring.</li>
    <li> Thought it had better direction / color</li>
    <li> I really like it but it makes me break out.</li>
