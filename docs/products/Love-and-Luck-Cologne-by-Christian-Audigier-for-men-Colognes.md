<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not smell as good as department store, weak longevity.</li>
    <li> I had to have a little patience to make this purchase as the value of the product is pretty high. I have owned +25 fragrances over my lifetime and I would put Love and Luck just outside the top 5. A quality brand.</li>
    <li> Great spring smell.  It is a little short lasting, but would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it when my husband wears this cologne, it smells so good! And the women&#x27;s in the pink bottle is my favorite for me too.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne. i bought it on amazon before about a year ago, it was great, but i just received a new bottle a few days ago, and the scent is much more washed up, it seems very diluted, the alcohol smell is very noticeable. Maybe this is why its so cheap. i would buy it from macys or some place reliable. the smell is great i love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent and it&#x27;s long lasting.  Will definitely continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells sweet and fresh.  Definitely will help secrete some extra vag juice from the ladies</li>
    <li> Strong Cologne. I bought this as a gift for my little brother who doesn&#x27;t wear cologne yet. I usually wear Armani Code and have for years, but I really like this scent. Its a little stronger whereas the Armani is very subtle at twice the price. I would recommend this cologne if you want to get a little attention and some compliments from the ladies.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected!  Disappointed by it.  The last time I ever buy it.  Have not worn it since I bought it</li>
    <li> how every man should smell!!!</li>
    <li> Smells Great! So nice and very quick! Would defiantly buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Ed hardy fragrance is amazing!!!!  I never would of thought 2 buy Ed Hardy, now Ive got others purchasing it.  This is a must get item.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this scent, I get many compliments!! Not to strong! I would recommend this product...this is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this foro my son and he loves it!!  The price was EXCELLENT compared to what you would pay in the store.  it is the original item (no fake), and he&#x27;s very happy with the gift!!</li>
    <li> My dad wanted this for Christmas and I found the biggest size at the best price right here on Amazon.  This bottle of cologne is huge and less than half the price in department stores. Great value.</li>
    <li> bought it for my brother as a gift. arrived in time and even thought the package was a bit damage the product was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent. Girls who know me, know this scent as my trademark. I am a high school senior and I have worn this same scent since 8th grade and I do not plan on changing it - God forbid they stop making this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other colognes that seem to all smell like the same musky mixture, this cologne is different. It&#x27;s got a quite a sweet smell to it, however it still maintains its masculinity. Every girl I have ever dated or been near has complimented me on the way I smell and some have even gone as far to tell me how crazy (in a good way) it makes them when they get a whiff of it and they have all told me that I don&#x27;t smell like any other guy out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this scent.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with quick delivery as well as the cologne itself.  It is my son&#x27;s favorite..  he too is happy.  Thank You for such great service..</li>
    <li> My fiance has been wearing this cologne since it came out - Macys no longer carries it so now I buy it for him on Amazon. I&#x27;ve never been a big Ed Hardy fan but Love &amp; Luck smells amazing, and is a very universal scent - it works through the seasons and in different settings.</li>
    <li> Incredible smell for the price, great longevity. I would and will continue to buy this product for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Love the price! Bummed they wouldn&#x27;t ship to Alaska but we made it work with family in WA.</li>
    <li> Definitely a summer scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering. It&#x27;s not overly musky. It&#x27;s pleasant and citrusy. It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, it smells like a nice cologne. I have a problem with some colognes making me feel lightheaded, but this is no problem.</li>
    <li> Nice scent if you are partial to Issey Miyake and Polo Black. Great price.</li>
    <li> I received this product on 8/25/13 and tested it. At first spray, I could instantly tell that it&#x27;s not a genuine product. The scent is EXTREMELY WEAK, obviously watered down so badly that I can&#x27;t smell the scent even after 2 heavy sprays to the neck and 2 sprays to the wrists. I took it to a Macy&#x27;s for comparison with the real deal and it confirmed my suspicion. It didn&#x27;t come close to the strength of the real thing. I&#x27;m really disappointed and is very wary of buying fragrance from Amazon now.</li>
    <li> Great smell for a young adult especially.  My son always get compliments, especially from the ladies! Great price on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This was a great gift for men on my Christmas list. They loved it. I bought the big bottles because they use it everyday.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both LOVE LOVE LOVE ED HARDY!</li>
    <li> My fiance loves it, I love it, and I get compliment often. Just doesn&#x27;t last that long since its water based not oil based. Good cologne for a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my fav. I buy this product regularly. As a female, I wear it and it smells so good. I get compliments from both men and women about how great I smell. I bought it for my husband and ended up keeping it for myself. It is the perfect combination of a clean and crisp scent.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my son-in-law and he loves it! It I his favorite scent. Will most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite scent - will purchase again</li>
    <li> Good price , seller shipped fast, I like the cologne smell but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I wearing it after couple hours the smell seems that fade away!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the brand&lt;br /&gt;Always smell good and fresh if you are looking for a new fragrance this is it!</li>
    <li> The girls at the strip club said I was the best smelling guy ever.. which is pretty good considering how busy they are and how much money the customers probably spend on these things. Excellent deal, this bottle lasts months</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great cologne</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s brother. While it&#x27;s not exactly my kind of cologne it&#x27;s well packaged and was delivered promptly. It&#x27;s perfect if you want to smell like one of the douchebags at a bar downtown that&#x27;s looking to punch a baby if he can&#x27;t get laid.</li>
    <li> it smelled so nice my husband love it and so did I</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a friend and had to get it for my Husband.  He likes it and I like it on him so it is a Win-Win!  This is over $70 at Macy&#x27;s so the price on Amazon was less than half, can buy twice as much.  The scent is clean and fresh and very pleasant.  Will purchase again when it runs out.  We do recommend it!</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely. Great product at a very good price</li>
    <li> Well, I purchased this cologne a few years ago (back in 2009) and man did all my friends (mostly Lady) enjoy the way i smelled :). only 3 spays and you should be good as it can get a bit overpowering. The bottle lasted me for about 4 months. then i went onto True Religion Drifter spray (Smells excellent but wears off a bit quick). now that this was on sale for $33.00 i just had to buy another bottle.. I nearly paid 80 dollars for a 3.5 oz a few years ago. 33 dollars is a steal. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The real deal ,not the fake crap some sellers have on here! Women love to smell ths on me Everyday</li>
    <li> My Boyfriend loves the scent, I recommend it to every girl who wants to make his man feel special love it! It makes a great present</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this at first because I bought the same one kind but smaller bottle. And this one was a little cheaper. But the same day I received this I went to the store where I bought the first one and it was just like this one. It looked cheap but smells the same.. I really like the scent.</li>
    <li> I believe this product is either old or fake.  The scent only lasted about 5 minutes on me, it also made my head hurt.  I&#x27;ve had this product before and know how it should smell, something is wrong with the product.  I will never buy from this company again.  My hard earned money went right down the drain.  Very upset and disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product at good price!</li>
    <li> A man isn&#x27;t fully dressed until he has this fragrance on.</li>
    <li> I order this at least once or twice a year and I get my shipment fast, greatly packaged, and never have an issue. My husband loves the scent and love receiving this as a gift. If there was 10 stars they&#x27;d get it since I also order the female scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great, only lasts for 30 minutes. It should be sold in larger size for less price because having to apply it 2x an hour.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I would recommend this to any male.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He wears this before and I like it in him. He likes it too. Happy for the purchase.</li>
    <li> Received the last day I thought it was a good buy but I guess you get what you pay for looked new but about a quarter was missing looked like it was a sampler in Macy&#x27;s some where</li>
    <li> fast shipping, decent price</li>
    <li> Just ok, nothing extreme about it.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells good but at Macy&#x27;s it seemed a little less watered down. Im not sure why but overall its good for the price i get compliments all the time. I gave it a 4 stars because i think it smells a little watered downed but still overall good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad, He loves this stuff. It&#x27;s okay to me.</li>
    <li> As anyone can tell from my reviews, I usually rate things pretty high.  I must say that I&#x27;m EXTREMELY disappointed with this cologne. I expected way better. Smells very feminine.  I don&#x27;t know how or why a man would wear this. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m only out about 20 bucks as this isn&#x27;t even worth that amount. If you like smelling like a girl then this is the cologne for you.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> love it.  Bought as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> smells great but scent doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good price and fast shipping, thanks.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. Item as described very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quicker than expected. Very happy with purchase &amp; product!!</li>
    <li> great value; gift for son-in-law  his favorite cologne / was a perfect gift!</li>
    <li> Smells great and comes with a pretty good amount. I love when my boyfriend wears it because it smells good and lasts.</li>
    <li> Check my review history, I&#x27;m always honest and give good ratings. I&#x27;m very dissapointed I&#x27;ve bought this cologne @ Macys 5x&#x27;s in the past and know how it&#x27;s suppossed to smell %100. I bought it from here and I regret it so badly, it&#x27;s fake. It smells more like alcohol than the way it&#x27;s meant to smell. This was very dissapointing Amazon, if you plan to buy it DON&#x27;T buy it here. This sucks!!!! Money gone to waste.</li>
    <li> Smell so good and even brings out the best in you</li>
    <li> My wife and I tend to make fun of everything ED HARDY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which makes it sooo hard to write this review... The stuff smells good.. A very clean Citrusy Summer scent.. Closest comparisons I can make are Aqua Di Gio or Tommy for men.. Normally I would not wear those scents in Winter because they tend to be kinda weak and I prefer a more woodsy strong scent in Winter.. But as clean as this scent it.... It is strong as well... 3 sprays and I am still smelling it 9 hours later.</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s not that great plus it&#x27;s almost if not the same as exceptional because you are for men</li>
    <li> Watered down. Bottle I bought at the mall 3 years ago still outlasts this economy size bottle. You want the real thing.... Sorry, looks like you&#x27;re going to have to pay for it. I have been using this big bottle for a while now, the smell is great and authentic. I was running out, so I use my first,  smaller bottle sparingly. I can now tell a big difference on the time it takes for this cologne to wear off. The smaller more expensive bottle (from the mall) def is more potent and lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband to add to his cologne collection. Out of all of his choices this one has always smelled the most pleasant to me. Not to strong and last all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift. It is what my son wanted and was in perfect condition. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It was good and as i expected. recommend it to everybody wishing to captivate a gorgeous woman and luv her.</li>
    <li> fresh, sweet, and intoxicating opening....then after about 30 minutes, dies on the vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for the first hour or so.  wear it just before you meet your date, let her get a whiff, then close the sale before it dissipates to slight musk.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for christmas. Great size, great package, and probably one the best smelling colognes on the market, in my opinion. I had no idea it was ed hardy until I asked!</li>
    <li> This is overall good cologne, It seems to wear better in the summer when it&#x27;s hot. I&#x27;ve gotten a few comments on this fresh smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> I was tired of my husbands cologne and looked at some of the local stores for something new. I found this one and really liked it, but it was so expensive!! I bought it as a Christmas present and then when I got home I checked on Amazon...it was half the price for a bottle TWICE the size!!!!! I promptly returned the one I had purchased and ordered this one.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Smells just like Sean John Unforgivable which one of my faves but got discontinued. My buddy had it and I had to buy it and for $30, why not. Only downfall is the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. Could just be me though. For the scent, amount, and price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a buy</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic. My wife loves it. The price is way better than any where else I have seen this cologne.</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; cologne.  It&#x27;s a great scent without being overpowering.  Also great for date nights too.  My fiancee loves it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift - person who received it loves it! Large size for great price! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It goes on well, not overpowering, but fades fast.  Within about 2 hours the scent is completely gone.  I would apply it no longer than 30 minutes before your event.  The scent is little more sweeter than I prefer, but its not bad.  Maybe better for someone younger.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice,the price is excellent,can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
    <li> Ed hardy is definitely on my top of the list of favorite colognes. Is smells wonderful and you can absolutely be anywhere and this cologne will grab anyone&#x27;s attention. It makes all the girls smile and focus on you, just dress well &amp; spray this one, no regrets!!</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts forever on my skin. To me, at least, the smell is very unique. Women love it!!! Great night out/date scent.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the bottle I was thinking it was the small one but thank you for giving me the right size and the cost is great</li>
    <li> This cologne is a good size bottle and it smells so good I get compliments all the time when I go out in public.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, what I needed</li>
    <li> This is very soft, very musky, not nearly as sparkling citrus or alcoholic-smelling as the women&#x27;s version(which I love, too).  I could wear this on it&#x27;s own, but, as always, it layers very well with the women&#x27;s, or something similar (G of the Sea,  Passport Tokyo).</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely amazing at a amazing price.  This is one of my favorite Ed Hardy colognes.  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> bought this for a gift.they were almost out of the other bottle like this so I bought them another.they said I was almost out of this suprise</li>
    <li> Great Spring/Summer bargain bin scent. I have been using it daily...at least until my Gucci Pour Homme 2 from Amazon gets here.  A fragrance needs to be light &amp; fresh to stand up during the crucible that is the Arkansas Summer :)</li>
    <li> Found this at a large department store and my husband loved the scent, decided to check amazon and surprised and happy to see it at a fraction of the cost. A year later and my husband is still using the same bottle purchased and smelling delish!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation I found online. I really like the fragrance and the lady likes it also. Depending on the strength of the fragrance I tend to use between 2 and 5 sprays. This cologne last very well with only 3 sprays. I can still smell it on my skin after 9 hours at work.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this cologne from Amazon since I didn&#x27;t know it was original, but boy I was totally wrong. This cologne is very original at rational, good, and great price. I first used this this cologne, everybody noticed it. It has a calm, soft, elegant, and unique smell that when your wear it, ladies notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this cologne. I love it and I think you&#x27;re going too!&lt;br /&gt;and  cautious smell</li>
    <li> i buy this perfume bc a friend of my give me the same 1 for my birthday present long time ago and i love it but i run out so i need more so i order this one and turn to be fake smell like nothing i spray my self and walk from my bathroom to my kitchen and the smell disapear is like the bottle is full of water DONT BUY</li>
    <li> Great scent, I really like it but it doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin...about 4 hours or less</li>
    <li> Product was great but ups smashed my package. The box was ruined and most of the air bubbles were popped inside. The cardboard around the cologne was smashed but thankfully the cologne its self was fine</li>
    <li> my dad loves this perfume. I ordered for him and he just loved it!</li>
    <li> I know Ed Hardy is going out of style but their perfumes are still amazing! I loved this one! It&#x27;s very fresh. It&#x27;s good for the spring/summer time. I got a lot of compliments on it already and they loved it. I didn&#x27;t get a fake one, for the price I paid it was a very good deal :)!</li>
    <li> Good cologne, bought for my teenager. Not too strong or obnoxious.  Packaging is interesting, too. This is his second bottle, so I guess he likes it. Mother approved.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for Christmas for my husband and omg it was soo much cheaper then in the store. It came on time, perfect condition. I love the smell. Its not over powering at all. I cant stand those kinds. It has a clean type of smell. Its hard&lt;br /&gt;To describe. Its just sooo yummy. And he&#x27;s actually gotten compliments from other men he works with.</li>
    <li> Wow!! Ordered on a Monday, got here by Friday noon! On standard shipping!! In top of that, the packaging was great, never been sprayed before. Orignal box Package.Love the scent.. And like some others have stated that it fades away.. I like that it sort of does.. Leaving a less strong but sweet clean scent. Love this cologne and waiting for the original Ed hardy to come in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-saving this seller as a favorite and def will be purchasing from them. Still amazed and in awe at how fast it came in!! :))))))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked all the Ed Hardy fragrances I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> I truly love this stuff. But you can find it at your local TJ Maxx or marshalls for $19.99, same 3.4 ounce bottle... Just saying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son for the holidays. He loved it and i got a great deal on the size of the bottle for the price i paid.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. I bought it because my friend was wearing it one day and it smelled so good that I had to get it!</li>
    <li> This is about the only thing I would buy from Ed Hardy, I love this smell though. First time I bought it at the Galleria, this one smells exactly the same to me. One thing to note is that the smell seems to go away after 2-3 hours.</li>
    <li> I like this smell,  it&#x27;s not to strong or over powering at all. An most people find it pleasant.</li>
    <li> My son broke a bottle of this, and I replaced it with this one.  It smells similar, but not exactly the same.  It also doesn&#x27;t last at all.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed, and for the price, probably should have known better.</li>
    <li> Great stuff use it just about every day, smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Honestly i just now looked at the date purchased of this product and found that it was purchased last year december 27th of 2013 it has lasted me up until this very moment and even still i have about a quarter inch left ! Purchase THIS SHIT PLAYAS</li>
    <li> This is the best everyday cologne I have ever had!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s favorite!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before (which i didnt purhcase from Amazon) and that was the reason i order this Item again. But this cologne fades away pretty quickly. Even i myself don&#x27;t feel if I have put the cologne or not after couple of hours. Not sure if what I have received is original product. My earlier cologne used to last for long time and i got good review from people. But i am disappointed. Wont buy cologne ever from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for years and was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I smelled this product for the first time. It smell like someone used strawberry vodka instead of the actual cologne. Smells nothing like the actual product and the smell lasts for about 5 seconds. DO NOT BUY! People who are giving this product good reviews must have never used the actual product. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> It smells so good. I love it, and, so those who are close to me. I am always asked what cologne I am wearing..when someone is close enough to notice.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this to Men who enjoy clognes that are sophisticated without being too overbearing.</li>
