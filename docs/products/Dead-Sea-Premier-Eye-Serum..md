<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product...great delivery time</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the bottle I bought at the mall. Rip off</li>
    <li> This makes your skin soo soft.  I did notice my skin getting smoother over time.  Just be careful not to put it too close to your eyes, it will irritate them.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It does not firm its very oily so if you have dry skin its great.  Bio oil would work just as well as is a whole lot cheaper.  Boy I&#x27;am glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this item.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth. No noticeable difference in appearance of my skin</li>
    <li> Use this everyday.  Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> My lady tried this in a mall and saw instant results. She now uses it regularly. It is amazing how the wrinkles near her eyes just went away.[[ASIN:B00115TXRE premier dead sea age defying anti wrinkle eye serum]]</li>
    <li> Absorb fast and leave nonsticky touch. Like it.</li>
    <li> I love the texture, though it is probably more appropriate for night time use.  It is the only eye product that does not irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> This product is equally as wonderful as the facial serum by the same maker Dead Sea.  It has improved the lines around my eyes and soaks into my skin .  I would recommed this product to anyone looking for a great eye serum..</li>
    <li> Generally speaking, I am the last person on earth to think about beauty products, make up and face creams. But about two years ago, while traversing a New England mall with a loving family member, I was unwillingly lassoed into stopping at a Premier luxury cosmetics kiosk to play guinea pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You won&#x27;t believe it,\\&quot; I was told. Okay, so the sales woman flashes before me a royal blue glass jar of whipped face cream, dabs some over and under my eyes and asks me to rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila, a genuine difference appeared in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, she issued a dab of this under-eye anti-aging serum, and asked me to rub it in lightly, under each eye. Voila, again, an amazing decline, instantly, in wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confess that I am still in shell shock over the amount I spent on Premier cosmetics that day. But I still have all the items, and the jars are still more than half full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the kiosks are gone from the malls, and Premier&#x27;s prices have tumbled by more than half, thanks to online selling from many internet stores, these products are a genuine value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look expensive. But this little jar that will now run you maybe $30 formerly cost $99. And it will still last you years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value comes when you look in the mirror and see that your skin really is more supple, less wrinkled and younger than it was before you indulged yourself a little.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but the sellers have pretty bad customer service. The didn&#x27;t reply to my email until they saw a bad review. Then they tried to blackmail me. Their prices are not the best, you can find better deals at Amazon.com even if you have to pay for the shipping.  I still have a snapshot in my Amazon account of the set for $51.99 of eye cream and eye serum.</li>
    <li> i saw immediate results and they are not temporary fixes. the more use on regular basis the better it works i now have my sister and my sister-in-law in the process of ordering these products without question whether they work or dont.  THEY DO!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product,.....saw results within a week. Ready to reorder 6 mos later and the price went up dramatically. Was $16 now $82. Worth it not sure yet . Disappointed? Yes!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product in a mall and was delighted with the result. When I ran out, I did some searching for a cheaper price.  Luckily, it is more reasonable on Amazon.  Unfortunately, I received a bottle with a defective pump.  It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, because I was able to use the pump from my old bottle.  I am hoping that this was a rare occurrence, because I love the serum and will most likely buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> On the one hand I am sort of glad because they must not have used any type of testing - animal or otherwise - because should you get even the tiniest amount in your eyes, it will burn your eyeballs out of their sockets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same goes for their eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a snake-oil selling company that needs to be avoided at all costs!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and prefer not to be without it.  In my search for the perfectly hydrating eye cream, this serum provides the perfect cushion for the expensive eye creams that still irritate the under eye area.  I use it at least twice a day.  It always feels good.  This is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon and the pricing was the best.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but the manufacturer should do something about the pump.  The quantity that comes out with each pump can be used at least 4 x for a normal product.  Hence, I finish a bottle too fast.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I purchased this product on his Amazon account recently for his mom who swears by this line of products.  We typically buy this product from a mall where they have the stands that sell it for nearly 5x the price so we were a little skeptical when we saw it on Amazon for so much less.  We were thrilled when it arrived (along with other Premier products) and was identical to the ones we had purchased before. His mom loves it claiming it to be the reason she looks so young (she looks great!) and needless to say, Amazon will be where we shop for it from now on.</li>
    <li> I feel I got totally ripped off and was a big sucker.  I got approached at an outdoor mall and the product seemed totally different.  I agree about the bait and switch.  I paid $220 for the eye serum and eye cream and was sick when I saw how cheap it was on amazon. I got the Viva Facial Peeling \\&quot;free\\&quot; with purchase.  It peeled away dead skin during the demo but nothing sense.  I can&#x27;t say it does anything special at this point.  But I sure learned my lesson and an expensive one at that!</li>
    <li> It is a moisturizer, which makes you skin smooth and enjoyable. It softens the lines of the eye area, neck and elbows as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Used this product along with the matching eye cream as indicated by the directions no major improvements or changes to my eye area and left a slight greasy feeling around my eyes making it hard to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> this is very good.  i used to have lumps around my eyes from just using eye cream not anymore now that i am using this serum first before applying eye cream.  This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> OK. Very fast delivery</li>
    <li> contains vitamin c that really dries your skin out. My dermatologist recommends using vaseline around the eyes. So so much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Absorbs well, hydrates really well, very happy with this product. I have seen tightening of the skin around my eye.</li>
    <li> premier is the best!  shipping was quick and orderly as well.</li>
    <li> Like many of you, I was approached by one of Premier&#x27;s represenatives at my local mall.  She put the eye serum,eye cream and the firming serum on my skin and I instantly saw an improvement.  However, after purchasing the products and using them at home, I found that they are useless.  So expensive for no results.  I am curious how people use the products and do get the same results as at the kiosk; maybe I am doing something wrong.  I am not easily fooled but this was an aggressive sale.  I did take some of the products back but not all so that I could get some refund without all the hassle.  In fact, after my first purchase of almost $500 I cancelled my check.  If you do buy these products, Amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> Tried it at the mall on  one eye.  Went to see my friends having lunch and they were so amazed that we all bought it.  Packaging from the company is weak and names rub off as do directions. That is the biggest downfall</li>
    <li> Can not begin to find enough great words to discripe this fantastic product.  First of all, I have the most sensitive skin, especially the eye are, no irration what so ever.  Your eye area loooks amazing immediately. I purchased the eye cream at the same time, so pleased with both products. Seldom ever review a product, but I would like everyone not to hesitate for a moment to purchase, know you will not regret doing so.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and would highly recommend to anyone who is starting to age.  It has worked wonders for my eyes.  Crows feet are gone and they look more bright.</li>
    <li> Excellent produce. So much better than the price tag that goes with it at the mall.  Leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> i like the serum, i think it actually works.  but the bottle does not pack well for flights.  i&#x27;ve had it both in my check-in and carry-on luggage, and both times the product leaked out.  very disappointing considering the price.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Serum is only an average serum. I did not see significant changes in my after 6-7 months of use. It was a little pricey and I was disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> I used this and it seemed fine....but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of difference from any other product, I am very particular and will spend what I need to for my face. I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed..</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny. It takes the puffy eyes away within seconds. I recommend everyone trys it. Im in my fiftys and this is a wonderful product for undereyes.</li>
    <li> I DISCOVERING DEAD SEA EYE SERUM&lt; I but since discovering Dead Sea Eye Serum, I will never use anything else. It is recommended to use every night for a week or so till you see the results you want and then two to three times a week at night to keep it there.  My eyes love it and I can see and feel the lines have improved and the skin around my eyes is more resilient.</li>
    <li> I have been using this, the Premier anti wrinkle and the Premier Face creme and I have been getting all kinds of compliments. I have tried to get rid of my wrinkle and sun spots/age spots for years and I guess this is working. I have used Olay, Porcelain beauty cream, All kinds of expensive creams and exfoliates. I figured this was anther money grabbing product I was tossing my money away to. The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give it a \\&quot;5 STAR\\&quot; is because the  pump on every single one of these (so far) dispenses way too much product. It is very difficult to use. It seems you waste more than you use every-time you use it. But, I just put the extra on my face.</li>
    <li> Premier is a welcome change from other eye serums...it&#x27;s not oily and absorbs very well. My fine lines around my eyes have diminished. I would recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so upset I ordered these because just like the other reviews, it does not work, in fact, it made it worst!</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on skin. this is excellent for young adults. Protects and nourishes. Investment for beautiful skin now and in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Makes me look younger than my younger sister. What more could you want! My eyes look brighter and minimizes the lovely \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping it would work as well for my skin as it has for others who have written reviews.  I used it everyday for two weeks, and finally had to give up.  The oil does not absorb into my skin, but simply coats it.  It did nothing to improve the appearance of the skin around my eyes, and in fact, it worked quite the opposite.  Within several days of using it, I noticed dry patches around my eyes, and the lines were more pronounced.  A co-worker even asked if I was getting enough sleep.  I quit using the serum on my eyes, and decided to test it on hidden areas on my arms and legs.  By the fourth day, dry patches of skin were already forming in these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I believe the culprit is the high amount of Dimethicone in the ingredients.  This drying agent is added to most hair and skin products to make them feel less greasy, and to give them a smoother application.  My skin is very sensitive to this (and similar) ingredients.  With repeated use, it can dry and crack my skin.  I only know this because a friend makes her own lotions, and I cannot use anything she makes with this additive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know your skin is sensitive to these additives, I do not recommend this product at all.  I&#x27;m happy that it works for some people, but I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> feels great on the skin,  moisturizes the eye area , reduces lines. does not leave oily residue. i will recommend it for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I see no results yet.</li>
    <li> This supplemental eye serum has softened the small lines around my eyes to the point I barely see them! I use it whenever I feel my under eyes feel dry! In conjunction with an eye cream, it&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> The first time I got this was in paying a &#x27;discount&#x27; price at a kiosk in Beverly Hills - NOT! However gullible that makes me, I love the product and actually use it on other sensitive areas on my face. It produces instantaneous and visible effects. It speeds healing on sores and blemishes where applied, and it enhances exfoliation. This product is more natural and helps with removing toxins via the Dead Sea salts, although there are some solvents in it that I am not sure about.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes smart.  They feel good and refreshed after applying to my eyes.</li>
    <li> total waste of money, does not work at all</li>
    <li> Works on fine lines around my eyes. retains moisture. recommend it for ladies over fifty. A great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff.  First thing to know.  The merchant does not take returns.  They may SAY that, but they do not.  They are a skanky operation.  The stuff has zero effect on your skin and it is absolutely worthless.  You would be doing better to go to Walgreens and picking up the first thing off the shelf.  Including shoe shine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible.  I used it for a while, and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  It cost a lot too.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Eye Serum is silky smooth and instantly absorbed into the eye area.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting or feel greasy.  It is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> The product is far superior to other serums.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my wrinkles but I like how it goes on.  The bottle arrived with a lot of it spilled out but since the price was so good, I didn&#x27;t bother returning it.</li>
    <li> [...]  The finest Dead Sea cosmetics and beauty products based on natural ingredients found only in the Dead Sea.  The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my face and neck. I have sensitive combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any sensitivity problems  I&#x27;m 59 and my neck Is getting wrinkled and loose. This makes my neck look better!!! For that alone it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this serum because it is not greasy and my skin just soaks it up.  You can visibly see the difference in your skin after applying.  I live by this serum and use it daily.  No other cream or product can compare.</li>
    <li> I have used several oils for face over the years and this is by far the best.  A little on the expensive side but a little goes a long way.  I am very happy with all the Premier products.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that it pumps out too much at once. A little goes a VERY long way. Super for the dark circles and bags under my eyes!</li>
    <li> just wonderful. I am so glad I tried this. Not only did it help with my eyes, but it was perfect for a scar on my neck, from an operation. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been uaing this product for four  year and I love it.you will see results within 2 weeks of using this product</li>
    <li> I have found this eye serum to reduce the puffiness around my eyes and recommend others with the same problem to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 4 months and have noticed a decrease in lines and wrinkles. Several scares have begun to fade. Very happy. I was more excited when I found it on Amazon for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is the best product by miles as anything you see on the shelves of the stores. And it is so inexpensive. It is light. Absorbs completely. Makes my skin look younger and firmer. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was also sampled in Hawaii. I received some samples  and it seemed to work on my puffy eyes, so I decided to purchase some when we got back home</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if I look any younger, because I&#x27;m not that old,(only 50 hee hee) but I use this twice a day, and it really seems to be diminishing fine lines, and also hydrating the crepe like skin under my eyes, I&#x27;m going to go the distance and continue to keep it as part of my nightly regiment, I also use it on my upper lip, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but I&#x27;m super paranoid about getting those old lady lines above my lips</li>
    <li> Just as good as stuff in mall but 90 percent cheaper.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye serum. This is not miracle worker but it does a good job of softening up the lines.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with Premier Dead Sea eye serum, it make my eye area feel very smooth and hopefully fewer wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This serum does not work. It sucks the moisture out of the skin.  It made my dark circles baggier. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Nothing blew me away about this eye cream, It has a nice consistency, but too much comes out every time you use the pump, so it is not economic.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product but the shipping has something to be desired.  One of the two bottles arrived leaking.  Fortunately, the shipper made it easy to return but I&#x27;d have to go through the whole ordering process to get it replaced...and that would have resulted in higher shipping costs so I just didn&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> You shouldn&#x27;t use anything else on your skin but Dead Sea Premiere products.  There is nothing else like them on the market and I will not use anything else!</li>
    <li> I was pounced on by an Israeli woman at a mall kiosk selling Premier products. She spoke broken English, and I saw she was trying hard to sell her products. I felt sorry for her and let her talk me into a purchase 400 dollars. I have never used skin creams of any kind, but thought I would give them a try. After all, I got  4 free gifts worth hundreds of dollars! At least that&#x27;s what I was told. Adding up what I paid, I could have paid 150 dollars less online. The receipt says no refunds, just exchanges, so I was suckered out of 400 dollars. I&#x27;m putting it all in the trash without trying any of it. I don&#x27;t trust the products. If the company can use such sleazy sales tactics, I&#x27;m sure the ingredients are not what&#x27;s on the label. I&#x27;m not damaging my skin. Buyer beware: I didn&#x27;t want to be impolite and just walk away, and my good nature was treated as a weakness to be exploited by the Jewish sales woman. If you are ever approached, just walk away. The women selling the products are ruthless thieves and liars.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product while in Las Vegas and have used it for years.  It was great to find the exact same product on amazon at a reduced price without any change in quality. Highly recommend the product--takes away the fine lines and reduces age appearance by ten years--well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use the product morning and night. I love the feel and texture and how it helps with my eye area without greasiness. I have very oily skin and oily products irritate my eye area but this is perfect. The dispenser does pump out a lot more than I would normally use so I just open it and get the amount I need without wasting product.</li>
    <li> I like all of the premeier Dead Sea products and was not disappointed by the eye serum.  It feels good under the eyes and makes the area look better.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I can not live with out it. If your looking for an alternative to the really expensive stuff this is it.</li>
    <li> excellent product at a low price. Great value</li>
    <li> If you want this product don&#x27;t buy in the mall as you can see cheap here,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how good the product is, it does a little, but your not paying that much as you can see,, what do you expect,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum and the eye cream,, roughly a total of $30 bucks which doesn&#x27;t cost much more than cream at walgreen&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;so my expectations are lowered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean this isn&#x27;t Dr Perricone stuff or Eye Serum from Erno Lazo or any of the other expensive creams. But what do you know what really is in the bottles and how much it really cost for them to manufacture? You don&#x27;t, I say you try a few different ones and find the one that works for you and your skin type. I mean $30 bucks total to try this isn&#x27;t much considering how much I pay for my Lazo Eye serum and cream and they raised the bar of sea mud soap from $20 to $40 now, which is lame, the soap has doubled in 10 years. Still I like the Erno Lazo for men best.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It feels silky smooth.it does help minimize wrinkles around your eyes, I will be buyong more of this product. The should make this in larger bottles.  I recommend buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I find this product great for my eyes. It is refreshing and it sooths and reduces my wrinkles. Great trade</li>
    <li> I was in a Chicago Mall with my husband when we were approached by a salesperson from Premier.  I would never stop but she targeted my niave husband and I thought I would give her a chance.  To cut a long story short she persuaded my husband to part with $100+for Eye Cream.  I tried it once and my eyes were like two red puffballs for the rest of my trip from UK.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a reaction to any face/eye creams in the past so will be avoiding this one and advising my friends to sample for a few days first. Shudder when I hear the name Premier, so does my husband!!</li>
    <li> Great product and great seller!!!</li>
    <li> My regular skin care line is not available in the USA and I&#x27;ve purchased this online.  It works quite well for eye flaws.  It helps with everything but while it doesn&#x27;t take it all away it sure does have dramatic effects.  I use it day and night.  It works almost as well as the oober expensive skin care line I use out of Switzerland.  It&#x27;s a bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and have dry skin. People tell me my eyes look softer now.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and find that it is the best eye serum I&#x27;ve used. My skin feels very supple afterward.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - do I look 20 years younger?  probably not but it does keep those lines to a minimum.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I add just a small amount around my eyes and mouth, love the way it makes the wrinkles disappear, it really works.  The pump is hard and you have to push it down easy so as not to get to much.  Much cheaper on Amazon than the Kiosk where I was introduced, the extravagant price scared me right to the computer, glad I followed through.</li>
    <li> I needed to express how much I love this product, but..... a big but........ 1) the lid pump on two bottles thus far quit working, one as trying to pump it , I dropped it to the floor and it broke, being a glass bottle.....I wish I could buy a good pump as this stuff is not cheap to fiddle with.......annoying as I leave this bottle in my drawer been useless as cannot get the cream out unless i unscrew and get some from the ]tube inside the bottle and I get too much.....</li>
    <li> This eye serum is thick and rich - a wonderful combination for this cold, dry winter.  Great product.  The pump dispenses more than needed, but I work around it.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And great delivery with &#x27;quick click&#x27;.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be terrific according the price its suppose to be.  Used it until it was gone and saw no improvement.  I have some lines under the eyes and it did nothing.  Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.  I will not be purchasing anymore.</li>
    <li> My order arrived exactly as ordered.  This is an excellent product.  My only complaint is the time it takes to get here.</li>
    <li> very soothing and did help to brighten my eyes</li>
    <li> I have purchased my item last month and still havent received my product nor heared from them.   I tried to call customer service, but there is no phone number offered for that.I dont know if I will ever receive the product... It is a lesson to learn when we get cheap and dont purchase from official website.</li>
    <li> As a canned response to a requested review, I state this:&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the items that a review is silly to do as I am happy with this product and would have no reason to not reorder in the same manner&lt;br /&gt;It is a sundry or something I use in everyday life like light bulbs, toilet paper, cereal etc&lt;br /&gt;the only way I would give a bad review is if it arrived busted and if it did that, as a Prime member I get mainly from Amazon and they take care of all issues like that so I&#x27;m sure it does not fit this case&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product it works very good</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Great for night time use.</li>
    <li> I love this eye serum. I broke the 1st bottle because it dropeed on the cement floor. :( Very Nice&amp;makes your eye are look great! Reduces puffiness&amp;so silky smooth. I am almost 34. I will contiue to buy this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent face serum.</li>
    <li> I have used this one for quite some time and it is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this.  Wrinkles just disappear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have used better.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t help at all...wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Costly and quite the farce NOT as good as Sea Flora from Vancouver! No results, spent to much money and their store at the malls are AlWAYS pushing procuducts on you, obvious reasons!</li>
    <li> This eye product has caused a problem under the eye area..  It must be so strong that it has caused an irritation.  I would stop using it for awhile and hope it was something else causing the problem but everytime I started using it again it would cause that irritation again and now it is too late to return it as return time has expired.  So I am not very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve used it many, many times and would use it again. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. I&#x27;m so blessed to have found it for the price I got it for! Wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> Another awesome product by \\&quot;PDS\\&quot;. Serum helps reduce the appereance of fine lines, and that overall aged look around the eyes. It&#x27;s not an overall end all to ageing,nor a time machine in a,bottle. Though with continued use you will find a much smoother apperance to that troublesome area.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd bottle of the eye serum that I have purchased -- it really is a good eye serum, and considering I bought it on Amazon.com -- the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> use it under premier eye cream. great texture.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and was very happy to be able to purchase it because I paid much more for it in my country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> the bottle was not sealed, the product is transparent, and it is supposed to be yellow&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a fake , oily product , good to trash</li>
    <li> Been using for years.</li>
    <li> I have this eye serum for some time and I love it. I will buy again. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Does this make every wrinkle and puffy eye disappear?... No - but it helps and it HELPS ALOT. I was gifted with it first and fell in love - it&#x27;s going rate then was $145 a bottle and I was so disappointed that I could not afford it... but now it is affordable and so worth its cost.  As I get older every little bit helps and this eye serum is golden.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this serum!</li>
    <li> Une texture unique et confortable qui agit vraiment sur les ridules.&lt;br /&gt;A utiliser matin et soir. Une goutte suffit; la pompe a tendance à être un peu trop généreuse&lt;br /&gt;Une utilisation bi quotidienne depuis 4 ans fait des miracles pour moi</li>
    <li> I am literally shocked by the high reviews on this product! I think many women suffer from the &amp;#34;placebo effect&amp;#34; with wrinkle creams. They want them to work so badly they believe the product helps even when there are no results. This stuff is an overpriced joke. I thought it would help with the slight crows feet I have started getting this past year. Nope! Saw no difference at all. It is a silicone based eye serum so it is very greasy and it takes forever to soak in. There are several other eye creams that work far better than this one does. Please keep looking!</li>
    <li> Texture of product is very smooth and non oily, I use mine at night and there is no adverse reaction with my skin which I have to be careful about. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tried the product on my face wrinkles to the best of my knowledge because it did not come with clear instructions. I saw no difference. This was a huge waste of money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months and the other Dead Sea Bioxx products. I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my skin. I even postponed Botox for my 40th class reunion because the mask and the serums worked so well.</li>
    <li> Really like this product but when it arrived it was not sealed in a package.  Product seems fine though</li>
    <li> Very good eye serum! I love it. Really makes my skin look better, I even use it around my mouth and on my chest!</li>
    <li> It is like life massaged around your eyes.  The skin absorbed the serum quickly and feels soft and suple.  I used it at bedtime and in the morning the kin around my eyes looks amazing, zero puffiness.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  It made the lines under my eyes worse.  I thought it was my imagination when I noticed the skin under my eyes seemed worse in the morning after using this serum. It goes on smooth, but that&#x27;s about as good as it get. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> 4star as an excellent product .&lt;br /&gt;Feels soft on the eye area and goes well under any product eye cream. Make up stays on well too.</li>
    <li> ordered it here, same stuff as mall, didnt hydrate at all seen no affects had instant affects at mall, so wonder if theres a shelf life.</li>
    <li> Now THIS, I like a lot!  This is one Premier Dead Sea product that I actually believe works.  I usually have puffy eyes when I first awake in the morning and I struggle finding a product that actually reduces eye puffiness.  This one actually seems to work.  I apply it after my shower and within short order, the puffiness is gone when I walk out the door. If I put it on again at night before bed I awaken to very little puffiness at all.  It goes on smooth (tiny amount) and does not encourage crepey eyelid skin during the day.  I may very well buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is o.k. but since I am using the Premier Facial Serum I don&#x27;t feel it necessary to use the under-eye serum also.  When using them, they kinda run together anyway.</li>
    <li> This is exactly same high quality product I used to pay big money for. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy cause it it worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The eye serum was easy to use and apply, made my skin feel  very moisturized.  Was a great deal for the price</li>
    <li> Not sure if these are counterfeit but they felt different and pump is different to use so I end up with a big big squirt each time.</li>
    <li> A little fragranced, but manageable.  It feels good putting it on, and my eyes look younger; fewer wrinkles; less sag.</li>
    <li> I actually use this product all over my face and while I generally look much younger than I am people noticed an improvement.</li>
    <li> Sample I received was great and tightened skin under my eyes. When I received this product, it Did not do anything for saggy skin under my eyes. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle of this serum - it works.  I&#x27;ve tried many eye serums, creams, including Strivection, Prevage, and this one really works.  Don&#x27;t get sucked in by the mall hawkers, just buy it online for a fraction of the price.  I agree with previous posters that you really have to finesse the dispensing, otherwise you can end up with a week&#x27;s worth of product being wasted (in which case I just put it on my neck!)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for close to 2 weeks now and see no difference whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have a minimal degree of signs of ageing and fine lines under my eyes so with all of the glowing reviews I assumed I would see SOME sort of good results but so far absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty this product just feels (and looks) like a thickish mineral oil and nothing more.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel like satin. Really great serum and last a long time. I have used it almost daily and sometimes twice a day as I live in the desert. And the bottle has lasted over 6 months. Great product and very pricey in mall.</li>
    <li> I wish &amp;#34;PREMIER&amp;#34; would Change the pump on the bottle Because it pumps Way Too Much when pressed. Only One Small drop is needed to apply for both eyes. It&#x27;s difficult to put it back in the bottle and is therefore wasteful being forced to spread on areas not recommended for its use.&lt;br /&gt;I have not received the item yet; however, I know that I will love it because all the Premier Products that I use are wonderful. I use many different Premier Products and that line is my very favorite. I am 68 yrs. old and have been using Premier Eye Serum for many years and my dermotoligest said my eyes were amazing. So, I purchased the Eye SeruAVEm as an introductory gift and informed that only 1 drop is needed for both eyes. I only have a couple faint wrinkles from using the product.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU  &#x27;PREMIER&#x27; !</li>
    <li> The way it is packaged makes me reconsider whether to use it or not. Completely no seal from the box to the bottle. And the whole packaging was sitting in the mail box for hours under the sun before I took it inside. The whole bottle was really hot to the touch. I wonder if it is going to affect the quality of the serum. I have been using it for 1 week. No noticeable result so far.</li>
    <li> Less wrinkles, brighter.less puffy...people have been asking what I did.  Will be buying more.  Will make it a basic in my skin care.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It was recommended to me by my daughter.  It works as advertised.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Started using on eye area.  Got a little too much on finger so spread to rest of face.  Surprised to find a new fresher glow from skin.</li>
    <li> like this, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes and cause problems with my contact&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a while and no issues</li>
    <li> This is the best Eye Serum that I have found for wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet.  I use this in the morning before make-up and at night before bed.  A little goes a long way.  But it does not help puffiness or dark circles - surgery is the only cure for that!!!  But I have seen a definite difference in my wrinkles and crows feet they smooth right out.  Amazon offers all Premier Products at super prices and great delivery times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my Oz Naturals eye serum</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it but I do see a difference in LESS than one week. My skin needed to be hydrated, I guess. Worth the AMAZON price FOR SURE!</li>
    <li> Seems to be full of silicon.  Yuk.  Sold my bottle on Ebay.  Whatever you do , do NOT buy this product from mall vendors...they will rip you off!  Amazon has the best price if you have to have it...if I could I would give it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> I am always very skeptical when trying new products, but I have to say I loved this product.  Goes on nice and smooth and feels great.  Try it you won&#x27;t be dissapointed :)</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims and absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;I feel it is a product that does what it says it will and the price is right</li>
    <li> this is the first time i use it, it is perfect, smoothly. and good price from Amazon, i will return again once it run out.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle.  The lines around my eyes are barely noticeable now (I&#x27;m 59 and a sun person).  It is awesome.  The bottle it comes in dispenses too much with even a small pump.  I transferred to a smaller bottle with a little pump dispenser.  Works just great.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really helps hydrate my whole face I use 1 drop and then a moisturizer. It lets the moisturizer penetrate deeper and my sun damage wrinkles don&#x27;t show nearly as much. To take out just one drop I unscrew the top and use the pump tube to get one drop. The pump other wise delivers too much. It goes much farther my way</li>
    <li> Using about 1/3 of a pump provides me ample product for both eyes. Follow with the eye cream in 15 minutes. No wrinkles around these 58 yo eyes.</li>
    <li> Memo&lt;br /&gt;To: \\&quot;Premier Cosmetics\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;From: Roy Hayward&lt;br /&gt;CC: Intentionally left blank - at this time&lt;br /&gt;Date: 2/22/2013&lt;br /&gt;Re: Return of purchases&lt;br /&gt;As you will see from the attached prior emails I am returning all charged products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The principle reasons are:&lt;br /&gt;1. Totally dissatisfied with the &#x60;free samples&#x27; given to me at point of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;2. Your claim of &#x60;best pricing&#x27; was inaccurate - by huge amounts.&lt;br /&gt;3. Products promised, were not what was delivered. (Yes, I signed the receipt, but did not look at the itemization.)&lt;br /&gt;4. I was assured that since it was shipped to MA, where you have no &#x60;store&#x27; there would not be a Sales Tax Charge. (Yes, I signed the receipt, but did not look at the itemization.)&lt;br /&gt;5. The &#x60;slight-of-hand&#x27; tactics between your group and the on-line group are not what was claimed.&lt;br /&gt;6. Most important - Your unconditional 100% Money back commitment if dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have called the phone number provided on the receipt (copy attached) and requested a RA number. I have not received a call-back, but will try once again this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the relationship is between Premier Cosmetics located at the Chicago Mall on Michigan Ave. and Premier Cosmetics on line, but to claim there is NO RELATIONSHIP is beyond my understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as I trust you are aware of by now, I&#x27;ve asked my credit card company to disallow this charge. I assume they will be in contact with you and will properly defend my position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tactics used at the mall are from a sales perspective interesting to say the least. I have less of a problem with the sales approach than I do with the fact that the product simply does not live up to the sales promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy J. Hayward</li>
    <li> it not working like it is advertise. I will try to use for a longer period of time maybe I will see a difference if not I will try something else</li>
    <li> Product is actually quite good. I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend&#x27;s birthday. She has a skin problem that only the Premier Dead Sea products will help. I am giving her the website for her to buy more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Absorbs immediately.  Noticed a difference in a very short time.  Press pump carefully or too much dispenses.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> this item came with poor package with scratches and wrinkles. even worse situation is, unfortunately, it leaked inside and contaminated the box all the place. never buy it again for present to relatives and friends any more!!</li>
    <li> Great product. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s light. It really helps me when I have puffy eyes or dark circles. You can see the difference quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and will continue to use it the rest of my life. It is a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;Nathanne</li>
    <li> Only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or contacts and makes a real difference that can be seen.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I keep buying this because it makes the skin under my eyes look and feel better and it&#x27;s easy on my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three years.  The bottle lasts a long, long time as well and the price is good.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it twice a day.  Have seen great results.</li>
    <li> I bought my second bottle but after my first my wrinkles around my eyes were gone 90 % and did not come back even I did not use the product for 3 months, now I got my bottle just to be sure to keep my results. I recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I was approached at a Mall by people selling this product. The price was $200 the first time around and when I said too expensive they brought the price down to $175 then down to $125. Of course it was obvious by then that this was a scam. I came home and went on line and I think I paid under $25. Also, the product pumps out way too much &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34;, seems like another scam, use more ~ buy more. Also it just does not work, I saw absolutely no benefit from using it.</li>
    <li> Like some of the others the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the pump dispenses too much at a time.  I too was introduced at a kiosk that was a killer ripoff.  I&#x27;ve been ordering from Amazon with no problems and feel it is the same product but of couse the stores tell you that you are getting something else.  I use the eye serum and the eye cream and these are the only 2 products I&#x27;ve been able to use around my eyes without any irritation and I&#x27;ve tried all of the major department store brands.  In my opinion Premier does put out some great products, the eye serum is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love the silky feel of this product. It absorbs into my skin and feels great. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I love the Premier Dead Sea products.  I purchased the eye serum because it helps diminish wrinkles and puffiness.  It arrived on time and in good condition.  I will purchase this again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Premier eye serum for over 5 years. I&#x27;ve used other brands, but always return to Premier&#x27;s eye serum.  Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Triple Firming Eye Serum,  I apply around my eyes morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some grand changes in my wrinckles and the firmness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;A small amount goes along way.</li>
    <li> This is very soothing and seems to make a difference.</li>
    <li> item arrived on time and works fine;exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I know it&#x27;s supposed to be for the eye area, but I put it all over my face.  It seems to have helped minimize the appearance of the pores on my face.  Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to work that way, but I love this stuff, and won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> pretty good product!but you should wait at least 10 minetes,and then  you can  make your next step of face care</li>
    <li> I use this product daily. In the winter months before bed I will apply all over face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so nice in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon makes fast delivery of this product.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Triple Firming Eye Serum I use especially at night. Apply under eyes and use under towards face. It&#x27;s smooth lovely and just loves your skin.  Three words....I LOVE IT..♥</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has such a silky feeling under your eyes., not greasy.  I have used for a couple of years now.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This serum  helps soften wrinkles around the eye area.Beautifully soft and easily applied I would highly recommend this product and more than half the price against pop up retailers in shopping malls.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the BEST serum I have found to date for my eyes!  It seems I can pair it with almost any eye cream, but I have never found a better serum and I feel like I have tried them all.  I cannot ever run out of this serum!</li>
    <li> This serum is absolutely amazing. I feel that the word \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; is used a bit too loosely in reviews such as this one, but let me tell you, I mean it. My mother and I spent an hour at a mall kiosk trying out all sorts of products that are worthy of the word amazing, and then spent way too much money(happy to find it on Amazon for a drastically better price)...but it was well worth it. I recommend all Premier products, especially this magic eye serum. My mom has an under-eye area that is severely dark, puffy and wrinkled(it has been this way her whole life) and we watched the wrinkles and puffiness decrease right before our eyes after the 1st use at the kiosk. I was very surprised and had to try it out for myself! Though I am not remotely in need of anti-aging or wrinkle fighting products, I have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes, a gene passed down from my mother. I put this serum on...and they disappeared like magic. I figured I could stop the progression of wrinkles by using this, even if I only need it a couple times a week on my young skin. I used to see dark circles before i even noticed my eyes...now I love my eyes again. Thank you Premier!</li>
    <li> Feels nice when you put it on, doesn&#x27;t smell bad but also didn&#x27;t see any improvement in 8 weeks of use</li>
    <li> this product came in a broken box with no warranty seal, there is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product at a mall kiosk.  it does remove the puffiness around the eyes as stated in conjunction with the eye cream that goes with this product.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product would not take care of bags under my eyes (not too large but noticeable)&amp;#62;  However, I am impressed with the job this product does.  After only a few uses, I have noticed a big difference.</li>
    <li> If you want your around your eyes to feel great and be wrinkle free, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Smoothes out some of my fine lines before I apply my eye cream. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the price at the mall kiosk and researched to buy online first. I may or may not re-buy depending on how I feel when I deplete the supply.</li>
    <li> I paid (gulp) well over $100 for this at the mall three months ago, and I was happy ... then I started looking for a way to replenish my stock and found how much cheaper it is here. Now I&#x27;m ECSTATIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and works for hours. I can detect no fragrance and it&#x27;s not at all greasy. And really, it truly does diminish the lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m subtracting a star for the bottle. The \\&quot;top heavy\\&quot; shape is misleading. I thought the bottle I bought in March was going to last forever and then, once I used it past the round portion at the top, it started running low at a fast rate. Also, the pump is a little unreliable. Sometimes I get more than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works. It really works. And I&#x27;m going to keep using it as long as I can find it at these less-than-mall-kiosk prices.</li>
    <li> The Premier Dead Sea Triple Firming Eye Serum, immediately travels while it  penetrates into my eye area. I am very pleased in the product&#x27;s performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you</li>
    <li> Great product and worth the price.  All Dead Sea products are superior.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s very good. I am very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Tis serum is the best ever!  It soaks into my skin very quickly and helps smooth the wrinkles and crows feet around my very sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Use it every morning...I am 44 years old, and am eye wrinkle free!!!</li>
    <li> Very timely, product was exactly as described.  Works fine, feels silky once on.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for entire face and neck. My mother in law @82, daughter in law @33, and myself @64 use this oil and all love how light it is and love how fast it hydrates.  Makes us feel younger and radiant😊</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for quite a while now and i have seen it definitely works! This serum is one of my favorites. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this very nice and effective serum.  I would not be halfway through the first bottle, except thatbit dispenses far more than you need--you only need a drop to cover both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using it, I have notices the crepiness on my eyelids has diminished, and the wrinkles at the corners of my eyes are less noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the excess on my hands, and they have also become much softer and smoother, so even the problem has become a benefit :)</li>
    <li> Great absorption and visible results.  I can see a marked improvement and will continue to use this product.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3 years and have fewer visible fine lines around my eyes and less puffiness. (I do not get paid to endorse this product or company, by the way.)  It is one of the few I have found that really works! Thank you, Amazon for carrying this product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Not only this serum does not penetrate the skin even using a very small amount but it also doesn&#x27;t work, my eye area did not improve a bit. After using it for 5 weeks there was no difference except that the skin was and looked dry and dehydrated.</li>
    <li> Love all of premier Dead sea products</li>
    <li> This product is my magic wand...poof and the results are fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I will not leave home without it,  great for touching up later in the day also.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have been use it for years . Amazon deliver is excellent , but the bottle each time comes less full .</li>
