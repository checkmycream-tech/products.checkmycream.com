      <li>I was so happy when this product took out the brassy gold color!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle maker, just a very good vegan dye.</li>
      <li>The dye might be good thou!</li>
      <li>Very good product, took out my brassy colors from bleaching, did a great job.</li>
      <li>After a 30 minute use my hair is a beautiful blond color.</li>
      <li>Great seller but stuff don&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>All this is going to do is remove brass tones from your hair after bleaching it, and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy I tried Virgin Snow.</li>
      <li>let me say, AS AN EXPERIENCED BEAUTICIAN/STYLIST, this IS NOT FOR ORANGE</li>
      <li>It liFred my hair one shade , still a great product</li>
      <li>Stunning!!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t judge me... :P)</li>
      <li>also conditions nicely, my hair felt great afterwards.</li>
      <li>I will say the one good thing about this product.  </li>
      <li>good seller but not get color</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>Not too satisfied, which is surprising because Manic Panic is usually good.</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
      <li>I love my hair and take good care of it, but I did not choose this product because of anyone else&#x27;s review.  </li>
      <li>Manic Panic Virgin Snow really worked beautifully!  </li>
      <li>I really really liked it.</li>
      <li>if you want this stuff to work you&#x27;ll need to have already bleached hair which kinda defeats it own purpose.</li>
      <li>It honestly didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
      <li>but I found home made purple shampoo is more effective than this stuff at toning the brassy colors out of my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wella Color Charm would have been cheaper and more effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this works great for those who have naturally light hair that&#x27;s been bleached and can easily achieve platinum tones.</li>
      <li>It was ok</li>
      <li>but I do think it&#x27;s over priced it doesn&#x27;t come with the bleach (which most people need) and it runs I get splat from walmart which is hair dye and bleach</li>
      <li>Best product for removing yellow tones from hair.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>if your hair is anywhere close to your shoulders you should probably purchase two to be safe.</li>
      <li>My violet conditioner does a better job.</li>
      <li>My niece bought this to help her get to that perfect platinum blonde.</li>
      <li>I most Likly won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had much better luck with the &#x27;Punky Colors&#x27; brand</li>
      <li>You may need to bleach your hair more than 3 times.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better results leaving purple shampoo sit in my hair in a soap cap.</li>
      <li>because of how awesome their colors work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got multiple jars (for upkeep) and</li>
      <li>Had much better results with Shimmer Lights shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite toner, EVER.  </li>
      <li>The more damaged, the more porous your hair, the better to this stuff.</li>
      <li>so I can keep it healthy.</li>
      <li>It looked more purple than anything.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love how my haircolor looks now.  </li>
      <li>I use this before going on to most colors.</li>
      <li>This toner is the best I&#x27;ve found for getting rid of all traces of brassiness or yellow in bleached hair.  </li>
      <li>you can just apply this on top.</li>
      <li>I really REALLY love Manic Panic</li>
      <li>My hair never looked and felt better-</li>
      <li>I chose it based on my gut instinct, which is what most people should do.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I asked google for a safe solution and discovered MP.</li>
      <li>Looked ok but not what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Hopefully you can find a better toner...</li>
      <li>Virgin Snow is more of a toner than a dye because, well, look at the colour.</li>
      <li>you are going to need more of it than you think you will.</li>
      <li>so I was able to use this container for 2 applications.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Omg I love you Manic Panic.</li>
      <li>Also it was a lot more work and uses quite a bit of product.</li>
      <li>I would call this more of hair toner than a dye.</li>
      <li>To me there are better alternatives.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Beautiful Saturday morning, bleached my hair, hair was clean and was ready and excited to try Virgin Snow.  </li>
      <li>It is extremely light, and light colours don&#x27;t show up well unless they are used on very, very light hair.</li>
      <li>Worked quickly and easily!</li>
      <li>this toner works wonders and i would easily recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>easy to use and no smell to it.</li>
      <li>This product was easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is odorless an easy.</li>
      <li>This product is so easy to use and just as described.  </li>
      <li>LOVED THE SUPER FAST SHIPPING!</li>
      <li>You must remove all color from the hair to get desired color which is a beautiful white.  </li>
      <li>Used this product along with the bleaching kit... gave me a beautiful shade of white...</li>
      <li>used this product on my bleached hair, and as promised, turned it a beautiful shade of snow white....</li>
      <li>The toner worked fine after leaving it on for an hour.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great vegan toner that won&#x27;t damage your hair, it actually deep conditions it while processing.</li>
      <li>Your hair also has to be extremely light-</li>
      <li>Great for getting the yellow out!  </li>
      <li>However, despite the fact that it did not tone, it did leave my hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Whatever shade of Manic Panic you use,  use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I did not think I would need to use a bleach beforehand because my hair is already so light.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was ok I bleached my hair as light as I could kinda saw a white from it bud didn&#x27;t wrk well</li>
    <li> This stuff is just &#x27;alright&#x27; you are going to need more of it than you think you will. I really coated it on &amp; left it for several hours. But it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference. I&#x27;ve had much better luck with the &#x27;Punky Colors&#x27; brand the smell of this also bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair did come out super soft after use, so it might be good for bi-monthly touch-ups to keep color looking really vibrant. But I probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I tbought I would be white purple with this. Not white blue (virgin snow) looks like snow :p not worth reading reviews I guess..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a color it washes off in one wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too the people sleeping with it its dumb and I guess its not comfy... Keep it in untill its not warm anymore. Nothing happens when its cooled off. 1-2hours. Dont use shampoo if you want to keep the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars..  its an very expensive conditioner.  You can buy several for this price with the crazy shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying again, will try a color from manic but not this product. Not sure why its so popular..</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use and just as described.  we have used store bought products that do not work near as good.  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to achieve white hair color!</li>
    <li> I have light blonde hair as it is, but it was getting brassy at the roots. I used this and kept it on longer for desired results and it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. :(</li>
    <li> Bleached my hair, put this dye on it, washed it out nothing. So I put the dye on overnight hoping that several hours of it being there would hopefully dye my hair. The next morning I showered and there wasn&#x27;t even a hint of the color. Bleh</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst hair dyes I have ever used. It has little to no effect on my platinum blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, wavy brown hair. I&#x27;m not a stranger to funky color. I know the rules. I lifted my hair three damn times with 30 volume lightener. This stuff? Did nothing. I don&#x27;t know why. It may work for you.</li>
    <li> This will do it. It lasts through about 6 or 8 hair washings. It does require the bleaching of your hair before application. I would call this more of hair toner than a dye. If you lighten your hair and what to eliminate brassiness or yellow tints this product will do it. I did find it cheaper a a local \\&quot;beauty supply\\&quot; store. Saved shipping</li>
    <li> Did nothing to my hair at all, nothing! And yes my hair is pre lightened give this a miss if looking to get Snow White hair.</li>
    <li> meh... hair really needs to already be bleached white and then this makes it brighter white,  still had slightest yellow tinge in my hair and this was completely ineffective.  totally wasted my money.  THIS WILL NOT TURN YOUR HAIR WHITE.....its just a brightener for already white hair....</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this product. My hair is about the lightest platinum it could possibly be. I use purple shampoo pretty regard you and from the pictures and things I&#x27;d seen on line I thought this would give it to the push of white I really wanted taking out all traces of yellowish tint. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and I left it in for an hour and a half with no heat. I&#x27;ve had better results leaving purple shampoo sit in my hair in a soap cap. It did however leave my hair feeling very soft with no conditioner needed and didn&#x27;t feel dried out at all.</li>
    <li> Washed out almost completely first shampoo, and I wash my hair twice a week if that. Worst &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used. Not a fan of manic panic but figured I&#x27;d give them another shot. Not worth the price at all.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toner, EVER.  It&#x27;s a toner, so for those looking for purple hair color, this isn&#x27;t it. All this is going to do is remove brass tones from your hair after bleaching it, and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is that ugly grey color.  I like to wear a flat top.  So, every time I get my hair cut, I bleach my hair, then use Manic Panic Virgin Snow to get a white color.  It&#x27;s not Anderson Cooper silver, but it&#x27;s close and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Tiny jar not worth our money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to the hair. This product was a complete waste of time.</li>
    <li> I had my color touched up and it was a little more yellow than I wanted so I put this on for a half hour and it took the brassiness out of it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use after the manic panic bleaching kit.  This dye didn&#x27;t make a difference at all in my hair.  Disappointing and surprising because of how many great reviews it has.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t Work at ALL. Don even bother with this, it did nothing at all. What a Waste! I am so angry!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s supposed to. LOVED THE SUPER FAST SHIPPING!</li>
    <li> I ended up using a box dye after and got the results I wanted.. This was a waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I used this toner on 3 separate occasions and under 3 different situations and still no workie! From what i have read in reviews on other websites the stuff works for some people and for others it doesn&#x27;t. For me it was a waste of money and time. The only thing good coming from this product is, its a decent conditioner after bleaching. I&#x27;m beginning to believe that it has more conditioner in the bottle than actual hair coloring solution. Looks like I&#x27;m gonna have to just pay into a salon to get Marilyn Monroe like platinum hair. I will be spending the same amount as i would be trying this bogus color and any other toners like it again. As far as i am concerned Manic Panic&#x27;s Virgin White Snow is nothing more than a funny colored conditioner. I mean come on the crap should either work or not work and not only working for SPECIFIC people, SPECIFIC hair types and SPECIFIC starting hair colors. If ones hair has been bleached prior or is already pretty light blonde naturally, there is no other reason why this product should not work for just about everybody who follows the instructions correctly.</li>
    <li> After bleaching my hair, which is naturally red, I used this to cut the brassy tones.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, or white hair, but I was expecting....something.  Not only did I leave it on longer than 30 minutes, about 2 hours, I also covered my hair with a cap, and used a winter beanie to keep the heat in.  Maybe this would work better on someone who has no red/orange tones to their hair, but if you have any red whatsoever, skip it.  Feria&#x27;s Ultimate Platinum worked well for me.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! CLICK AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT ! I bleached my hair and put this in thinking it would work, I wasted my money 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the previous reviewer who said this is NOT for brassy hair, only for white hair. I am actually going to try a dark purple instead.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. I was very sad with the results.</li>
    <li> In other reviews, I read that this stuff worked for some people, but others could not get it to work, but I thought that they were just doing it wrong. Well, I bleached my hair to a VERY bright, pale blonde, and put the toner in. After an hour, literally NOTHING had happened. I tried it again, this time using heat to try to amplify it, still nothing. I just don&#x27;t know what went wrong.</li>
    <li> I have very dark hair naturally and bleached it once to a yellow/orange blonde. I bought this to take out some of the brass and possibly get a pastel shade of the Mystic Heather I had also purchased, but it didn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect for the brassiness on its own and did make the Mystic Heather somewhat lighter, but not pastel. I&#x27;m sure this works great for those who have naturally light hair that&#x27;s been bleached and can easily achieve platinum tones. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll have to bleach it again, possibly twice, for the Virgin Snow to work as intended. No qualms with the product though, just sharing with others who have dark hair that takes a few rounds to lighten.</li>
    <li> :/ didn&#x27;t work, i had pale hair and everything but it made an awkward purple streak, not worth it</li>
    <li> Awesome product I loved how fast it to the brassiness out of my hair and the ease it was to use the scent was not too bad as well</li>
    <li> I use this before going on to most colors. It&#x27;s a great vegan toner that won&#x27;t damage your hair, it actually deep conditions it while processing. My hair is really stubborn when I bleach it and there is always a yellow tone and this stuff knocks it right out.</li>
    <li> My hair never looked and felt better- all traces of yellow are gone and it is soft and shiny-a big hit with my man and my colleagues at work............ Agnes</li>
    <li> This sh*i sucks.. never had a problem with manic panic, but this is the worst thing ever.  I&#x27;m so pissed. .. My hair it&#x27;s already platinum blond.  All I wanted was my bands white.  But no.  Out Dint do ANYTHING.  Even used a purple conditioner aftrr to help the white.. no only thing it did was make my hair soft.. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have level 7/8 Ash blonde hair with natural (sun bleached) about level 10 hi-lights. My base color has a lot of gold to it that unfortunately comes up when exposed to sun. I usually use another product (professional obtained from beauty supply store) to tone my hair down so it becomes more platinum less gold. I saw this and have used other manic panic colors in the past and wanted to give this a try. My mother, a beautician with 35+ years experience, applied it as directed to my shampooed and dried hair. I wore it under a plastic cap with a heat cap on top for several hours then wrapped the plastic cap with a turbie twist and slept. The next morning I rinsed it with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it did very little to tone down the gold. Don&#x27;t get me wrong its not as gold but it hardly compares to what I was using before. Also it was a lot more work and uses quite a bit of product. For my fine shoulder length hair I had to use the entire jar. To me there are better alternatives. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Sally&#x27;s. It works fine and toned my hair to a nice white. To those complaining, you&#x27;re supposed to have your hair a very pale blonde before using. Not super yellow or orange. Also, you&#x27;re not supposed to use dyes or toners right after you bleach it, it won&#x27;t absorb as well.</li>
    <li> If you are buying this to go with a manic panic bleach kit, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with either. After I bleached my hair (which barely had an effect) this toner didn&#x27;t really take out any brassy tones at all. After that failed attempt, I had my boyfriend go to walmart and get me some Splat bleach, which surprised me by being blue, so it doubled as a very effective toner, and the bleach lightened the undyed parts of my hair to white after one use, and the parts that have been previously dyed took another round of bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: make a trip to walmart instead</li>
    <li> Ombre&#x27;d my hair, yes I know how to dye my hair but I found home made purple shampoo is more effective than this stuff at toning the brassy colors out of my hair. Save some money, buy purple hair dye and just mix it with your regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Have to bleach hair first and even after that it didn&#x27;t work. It is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It does not work at all it sucks to not get it be warned all those is barely strip your original home dye hair color</li>
    <li> This toner is the best I&#x27;ve found for getting rid of all traces of brassiness or yellow in bleached hair.  If you follow the directions (bleach with 30 or 40 volume first to lift all traces of your natural color then \\&quot;paint\\&quot; on, and watch the color transformation closely), you too can have a beautiful head of platinum, snowy blonde hair that is NOT fried or dried out.  I love how my haircolor looks now.  Stunning!!</li>
    <li> After bleaching my dark brown hair three times and then applying the Virgin Snow toner, my hair is now snowy white.  From the other reviews apparently it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  My only advice is that your hair has to be very light platinum-blond before you apply.  You may need to bleach your hair more than 3 times.  Going from brown to white hair is a slow process.  You&#x27;ll be stuck with orange or bright yellow hair for a few months at least.  You may want to go with a 40 developer or even invest in going to a salon to do it for you.  Just keep bleaching and applying the toner until your desired color is achieved.  You should expect your hair to get really damaged in the process.  White hair is not for the faint of heart!  This is an awesome product though.  The best purple toner out there.</li>
    <li> it worked just like i wanted it gave me the white tone line i was looking for. i will spread the word</li>
    <li> Nope. Don&#x27;t like it. Should have listened to the other reviews. I left it on 2 hours (I&#x27;m not doing over night because it&#x27;s not going to still be processing after all that time). My hair looks pretty much the same..(See the picture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wella Color Charm would have been cheaper and more effective. This was just a very expensive conditioner.</li>
    <li> Omg I love you Manic Panic. Let me tell my story. I bleached my hair twice so its still was yellow with lot of orenge on my hair. So I didn&#x27;t have choice and I didn&#x27;t know what to do coz i couldn&#x27;t color my hair agan. After lot of research I gave a try to manic panic. I left over night and tadam my hair deeply restored and conditioned and most important change color. Platinum white. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> It did absolutely Nothing.  Very Disaponited ..Followed diredetions to the Maxx. once more the directions were not in english, and had to follow the fine print on the jar whis was covered with sticker, NOT Sold Seperately....</li>
    <li> It may have been just the way I had done it or my hair, but the product turned my blonde streak into a muddled grey purple. Though, I may have done it wrong. Overall I may try it again.</li>
    <li> Dream color toner, excelent to take off other color residues.</li>
    <li> I have a super belched highlights, and this product didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. not even a shine. nothing. disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used this product along with the bleaching kit... gave me a beautiful shade of white... Left my hair in better condition than before I bleached and use this... love it!</li>
    <li> It took my hair a few stages past the bleached yellow color. I left it on a few hours I guess maybe I could have left it on a bit longer. Did not turn it snow white like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Terrible product! used this last yr when i ahd almost white blonde hair! Their was no difference! Waste of money! The dye might be good thou!</li>
    <li> i used it after bleaching my hair, but it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> Terrible, I had it in for over a hour and a half and nothing changed, iv never bought worse hair dye in my life.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what went wrong with this. I bleached my hair to a nice, light blonde shade, and used this over the top. I followed the instructions to the letter, and even left it in a little longer than instructed, and it did NOTHING to the color. I was highly disappointed, especially since I like the bleach so much.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even change my hair color.</li>
    <li> It came out all clumpy...</li>
    <li> Best product for removing yellow tones from hair.  Tried several different toners on my too yellow hair, and this product is the best.  Worked quickly and easily!</li>
    <li> i left this in for an hour so doubled the time and it still didnt do much. i then did another round and im left at a platinum blonde. i did this after i used the manic panic flash lightning 40 volume</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for getting the yellow out!  I have used many products over the years and this one definitely accomplished what I was looking for.  After bleaching my hair it is always too yellow and I prefer it a whiter tone.  This must be repeated about every 10 washes, but it&#x27;s worth it and does not seem to damage your hair.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. It was the most disappointing hair product I have ever used and I change my hair constantly.</li>
    <li> I really REALLY love Manic Panic so when I decided to go WHITE haired I instantly thought of &amp;#34;Virgin Snow&amp;#34; because of how awesome their colors work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got multiple jars (for upkeep) and it just... didn&#x27;t work. My hair was practically-white already, I&#x27;d stripped the brassy tones, etc. etc. and it just... didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss in some Wella T14 + developer? That did the trick.</li>
    <li> I am not use to all this new way of dying. I use permanent dye have always. I have been trying to get blodish white and nothing is happening. So about now Im putting red on over blonde bleached hair. This toner does nothing. I still have some left and dont know what to do with it but throw away.</li>
    <li> I have salt and pepper hair but more white hair coming in, so I didn&#x27;t like that dark brown contrast with the white.  I used the lightening kit (twice) and my dark parts turned either a pale yellow to a very light orange.  I put the toner in my hair and left it overnight and absolutely nothing happened.  Not even the pale yellow colors turned white.  I can see if your hair turned orange, this product wouldn&#x27;t work, but I saw all the review on how it helped with anyone having the yellow color - turning it white.  Well, wonder why mine didn&#x27;t.....  I will say the one good thing about this product.  It makes your hair very soft.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t make a difference</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful. i&#x27;m stuck in a tiny college town and had my roommate bleach my pixie cut to get to blonde (not white), and was left with a horrible brassy color and hair damaged beyond belief. i bought manic panic on here, left it in overnight, and the next morning my hair almost brass-free and so much healthier. this toner works wonders and i would easily recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This did not tone my hair at all. I followed the directions thoroughly the first time, left it in for 30 minutes - no difference. I tried a second time and left it in for two hours, and it still had no effect. Yes, this was after I had already bleached my hair as well. However, despite the fact that it did not tone, it did leave my hair silky smooth. Even after bleaching it, it felt healthy and unbroken, shiny and soft. I used the remaining product as a conditioner, so I feel like I at least got my money&#x27;s worth, but I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Okay let me just say I read a bunch of reviews for this product and a lot of people were saying how it didnt do much or anything to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Well let me say, AS AN EXPERIENCED BEAUTICIAN/STYLIST, this IS NOT FOR ORANGE HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think most people realize that this is for yellowish bleached pail blonde that still has YELLOW not orange tones in it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have yellowish hair and use this, it will work well!!! but if you have dark yellow/ orange hair, it wont work!&lt;br /&gt;If you have dark yellow hair and don&#x27;t want to bleach anymore, use shimmer lights blonde. it&#x27;ll work great.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be stupid and buy this if you have orange hair, you&#x27;d just be wasting your damn money.&lt;br /&gt;Hope someone reads this and finds it useful.</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair 2 times and then used this toner to bring my brassy yellow-orange hair to a presentable color. After a 30 minute use my hair is a beautiful blond color. Although my hair is not white, I didn&#x27;t expect this product to bring my hair from that brassy yellow-orange color to white seeing as it is semi-permanent and is just a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not very much of the product, only enough for 2 uses on my just above the shoulder hair. I probably wont buy it again because of the small amount you get and the semi-permanent nature, it&#x27;s just not practical for everyday hair.</li>
    <li> I got this product with in two days after I ordered it. Love it</li>
    <li> I left this on for 4 hours and used 3 jars.... my hair is yellow/blonde/pinkish and it did NOTHING at all. Not one strand is a different color.... horrible!</li>
    <li> I have short, thick hair that is already considered platinum but I didn&#x27;t have much luck with this toner. It appears that for this one to work your hair needs to be very close to white already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using Manic Panic so it surprised me how small of an amount 4oz really is, so if your hair is anywhere close to your shoulders you should probably purchase two to be safe. As for me, I think I&#x27;ll try another toner before I think about purchasing this one again.</li>
    <li> Not enough product for the price, in my opinion. I need about 3 more of these for my whole head. (medium length hair). After reading the reviews, I guess I did not leave it long enough on my hair because my hair was still as brassy as it was before. Most likely will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It came so fast! Lulz I made a funny.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use it!!!!</li>
    <li> from what i have heard, this does work but only if your hair is previously bleached and a veryyyyy pale yellow it wont work that well if its mostly orange or deep yellow</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, except dry it out. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all. sucked.</li>
    <li> Only problem I had was that it only turned the tips white but the color I put over it is still more vibrant.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how long and hard I tried to get my hair white. No matter what I did, there was still a tinge of yellow in my blonde hair. I used to use manic panic a while ago when I dyed my hair crazy colors so I was familiar with the brand, but wasn&#x27;t really thinking that their toner would be any better than a Wella toner or something similar bought at the beauty supply store. I WAS WRONG!!!! I am so happy I tried Virgin Snow. My hair is WHITE! From dying my hair crazy colors in the past I have always had a trick I would use with Manic Panic and I did the same trick with the Virgin Snow. Apply it GENEROUSLY over lightened hair.. It can be a pale yellow like the inside of a banana (if you&#x27;re a dark yellow, orange or red tone, this product was not made for you and you will NOT get white hair so don&#x27;t be suprised). After the application I use the blow dryer to heat up my hair for a few minutes and cover it with a shower cap or even a plastic bag. Then WAIT. Watch TV, clean the house, whatever... leave it in as long as possible. It wil not hurt your hair, it actually conditions it and mine always feels softer after. After at least an hour and a half...periodically heating a few minutes at a time, rinse out and shampoo/condition. I actually sleep in Manic Panic hair dye/Toner... Seems to really stick that way, and again.. will not hurt your hair one tiny bit. After rinsing my hair was WHITE... WHITE... I am sooo happy!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get me all the way to white, but it did get me to white blonde from yellowy and brassy! I left it on for a full hour. It helped my poor bleach bedraggled hair be less strawlike, too! I only used half the container. I&#x27;m going to redo it in a couple days, and see if a second application gets me an even whiter hair color.</li>
    <li> I test it on a strand of hair on the side of my face and it was SMURF BLUE.  Got it rinsed to light purple.  BEWARE.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, fun product for the teenager in the house.&lt;br /&gt;Probably wouldn&#x27;t get again as it didn&#x27;t actually turn his hair the color he&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> After proper bleaching and hair washes, this product barely stayed in my hair for less than a week.  This new formula is a huge disappointment.  The last time I used this product [with proper hair preparation and washes], the product lasted for about a month!  A month compared to less than a week?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you&#x27;re looking for an expensive, very temporary dye accessory for your hair.  I am so disappointed.  I used to swear by this product.  What happened to this awesome product?  Please bring the old Manic Panic back.</li>
    <li> Great seller but stuff don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Do not even bother with this product. I bought it and took this stuff to a salon to have some one apply it properly to my hair and it did absolutely zilch. it just made my hair stiff and gross. if you want this stuff to work you&#x27;ll need to have already bleached hair which kinda defeats it own purpose.</li>
    <li> Hi! I&#x27;ve read a lot of people&#x27;s reviews on here expecting this product to do things that it is not supposed to do. Virgin Snow is a white toner meaning if you have bleached hair but want to get rid of the yellow undertones to make it more white you can just apply this on top. I have never purchased this product so I can&#x27;t say whether or not this toner works I just wanted to inform people so that they didn&#x27;t buy something they didn&#x27;t want</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the situation. Before this, the top of my hair was pretty close to white while the bottom was yellow (not orange, yellow) which this product was supposed to correct. What I did was completely soak my hair in this, put on a cap, and slept with it in. So it was in for about 9 hours straight. Unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing and then a whole lot of what it shouldn&#x27;t have. The top of my hair is an uneven purple and the bottom is still yellow with no change at all. It&#x27;s not a good look. There&#x27;s plenty of people here who warned not to get it- &amp;#34;it did nothing&amp;#34; but I chose to listen to the few who, somehow, it worked for. Some say that it&#x27;s supposed to get rid of yellow which it didn&#x27;t and others say that your hair has to be damn year white for this to work which the other half of my hair was... And now it&#x27;s purple. So that&#x27;s my two cents and warning.</li>
    <li> I have had my hair professionally bleached around 5-6 times and toned twice. After spending hundreds of dollars I still hadn&#x27;t reached the white color I was hoping for. I was so happy when this product took out the brassy gold color! I only have 1/2 of my hair bleached (the under layer of my hair is a dark brown) so I was able to use this container for 2 applications. One application lasted about 2 weeks, the container lasted me for 1 month. After about 2 weeks the color slowly fades back out to a goldish/brassy blonde. I will be buying product this again and again!</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! Turned blond hair white! Awesome! I really really liked it. Will order it again. Thanks. It is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Turned hair blue, but I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
    <li> i had to bleach my dark brown hair three times for an hour each time. i bleached until my hair was platinum blond. then i put the toner on for 4 hours. the process took almost a week because after i bleached i deep conditioned to prevent damage. in the end my hair was stark white. it lasted almost a month before i had to touch up. will buy again</li>
    <li> Beautiful Saturday morning, bleached my hair, hair was clean and was ready and excited to try Virgin Snow.  Applied it, left it on for 3 HOURS and NOTHING! No change in color, not even a strand of hair changed.  If anything, it made my hair feeling stiff.  Never will buy Manic Panic again.</li>
    <li> really useful for my Weiss cosplay.</li>
    <li> used this product on my bleached hair, and as promised, turned it a beautiful shade of snow white.... no purple tinge to my hair ends or anything, definately recommend for anyone who wants to have pure, vibrant, snow white hair without damage.... My Hair was a little damaged from the bleaching process at a local salon, but after I used this product, my hair felt soft, silky, and was that gorgeous shade of white I have been desiring... KUDOS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair to very pale white/yellow and put this on for recommended time, rinsed and absolutely no color. Put on again and left on several hours, per reviews suggestions...rinsed...no color. Put on and left over night..rinsed...no color. Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> this toner was pretty weak even over my white hair so not sure just how white ones hair has to be for this toner to show up even a little-perhaps transparent? And I used the product according to the directions so it was not because of human error. Manic Panic has always been a good choice for semi permanent hair color in the past though I just do not think much of this &amp;#34;Virgin snow&amp;#34; tone.Only people with transparent hair should consider getting this toner and even then I am not so sure it will do anything except goop your hair up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used it wrong or if I got a bad tub but it didn&#x27;t do like I figured it would. It honestly didn&#x27;t do anything and I left it in my hair over the night and it did nothing.</li>
    <li> Uhh yeah after stripping and stripping again then bleaching I got my hair to an amazing almost white color so I thought hey this should get the rest of my hair there, after rinsing I took my towel away and ohh look! My hair is blue!!! I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I would order this product again! great product! easy to use and no smell to it.,and makes your hair soft.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair was platinum blonde, like as blonde as you can get and it still didn&#x27;t make my hair white. I followed the directions and nothing. Other than that it did leave my hair very smooth.</li>
    <li> not a fan.  it is easy to apply, and does not make a real mess, but it did not change anything about my hair tint after bleaching.</li>
    <li> I am not happy atall  this purchase.  I bought FOUR manic pani virgon snow toners. Not only did I have to pay VERY expensive tax when it arrived, there was only ONE in the box.  It clearly states that I purchased FOUR.  The pot it comes in, is no bigger than the palm of my hand.   The box it came in was VERY misleading. It was HUGE, literally nearly the size of my whole torso, but in the box only contained ONE pot of manic panic virgin snow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been messing around with different dyes and toners for the past week trying to achieve that white blonde look. Finally decided to try this after bleaching my hair to a very pale yellow and then dying it with Wella Color Charm in Frosty Ash. It still had a bit of yellow after the bleaching and dye job but I slept in this over night and it took the last bit of yellow right out. It left my hair extremely soft and I finally got the color I was looking for. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> This product is everything it claims to be.  It left my hair soft and white.  It is easy to apply and gentle on the hair.  I bleached my half gray hair, half dark blond hair twice, then applied Virgin Snow.  The Manic Panic website recommended leaving product on for several hours, so I did.  I also applied heat with a blow dryer to accelerate the process (which worked).  After several hours the majority of the yellow tint from bleaching was gone and my hair was a beautiful white.  I actually like my hair!  There is still a very slight yellow where my hair was the darkest so I will be sure to bleach that area a little more the next time I bleach roots.  Manic Panic Virgin Snow really worked beautifully!  Love it.</li>
    <li> As long as you bleach out your hair before and know what you are doing, this product brings out the whitest of whites.  I always suggest for home beauticians that they always bleach and tone their hair when they are due for a haircut as to allow for some room for some overprocessing in which you can immediately afterwards lop off.</li>
    <li> Very good product, took out my brassy colors from bleaching, did a great job. not sure what problem other people are having with this but it took out my brassy colors very great. love this product, highly recommend it. also conditions nicely, my hair felt great afterwards.</li>
    <li> My hair was bleached to a pale, buttery yellow, toned with a professional blue toner, and washed my hair with purple toning shampoo and conditioners for a few weeks before I even used this, and it still didn&#x27;t really do much. I think my results are ruined by the fact that I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with red tones before, and even gone dark brown, and those just don&#x27;t ever want to fully come out. I know people have gotten white hair from using this, but I think you have to have either a lot of patience and quite a few jars of this to tone it over weeks and weeks, or virgin hair before you bleach it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not very powerful, but if you&#x27;re lucky, it might get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It conditions your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no perfumes added (I have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is bleached palest blonde almost white ( I use 40 vol. with Matrix V-light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product WORKS only if you know what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply this to YELLOW hair...it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply this to pale YELLOW hair, it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White hair can only be achieved by bleaching your hair to the palest level which will require double-process bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who say \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot;  you are doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to school for cosmetology and have bleaching hair for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will use it when I don&#x27;t feel like putting globs of stinky ammonia products on my hair to make it white, this will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have white hair....and my hair is naturally dark brown (level 4).</li>
    <li> Manic Panic Virgin Snow is really not worth getting in my opinion. I purchased it in order to tone my bleached strip of hair white. After bleaching my hair multiple times (I think about 4 to 5) with a 40 developer, I used this product to try to tone the piece of hair to white. I regret to inform you that it did not change from very light blonde to the desired color. Believe me, I did extensive research on this toner before I bought it. I read that you needed to bleach your hair to a light yellow banana color before toning it, so that is what I did. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I also read that after using Virgin Snow, your hair would be rejuvenated, soft, and as good as new. I really don&#x27;t know where these claims came from, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this didn&#x27;t really do anything to better my hair, which, by the way, was damaged beyond compare! I am so glad that I only tried it on a strip of hair, I was thinking of doing my whole head! (Thats what she said... don&#x27;t judge me... :P) Anyway, if you&#x27;re thinking of buying this product, DO NOT BOTHER!!! I ignored the negative reviews and look where it got me! I was really hoping that this would work, but sadly, it did not. Hopefully you can find a better toner... Happy dyeing compatriots!</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so you cannot judge by someone else&#x27;s experience.  My hair is dark brown and I bleached it with mani panic flash lightening 40 volume and it made my hair very white in a short amount of time (about an hour).  I used the toner but did not leave it in long enough (only thirty minutes.).  The second time I bleached my hair, it came out snow white with slightly yellow highlights in some areas.  The toner worked fine after leaving it on for an hour.  My hair is very very very short and very strong, so the bleaching process did nothing to harm my hair, which is soft and silky after having  been bleached twice.  Of course, I also use argan oil on it between bleachings.  Sometimes I use olive oil on my hair and apply heat.  I love my hair and take good care of it, but I did not choose this product because of anyone else&#x27;s review.  I chose it based on my gut instinct, which is what most people should do.  To rely on anyone else&#x27;s review is like assuming that everyone has the same hair--NOT.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Sally&#x27;s after bleaching my hair and doing the lightest possible ash blonde, kept it on overnight(12 hours), and it STILL did NOTHING! Very disappointed,  my hair is no more white now than it was when I applied the ash blonde.</li>
    <li> This toned the blonde(which was super light blonde)and leaves small hints of lilac and grey in the hair if you tone it more than once. Sadly I&#x27;m looking for more than just the toning, I am looking for more of the lilac color. Overall, it is a pretty good toner. (:</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to lighten bleached hair without frying it. My hair is platinum, supple and soft! Yay!</li>
    <li> This stuff kinda sucks. I left it in for four hours and it only lightened the lightest parts of my hair. I&#x27;m really disappointed because I&#x27;ve bleached my hair three times and I wanted to use virgin snow to get it white. I have a lot of hair so I had to buy two bottles of it. Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as described. Doesn&#x27;t really do anything to my hair though....Looks the same color blond as before.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product, It did what a semi-permanent color was suppose to do. Will probably purchase product again.</li>
    <li> The color just never went silver. It looked more purple than anything.</li>
    <li> It just did not work for me, I regret the moment I bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom, she is blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream didnt work for her at all. nothing happened. i dont know what is the reason.</li>
    <li> So I didn&#x27;t leave this product on for the 30 minutes it said, I left it on for about 6 hours. i have ombre blonde hair right now from new bleach to older hair because I don&#x27;t want to fully bleach the bottom out so I can keep it healthy. so i got my hair hot with a blow dryer about every thirty minutes and I did notice some toned spots, especially at the top. However, I wish I would have left this on for the night, but overall I would say, its worth a try for your hair because my professor did comment on how my hair looked different the next day so maybe I am just my biggest critic.</li>
    <li> I went with the lightening bleach and I was highly motivated by this manic panic product yet  the toner I am sadly discouraged it did absolutely nothing still blonde with no signs of white or silver hair.. so sad horrible disappointment I need this to be transformed by this coming weekend I am running out of time</li>
    <li> good seller but not get color</li>
    <li> You must remove all color from the hair to get desired color which is a beautiful white.  This product conditions as well as colors.  Use a very gentle shampoo and cold water to wash with and color will last.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Helped tone my hair and take out some orange. It would have been more effective if I had lightened it further. You definitely already need to have blonde hair before using this product.</li>
    <li> no snow！  is nothing for my hair</li>
    <li> I never received my order from this store, but I used Manic Panic Virgin Snow, before and its a great product!</li>
    <li> I tryed to use it it had no change I even left it on for a few hours. It also was very burning I most Likly won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything to my dark blonde hair, gave me sort of a silvery glow. Just use bleach instead of this. Smells bad, but does much better.</li>
    <li> My niece bought this to help her get to that perfect platinum blonde. There wasnt enough to do her whole head, and what she could cover did not change that much. I am considering a different toner in the future....</li>
    <li> i bleached my hair and then used this and let it sit for about an hour. it really got the yellows out!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this, and it did not work as I expected.  I already have pretty light hair--blonde with undertones of red--but I wanted to go platinum-white.  I have long hair that almost goes to my belly button when it&#x27;s in front, so I used the whole jar, following the directions as instructed.  I left it in for two and a half hours, but when I washed it out, it was as if I had done nothing to my hair to begin with.  I even used heat on it when it was in my hair and washed it out with cold water.  Did I do something wrong?  I did not think I would need to use a bleach beforehand because my hair is already so light.</li>
    <li> Worked well for about 1-2 weeks. Very white.  My hair was already lightened.  plus I had to leave it in my hair for a few hours to get the desired effect.  Next time im trying wella lady or punky color.  those seem to have decent reviews</li>
    <li> Disregard the instructions, this stuff is best applied and left in for as long as you can stand to.  I apply in early morning and rinse after dinner. It leaves my hair a gorgeous pure white! It&#x27;s almost like a conditioner, too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is much cheaper to buy a bottle of Adore: African Violet hair color on here for $5.50, and mix a tiny bit into your favorite conditioner until you get a medium-light purple. It takes very little, and it would last you forever. This stuff is seriously overpriced. Take my advice.</li>
    <li> Toned absolutely nada!  I purchased this because it had fairly decent reviews, and I was going to use it to tone down the brassiness in blonde hair.  Used the entire bottle between two sittings, and it didn&#x27;t do a darn thing.</li>
    <li> Manic panic is vegan hair dye and it may not last that long cause it&#x27;s not actually dying your hair it&#x27;s staining. This is a toner it&#x27;s not a light purple hair dye it&#x27;s even called virgin snow. The first time I used manic panic it&#x27;s when they still had ridiculous names like after curfew blue and it runs like crazy but if you wash your hair 3 time a week with cold water it stays in the longest. I mean wash your body everyday but your hair only 3 times. And I would give it 5 stars but I do think it&#x27;s over priced it doesn&#x27;t come with the bleach (which most people need) and it runs I get splat from walmart which is hair dye and bleach and it&#x27;s 9$ but manic panic it does less damage to your hair then anything else so if you read the bad reviews don&#x27;t let it change your mind buy the overly priced toner it won&#x27;t damage your hair to bad :)</li>
    <li> You really have to put this on overnight to get any results. Your hair also has to be extremely light- my hair is really light (only the slightest yellow tinge) but virgin snow only caught some of my hair- leaving my hair an uneven mess.&lt;br /&gt;Also be advised that your hair might have a purple tinge from keeping this in your hair.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to apply. After 50 mins. of waiting, there was no white to be found anywhere on my hair. Would not purchase every again</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find Manic Panic. My budget is tight now so going to a salon to pay $200 is not an option at the moment. I found a hair colorist to do double process at my home for $60. Bad news she doesn&#x27;t use toner but I didn&#x27;t know until she got to my house. She said everyone she&#x27;s studied under does double process without toner. Hummm, it&#x27;s not really double process then, right? Anyway I was hoping for the best. I like my hair icy and I told her. So my hair turned out light yellow and just a little darker on 1/2 inch roots. Looked ok but not what I wanted. I was determined to have a toner. I asked google for a safe solution and discovered MP. Ordered right away and applied as soon as I received. This was last night. I read reviews and advice in Manic Panics website which indicated not to worry about leaving it on too long. One person even slept with it all night. Another; her hair was healthier after and she left it on for hours. DON&#x27;T!!! Everyone&#x27;s hair is different; natural state and healthiness or damage, and scalp sensitivity. I applied with the applicator brush all over. I did get it on my scalp as my hair is short, no more than 1-1.5 inches. Anyway, after 30 mins nothing, 1-2 hrs a little maybe. I used heat and plastic wrap and cap. After 3.5 hrs I decided to sleep with it on knowing I could have violet hair. I woke 4 hrs later and checked. Violet tips! My hair had not processed enough on the roots. Not having enough experience I though it was enough. Reviews also advised if your hair is medium to dark yellow, it will not work. IT WILL NOT WORK! Lesson learned. The thing I&#x27;m not happy about is my scalp was very irritated because I left it on so long. Itching like crazy! I put coconut oil on it and that is helping. So I have yellow roots and violet tips. I&#x27;m not giving up on my blonde because of this snafoo. I think this product is good but roots have to be light, light inside of a banana peel light for it to achieve white. The statement of this productbeing vegan can be misleading. Sounds safer but I wouldn&#x27;t eat it because it has other ingredients that are not good therefore NOT vegan. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll go back to Arrojo cosmetology school and pay $45 better safer results.</li>
    <li> I found that this product didn&#x27;t really work for me at all. I have light blonde hair already and even after bleaching it all i got was a white sheen from the product.</li>
    <li> While the toner took out a little of the brassy color from the last time I did my roots, my hair looked exactly the same as before I applied the toner. I let it sit a little longer than a half of an hour and the only change was the brassy roots were slightly less brassy.</li>
    <li> This toner did nothing to my hair. Followed the directions and left it on for longer than recommended but still nothing. Had much better results with Shimmer Lights shampoo.</li>
    <li> This did a decent job of getting the brassiness out of my hair, it made my highlights white if only temporarily (I don&#x27;t fault this product I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s the shampoo I&#x27;m using because I&#x27;ve put a filter in my shower and my hair is still taking on color).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read others say that this improved the condition of their hair but I did not experience that, if anything it might have dried it a bit but nothing serious.</li>
    <li> It liFred my hair one shade , still a great product</li>
    <li> This works against bleached yellow hair well!</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this Virgin Snow works. Wgen I opened it it was MOLDY. Disgusting. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well enough to be awesome but helps if your hair is light enough..And if you fried your hair from using other products and must tone your hair to look human again in order to leave the house. This is a milder option than putting another toner that requires developer.</li>
    <li> not foot for lightened hair. 4 applications later and this still does nothing to my hair</li>
    <li> I have bleach blonde hair. I put this on. I wrapped my hair in saran wrap. I let it set overnight. Barely any change. My violet conditioner does a better job. Sorry I&#x27;m not sorry.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all, but I have to admit, my hair is quite yellow. On the other had the color was quite moisturizing for the hair, so it wasn&#x27;t totaly a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted white hair, but this made my hair blonde. I had brownish red hair before, and waited a long time before dying it again, and when I did I bleached it then used this, but it seemed like it just lightened the bleach a little. Not too satisfied, which is surprising because Manic Panic is usually good.</li>
    <li> I like this product and would buy it again. Leave it in as long as you can. It is odorless an easy.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out to make my hair white. It didn&#x27;t work. Like AT ALL. I followed the directions and it didn&#x27;t dye my hair even in the slightest. I think that all of these dyes are meant to be used only after you have bleached all the color out of your hair.  However, this is not mentioned ANYWHERE.  So in short, super waste of time and money. Fail.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, took the yellow right out to make my hair a nice white color. Lasted until my next bleach job. (Note that I shampoo infrequently and usually wear a hat outdoors.)</li>
    <li> If it did anything I couldn&#x27;t tell. Used it several times and it still hasn&#x27;t evened out any of the brassyness or even lightened or &amp;#34;whitened&amp;#34; my hair. Looks exactly the same. Pretty disappointed because I hadn&#x27;t had a bad experience with manic panic before :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice on my bleached hair, once on yellow blonde and once on pale yellow and got no results both times. waste of time and money for me. only gonna tone my hair professionally now.</li>
    <li> The first thing people need to realize is that Manic Panic needs two things to last a month- heat and (VERY important!) leave it on overnight. The first time I used Manic Panic was when I was trying to get a really rich red from a dull, faded, permanent red. I had shoulder length hair and I had bought one jar of Vampire Red. I read the review but decided that if you can leave it on and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, why not leave it on overnight and see what happens. I applied it thickly (I still had extra left in the jar when I was done), put a cap on, used heat every 30 minutes, long enough to get all of my hair hot, and left it on for a total of about 13 hours. I rinsed it all out, and I was gifted with silky soft, vibrant red hair that lasted for about a month. I mixed the excess Manic Panic with my conditioner.  Virgin Snow is more of a toner than a dye because, well, look at the colour. It is extremely light, and light colours don&#x27;t show up well unless they are used on very, very light hair. I&#x27;m talking pale ash blond almost, before you try to use it. If you&#x27;re looking for white hair, you can&#x27;t just bleach it once and expect this product to act as a bleach and toner at the same time. It&#x27;s not a miracle maker, just a very good vegan dye. If your hair is damaged from bleaching, Manic Panic will really help you. The more damaged, the more porous your hair, the better to this stuff. If you use this on two people sitting side by side that have the same beginning colour, but one has more damage, the person with more damage would be blessed with better toned, softer hair. It&#x27;s practically giving you a gift for abusing your hair. The biggest things to remember about using Manic Panic are:&lt;br /&gt;a) Don&#x27;t be afraid to leave it on too long. There is no such thing as too long.&lt;br /&gt;b) Use heat, especially if you&#x27;re afraid that your hair is too &#x27;undamaged&#x27; for the dye to stick.&lt;br /&gt;c) If you go with a colour instead of Virgin Snow, put the excess from your dying process in your conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;d) Whatever shade of Manic Panic you use,  use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. Your hair loves it and it makes Manic Panic last longer.&lt;br /&gt;e) When you wash your hair, wash your hair under the faucet- cause it needs to be cold. If the water is warm, the colour will come out faster because the hair follicle is open. Manic Panic needs heat because of that same principal. Cold water&#x3D; shinier hair + longer lasting colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I could be helpful for some people and maybe these tips will come in handy for a future dyehard. :) Oh! and if you use a colour- don&#x27;t let it get on your skin! It will stain it in less than a minute! ^-^our conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;d) Whatever shade of Manic Panic you use,  use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.

    <li> Not as I expected.  More expensive than most products that I have used and takes longer to process. Will give it another try before tossing it.  Hope it works better next time</li>
