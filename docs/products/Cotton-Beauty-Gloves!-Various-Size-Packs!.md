      <li>Love sleeping in them.</li>

      <li>With that being said - They were a little big, but I am thinking once I wash them they will fit great.</li>
      <li>I needed them for psoriasis and not only for moisturizing , but to cover my hands when I am working because I have pain/itching from just touching certain things.</li>
      <li>They are ridiculously well priced but the stitching and material are great.</li>
      <li>Would have liked them to be a little looser</li>
      <li>I wear a size large in regular gloves, and these fit well</li>
      <li>I am writing this because I am a guy and have larger hands and never have found any that fit the length of my fingers.</li>
      <li>contacted MayaBeauty (seller) and they are very promptly helping me..</li>
      <li>If the glove shown and described is no longer available the Seller should remove the listing and not just decide to send a different brand.</li>
      <li>She has mainly worn these overnight</li>
      <li>I ordered Large and received extra Large.</li>
      <li>The gloves cover the wrists and the cream seem to be helping, as much as any can on these 89 year old hands that have known nothing but abuse and hot sun in a dry climate.</li>
      <li>I ordered large, gloves are tiny (even though package indicates large) and without the long &amp;#34;cuff&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>These ones go a few inches past which is good because I use this specifically for bag balm which is super thick</li>
      <li>these gloves that they sent is NOT Long at all.</li>

    <li> Love these! I use them every night after applying lotions and oils to my hands. It prevents oil stains on my sheets and keeps my hands warm. Would recommend them to anyone. I plan to order more when they wear out.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my gloves, fit well,work for moisturizing my hands at night when I soak them with oil and put gloves on</li>
    <li> The gloves are perfect for wearing while driving, keeps the sun off my hands. The sun creates brown spots,&lt;br /&gt;the gloves are soft, easy to store in car door side pocket and easy to wash. I like having two pairs,</li>
    <li> Too thin and one slit in the fingers the first time I put them on my dad.  I wanted them to keep him from scratching himself.</li>
    <li> large but fit for what I need</li>
    <li> Good quality, I use them with medication for psoriasis, so they hold the medication in and keeps meds off the bed linens.  Will order more as they will likely need to be replaced after so many washings.</li>
    <li> Came and were wedding gloves, not what I exected or wanted.</li>
    <li> They were huge and stinky. I washed them and they shrunk to 1/3 size. WTF? The packaging said they were wedding gloves. Huh?</li>
    <li> Ordered 10/2 from Aiea, Hawaii received 10/9/13&lt;br /&gt;I look all over for these \\&quot;LONG GLOVES\\&quot;. I was so happy to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG...these gloves that they sent is NOT Long at all. It just ends at the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very Disappointed. I could of just purchase these \\&quot;short ones\\&quot; in the stores here.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;One size fit most\\&quot; it does have a good fit while new.&lt;br /&gt;I did get the \\&quot;buy on get one free\\&quot; received 2 pairs.&lt;br /&gt;$3.99 for gloves..$2.49 shipping &#x3D; $6.48&lt;br /&gt;I contacted MayaBeauty (seller) and they are very promptly helping me..I&#x27;ll keep you informed.</li>
    <li> Product received is not what is pictured in Ad.  I ordered large, gloves are tiny (even though package indicates large) and without the long &amp;#34;cuff&amp;#34;.  Subtotal for gloves was $7.98, shipping was $6.58, not worth returning.  I will not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> A great pair of gloves that do their job and do not fall apart like some other brands that i have purchased.</li>
    <li> The gloves I received were completely different than the gloves listed.  They were not a size L but, one size fits all.  Also, they are not 100% cotton.  They are also very small and short, barely coming up to the wrist on a woman&#x27;s hand.  After contacting Seller, a full refund was issued.  While I appreciate the refund, the Seller needs to change their listing to the correct information.  If the glove shown and described is no longer available the Seller should remove the listing and not just decide to send a different brand.</li>
    <li> Bought for a dialysis patient. Purchased several types/styles so she could find the ones that would be best. She has mainly worn these overnight</li>
    <li> These gloves are PERFECT for my needs. I wear a size large in regular gloves, and these fit well--they do go beyond my wrist. I use a medicated ointment for my hands at night, and these gloves cover so well that I NEVER have any greasy residue on sheets or blankets. Great product for a low price...thank you!!</li>
    <li> These will work well, but I expected the size large to be a little bigger then they were. Would have liked them to be a little looser so when I put on my cream and slide the gloves on, that they would not be pulling the cream off as I put on the gloves.</li>
    <li> These gloves were great for the price and what I was looking for as far as inexpensive and more than one pair!  The size I received was NOT the size I ordered. I ordered Large and received extra Large. With that being said - They were a little big, but I am thinking once I wash them they will fit great. Since they are cotton and are different than the other ones I have(spandex?) . I think I could bleach them and wash them as I like. The length was NOT the length shown in picture, BUT they are longer than any other gloves I have found so I was happy. I needed them for psoriasis and not only for moisturizing , but to cover my hands when I am working because I have pain/itching from just touching certain things. In that area of relief -these are perfect! very soft and breathable Excellent match for value/product ratio. I will probably buy more..</li>
    <li> I am writing this because I am a guy and have larger hands and never have found any that fit the length of my fingers. The other gloves never reached the web of my fingers and only went down to the wrist bone. These ones go a few inches past which is good because I use this specifically for bag balm which is super thick and I dont want getting into my sheets when sleeping at night. My boyfriend likes to tease me and call my lady violet when I wear them but they get the job done. They are ridiculously well priced but the stitching and material are great. I only hand wash them so I am not sure if they can survive machine washing or not. I am guessing they may but I havent wanted to risk it.</li>
    <li> The gloves cover the wrists and the cream seem to be helping, as much as any can on these 89 year old hands that have known nothing but abuse and hot sun in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> Bought these gloves to wear at night after applying hand cream.  They are light weight and comfortable.  They work great and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I use these gloves to sleep in for very dry skin.  Although they are advertised as &amp;#34;wedding gloves&amp;#34; that isn&#x27;t my purpose  for them.  I had tried lighter weight gloves &amp; found them inadequate &amp; they wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  AND, they are washable.</li>
    <li> I HAVE A VERY BAD PROBLEM WITH MY HANDS THAT CAUSES THEM TO JUST CRACK OPEN &amp; BLEED, THEY ARE VERY SORE ALSO!! WITH THIS CONDITION MY HANDS I HAVE TO WEAR THE WHITE GLOVES &amp; IF I AM GOING TO CHURCH &amp; SO FORTH I DON&#x27;T WANT TO TOUCH OTHERS WITH MY HANDS BLEEDING!! i AM VERY HAPPY THAT I FOUND THESE!!</li>
    <li> A little small. Too bad there isn&#x27;t lycra in them to help hold shape.</li>
    <li> Yes these gloves worked out just like i wanted. I especially liked the length of the gloves. And i would suggest the gloves to anyone that has a medical condition and has to wear them every night.</li>
    <li> I wear a size 9 glove and the large were perfect. I have psoriasis so I have to keep my hands moist.  Love sleeping in them.</li>
    <li> My partner says these are really good gloves.  She knows her gloves, so I think these are good for helping dry hands.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. I put hand lotion on, then the gloves. In a few hours my hands feel wonderful. Great price too!</li>
