      <li>Thanks Rusk chemists for making an awesome product!</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful but the cans apparently were defective.</li>
      <li>It works more as a holding spray</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for extensions but not for real hair.</li>
      <li>This spay is more like hairspray ..</li>
      <li>I love it, straightens hair much better, kinda reminds me of a starch for your hair.</li>
      <li>have been using this product for over a yr now and love it.</li>
      <li>I love it, but The spray never works until it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
      <li>I have never had more control over my hair than with this product.  </li>
      <li>Tresseme has a better protectant out there.</li>
      <li>I like Vavoom Gold Heat better</li>
      <li>I would recommend anyone that uses a flat iron to try this, it is the best!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the pricey brands, the cheap ones, but this one allows my hair to remain healthy and comfortably functional withstanding humidity and rubber-bands, etc.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick!</li>
      <li>Straightens and lifts my kinks and gives me a smooth style.  </li>
      <li>: take a section I plan to curl and comb it, spray it lightly, iron it, and repeat.</li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron spray I have found for fine, straight hair.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I shop Amazon because I am 100% confident in the authenticity of the salon products offered by Amazon sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m re-ordering right now!</li>
      <li>This works great and leaves absolutely no residue on your hair.  </li>
      <li>Could not use spray for that reason, threw out full bottle.  </li>
      <li>I never get my monies worth.</li>
      <li>I love the rusk because it a refined light mist that does not overly wet the hair as Redken or Chi spray does.</li>
      <li>Would very highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the Rusk flat iron spray atva great price I was looking for a protectant and was thinking about going with the Sebastian trilliant but stumbled upon this.</li>
      <li>I have tried soaking it in hot water, but that doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
      <li>products are great quality, but my hair is thick and on the coarser side.  </li>
      <li>It was the first product I&#x27;ve used, and I prefer it to anything I&#x27;ve tried since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this spray, especially at that price!  </li>
      <li>It leave your hair really sticky.</li>
      <li>But it also damages your hair more than any other hair spray.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product...</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend</li>
      <li>I sprayed on dry clean hair before straighten it</li>
      <li>I sound like a commercial - if only all products lived up to their marketing hype!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I sprayed it on my hair generously as I do with the Shine Spray -- you definately need to use the Flat Iron Spray sparingly.</li>
      <li>I live in a very humid area and have always been plagued by &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;, especially in the summer.  </li>
      <li>It just feels soft and sleek.  </li>
      <li>The second can still sprays (after about 2/3 weeks use) but it doesn&#x27;t spray very well.</li>
      <li>I have very wavy hair and need a product to use along with a flat iron.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m late to the party and only recently learned you can use a flat iron to make curls, gorgeous beachy, wavy, last-all-day curls.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other heat protectors since, and they aren&#x27;t style tools like this one, or they are specifically for making straight hair sleek or shiny  -</li>
      <li>The curls come out crazy-perfect and stiff, similar to what you might expect using hair spray and a conventional curling iron - but it&#x27;s so much more than that.  </li>
      <li>You will probably like this product if you have thin, fine hair.</li>

<li> First off I am African american with thick coarse hair chemically colored.</li>
<li> Flat Iron Spray, unlike the SHINE SPRAY, is heavier and sticky.  </li>
<li> The difference was that she was taking thinner pieces of hair for each application of spray and flat iron.  </li>
<li> I found the Thermal Flat Iron Spray for a cheaper price, BASED MY DECISION ON PRICE and tried it.  </li>
<li> :B0017R9K7Y Rusk Thermal Flat Iron Spray (8.8 oz)]]</li>
<li> and I wouldn&#x27;t consider using as you flat iron for protection.</li>
<li> I flat iron my hair</li>
<li> this product vs the shine spray (used on dry hair only) is that it can be used on wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> (but it&#x27;s a little bit more expensive).</li>
<li> Even when I used an extreme lesser amount, the second time around, it still left my hair feeling stiff and</li>
<li> It weighed my hair down and made it less managable -  not touchably soft.  </li>
<li> , I typically use RUSK SHINE SPRAY, which is a very similar product.</li>
<li> If you have thinner, less coarse hair, this may work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
<li> it was a total waste of my money</li>
<li> Admittedly, I did not try it by spraying it on my wet hair, which may have made a difference.  </li>
<li> And you usually only have to straighten each few strands of hair once.</li>
<li> spray retains my initial flat ironing efforts unlike any other product, and I mean ANY.</li>
<li> My hair seems healthier with this than with other thermal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t add shine and made hair dry and stiff</li>
<li> After blow drying my hair using Sebastian taming elixir I started from the back of my hair and parted thin pieces and sprayed each individual piece sparingly and then flat ironed from the root down pulling the ends of my hair as I flat ironed going down very slowly</li>
<li> This thermal spray protects your hair, but also acts a little bit like you used hairspray when using a curling iron (just a little bit).</li>
<li> It dried my hair out and made it hard, rough and frizzy.</li>
<li> very sticky spray makes it hard to pull iron through thick, coarse hair - makes me afraid of breakage.</li>
<li> I have extremely curly hair and thick hair.  </li>
<li> It does make your hair kinda stiff but as soon as you run your fingers through your hair or brush your hair</li>
<li> it is no longer stiff....</li>
<li> same starchy stick result...my hair smokes in a bad way when I run my flat iron through.</li>
<li> So I usually have all my hair straightened in about 10mins.</li>
<li> and when I grabbed pieces of hair to straighten it was crunchy hard</li>
<li> The product description was almost word-for-word the same, which confused me and made my decision about which to purchase difficult.</li>
<li> And I have really thick hair.</li>
<li> I have extremely thick hair that will do whatever I tell it to do...for a time.</li>
<li> The item was broken and would never spray when I opened it.</li>
<li> People ask me if I am wearing a wig...which is almost a bad thing...</li>
<li> Its really bad.</li>
<li> Very disappointing</li>
<li> Absolutely horrible quality of product as well as pavkaging.  </li>

    <li> Straightens and lifts my kinks and gives me a smooth style.  Have used it for a couple of years, and prevents burning my hair off even when used daily.  Can&#x27;t do my hair without it.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron spray I have found for fine, straight hair. It helps your hair hold in the iron not simply slip through.</li>
    <li> I love it, straightens hair much better, kinda reminds me of a starch for your hair. It does make your hair kinda stiff but as soon as you run your fingers through your hair or brush your hair it is no longer stiff....</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible quality of product as well as pavkaging.  The head broke almost at once. Could not use spray for that reason, threw out full bottle.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Pros: great humidity-proof control, ok smell (fruity). Cons: very sticky spray makes it hard to pull iron through thick, coarse hair - makes me afraid of breakage. I like Vavoom Gold Heat better (but it&#x27;s a little bit more expensive).</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair all the time because if I don&#x27;t, I look like a lion! I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair so I got this stuff and it works GREAT! So people talk about it being sticky, and it is, but what I do is I section my hair, spray a section, then brush my hair so it won&#x27;t be sticky. It still works! And you usually only have to straighten each few strands of hair once. So I usually have all my hair straightened in about 10mins. If that. And I have really thick hair. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The item was broken and would never spray when I opened it. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I shop Amazon because I am 100% confident in the authenticity of the salon products offered by Amazon sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I flat iron my hair, I typically use RUSK SHINE SPRAY, which is a very similar product.

The first time I used it, I sprayed it on my hair generously as I do with the Shine Spray -- you definately need to use the Flat Iron Spray sparingly. It was so laden w/the product that I actually washed my hair and started all over again.  Even when I used an extreme lesser amount, the second time around, it still left my hair feeling stiff and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one difference that you may like w/this product vs the shine spray (used on dry hair only) is that it can be used on wet or dry hair. Admittedly, I did not try it by spraying it on my wet hair, which may have made a difference.  Out of frustration, I threw it away and immediately purchased the Shine Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rusk products are great quality, but my hair is thick and on the coarser side.  I just don&#x27;t recommend this product for my hair-type.  If you have thinner, less coarse hair, this may work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0017R9K7Y Rusk Thermal Flat Iron Spray (8.8 oz)]]</li>
    <li> This spay is more like hairspray .. I sprayed on dry clean hair before straighten it and when I grabbed pieces of hair to straighten it was crunchy hard which is not what thermal spay I suppose to do ... I give it 2 stars because it is good for hair spray lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m late to the party and only recently learned you can use a flat iron to make curls, gorgeous beachy, wavy, last-all-day curls.  I read someone&#x27;s curl-with-flat-iron blog about this product and ordered it.  For heat protection, it was 100%, haven&#x27;t found anything like it - if your hair is damaged, or becomes damaged from heat styling, Rusk makes great products.  It is a styling product as well as a protector, so it might not be for everyone. It was the first product I&#x27;ve used, and I prefer it to anything I&#x27;ve tried since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it like this: take a section I plan to curl and comb it, spray it lightly, iron it, and repeat. The curls come out crazy-perfect and stiff, similar to what you might expect using hair spray and a conventional curling iron - but it&#x27;s so much more than that.  Then I use my fingers to separate and loosen the curls and they last all day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a softer look, I run a brush through the curls and they are IN THERE, not going anywhere, awesome hold!  Then I use a leave-in aragon oil to conditioner and define and shape the curls after brushing them out. I&#x27;ve used other heat protectors since, and they aren&#x27;t style tools like this one, or they are specifically for making straight hair sleek or shiny  - but I want curls so they don&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is superior for my flat-iron curls, no frizz, great definition, unbeatable hold...I sound like a commercial - if only all products lived up to their marketing hype!  I&#x27;m re-ordering right now! Thanks Rusk chemists for making an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this spray, especially at that price!  I would recommend anyone that uses a flat iron to try this, it is the best!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Rusk flat iron spray atva great price I was looking for a protectant and was thinking about going with the Sebastian trilliant but stumbled upon this.

    <li> I read online about this product it s supposed to be one of the best heat protectant  out there... Leaves your hair sticky. Tresseme has a better protectant out there.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
    <li> I have never had more control over my hair than with this product.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I love it, but The spray never works until it&#x27;s all gone. I always have to throw a bottle away and it still hasn&#x27;t emptied the can. I have tried soaking it in hot water, but that doesn&#x27;t work either. I wish someone would tell me if there is a solution for this problem. I never get my monies worth.</li>
    <li> This thermal spray protects your hair, but also acts a little bit like you used hairspray when using a curling iron (just a little bit). You will probably like this product if you have thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> For straightening hair great product! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair frizzy. I have extremely curly hair and thick hair.  Delivery was quick! 2 days!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair that will do whatever I tell it to do...for a time. People ask me if I am wearing a wig...which is almost a bad thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of my hair doing what I ask it to do for a time; It will do anything until humidity hits. And then it&#x27;s all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray retains my initial flat ironing efforts unlike any other product, and I mean ANY. I&#x27;ve tried all the pricey brands, the cheap ones, but this one allows my hair to remain healthy and comfortably functional withstanding humidity and rubber-bands, etc.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t add shine and made hair dry and stiff</li>
    <li> Love this product when straightening my hair!!</li>
    <li> I live in a very humid area and have always been plagued by &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;, especially in the summer.  My stylist was using this and it worked well.  When I tried it, it didn&#x27;t work as well.  The difference was that she was taking thinner pieces of hair for each application of spray and flat iron.  When I do the same it gets her results.  My hair seems healthier with this than with other thermal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of one thing...if it builds up on your floor,  this spray can make it slippery.</li>
    <li> I love the rusk because it a refined light mist that does not overly wet the hair as Redken or Chi spray does.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for over a yr now and love it. great purchase. will buy again. thank you</li>
    <li> Its really bad. It leave your hair really sticky. I don&#x27;t recommend it... I thought it was good. But it also damages your hair more than any other hair spray. contains a lot of alcohol. it smells like alcohol. don&#x27;t recommend it. it was a total waste of my money</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all. It dried my hair out and made it hard, rough and frizzy. It&#x27;s great for extensions but not for real hair. I had to wash it out immediately.</li>
    <li> This product was reasonably priced but is heavy on the hair.  It works more as a holding spray and I wouldn&#x27;t consider using as you flat iron for protection.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for me, however I will give this product to my sister to see if it works better for her!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful but the cans apparently were defective. After using the 1st can about 5 or 6 times it quit spraying. The second can still sprays (after about 2/3 weeks use) but it doesn&#x27;t spray very well.</li>
    <li> I have very wavy hair and need a product to use along with a flat iron.  This works great and leaves absolutely no residue on your hair.  It just feels soft and sleek.  Would very highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Have been using for years and will continue.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product...since I like the smoother conditioner...but Noo. I&#x27;ve tried combing it out..I&#x27;ve tried using it sparingly bit no...same starchy stick result...my hair smokes in a bad way when I run my flat iron through. It just doesn&#x27;t work. The end.</li>
