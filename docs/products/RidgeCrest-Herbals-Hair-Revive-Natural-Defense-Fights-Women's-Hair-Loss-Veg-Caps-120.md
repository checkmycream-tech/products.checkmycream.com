<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years now and can truly say that I have seen a change in the overall condition and growth of my hair.  I initially started using this product because I was taking quite a bit of medication that was making my hair fall out by the hand full.  I purchased this product with the hope that the hair loss would  stop.  It didn&#x27;t because of the medicine, but I have to say that I believe this product did promote the growth of new hair and made it grow twice as long as it originally was prior to taking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this product will work for other people with this problem, I can only say that it worked for me.  I have recently stopped taking some of the meds that took my hair out, and my hair has stopped falling out as much as it had been,  but I continue to use Hair ReVive because it  continues to work.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product  for close to two years and I love it. I keep it on hand all the time. I&#x27;m 58 and I geet lots of compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair is</li>
    <li> Perfect product! It solved all my hair losing problems.</li>
    <li> very happy with the great results. my hair it back to normal and is not falling anymore.&lt;br /&gt;recommend to all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m working on the third bottle of Hair Revive and honestly, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair.  It also gives me a bad taste in my mouth for about an hour after I take the pills.  This product may work better on other people.  It&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair Revive for about 6 months, so haven&#x27;t given it enough time to rate its success.  I&#x27;m a senior citizen, and have thinning hair and do believe it&#x27;s helping some.  I know for sure that my finger nails are liking it, as they are growing quite fast and are strong, so that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
    <li> great product…it works</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give the roduct a chance to work.  Used the bottle up and didn&#x27;t see any results so I didn&#x27;t reorder.  I should have kept using</li>
    <li> Priduct is great. Came on time and packaging was safe and undamaged</li>
    <li> Too much vitamin B cause my skin to break out :(. I had to discontinuous after one week of use</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous.  I had several bald spots and blamed it on my underactive thyroid.  My doctor really looked into the problem and found out that Celebrex was the culprit.  Stopped taking that, but my hair didn&#x27;t come back.  After spending a fortune on everything I could get my hands on, I discovered this product.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for about a year, and  not only do I have a full head of hair, it has grown back in really curly!!!!  I can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that.  By the way, my fingernails are great too!</li>
    <li> Am almost done with my first order, have not experienced any change.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this product! My second time ordering. It does take four to six weeks for you to notice any difference but it&#x27;s worth the wait. My hair was always super thick but after five babies so much fell out and kept falling out I was afraid it would all fall out.  After taking the pills in four weeks my curly youthful hair Started showing as new growth popped in. It also feels so much better to touch, healthier. Very very Happy! I did stop after used up two bottles big mistake I&#x27;m back on them since hair started falling out again.</li>
    <li> Not yet two months of pill taking as directed and my nails are almost all hard now (a few are not there yet). I am not shedding either like before and my hair growth since Nov 22 has been a inch and a half and it is Jan 13 now. I am still on the first bottle of my order. Started noticing a difference about three weeks into it.  My face looks younger too. I will order a refill.  Pills do taste gross.  My once long hard nails were bending easily before and my hair was shedding and hardly growing and have been getting worse in the last five years. I do take thyroid meds. I am on the four a day though right now. I will drop back to the two a day as directed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years for my hair.  It really is a great product and works well.  I didn&#x27;t have any of these vitamins for several weeks and noticed a big change in my hair volume, and it was constantly falling out.  My hair is very fine and thin, and this really helps give it volume and strengthen my hair.  I will continue to buy this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this vitamin for approx. 6 weeks and take the indicated amount, which is 4 pills a day.  I have noticed that I don&#x27;t lose as much hair especially  after showering.  Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has no more rosacea breakouts and my skin looks great.  A true miracle vitamin and I will not stop taking it!!</li>
    <li> I GREAT STUFF. WORKED IN THREE WEEKS. MY HAIR FELT FULLER, , BUT IF YOU STOP, YOU LOSE WHAT YOU GOT.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was losing my hair (due to menopause mostly) by hundreds of strands every day and devastated over it. I tried everything in shampoos, conditioners, etc. Then I found this product and after taking 2 caps twice a day for a month the excessive hair loss had stopped and not only was my hair shiny and healthy, my fingernails were in the best shape ever.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be working.  I hate pills so I switched to a shampoo/conditioner from the beauty supply store that seems to be giving me the same results.  The health food store in my town can&#x27;t keep this on the shelves.</li>
    <li> I was losing a lot of hair every day before I started using this product.  It&#x27;s been a month and I am losing about 1/4 the amount now, which is a huge improvement.  Hopefully, it will continue reducing the hair loss, but I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Directions say to go from twice daily to once daily after the first month.  Hair loss increased when I did this, so I went back to twice a day.</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing I have found for my hair.  No longer do I have to deal with thin, stringy hair.  It has made my hair fuller, stronger and longer.  I am a 59 years old African-American woman and if it works for me it will work for anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and have noticed less hair falling out but have not recovered my &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; hair thus far. I will continue in hopes that it will regrow</li>
    <li> I worked for a vitamin store for nine years and when this product hit our shelves I called the company and asked if my husband could use it.  I was told there was not any ingredient that would be harmful.  He has been using this product about one year and his hair has been growing.  He has to shave more then before but his hair is not thinning any more.  It is a great product and thank you.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd month of using the product. I had stopped losing my hair in the second month but this month a little more noticeable hair loss. Probably stress. I will continue using for now. I think my overall hair condition is better....I hope :)</li>
    <li> Nine months after ending chemo treatments for cancer I still didn&#x27;t have enough hair on top of my head.  I lost around 90% of my hair during treatment.  My cousin recommended this and after taking it for two months, I am happy to report that the hair came back in and I have more hair than before cancer.  I am delighted with this and encourage you to try it!</li>
    <li> My hair started falling out and I decided to try these. I since found that I had cancer and have been going through chemo. Even though there is nothing that cannot stop your hair from falling out during chemotherapy, I still have enough that I do not have to wear a wig yet. So either I&#x27;m incredibly lucky (probably not), or this has helped to at least slow the process? We&#x27;ll see. Three more months to go and I will faithfully stick to these during. One small warning: you will grow hair everywhere and not just on your head, but worth it.</li>
    <li> tried first early pm dose of 2capsules &amp; got a slight headache immediately, woke up from my sleep 12m and was up til 6am. tried am dose of 2tabs &amp; had terrible headache all weekend til Sun pm, had to cancel my weekend plans. I didn&#x27;t take any more &amp; wont. No side effects were listed, whats up with that?</li>
    <li> Love that the pills give you a boost of energy!! Will let u know in 6 week&#x27;s on the progress of growth!!</li>
    <li> I read all the other reviews for this item. I recently started losing my hair, a lot! Very upset by this, and have been under a lot of stress.  I wanted to find a supplement that would help me grow my hair back.  The jury is still out and I have been taking this product religiously.  I will give it two months and I do hope to see regrowth!!!  I will return with further feedback in a couple of months!!!  Oh...the capsules do have a slight odor, but not so strongly that it would turn you off enough not to take them.  I have also taken them on an empty stomach with no problems.  But hey, each of us are different!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for 4 weeks... says it needs 8 weeks to produce results... will try for another month and get back to you</li>
    <li> I feel like it really helped my hair grow</li>
    <li> Pills are huge.  Price is great!</li>
    <li> I was a vitamin skeptic, but my friend recommended this product so I figured i should give it a try. I am 37 and i started experiencing a heavy hair loss. I tried other vitamins, i also tried biotin and Rogain, none really worked. When i started using this product, i noticed change immediately. First, there was much less hair on my shower drain and my brush, but more importantly my hair was re-growing and unlike with Rogain, most of the new hair did not fall out after a month or two, but is still on my head. I would recommend sticking to the dosage instruction on a package. To the manufacture, I would recommend changing the image on the bottle - looks kind of cheap, but that&#x27;s just an opinion.</li>
    <li> So far I think it is working great. I just ordered my second bottle. I&#x27;ve had extentions for 7 years, and thought I could never take them out, because my hair is too thing and lacks volume. It&#x27;s been 6 months and I really can tell my hair got much thicker, stronger, healthier and longer. I will be much more consistent now, as I would just take it here and there before, and see the progress after another month or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for 8 weeks after experiencing several months of massive and very disturbing hair loss following a chemical relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shedding reduced significantly about 3 weeks in.  I have yet to see any notable extra growth, but I didn&#x27;t expect much in the short time that I&#x27;ve been taking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside (and one I am willing to live with) is the smell.  I routinely gag when taking these and wish they were more pleasant to taste.  Not a huge deal if they deliver desirable results but something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this as more time passes.</li>
    <li> I thought that, thinning hair was something that was inherited in my family. As the women got older they got thinning long stringy hair. I&#x27;ve consumed one bottle of this so far, and i got baby hairs growing and filling in. I actually see more hair and less scalp. I realize now, that is probably wasn&#x27;t the genes, it was nutrient deficiency for your hair. Now my mother wants to try this product and i ordered 2 bottles this time one for me and one for her. Thank you ...</li>
    <li> Hair revive is for my wife and she loves it. Before, when she washed her hair, she would lose quite a bit of hair. Now, with 2 Hair Revive capsules a day, she is happy because she doesn&#x27;t lose any. And when I place an order, the bottles get here very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months.  I have noticed a slow down in hair loss (due to aging).  It doesn&#x27;t grow hair, but I think it definitely slows down the thinning. I would recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair loss due to aging.</li>
    <li> I never noticed any improvement with my hair.</li>
    <li> good product, quick shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. So far no lessening of hair loss. If not I will search something else out.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw so many good reviews on this site.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second bottle and haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet.</li>
    <li> The best hair growth product on the market!</li>
    <li> love this product , helps my hair to grow and not fall out. this is my second bottle will buy again.</li>
    <li> This formula is one of a few I have tried that works.  I have always had thin hair but the &amp;#34;menopausal&amp;#34; thing has caused additional thinning.  It takes time but has helped my thinning hair thicken up a bit.  It took a couple of months to really see any results so be patient.</li>
    <li> I am very happy it does help me stop falling hair and also my hair is back to normal thick hair.  I personally recommeded.  I been using this product for 3 years  ..Customer...give 5 stars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy C</li>
    <li> Ladies, I was going through significant hair loss with spaces and gaps throughout the hair line. I hit a period of high stress and it caused the hair loss.  It took it a while but ALL are gone and filled in.  I ordered this product for more than a year.  If you are loosing your hair, you should try this one!!  Be a faith taker.  :)</li>
    <li> I wish I could have known about these hair vitamins long ago! I had long pretty hair &amp; because of hormones &amp; also my diet, my hair started falling out &amp; getting very thin. I didn&#x27;t have bald spots, but my pretty long hair wasn&#x27;t pretty anymore. It was long &amp; stringy a real mess. So I had to cut 10 inches off, it made me sick &amp; very sad too. I always got loads of compliments on my hair how pretty it was, then  the compliments stopped when It got so thin. I had tried all kinds of hair vitamins &amp; started eating healthier food, but nothing changed. Then one day I saw these vitamins, so I purchased them hoping for a miracle which I really never expected, but to my surprise I got that miracle! After taking these vitamins my hair completely stopped falling out! I was so happy, but then I noticed new hair starting to grow back in the places the other hair had fell out, &amp; it also started growing at a faster rate. That all happened about a year &amp; a half ago. Now I once again have long healthy shiny pretty hair, even better then before, &amp; my hair never has any problems anymore. I take these vitamins everyday &amp; will never be without them they are that great! These hair vitamins do what other hair vitamins don&#x27;t do, I really love them! If you really want your hair to be the best it can be, just try these vitamins, I know you won&#x27;t be sorry, &amp; you will love them &amp; love your hair too! Don&#x27;t even bother wasting your money on other hair vitamins that won&#x27;t work, these will work, you will be happy! It usually takes 4 to 6 weeks to start seeing results, I started seeing results after 3 1/2 weeks. It is a little different with everyone, but you will see results! :)</li>
    <li> I waited to write a review on this until I had something to report.  I kept checking on reviews for the product to see how long it took for people to see results.  Some people said they saw results in a week or two.  (Does anyone&#x27;s hair really grow that fast?)  I was getting pretty discouraged, but stuck with it, taking 4 pills a day faithfully.  I am just starting my 12th week, and I can finally say I&#x27;m seeing results!  My hair was falling out like crazy.  I&#x27;d have to sweep the bathroom floor every morning to get all the hair off the floor, and I continued to feel hairs fall onto my arms and back throughout the day.  Every time I combed my hair the comb would be full of hair.  I&#x27;m not getting nearly as much hair off the floor now, and am not noticing any stray strands falling during the day.  I&#x27;m also starting to see new growth; there are hairs about an inch long all around my hair line.  Areas where you could see bare scalp are starting to fill in now.  I&#x27;m thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who are suffering hair loss, I want to offer some other information I learned.  I take a thyroid supplement, and hair loss is a classic symptom of the thyroid being out of whack.  My thyroid levels tested normal with my medication, yet my hair was still falling out.  I found out that many people who take synthetic thryroid medication can test at normal thyroid levels, yet still experience symptoms of low thyroid.  I had my doctor switch me to another type (I think it&#x27;s from a pig?).  I just made that change, but hope it will start helping with the hair loss as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I learned is that if you have low vitamin D levels, your body can&#x27;t absorb calcium.  That can result in weak hair and nails, among other things.  Turns out I was low on calcium and vitamin D and now take a D supplement, which caused my calcium levels to go back to normal.  So that&#x27;s helping with the hair issue too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can&#x27;t explain your hair loss (no illness, surgery, stress, etc), have a doctor check your thyroid and vitamin D levels.  And don&#x27;t give up on the Hair Revive.  It DOES work, but may take a while.  I am going to drop to 2 pills / day at the end of this week.  BTW:  they smell kind of bad, so swallow quickly!  I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  A few more months have gone by, and I&#x27;m still taking 2 pills a day.  My hair loss is down to almost nothing - just a normal daily amount.  I don&#x27;t find hair on my clothing (from falling out during the day) anymore, and running my hands through my hair pulls out maybe 1 or 2 hairs at most.  My hair feels really soft, and I continue to get new growth.  So I&#x27;m a believer.  I don&#x27;t know if HR helps with skin as some people have reported.  I don&#x27;t have any particular skin problems aside from clogged pores.  However, I had a facial a week ago and the technician said I had beautiful skin and that there were only a couple of extractions needed.  I&#x27;ve never heard that before!  May be a coincidence, but who knows?  I&#x27;ll continue using this.is week.  BTW:  they smell kind of bad, so swallow quickly!

    <li> Love these hair vitamins.  If used as directed they will grow and maintain your hair especially during times of stress and/or hormonal imbalance.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 9 months and have an amazing head of long thick hair.  Started seeing a pattern of thinning hair in my crown and my cousin recommended this after a friend of hers found it successful in restoring her hair after chemo treatments.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for thinning hair.  I highly recommend it.  Whenever I stop taking them I immediately notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Really seems more like a placebo</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for years.  I had always had beautiful hair until my body started experiencing menopause, then my hair went ballistic.  It as thinning, falling out, and I was balding in spots.  I started wearing wigs and hats because I was so embarrassed.  Hair Revive to the rescue.  My hairstylist actually sold me the first bottle.  In two weeks, I saw a difference. The hair of my youth has returned, and so has my confidence.  Now I am working on returning the  body of my youth. LOL!  It is about 45% cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere I have ever been able to find it.  Wish I had searched for it here sooner!</li>
    <li> Not really sure if this works.  Have used for 2 months now and just cut back from 4 per day to two.  I think it may have stopped the thinning but no sure about regrowth.  My hairdresser says the thinning has stopped.  Capsules have a moldy smell which is a turnoff.  I will try one more month and then probably stop.</li>
    <li> I am about to celebrate my 21st birthday in a few days and i just recently had to cut my hair short because it is thinning too much.  I had long shiny golden hair and my hair started shedding rapidly overnight.  Dr says it&#x27;s a classic Telogen Effluvium case.  I can see my scalp easily on all parts of my head.  my hair is painfully thin and frizzy.  This is so horrible and traumatic.  Could not have occurred at a worst time than now before 21&#x27;st birthday.  I started this Hair ReVive regimen yesterday and this morning my mom said my hair looked shinier.  I will update next month (or before if something awesome happens).  I do know that Biotin breaks me out.  I won&#x27;t be surprised if I break out from this but I don&#x27;t really care anymore about that.  I want my hair back! feel free to comment on my review.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these before and they were fine, but the last bottle I ordered had the most horrible smell like they had gone bad.  I tried them for 2 days and then couldn&#x27;t take the smell any longer.  I think they may have sold me a bottle that had expired.  Not sure I would order again....</li>
    <li> I LOVE what Hair Revive has done for my hair! I have always had thin hair that doesn&#x27;t grow quickly. Thirty days after I started taking HR I noticed a significant difference in thickness of my hair. I also recognize that my hair was growing faster than it ever had before.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> I started using this about three months ago... it took about 6 weeks before i started seeing results, but my hair now is stronger, and doesn&#x27;t fall as much. Must say I&#x27;m also using other high-end hair products when it comes to shampoo, hair masks and such, but not using anything else that enhances hair growth or anything like that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with this and I will definitely continue using this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these pills. They are not only good for your hair, and nails but your overall well being. It does take time for them to work, they don&#x27;t work over night so don&#x27;t expect results right away. I have learned some pills work and some don&#x27;t work for others either. Biotin didn&#x27;t work that well on me but these worked pretty good. Also keep in mind as my hair dresser said you should use the bottle for 3 months because your body gets use to them. Take a break and then return using it again....Overall, this is a great purchase for a great price!</li>
    <li> The capsules are nasty tasting and you have to take 4 of them a day.  My hair loss is due to menopause and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin for a month, instead of 4 pills a day I&#x27;m taking 2.  My hair is shedding less, but I&#x27;ve noticed my nails are growing faster and are stronger.  I&#x27;m hoping these vitamins will help stop my hair from falling and increase the growth, I will continue taking them, hope to see better results.</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS.  About 10 years ago when I was around 30 I noticed my already fine hair thinning out.  I had decided to purchase this product at Seattle Super Supplements after their clerk told me she&#x27;d gotten excellent feedback from other customers.  I started taking it as prescribed and within 2 month I started seeing a marked difference.  The little hairs around my face were filling in and the strands all over felt thicker.  The validation came when a friend came over to my house and as soon as she walked in the door her first words were, &amp;#34;Your hair is thicker!&amp;#34;  My hair tends to thin out during times of high stress, so I&#x27;ve gone back to this product a few times over the years, and it really does work, with NOTICEABLE results every time.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write review but I already ordered my second bottle today. I&#x27;ve been taking this product for a month and I noticed my hair isn&#x27;t falling so much anymore. I also noticed new hair growing. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and going to continue purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin for hair I&#x60;ve ever tried. My hair was thinning because of illness and medication. After taking it for a few days I began to have a feeling of well being. After a few weeks my nails became super strong. After a few months my hair was not only strong but growing quickly. They do give me heartburn if I don&#x60;t take them  with a meal. The pills do have a herbal smell but they are not huge and they are easy to swallow. No pill is going to give overnight results so be patient. Give it at least 3-4 months. I&#x60;ll take these forever (if the price doesn&#x60;t keep increasing)</li>
    <li> Мне 44 года. В последнее время шевелюра на голове не радует своей густотой. Может стрессы,гормональные изменения или от того что гормоны щитовидки слегка повышены.Я заказывала две баночки,принимала по инструкции и о,чудо,волосы стали более здоровыми,густыми,блестящими. Однозначно,буду брать еще.</li>
    <li> I know these work because when I stopped taking them so did my hair growth and the thickening!  Great product - the special part is the biotin - I grew hair fast with half the dosage!  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have found and seen results from! I am 46 and suddenly started losing my hair! I have always had long, full, beautiful hair! It was falling in handfuls which was very scary! My vacuum roller was full! Started using this product 3 months ago and saw results in a matter of a couple weeks. I no longer have excessive hair loss. I have tons of new hair coming in and in a very short period of time. My hair is fuller, stronger, and no longer feels as dry. I am also seeing great results in my nails and skin...I would highly recommend this product and I will be taking this everyday!</li>
    <li> This is one item that really, really works.  It stopped my hair from falling out within 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everybody with also a daily B-Complex 100.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using this product for almost two months now and it&#x27;s actually working for me. For the first time in years my hair is  not only growing where it had fell out but its actually coming in thicker. I will continue to use Hair Revive to reach my desired results.</li>
    <li> Amazing, they do work!! I was loosing a lot of hair, don&#x27;t know the reason but i decided to give this product a chance and, Only 1 bottle and I see a lot of baby hair coming out!...Yes some hair still falling but less than before. I ordered my 2nd bottle !! Also using biotin shamboo with fresh aloe vera on it.</li>
    <li> This is really really effective stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, &amp; have one in storage! I love RidgeCrest, &amp; totally believe in their products so when I found these I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them. I only gave it 4 stars because I want to see how the next 2 bottles go! I definitely see a big difference in hair growth, &amp; the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> Really helped in the past but I stopped using it. Waiting to see how it does this time around.</li>
    <li> These Tablets are the best that I have found among other hair products. They maintain the condition of the hair, but it&#x27;s not magic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going on my third bottle of this stuff and it&#x27;s hard to tell but I think it is helping to stop the hair loss I am experiencing. I am 25 yrs old and I think the loss is due to stress since my doctors offered no other explanation. I think this product is worth a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  While it&#x27;s marketing is geared towrds hair growth, the greatest benefit for my mother and myself has been nail hardness and growth.  I think it has also improved the thickness of my hair, but the nails are looking real good.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS MY HAIR IS GETTING THICKER AND IT ISNT FALLING OUT</li>
    <li> I love these vitamins! Great results.</li>
    <li> I have been taking these vitamins along with using Revita Shampoo and Conditioner and it has worked in stopping my hair loss and even thickened up my hair.  I have been very happy taking these capsules.</li>
    <li> did not perform as expected</li>
    <li> While at a local health food store, I asked what they had for thinning hair. The clerk said she has several customers that sware by this product! So, I started my first bottle and before I finished it (and without prompting), my hair stylist said, \\&quot;your hair is getting thicker!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months and months of trying other manufacturers, I am ordering my second month today! Thank you Hair ReVive and I hope others receive the same benefits!!</li>
    <li> FIRST LET ME SAY I ONLY GAVE A FOUR STAR RATING SINCE I&#x27;M NOT SURE WHICH PART OF MY NEW REGIMINE TO THANK.  HOWEVER, I DID ORDER 2 MORE BOTTLES YESTERDAY.  I&#x27;M 62 YEARS OLD AND CERTAONLY WELL PAST MENOPAUSE.  I HAD BEEN DEALING WITH THINNING HAIR FOR QUITE SOME TIME, TO THE POINT THAT I WAS AFRAID TO RUN A BRUSH THROUGH MY HAIR FOR FEAR OF WHAT WOULD END UP IN THE BRUSH.  FINALLY I DECIDED TO TAKE MATTWERS INTO MY OWN HANDS AND DO SOME RESEARCH (THE COMPUTER IS A WONDERFUL THING) SINCE I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO BE SUCKED INTO A \\&quot;MIRACLE\\&quot; CURE.  WITH THE INFORMATION I GATHERED I HAVE SWITCHED TO ORGAIC SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER I FOUND HERE AT AMAZON WHICH IS NO MORE EXPENSIVE THAN YOUR AVERAGE PRODUCT.  I INVESTED IN A GOOD BORE BRISTLE  BRUSH, I USE MY OLD HAIR BRUSH FOR STUBBORN SPOTS ON THE CARPET!  I TAKE MY REVIVE CAPSULES FAITHFULLY AND BRUSH MY HAIR WELL MORNING AND NIGHT MUCH TO MY DELIGHT I NOW HAIR NORMAL DAILY HAIR LOSS.  I KEEP MY HAIR RATHER LONG SO I CAN WEAR IT UP AND OUT OF MY WAY WITH LITTLE TIME SPENT.  I MENTION THIS ONLY BECAUSE I WAS CONSTANTLY CLEANING THE ROLLER BRUSH OF MY VACUUM OF WOUND UP LONG HAIR, THAT CHORE IS NEXT TO GONE.  NOW LET ME, SAY I HAVE BEEN DOING THE AFORE MENTION FOR LESS THAN THREE WEEKS!  I WILL DEFINITELY CONTINUE WITH THIS PRODUCT SUPLIMENTED WITH AND EXTRA BOOST OF MAXMUM STRENGTH BIOTIN.  I CAN HONESTLY SAY WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR NOT TO MENTION CONFIDENCE.  I WORK OUT AND SO I&#x27;VE STAYED THIN AND CAN WEAR THE CLOTHES I LOVE BUT, IF YOUR UNCOMFORTABLE WITH YOUR HAIR WHAT&#x27;S THE POINT.  JUST MY LONG WINDED STORY HOPE IT HELPS SOMEONE.</li>
    <li> My hair basically stopped growing for several years. My neighbor recommended this and after just 10 days I could tell a difference in the thickness of my hair and now after a month I see a difference in length too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been usine this product for over a year and have found that I have less hair loss and am beginning to notice a bit more strength. My hair is baby fine.  I have also notice new hair growth. It is important to take more than one time a day.</li>
    <li> I have been through a great deal of stress and my hair started to fall out. I have tried several \\&quot;hair type,\\&quot; vitimins but nothing worked. Then I tried this product and I have noticed a real differenc within just a few weeks. My hair really slowed down when it was falling out at a pretty steday rate. I will use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynn</li>
    <li> Excellent service, fast shipping, easy transaction. This product seems to help reduce hair loss and definitely helps my nails grow. We&#x27;ll see. A+++ seller</li>
    <li> So I started using this product months ago, had minimal hair shedding. I was always concerned if it was too much or normal.  I forgot to order this product last fall and stopped taking for a few months. I noticed more shedding in the shower and wondering what could be causing it.  I thought maybe it was the time of year, but it kept on for a couple months.  I finally realized I stopped taking this pill!  I quickly reordered more, and guess what, the shedding slowed down again after 2 weeks of being on it!  My nails are good on this product too.</li>
    <li> i used this product for one month and did not notice any change in regrowth of hair. i had started to loose alot of hair about 9 months ago, realized it was just hormonal but thought this would encourage growth, didnt notice anything.</li>
    <li> I just recieved and started yesterday. I read reviews that say the pills smell. My capsules do not smell at all. I am wondering if i have been tricked and not recieved the real pills. Can anyone comment if the pills smell. or they produce a smell in your breathe after taking them.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd bottle of Hair Revive and today no hair came out on the counter when i brushed my hair. I also quit taking vitamins with Selinium in them (it can cause hair loss).  I can see new hair growth on my scalp. I am not sure if it is the Hair Revive, the new vitamins or both which are contributing to the new hair growth and hair not falling out but i am  so happy!</li>
    <li> I do not like the label ,this face . but i do like the product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this pill for about a week. My concern is the weight gain. have anyone gain weight from taking this pill?</li>
    <li> I store the bottles in the refrigerator, and a month later they were moldy. I am very frustrated, because I think this is one of the items that is supposed to work well for women&#x27;s hair loss. But I just can&#x27;t take moldy capsules.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a temperature controlled environment and I don&#x27;t live in a hot part of the United States, so I don&#x27;t know what went wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase price.</li>
    <li> RidgeCrest Herbals Hair Revive Is Awesome. The natural defense fights women&#x27;s hair loss is Absolutely Amazing. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I began taking these Mar. 9th. I am an American Black with moderate hairloss. I have a diagnosis of scarring alopecia after a biopsy, but I&#x27;m questioning that because of regrowth.. I follow a mostly ayurvedic routine for hair care, supplemented with commercial products. This is the first supplement I have taken and I am following directions to the letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use henna for its conditioning properties every 90days. My hair is naturally dark brown with a small amount of gray strands. I have previously classified my hair as slow to grow after monitoring my growth rate for two years..but after my latest henna use 3-4wks ago, I have AT LEAST a quarter inch of growth. I can measure the growth because the strands I&#x27;m monitoring have henna deposits that cause them to appear bright orange but as they grow the grey color is visible from the scalp. That may not mean much for your hair, but for my type 4b/4c, VERY KINKY, VERY COILY, breakage prone curls, that.is.awesome.  I have never noticed growth so soon. Usually I can&#x27;t measure because my very fine hair is so easy to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only new item in my regimen are these pills. I take two after a midday meal and two after dinner. I try to consume foods that help the supps absorb. I&#x27;m also on a weight loss journey and I haven&#x27;t had any weight gain, only continued loss. I don&#x27;t notice much of a taste when swallowing these pills, and no after taste at all. I am much appreciative of the capsule. It goes down easily for me. I think its size 00. The pills smell mildly herbal, but nothing that permeates or induces gagging for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to order my 2nd bottle and I will continue 4 a day. I will update once that bottle is complete. My plan is at least 90days on 4 a day. Four stars because the pills don&#x27;t have msm and another hair goodie I can&#x27;t remember, but seems to be common in other supps. I will edit this once I remember which...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Still taking these. I like to take them with food. They make me feel less heavy in the chest that way. I think the heaviness is from the \\&quot;Chinese Herbal Hair Complex.\\&quot; It doesnt alarm me but sets in about thirty minutes after I take them and leaves me feeling heavy (or full like after a big meal) for about 20mins after. Sometimes I forget to split the dose so I have been taking four at once. On my third or fourth order now. I like them and will continue to purchase. I will continue to take four a day until I get my \\&quot;desired results\\&quot; as the bottle says. I dont straighten my hair so its hard to see length results, but my hair does not shed nearly as much as it used to, even during this hot summer, and I have new growth hairs everywhere. Also my strands are very strong and can stand up to cleansing sessions better. I take MSM separately for my hair&#x27;s beauty. Still four stars since no MSM in Hair Revive.ey make me feel less heavy in the chest that way.

    <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old female with fine/thick hair that usually grows pretty fast. However, over the past couple of months I began to notice A LOT of my hair was shedding during the day, every time I brushed it, and especially in the shower. Then I saw I started to get almost bald spots in the front of my hair line and along where I part my hair. I was devastated and scared not knowing what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research online I started to take krill oil and these pills and WOW, what a difference. My hair is looking shiny, less is falling out, and I see new hair filling in where it was starting to thin. In my personal case its been under two weeks! I also have more energy and feel a lot better. The B vitamins in this formula may turn your urine a bright yellow&#x27; but that&#x27;s completely normal for a water soluble vitamin (the excess is excreted in your urine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this will help others as much I see that its helping me. (I recomend going to a doctor if it doesn&#x27;t, hair thinning can be a symptom of other more serious health problem).</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and is as described in the posting.</li>
    <li> a great supplement, you have to take it regularly to see results. Its the only supplement besides vitamin D that I need. It has everything in it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tried and true product.  Would recommend to anyone who wishes to improve hair, nails and skin.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for two months now. I take two tablets in the morning and two at night as directed. I can see a lot of new hair coming in on top of my head. The gal that does my hair indicated I have a lot of new hair growth all over. Great product and it really does work. I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> well i bought the pills and started using it for like 2 days but then one of my friends told me that hair loss pills might help you get your hair back, but it will also help u gain weight faster. i didn&#x27;t believe it at first, i mean there is no way vitamins will cause weight gain. so i googled vitamins and weight gain and read a lot of threads about people gaining weight because of vitamins. i struggled with weight my whole life and managed to lose it, i don&#x27;t wanna gain any back, but at the same time i wanna get my hair back. my question is to the people who tried this for months. did you notice any weight gain? i really wanna take the pills but i&#x27;m also scared :(</li>
    <li> I have been using these vitamins for about 2 weeks now.  I wear my hair in a ponytail and use gel so my  hair doesn&#x27;t fall out every day but it does so at the end of the week when I am ready to wash it.  I have to report that even though it is now Friday my hair is not falling out in the amount that it used to.  I have taken it for granted that some hair fall is acceptable but I see now that there is a big difference in the amount.  My facial skin is also benefiting as my skin feels smooth and clear.  I have been using other brand of vitamins but they were not capsulated as these are which is my preference.  With the other vitamins my hair was still falling out.  So I have to say that I am so far pleased with the results.  There is no offensive smell and the capsules are easy to swallow also they do not repeat on me as some vitamins would.  There is no question that what you eat is also very important and if your diet is not good no amount of vitamins will help.  I would say these vitamins are worth the try.</li>
    <li> This is my second time around using this product.  You have to stick with it like anything else to see results.  I am 4-months into using this daily regimine and I have fuzz where there was none.  This product seems to work the best because it dose not contain any stimulating ingredients and again, I am seeing some hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> So far there has been no improvement in hair restoration, but it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t been quite two months yet, so the improvement may still come.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I have been using it for about two months now and have used it before and stopped, but I have stuck with it this time.  My hair has grown quite a bit and is very healthy, shiny and manageable.  I think Hair Revive is responsible for some of the credit but I also use IHT9 shampoo and conditioner for hair loss and this stuff is great.  So between the 3 products I am getting pretty good results.  I had alopecia and they seem to be keeping it under control.  My friends are amazed because they saw me when I had loss my hair and had to result to wigs.  Now I have a full head of hair.  I just hope it is permanent because with Alopecia it could possibly return anytime.  I just wanted to mention I have just started to get a mild headache when I take the two capsules morning and afternoon so I am going to cut back to one in the morning and one in the afternoon and see if that eliminates the headaches.  All in all I am quite satisfied.with the results so far.  I continued to take the Revive as I stsated earlier, but hsad to stop because it caused considerable gas and bloasting.  I had to make sure it was the Revive because I was taking a few other nutrients. It made me let off gas constantly and it hurt to try to hold the gas in.  I am glad I found out it was the Revive. I plan to return it soon.</li>
    <li> It is helping to keep hair from falling out.</li>
    <li> In 2010, a coma and septic pneumonia resulted in, among other things, the loss of thickness in my hair. In 2012 I started using this product with fidelity (four capsules a day). I&#x27;ve been using ReVive now for nearly two years and there is so much new growth in my hair that it won&#x27;t even lay flat in some places! I&#x27;ve recommended this product to friends and they love it as well! A good friend of mine has had thin hair for as long as she can remember. She&#x27;s on her second bottle of ReVive and her family has commented on the increasing thickness of her hair!  My one piece of advice is to use two bottles of this product before you really start seeing results. Don&#x27;t be impatient....the growth will come!</li>
    <li> Although these may work for some folks, it did nothing for me.  I used it for the recommended period..which is hard for me to do, but alas nothing. As with all products of this nature its just a matter of finding what product works for you.  Good luck, I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> waiting to see with hair growth.</li>
    <li> So far I have not seen any results, but I have taken these capsules for a month only.  If I don&#x27;t see the slightest improvement in one more month, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this product. I have taken just one veg cap and regugitated it all day. It tasted moldy to me, though the expiration date on the bottom cleary has not past. I may try it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Before I started using Hair Revive 5 my hair felt thin and lifeless,  not to mention it fell out in handfuls in the shower:-( I was devastated , I literally cried everyday. I must have spent 1,000s of dollars on other products, vitamins, miracle serums ect. I found Hair Revive in a health food store priced at $50.00! But i bought it anyways, and it worked! it took time but there is a definite difference in the texture and thickness of my hair. I found it on Amazon for 1/2 the price I was paying !!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier, and the shipping is always super fast</li>
    <li> Hair Revive has most definitely made a difference in the amount of hair loss I&#x27;ve experienced.  I rate this product very highly because it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> It was a very good 😊. I really like it it gives my hair big difference and lot of benefits like tall and shine</li>
    <li> These vitamins are amazing! I was distressed over all the hair on my comb and loose strands on my arms and shoulders. After 1 month I can totally see my hair loss has diminished. The only down side is in the beginning HR caused my stomach to feel gassy and bloating. Taking these on an empty stomach helped. A must buy for hair loss!!!</li>
    <li> I was losing my hair due to a hormonal imbalance, and found this product--and all of its great reviews (thank you fellow Amazon buyers)--here on Amazon.  I am very happy to tell anyone who&#x27;s also considering buying it that it does work.  I&#x27;ve had my hair thicken and some of the hair grow back as well.  But you&#x27;ll have to take it for a while before seeing results--it&#x27;s been six weeks so far for me and I&#x27;ve taken four capsules a day.  Well worth it.  I&#x27;m so relieved!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited 4 months of taking this product before leaving a review so I would truly know whether it works or not. I&#x27;m 30 years old and my hair has been thinning out on the back of my head due to health issues and medication. My hair was thinning so much I was worried I would have a bald spot if I let it go on much longer. I chose this product because it was all natural and claimed to work quickly while other chemical products take many months to start working. Within 7 weeks of taking 4 pills a day I noticed my almost bare scalp felt prickly which told me that new hair was starting to grow. Now 4 months later my balding area has filled in with new hair growth and I no longer feel uncomfortable about people seeing or noticing my thinning hair. I now take 2 pills a day instead of 4 and continue to see the same progress.  This really is an amazing product! I doubt there is anything else out there that works this good and fast!</li>
    <li> Best hair vitamins I have ever purchased and will purchase again!! I&#x27;m not loosing hair, I just wanted to improve its condition (got a little heavy on the hair dye for a few years). Made my hair grow super fast to the point that people were commented on the length of my hair in two weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product; great customer service!  It does help grow hair.  Hair needs biotin and there is a lot of it in the product.</li>
    <li> Just bought this product out of a huge suggestion from my hair stylist, and the thing is I didn&#x27;t realize it until it arrived that it&#x27;s for WOMEN! ha.  Yeah, I&#x27;m a male and was WONDERING if anyone on here A. is a male that&#x27;s used this product or B. knows if the \\&quot;hormone balancing complex\\&quot; is something I - a male - shouldn&#x27;t be taking?! My hairstylist seemed to say it was fine, but why not ask Amazon users to find out further.  Thanks !</li>
    <li> Taking this most assuredly helped my hair grow faster - absolutely everywhere.  However, my hair has always grown quickly.  What I needed was something to help fill in the areas where it had thinned due to some medical issues.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do this.  While I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who is wanting faster-growing hair, to the point where the natural rate of growth is even doubled, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this as a treatment to alopecia.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair revive for almost a year. My hair is fuller and healthier. It&#x27;s growing at a moderate pace. My hair sheds less as well. I&#x27;m happy with the product and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. I have tried millions of vitamins for hair, this is by far the best. My hair was falling and breaking a lot, was dull and dried, and was not growing at all. Im on my second bottle already because I dont want to stop using it. I saw a lot of benefits with it; such as, no more falling or breakeage of hair, my hair actually grew an inch in one month, and feel my hair young and alive!!! I am very satisfied with the product. I recommended it to my daughter and friends. I  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Hair did not have as much loss</li>
    <li> I use this and it seems to help.....</li>
    <li> Amazing, who could have every guessed this product would work so well.  I was at the hair salon asking my stylist if there is anything I could do about the visable balding on the top of my head.  I have asked before and he had no suggestions.  Today one of his customers still in the shop reported she tried a product and her hair grew back.  She had a picture of the bottle on her phone, and told me where to get it.  I started the product that week and within 6 weeks I started to notice my head was itching.  I felt my scalp and noted the itching was due to new growth all over my scalp.  I have been on the product for 4 months now.  I did cut down to 1 capsule two times a day, but went back up to the 2 two times a day as the decrease in dose reduced the amount of new growth.  After increasing the dose to two caps two times a day the new growth started again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a person who is extremely skeptical when it comes to supplements that reportedly produce results and normally don&#x27;t even try them.  My hair was so thin I had to try something, tried this and was simply amazed.  Everyone around me asks and has bought the product.  Oh, and of course after the first bottle I went to Amazon and now buy it for half the price I paid in the store.</li>
    <li> Have only been taking for one month... I haven&#x27;t yet seen a difference, but am hopeful that I will with a little more time</li>
    <li> I have less hair than when I started taking this about four months ago. At first I grew a few new scraggly hairs at my hairline and then nothing.</li>
    <li> I got this product for one of friend, she was losing the hair everyday, i got this pills for her, and since she was using it she got more grow hair, and her loss was minimum.  The only concern is once the finish the bottle you starting losing hair again but at least you got new hair too.  Let see after her second bottle...</li>
    <li> I noticed a widening in my hair wherever I parted it. I began a search for supplementation to help with this and came across many options. I tried several. Out of all the various products available, I keep returning to this one. Initially, I take four capsules per day, divided, then switch to two per day once the hair thickens. It works when used regularly as it is cumulative. Would not be without it.</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out and I bought this product. Ever since then the falling out has decreased dramatically. I love it.</li>
    <li> I take 4 of these a day. I am now into my second bottle and have seen zero difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using chemical shampoo and conditioner. I changed to Wen cleansing conditioner, Wen SixThirteen treatment, Rene Furterer Thin Hair Treatment and will be starting to use John Masters Organic shampoo and Deep Scalp Follicle Treatment &amp; Volumizer as soon as it gets here (I&#x27;ve just read some really bad reviews for the Wen hair system, so I&#x27;m going to stop using it). I&#x27;ve also tried Castor oil/Jojoba oil scalp treatments. I stopped chemically coloring my hair and use Henna, Amla and Herbatint ONLY. I will never use chemicals on my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take Biotin, fish oil and Hair Revive (among other supplements). I&#x27;ve been taking these since October and with these and everything else I have been doing for my hair loss, I see no improvement and it may even be worse. Not only have these not worked, THEY TASTE AWFUL. REALLY, REALLY awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a lot of supplements and out of them all, this is the only one that has a taste (VERY BAD TASTE) and makes me gag. I can taste the ingredients through the thin capsule. I&#x27;ll probably finish the last bottle just because I hate wasting things, but will more than likely not buy these again. If they worked, I&#x27;d force myself to take them despite the horrid taste, but as far as I can tell, they do nothing for my hair loss - Your mileage may vary, but I wanted to tell my story which does vary from the 4/5 star reviews (which is why I bought it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely leave 1 or 2 star reviews, but I felt this product didn&#x27;t deserve more from me. You will have to decide if you want to spend the money and see if it works for you. I wish you much luck and hope it does.</li>
    <li> This product might work for some, but not for me.  I have been taking biotin for years, and I thought to make a switch.  I think I will just stick with my high potency biotin pill.  I didn&#x27;t read close enough I guess, but these are fairly large capsules.  They smell bad, and are not that easy to swallow.  On top of that you need to take 4 a day! That is a lot in my opinion.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always noticed that my hair is slow to grow and would tend to have lots of hair fall out of the shower. I&#x27;ve been taking this for the last four weeks and just ordered my second bottle.  I&#x27;ve noticed the my hair isn&#x27;t falling out in clumps when I shampoo and less is accumulating on my brush. My hair is a little thicker and I&#x27;m hoping that I will see new growth coming in in the next few weeks.  I didn&#x27;t expect the most amazing results but with realistic expectations I can see that it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff my hair has been growing back in it is getting thicker</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking 4 of these a day for 3 months and I do feel like my hair has not been falling as much as it was before taking it. I feel that it has made my hair grow almost double as fast as it was before. (About 3/4- 1 inch in a month now) The thing is with this product is that people expect a miracle pill that will grow your hair a foot long in a month. No, it does not do that. But it will make your new growth hair much healthier and fuller feeling. Doing daily scalp massages also helps with the blood flow in the scalp to stimulate growth which i&#x27;ve been doing as well. Overall, I would get this product again and recommend it to people with hair loss/thinning hair. But you do have to be patient with it and you won&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
    <li> Idk if it is helping although I have gone through 2 bottles,which is the recommended full 2 months.  I will buy another bottle, just for good measure, although I don&#x27;t want o rely on this forever as it is expensive.</li>
    <li> This really works.  I could not believe how thick my hair got especially at the temples.</li>
    <li> Had a major hair shed after a stressful event and thyroid problems. This supplement made a huge difference. I also took a GLA/ omega 3 supplement that helped the dry skin and hair issues.</li>
    <li> I really think this product is helping to thicken my hair.  I have very fine thin hair so I purchased this product to help thicken and grow my hair.  I&#x27;m finish taking one bottle and can see improvement already.  I will continue taking them to see how thick my hair will get.  I gave it four stars because I still have one more bottle to take......they sent two bottles.</li>
    <li> I noticed that hair loss is getting less than before but not that obviously. Also it did bother my sleeping while I taking it everyday</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair Revive for about 4 months after losing the majority of my hair to a hormone prescribed by my doctor.  I was skeptical about ever seeing my thick hair again.  It took about 3 months before I saw a difference in the volume of my hair.  Not only is it thicker, but it&#x27;s grown a lot too.  My hair is at a length I like, but I&#x27;ll continue to use the product to maintain healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this supplement for about 5 months and my hair is still falling out the same so not sure if it will help or not, going to take it for a year to give it a chance.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but have not seen any improvements in hair growth, length or thickness.  No new hair growth either.  After using for more than 2 months now, it is safe to say that this product does not work.</li>
    <li> Fantastic deal! I bought four bottles. You can take four capsules per day in divided doses for two months, and then cut back to two capsules per day for maintenance. Hair will look and feel shinier and fuller and seems to reduce falling hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product because several of my friends have used it and have had amazing results.  I&#x27;ve tried it for several months now and there isn&#x27;t any difference</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and believe it helps with thinning hair. This is the first time I bought off Amazon and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> It work but need time&lt;br /&gt;I like that products</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use the product.</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading numerous reviews here,had high hopes for it.used religiously for over 3 weeks, had to stop since got very dry &amp; brittle nails...no change in hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Now, since stopped more than 1 mnth...my nails are looking good again...beware for ingredients...not sure whats in this.</li>
    <li> Purchased these vitamins because they were recommended for hair growth.  They made me very sick.  I experienced pain along my arms and chest when I took them.  Pain stopped when I stopped taking these vitamins.</li>
    <li> I doubled the recommended dosage and used this for 2 months and I did not see any difference in my hair, in either thickness or growth.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change after 8 weeks.. Also product smells like sawdust--yuck! (why is there a min word limit for reviews?)</li>
    <li> I have always had a healthy head of hair but after surgery I was loosing it by the handful.  My hair dresser recommended I try this, and even told me the best buy was on Amazon.  I trust her allot so.... got it.  Loved it and was amazed I could see that it was working in less then two weeks.  I stopped losing hair at the rate I was, and returned to normal by the end of the month.</li>
