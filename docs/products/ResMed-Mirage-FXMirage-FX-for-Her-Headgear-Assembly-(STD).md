    <li> The last two items supposed to be delivered on November 26 were not delivered so far. I am worried because I will leave next Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manoel Costa</li>
    <li> The picture showed this as pink and it was delivered gray.  Also it says for her, and the headgear is so large, it falls off.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Perfect, just like the original.</li>
    <li> good head piece easy to assemble and adjust. I have been very happy with this head set..it&#x27;s the only one that fits. Plus it&#x27;s weight</li>
    <li> The quality is good, no issue with ResMed products. The problem is, it is HUGE. I had to &amp;#34;take it up&amp;#34; about an inch and a half on each strap and safety pin it. Once I was sure of the length, I machine sewed it to keep the pins from popping open in the night.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is designed to do. It holds my cpap mask in place.</li>
    <li> I find this head gear a little uncomfortable it puts press on the back of my skull because of how it is sowed.</li>
    <li> I love this worked great .A better price</li>
    <li> These do not last longer than a year.  I need it so I have to buy it.  its ok- does the job.</li>
    <li> Bought a Standard size but I have it tightened about as much as it goes and think I would have been better with a Small.  Fits comfortably although I prefer the snaps on my previous headgear to the velcro loops on this one.  They have come dislodged a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Perfect match to what my health care provider furnished but 1/3 the cost!!! Amazing how much of a rip off insurance is these days, and thanks to the &amp;#34;Affordable Car Act&amp;#34; everything is 3 times more expensive now.  This was literally 1/3 the cost of what it would be to get from my Dr&#x27;s office!!!</li>
    <li> Love this headgear.  Hard to find though.</li>
    <li> Good headgear for my CPap mask.Fits correctly and does the job.</li>
    <li> This quality headgear is comfortable and a perfect fit for my Mirage FX nasal mask.</li>
    <li> Product is just what I needed and arrived earlier than the estimated arrival date!</li>
    <li> replaced everything else on the mask before replacing this and this turned out to be the actual problem.  You would think that by now these manufacturers would come up with a product with more longevity.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPER!!! A++++</li>
