      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
      <li>so I can have a perfect color match when I splice it.</li>
      <li>(youtube tutorials are the greatest)</li>
      <li>Wonderful for Halloween!</li>
      <li>The quality is very nice, and the hair doesn&#x27;t tangle or fall out!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s BEYOND beautiful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and I love it!!</li>
      <li>For the price of the purchase, I am happy with X&amp;Y ANGEL.</li>
      <li>I think this wig would work best under a hat, the way the model in the picture has it, if you are wanting a wig to wear on its own you should probably look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Great wig.</li>
      <li>Amazing wig!</li>
      <li>Its so amazing!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really good.</li>

      <li>Absolutely fabulous!!</li>
      <li>This wig is amazing for it&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>but all in all i liked it.</li>
      <li>(Plus having more hair in any wig is nice anyways)</li>
      <li>I am happy with the color, it is exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>over all the rest is fine the color was nice</li>
      <li>I ordered MORE wigs from X&amp;Y ANGEL after that.</li>
      <li>I personally love the style and I can&#x27;t wait to fix up this wig.</li>
      <li>A Halloween store might have a better wig than this, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
      <li>A lot of the tracks show in the front top area.</li>
      <li>so it can hold better</li>
      <li>pretty good wig for the price.</li>
      <li>Easily styled</li>
      <li>I love that the color of this wig is true to the pictures.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it is fine for the price.</li>
      <li>Altough it tangles very fast,  you can comb it very easily.</li>
      <li>You can see a bit of the netting on top , because of the light hair color I think , you can solve it by wearing a cap or the right styling.</li>
      <li>I love it so much!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this wig, It came in today... 10-20 days early :)</li>
      <li>The quality is good, especially for this price.</li>
      <li>But other that it&#x27;s a easy a just wig with good quality hair.</li>
      <li>but I only wished it had more hair and more volume.</li>
      <li>hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle too easy.</li>
      <li>(true to shade, creamy light golden blonde).</li>
      <li>Exactly like the picture</li>
      <li>There was a bit of shedding during the first brushing as well, so expect that.</li>
      <li>This is my first wig.</li>
      <li>It was exactly the color I wanted.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planing on cutting the bangs though cuz there too long and sewing some more hair into it to give it a bit more volume other then that its a good wig for a good price</li>
      <li>This easy to fix with a hat.&lt;br /&gt;Besides those it is very soft and as far as the price</li>
      <li>It feels real, looks real, and it&#x27;s super soft!</li>
      <li>I really do adore this wig.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t tried styling it much yet to see if it can be improved.</li>
      <li>The texture looks like real hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to comb and hardly ever tangles.</li>
      <li>It was tangled at the ends right off the bat, and the top was so thin that, even with a HAT, you literally cannot wear it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get this styled and fixed!</li>
      <li>and i love how soft it is and hardly tangles</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually pleasantly surprised at the quality of this wig for the bargain price.</li>
      <li>Seriously, do NOT waste your money.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft.</li>
      <li>Also pretty thin and sheds easily.</li>
      <li>You could have blonde hair the exact same color as this wig, and I&#x27;d bet you still couldn&#x27;t wear it correctly.</li>
      <li>Very green and extremely shiny in direct sunlight, but s&#x27;okay</li>
      <li>Sure it&#x27;s a bit thin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty noticable but it can be easily fixed with a few extentions or splicing another wig into it.</li>
      <li>The top is thin</li>
      <li>only complaint is that it tangles and gets frizzy easily.</li>
      <li>The hair is quite soft though and any tangles came out easily with a bit of brushing, it is a bit shiny and therefore fake looking but that can be fixed.</li>
      <li>Very prompt delivery it actually came like 4 days before the expected date</li>
      <li>Had to trim the bangs a little because it was too much in my face.</li>

<li> The wig is not as dull in the picture</li>
<li> but its a little thin</li>
<li> It is a little thin</li>
<li> and also recommend adding in some clips inside if you have really thick hair</li>
<li> but this is, by far, the worst.</li>
<li> It will add to the &#x27;scene&#x27; look this wig gives uncut.</li>
<li> this wig is very thin</li>
<li> I cannot believe how absolutely awful this wig was.</li>
<li> Worst wig I&#x27;ve ever gotten the one they show</li>

    <li> Wig was cute just a little too thin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig, It came in today... 10-20 days early :) It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for Halloween! Easily styled</li>
    <li> I really do adore this wig. It is a little thin but it doesn&#x27;t stop be from wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle too easy.</li>
    <li> Thus wig is very cute and i love how soft it is and hardly tangles but its a little thin and i can see the netting from the back and a little on the front kinda bugs but can be fixed.I&#x27;m planing on cutting the bangs though cuz there too long and sewing some more hair into it to give it a bit more volume other then that its a good wig for a good price&lt;br /&gt;Oh and also recommend adding in some clips inside if you have really thick hair so it can hold better</li>
    <li> The quality is very nice, and the hair doesn&#x27;t tangle or fall out! I love everything about this wig! It looks just like the picture! It feels real, looks real, and it&#x27;s super soft! I love it so much!</li>
    <li> It was exactly the color I wanted. A lot of the tracks show in the front top area. It&#x27;s pretty noticable but it can be easily fixed with a few extentions or splicing another wig into it. (youtube tutorials are the greatest) I&#x27;m going to buy another one of these wigs so I can have a perfect color match when I splice it. (Plus having more hair in any wig is nice anyways) It will add to the &#x27;scene&#x27; look this wig gives uncut. I personally love the style and I can&#x27;t wait to fix up this wig.</li>
    <li> this wig is very thin i can see the lace and must be worn with a hat. over all the rest is fine the color was nice</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous!! Exactly like the picture but the bangs are a little longer. No issue there though. It&#x27;s beautiful and I love it!!</li>
    <li> pretty good wig for the price. only complaint is that it tangles and gets frizzy easily. not for every day use. but all in all i liked it. shipping took a litte while as well.</li>
    <li> Worst wig I&#x27;ve ever gotten the one they show n the one that some people get isn&#x27;t what others get! They sent me curly nappy mess twice!</li>
    <li> The quality is good, especially for this price. The hair is soft. Altough it tangles very fast,  you can comb it very easily. You can see a bit of the netting on top , because of the light hair color I think , you can solve it by wearing a cap or the right styling. If I need a wig again in the future , I would buy it here  !</li>
    <li> The only flaws in this wig that I could find where&lt;br /&gt;1. The wig is not as dull in the picture it&#x27;s shiny.  But that can be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;2. The top is thin so you can see part of the cap. This easy to fix with a hat.&lt;br /&gt;Besides those it is very soft and as far as the price it&#x27;s really good. I can&#x27;t wait to get this styled and fixed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually pleasantly surprised at the quality of this wig for the bargain price. It&#x27;s not too shiny and doesn&#x27;t even look fake at a glance, the only problem is that in the front you can easily see the seams for the netting of the wig unless you are EXTREMELY strategic with the bangs. I got this for cosplay and will modify it so it doesn&#x27;t matter, but it might make a difference for how you want to style it.</li>
    <li> God. I cannot believe how absolutely awful this wig was. I have been buying wigs for years but this is, by far, the worst. It was tangled at the ends right off the bat, and the top was so thin that, even with a HAT, you literally cannot wear it. You could have blonde hair the exact same color as this wig, and I&#x27;d bet you still couldn&#x27;t wear it correctly. I&#x27;d post pictures of this atrocity, but I was so caught off-guard by the quality that I threw it in the garbage without a second thought. Seriously, do NOT waste your money. Go somewhere else. Anywhere else. A Halloween store might have a better wig than this, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
    <li> Very green and extremely shiny in direct sunlight, but s&#x27;okay if you pat some powder on it. Also pretty thin and sheds easily. Won&#x27;t be wearing it in public, I don&#x27;t think.</li>
    <li> Not enough hair in the print where the bangs part. You can&#x27;t tottally see the cap underneath</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! Now I ONLY want wigs made of kanekalon Japanese fibers. This wig is amazing for it&#x27;s price. Sure it&#x27;s a bit thin but it&#x27;s so silky and long. Its so amazing! I ordered MORE wigs from X&amp;Y ANGEL after that. ORDER THIS WIG. It&#x27;s BEYOND beautiful. oh and the color is PERFECT! (true to shade, creamy light golden blonde). It&#x27;s very easy to comb and hardly ever tangles. It tangles like natural hair, not a matted cheap clump of fake synthetic material like I&#x27;ve felt on a mistakenly brought wig. X&amp;Y ANGEL are the way to go!</li>
    <li> This is my first wig. I love that the color of this wig is true to the pictures. I had to cut the bangs because it was too long. I have not gone out with this wig yet because I find that it is too shiny. The texture looks like real hair. I don&#x27;t like that the netting shows at the scalp so depending on the styling you&#x27;re going to wear, always check at every angle so that the netting isn&#x27;t seen through. I am happy with the color, it is exactly what I was looking for but I only wished it had more hair and more volume. For the price of the purchase, I am happy with X&amp;Y ANGEL. Very prompt delivery it actually came like 4 days before the expected date it was supposed to arrive. So I am very happy with that! Will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say it is fine for the price. The wig is a bit thin and you can see the netting through the hair, the hairline does not have a very natural look but I haven&#x27;t tried styling it much yet to see if it can be improved. The hair is quite soft though and any tangles came out easily with a bit of brushing, it is a bit shiny and therefore fake looking but that can be fixed. There was a bit of shedding during the first brushing as well, so expect that. I think this wig would work best under a hat, the way the model in the picture has it, if you are wanting a wig to wear on its own you should probably look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great wig. Had to trim the bangs a little because it was too much in my face. But other that it&#x27;s a easy a just wig with good quality hair.</li>
