<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not like the product. They said its a strong hold. But I never found it strong. I do not recommend this</li>
    <li> Favorite get L&#x27;Oreal makes and I think they are discontinuing it.  I ordered as many bottle possible!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time, but couldn&#x27;t find locally any more. Amazon had it so I ordered a six month supply. Could possibly switch, but really like the way it holds without making my hair sticky - or stiff.</li>
    <li> dissolves  easily, non sticky,  keeps control all day and lightweight</li>
    <li> great gel- no flaking, soft- nhave been using this specific one for years -hard to find in the local stores</li>
    <li> Great product would advise friends and family to use. Does everything i personally need in hair products.  Thanks and have a great day.</li>
    <li> Great! I&#x27;ve treated with other gel like OSIS, American Crew, and this is the only that leaves my hair firm but flexible. No dandruff when dry! 100% reccomended.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much!  I love this Gel.  The first one sent out had a broken cap so I called Amazon and Customer Service said they were sending another one out via email with no charge!  Great Customer Service and the Gel is the BEST I have ever purchased!  I am a Stylist so this is a big recommendation for this product!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore. I just bought 9 so I can get by for a few years.</li>
    <li> Love it. It only takes a few second to style my hair. It made my life so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;It is so cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;Though it is lots of hair gel, and you cannot travel with it on air unless you put it in a checked in package.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a couple of years, for my curly hair. Works really well, without making it crusty. The only downside is that the build up will start to flake after a day or so.. Just have to wash your hair pretty often.. Otherwise it is great.</li>
    <li> Has its hold of my hair in a good way.I recommend this to anyone who like styling their hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes, as I was looking for a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; gel. Alas, it was terrible, it holds for maybe 15-30 minutes then BAM, gone, smells awful as well, don&#x27;t buy. I suggest you&#x27;d purchase redken maneuverable wax, or KY hair play California</li>
    <li> I have VERY curly hair that I typically straighten. All of my hair products are Aveda, Pureology, and Redken except for this one! I usually spend the money because I can tell the different and because I use to straighten my hair almost every day. Recently I have been wearing my hair curly and I remembered this line from when I was little. My mom always used the pumping curls on my hair (Which I found on amazon and I am so excited!). But anyways this product is GREAT for curly hair!! It hold my curl and makes it soft and bouncy and not crunchy like most gels. NO Aveda, Pureology, or Redken product even comes close in comparison!! (I do use Matrix curling shampoo and conditioner though too, which I love, and it make a huge difference in my curly hair)</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it will. You get the look you want without the hardness, which is what I wanted. I love this gel! I&#x27;m running low so I think I need to get more :)</li>
    <li> good melting gel, makes my hair look good and stronger.</li>
    <li> My son uses this more than I do, its not sticky at all. It holds very well. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love that this gel doesn&#x27;t harden your hair nor does it leave any white residue. I use it to smooth all the fly aways I have due to breakage</li>
    <li> Sticky and leaves white flakes after a while. Not good.</li>
    <li> Great France product. Amazon.com is the only place to sell it with reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Awesome gentle hold that lasts all day. Perfect for my curly hair. I have a mix of gentle and tight curls and this gel works perfectly. Applies really easy too.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, doesn&#x27;t add any control to my hair which is what I need the gel for.  Don&#x27;t buy if you need any kind of hold.</li>
    <li> Occasionally someone other than yourself is going to touch your hair, and when that happens, it&#x27;s best if you don&#x27;t stab them to death with your spikey &#x27;do. That&#x27;s where this stuff comes in handy (or hairy as the case may be). It&#x27;s easy to apply and keeps your hair under control all day. If you use a lot your hair will get a little stiff, but running your fingers through will make it feel natural again. Use less and you&#x27;re good to go. I find that if by mid-day a few stray hairs are going alfalfa on me, I just dampen my hands and run them through my hair, and that puts things back where they belong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. A little dab will do yah, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, sticky, or hard. It&#x27;s the perfect gel for people who don&#x27;t like gel.</li>
    <li> Meh. I use this for my boy and it works well enough. His hair is still flat by the end of most days though.</li>
    <li> Have been using this hair gel for the past two years and its simply the best . Nice hold without too much stickiness .</li>
    <li> If you are someone who puts gel on dry hair, or put it on and then blow dry - this will be perfect.  It&#x27;s in a very loose liquid state and then it feels like it lathers.  And because I gel my hair while it&#x27;s still damp, it takes forever to dry.  Also, because I put it on damp hair, forget trying to sculp.  That is all.</li>
    <li> $4 stuff, not so good not so bad. I didn&#x27;t use much, but it seems not so strong holding...</li>
    <li> I used some of this at a friends house and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it already!</li>
    <li> i find this gel too runny/liquid. it&#x27;s supposed to be strong hold but it&#x27;s more like WEAK hold. and for some reason, it seems to be rolling off of my hair and doesn&#x27;t stick to it. stays on my hands. i wouldn&#x27;t get it if i were you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update (after 4 times using it): now that i have used it several times, i&#x27;m liking this gel. yes, it is still how i described it as above but after developing a \\&quot;style\\&quot; of applying it, i like the product. when it dries, it looks sleek, wet-look, and doesn&#x27;t have the rock hard feeling of other gels. now i recommend it. i suggest to try putting it on before going out with it</li>
    <li> Stuff works great, and priced right. Makes my hair feel soft and Not Stiff</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this on the shelves! A huge favorite for our hair gel needs! Not sticky and works great with my naturally curly hair! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Very good gel.  I&#x27;m a guy and I like this.</li>
    <li> Bough this gel based on reviews.  I was looking for a light gel that didn&#x27;t leave your hair all greasy, but still provided some holding power.  The L&#x27;oreal Paris Studio Line Melting Gel was right on.  Its super light and non sticky or gooey.  Your hair doen&#x27;t feel nasty at the end of the day and Im glad i found this gel which met my hair care needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> Good Styling Gel. No issues with flaking unless you use WAY to much. Holds just fine most of the day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make your head feel like a piece of melted plastic, it stays soft and palatable while maintaining its style without frizz!</li>
    <li> Hold is weaker than I expect but still a good gel for styling</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only gel my husband will use because it isn&#x27;t stiff or flaky; it provides the right amount of hold without looking too coiffed.</li>
    <li> serves the job of molding the hair down. But is wet/greasy and the smell is unpleasant. You cant stay with this on your head for longer. Expected a better quality product from the brand L&#x27;Oreal.  I prefer hair glue that this gel. The wetness/grease slowly drips down onto your forehead.</li>
    <li> Still love it. Very light gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s better than normal gel as it doesn&#x27;t get as stiff.</li>
    <li> I have used melting gel for quite a while now and was upset when our local stores no longer carried it. So glad I found it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as I expected, but an okay product overall!</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;melting gel&amp;#34; is the perfect gel. You don&#x27;t feel you have applied a gel to your hair and your hair remains manageable and great looking. I could not find this gel, which is my favorite, in most stores I shop in but Amazon is where I can find anything I need at even lower price.</li>
    <li> very good item. I am very picky with my hair products and I must say that this is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> Gel works great at keeping my hair under control and looking good.  I purchased back in Feb of this year at $3.97 each.  I was just going to re-order but the price is now $8.89 each.  That&#x27;s an insane price increase.  Is this a mistake on the price ?</li>
    <li> It is not a very strong holding gel but this is enough for me. It also smells good. I have long and very fine hair that always get really messy in windy days. I tried this product and it holds my front hair well and maintains a good shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having difficulty finding this in my local Walmart and Walgreens. I found this on Amazon and now I get it shipped on a scheduled time frame. It&#x27;s a few cents more than buying it at the store but now I don&#x27;t have to look for it throughout my city and waste gas.</li>
    <li> The first time I squeezed a little melting gel into my palm, the different texture took some getting used to. Now regular gel feels awful by comparison. There&#x27;s something just a little lighter about this product. I don&#x27;t like heavy gels that crisp up my hair; I use melting gel for a little help keeping my curls in shape.</li>
    <li> Best gel ever for curly hair morning touch ups</li>
    <li> This is some pretty great stuff...  Unlike most gels, this doesn&#x27;t smell and so long as your hair is mostly dry, it&#x27;ll provide a very natural looking style without making your head look like it was dumped in grease.  For that kind wet/slick look, just add a little water after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a pea-sized amount (for short hair), rub between your two sets of fingers and get to styling.  It has an all-day strength, but won&#x27;t hold itself up for long in the wind (so don&#x27;t try to go skydiving expecting fantastic hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the product tends to dry quickly when you style and a lot of it will stay on your hand (hence the pea-sized amount suggestion).  You can add a little water to your fingers to try and use as much of it as you can or you can rinse it off (it comes off pretty easily).  Either way, I&#x27;d definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this before last year and liked it, when it ran out I gladly purchased it again, but when I tried using it I noticed that the smell had changed for the worse and the gel is much thinner. It also has a much much weaker hold. I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> This does not leave a stiff finish on my hair,but holds fairly well. The Clean gel variety leaves the hair much stiffer.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome but for some reason l&#x27;oreal has decided to discontinue this product. Every time I find an awesome product they take it away.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite gel I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve had several!  It leaves you hair soft and pliable unlike many strong hold gels.  Now I say soft and pliable but only after it dries and you run your hand through it.  After that you&#x27;re sure to have a good hair style all day.  No flakes! I bought it online mainly because I cannot find this product in stores.  I wish I could so I would have to pay for shipping or buy so much at once.  This is a great product and highly recommend to any guy or gal out there.</li>
    <li> I have long, cirly hair and this is my favorite gel. It holds well without feeling sticky or stiff, and smells nice, but not strong.</li>
    <li> I can tell you that throughout the last ~ 15 years I&#x27;ve tried all types and brand names of gel and absolutely nothing was even comparable the &#x27;melting gel&#x27; by l&#x27;oreal. It is smooth, it doesn&#x27;t stick but yet fix the hair and has no odor. Love it.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this product for me. Great gel with great value. It is light enough to not weigh down my hair like other products I tried. It holds my hair in place and lasts.</li>
    <li> It does the job well. The hair gel isnt sticky, greasy, or wet looking. It holds my hair for the day and doesn&#x27;t get dandruff looking. Its not for spikes though.</li>
    <li> Great gel. A social life saver. I would like a total dork dad without fixing my hair every morning. At least with this on, I look presentable.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hair gel that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look rock hard, this is the stuff for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the description &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34; is inaccurate. When I use this product I have to keep wetting my hair throughout the day to re-style because the hold it provides is pretty weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does do its job, though, and is worth the money. (It&#x27;s slightly cheaper in stores.)</li>
    <li> Switched from LA looks to this and love it.  Nice smell and does what I need it to do better than LA Looks product.</li>
    <li> love this stuff and it is hard to find in the store</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these gels lately, trying to find that one that combines just the right degree of &amp;#34;hold,&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t have an overly shiny appearance, and has a consistency that makes it easy to apply.  This &amp;#34;Melting&amp;#34; gel was far and away the best of the products I tried.  (Be sure you get the L&#x27;Oreal MELTING gel, as they also have a product identical in every respect except that it is considerably thicker and not nearly as easy to apply.)</li>
    <li> Love this gel, can&#x27;t find it in stores any more so I pile up the quantity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of hair gel for years.  It is one of the best.  It holds your hair well, but doesn&#x27;t make it overly stiff.  Just the right amount of hold.</li>
    <li> I live in a small town, so choices are limited.  I love using this gel because my hair does not stay stiff as with other gels, yet the curls/waves stay in.  The stores where I used to get this gel no longer carry it, so I was glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> well i guess this is for younger people.</li>
    <li> This product is one that both my husband and I have used for years.  Couldn&#x27;t find it easily in our local stores, but Amazon came to the rescue again.  We like the non-stiff hold and the odor is very neutral.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found. Soft and with a good hold, but easily brushed off. I have short curly hair. If I use it on still wet hair, it would keep the shape once it dries. If I brush it dry, it would fluff up a bit, but keep almost all the style. Frizz kept to a minimum, especially if not brushed. Never sticky or hard to the touch.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel for my waivy hair! Been using this product since 15 years!</li>
    <li> I have liked the L&#x27;Oreal Hair Products because I saw them in use on Project Runway.  Seeing just how well the product works in an actual setting helped me decide to use them.</li>
    <li> pro quality at an affordable price</li>
    <li> Okay so my hair is really bad as it loves to pick up static. This fixes it and keeps it good all day. Best results though are after you take a shower or after you wet your hair. You don&#x27;t need to much at that point and it gives you enough time to work your hair and get the style you want. Yes I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The melting gel is different from what I am use too. I almost like the crunchiness other gels give but gave this a try and seems to work fine!</li>
    <li> I am on my 10 bottle.</li>
    <li> Works great, works best with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It gives the perfect amount of hold without getting weird and sticky.  Doesn&#x27;t look greasy and its easy to style.  No down side.</li>
    <li> As a guy with fine hair, I just need something to hold in place for most of the day without turning hard as rock.  A little of this stuff added to damp hair dries with a decent hold and still somewhat soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> This melting gel rocks and is the ONLY gel I use. You can use it on wet or dry hair. It leaves it frizz free, manageable and crunch free too! Can&#x27;t find it at Walmart, CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s anymore. Thank you Loreal for still making it &amp; to Amazon for still selling it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent gel. I would buy again. Amazon is the best place to buy such things because places like Target, Walmart have very limited collections and we don&#x27;t know if they are good or bad. I bought this gel after seeing the reviews and I&#x27;m sure I can not find such a gel in any of my local stores.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com is the only place to sell it with reasonable price.Stuff works great, and priced right. Makes my hair feel soft and Not Stiff</li>
    <li> My fiance is very picky with his gels for his hair and im happy that I found it on Amazon !!!! No more PMS from him about it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 tubes of the Melting Gel.  Two of the four we a different product.  Not good, and too insignfificant to chase down.  However, Amazon....now that you have this comment, how about shipping me two tubes of the Melting gel at your cost?</li>
    <li> I tried some other brands, some of which were around 20$ (5 times more expensive) but they weren&#x27;t as good.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t strong enough for my kinda curly hair, but it is good enough and definitely leaves no flakes or anything like that.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this hair gel and he has awesome hair. He says it&#x27;s his favorite because it offers good hold without being stiff. And it&#x27;s true, his hair never feels like it has product in it. Four thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This product wasnt only good for the price, It beats most expensive brands regarding quality of the gel, I WOULD BUY THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Thats actually why i&#x27;m here to Buy more. Excellent Product</li>
    <li> The product does the job it was intended to do, but I don&#x27;t like how it smells. Instead I prefer Garnier Fructis styling gel.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair gel with a nice smell. It has a good hold without making hair clump or get stiff. A little goes a loooonnngg way. This bottle will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Saw little flakes. Nice natural hold but flakes are never good. I buy a lot of hair products to experiment with my difficult hair. My hair is wavy curly.</li>
    <li> This gel is just strong enough to hold really frizzy hair, without feeling like a helmet. Once it dries, just smooth it out with your fingers to soften your hair and you would never be able to tell you have anything in it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and practically free. Use it right out of shower and works all day.</li>
    <li> Product was too hot--turned it to water--no gel-at all--recommends keeping product cooler during shipment..</li>
    <li> If you sweat at all, it leaves a greasy/oily layer on your face that feels disgusting. And I am talking minimal sweat.</li>
    <li> This gel is amazing. It is a strong hold gel but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling all stiff. I can use it to style my hair giving it that wet look.</li>
    <li> I have very stubborn hair, and this product didn&#x27;t provide a good hold. I ended up getting dry wax and didn&#x27;t use this product more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product can do a good job on other types of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought gel in my life before, but I wanted something to hold down my baby hairs. I was afraid that the gel would harden in a very shiny and noticeable way, but it didn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s very flexible, blends in naturally with my hairline, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.</li>
    <li> My favorite gel.  I order these with free shipping and zero taxes from Amazon.  This was discontinued so not sold in the store.  Right amount of hold for my hair style, but just dampen and I can remold my hair.  Been using for over a year now.  More expensive brands fall short of this Melting Gel!</li>
    <li> My son likes Axe better.</li>
    <li> Best gel every for curly hair or hair that is dry and needs a bit of oil.  If you comb through your hair it will not dry hard.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job , but I wasn&#x27;t way impressed with it. I will probably get something else next time.</li>
    <li> I just keep reordering this when I am almost out so I have plenty on hand.  It is great stuff and does the trick for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST stuff for curly hair. It helps define ringlets without the &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; that many other products leave behind. The gel really does feel like it &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; into your hair (feels more like a leave in conditioner than a hair gel) and doesn&#x27;t feel as sticky as many other gels.</li>
    <li> I love this product but after receiving 4 orders through subscription I canceled. I expressed concern about the packaging and nothing was changed. These are tubes with lids that pop open. If they had screw tops there probably would not have been an issue.  It appears that when the shipping packaging was sealed the pressure applied caused the tubes to pop open and the product squirt out resulting in a lot of waste.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Perhaps 10 years total, I don&#x27;t really recall.  Its formulation has changed somewhat over the years.  But this latest change has taken it from a great product to a mediocre one at best - at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it no longer holds all day.  Now, in the early afternoon, I get stray hairs that break lose and look really bad - kind of a Dagwood effect.  The old formulation was more grease/gummy which I am sure people did not like the feel of.  The new formulation is \\&quot;dry\\&quot; to the touch - but it does not hold all day.  The grease/gummy formulation would continue to stick even after being fully dry.  So it worked all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fundamental trade-off seems to be between how your hair looks vs how it feels.  L&#x27;Oreal has traded off worse look for better feel, but this is a bad decision from my point of view.  Many people see one&#x27;s hair, but not many touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a new product to replace my old trusted gel.</li>
    <li> Hate it,weighs the hair way down and the thing I hate worse is,my hair looks so greasy and I barely put any in. Money thrown in garbage.</li>
    <li> Great product - don&#x27;t think twice before locking your eyes on this product - it would be totally worth your money.</li>
    <li> It works great! Keeps my curls from looking frizzy, but doesn&#x27;t get too crunchy. Value for the price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> too watery and sticky</li>
    <li> Love it for Curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have VERY curly, frizzy hair.  This stuff gets it under control.  Hard to find in the store.  So glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> I love this gel! I&#x27;m in the military and it took me awhile to find a great hair gel that doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or leave flakes in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent either which makes it awesome. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is strong hold like the red L&#x27;Oreal Studio gel but it does do the job and is the perfect light weight gel.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Loreal Melting Gel for over 15 years.  I have short, curly and extremely frizzy hair and it definitley keeps the frizzies in check. And the price is right compared to other gels or products like this.</li>
    <li> Hard to find clean smell and use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not great; it has a poor smell and poor consistency; too liquidy and does not dry fast..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Great for my naturally curly hair. And having it on subscribe and save makes it super easy and less expensive then going to a retail store. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Product works well. Holds hair in place but it is not overly hard. Gel does not feel clumpy in hair. Product does not flake or turn white when dry. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> best hair gel i ever purchased. Owned this type for about two years and is my favorite gel. Definitely hope they have this gel around for years to come.</li>
    <li> Great quality product that competes with the more expensive salon brands. I have curly hair and I like how this doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky or crunchy. My husband uses it too!</li>
    <li> in love with it. Because it&#x27;s so cheap :D for the price + prime shipping, nothing can beat this one.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair. I have never found a gel that works so well without leaving my hair sticky and therefore fuzzy. I order this in bulk in fear that one day the product will not be available. I do not think I can live without this.</li>
    <li> This is my new hair gel, will never go back to the crew gel.  Awesome, no regrets on my purchase!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Love this product, it helps my straight hair to have some body but feel soft and bouncy. A user for life!</li>
    <li> Give me the control without the stiffness.  It smells great too.  Good bargain for the price paid for this item</li>
    <li> I like a gel that will give me some control but won&#x27;t end up crunchy or leave any residue. This is the stuff!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave stain on pillowcase.</li>
    <li> Holds extra well, super strong, no flakes.</li>
    <li> Best in the line of L&#x27;oreal hair gel in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Only hair gel that actually holds and does not flake.  Even when dry, you can still brush your hair and this gel will not flake!  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, either.  It&#x27;s not a extra-strong hold; rather, a firm hold.</li>
    <li> Does not really keep the haid spikey all day!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it holds up any better than any other gel, including the cheap Suave one my parents have had for decades in their cabinet.</li>
    <li> My husband, age 60, has thick blonde curly hair that can get a little wild. He loves the MELTING GEL and no other. We can&#x27;t find it in stores so glad it&#x27;s subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> I have tried various gels and I love the L&#x27;oreal Melting Gel. It does not leave a sticky film on my hands or hair and It makes styling my hair so much easier and looking great.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair flake and keeps it looking soft.  Glad I found it recently.  My husband really likes it too</li>
    <li> Not consistent hold between tubes bought previously.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I would call it &amp;#34;strong hold.&amp;#34;  I normally use the American Crew Firm hold gel but was trying to save a buck by trying this stuff.  My head is a frizz ball so I wear my hair short and use gel to tame it and keep it from sticking up everywhere.  I also spike up the front a little.  The American Crew stuff gives me a great hold that lasts all day.  This gel is different.  Even when I first put the gel in my hair, my hair does not stay in place.  The front where I spike it up falls down and the rest of my hair sticks up again as soon as it&#x27;s dry.  It also has a runny consistency unlike the American Crew stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on my son&#x27;s hair as well.  He has straight fine hair that is quite a bit longer than mine.  It doesn&#x27;t give a great hold for him either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of great reviews (between that and the low price is why I tried it) but it just must not be for my hair type.  So if you have short, straight hair, it might not be for you.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best gel I have ever used. Bummed Walmart stopped selling it. Love the Gel, styles without hardening my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel i ever bought. I recommend this product. The only problem is amazon forces us to buy other products since this is a &#x27;prime&#x27; item</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff and I can&#x27;t get it on Soap.com</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase a better holding gel in the store at Walmart.  Not worth the money.  Would recommend something else.  I have short hair and need some kind of strong hold.</li>
    <li> I just started using gel for the first time in over 5 years. My hair is pretty long and i needed something to make it look clean after being slicked back. This gel is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t get too hard and it goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> Light, inexpensive gel for mixed curly hair.</li>
    <li> The barber cut my hair way too short. Quite disappointed in the haircut. However, after reading some reviews on this Melting Gel, I purchased it, and I love it. Keeps my hair, what&#x27;s left of it, in place. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Gave me a  light set with my blond hair and didn&#x27;t change the color  like other setting lotions. Well packed , securely shipped and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Yeah I am a 20 year old guy with longer hair...I got a bad hair cut and needed to get some gel to hold it and make it look better....but it didn&#x27;t do a darn thing! I put it in as directed and it just fell back to natural. It&#x27;s not worth it. There is better gels.</li>
    <li> This gel is awful! How is this classified as strong hold? This product is garbage unless you are looking for VERY little hold.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I tried other gels and hairsprays, but this works the best for me.  It controls my hair really well without being stiff.  I like that is not scented.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> not bad for occasional use</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this gel to anyone with super thick, frizzy hair. It never gets sticky or stiff and keeps my hair smooth, controls the frizz and makes nice looking curls. I can also use it to blow dry my bangs into smoother look. As anyone with frizzy hair knows, the weight of product helps keep hair from lifting up and fluffing out.  This product has plenty of weight to it, but yet it is light enough to let my hair shine! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is getting hard to find in walk in stores. I have been using it for about seven years and really like it. It strikes a nice balance between&lt;br /&gt;hold and not being stiff or greasy.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever.</li>
    <li> Accoding to expectations!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve used several hair gels to style my hair. Using a small amount holds hair firmly in place which means this one tube has potential to last months. Definitely worth the purchase. Hair will not get hard and rough after application.</li>
    <li> Nice hold without the hardness.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair body after washing so easier to style.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like this stuff for my fine, unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Been using it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Like others, my fear is that Loreal might mess-up and reformulate it...and ruin a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product.  It&#x27;s not overly sticky or dries and flakes.  It holds his hair the way he wants and makes it look natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  A good hold without the stiffness.  Shiny when first used and if not touched, but will go matte if you run your hands though your hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but now Amazon is the only place to find it.</li>
    <li> Not very strong effect, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Good Product. The only challenge is that the cap is really wide which makes it come out too fast and leads to wasted product. All in all good product aside from this.</li>
    <li> This gel really does not hold my hair for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It may just last for a few hours then my hair is back to it&#x27;s old self.</li>
    <li> Not sure what species of hair Loreal used this product on to attain a &#x27;strong hold&#x27; characteristic, but an accidental brush up against a jacket or hand, and you might as well not have used anything in your hair at all; wallah, like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy, because as I learned about 10 minutes ago, you can&#x27;t return liquid-based products I guess (even though it wasn&#x27;t sealed with any extra precautionary packaging, not even one seal let alone the Amazon required double-seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why they don&#x27;t offer a 0-star...it would bring the average rating to a more statistically accurate figure included therein all of the COMPLETELY useless products such as this, and perhaps the &amp;#34;Flowbee&amp;#34; from the 80&#x27;s are the only two that would be in it just yet.</li>
    <li> I like the L&#x27;Oreal Melting Gel because if I brush through my hair after it dries it holds my hair style without looking wet or oily. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years.</li>
    <li> This is a good example of an item which is very difficult to find in the stores any more ... but you can find and buy on-line. Stock up!!</li>
    <li> I have been using KMS California Hairstay for some time now as my go-to gel, but when I went to reorder some, I found reviews that they had recently changed their formula for the worse (smell-wise), so I thought I would try to find something else, possibly a bit cheaper. So here we are.  For the most part, this gel is very nice. It&#x27;s more liquidy than what I am accustomed to, which makes spreading it in dry hair easier. The stay is moderately strong without being &amp;#34;crunchy,&amp;#34; which is always a plus. However, I have noticed two main differences that are not good news in my book. First, it gets pretty flaky over the course of the day. Yes of course, all gels do this to a certain extent, but this one seems to flake a little more than I recall with other gels. If you have light hair, or mostly plan on using if for a night out (rather than all day), I imagine this won&#x27;t be nearly as much of a problem. Second, I&#x27;m not thrilled about the smell. Again, yes, I know all gels smell a bit. Some do a decent job of disguising it as something pleasantly fruity, but this one smells, as my girlfriend put it, &amp;#34;like grandma perfume.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not an altogether unpleasant smell, but I would rather my hair not be determining my scent, especially when it&#x27;s a little chemical-y. It definitely smells most strongly right out of the bottle and mostly dissipates once it is dry. I have a fairly good nose, so this may cause me more grief than it would for others.  Bottom line: I will not be buying this again, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others. This gel is noticeably less expensive than what I have been paying for KMS, and for someone with lighter hair, someone who doesn&#x27;t plan to wear it day in day out, and someone who doesn&#x27;t plan to have people sniffing their hair, this is a good deal for a medium hold gel with nice spread and texture.  ADDENDUM: I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, closer to six months, and it has definitely grown on me. I&#x27;ve become fondof the more liquidy consistency, and it seems less flaky and aromatic than before (or I&#x27;ve just gotten used to it). I definitely feel now like I judged this product too soon, and if it continues to be such a great deal, I will likely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, but they are discontinuing it. I was pretty happy when I found this on Amazon! All the other gels are too sticky &amp; too smelly (I do not like perfumed products) I hope this will be available for a while.</li>
    <li> Believe me in this thing: It&#x27;s not strong. I don&#x27;t care whatever quality else they have.</li>
    <li> Their melting gel is incredibly runny out of the bottle, much more than I was expecting, but it holds surprisingly well and goes in very easily. Almost out of my current tube and will be buying another.</li>
    <li> I find this gel too liquidy without much hold. Since it advertises strong hold, I was expecting something stronger.</li>
    <li> I tried other gels including other L&#x27;Oreal but it&#x27;s nothing like Melting Gel...It holds well without stiff..and it last longer too..best part you won&#x27;t feel sticky!!</li>
    <li> This is the only gel my daughter and I use. It&#x27;s tuff to find it in stores sometimes, so I get it here. It never gets crunchy or stiff but holds great anyway and takes the frizz out of our naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Holds very well without flaking</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this gel.  I have a lot of hair and need to be able to control my curls while allowing them to move or I look like I&#x27;m wearing a helmet.  This gel gets the job done wonderfully. It holds up great in the humid conditions in Central Florida. I have a really hard time finding them stocked in brick and mortar stores so I am very HAPPY to find it here.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different hair gels and most of them are very sticky and makes your hair look stiff. And few creams made my hair dry after few hours. I love this gel it leaves no residue and sticks to hair how you want it to be. When I apply this gel my hair looks naturally styled than applied gel look. LOVE IT!!!</li>
