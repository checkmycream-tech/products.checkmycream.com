      <li>Lauren used to be easy to find, but not the case anymore.  </li>
      <li>One of my very favorite classic perfumes!</li>
      <li>and I was able to give it to someone who liked the new scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light floral,citrusy scent,not overpowering.</li>
      <li>KUDOS to Amazon Customer Support for going the extra mile to keep their customers happy under these circumstances.</li>
      <li>Same great product for 35 years.  </li>
      <li>My favorite since the first time</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s unique aroma.  </li>
      <li>Light floral fragrance without being sweet.  </li>
      <li>From now on i will buy it from a Store that is reputable for a higher price to receive a quality product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean smelling.</li>
      <li>Got away from it through the years and was super excited when I found it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s what i expected and am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>great value for the price as expected from amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells ok, but is not the classic Lauren.</li>
      <li>I just love this older fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is very recognizable.</li>
      <li>; Today, of course, &amp;#34;Ralph&amp;#34; is the name of a new scent, so we can&#x27;t do that any more.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I paid for and wear it on special occasions.</li>
      <li>I have also seen that old stock is available.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to surprise my wife for Christmas, as this was her signature fragrance.</li>
      <li>kind.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER!!!, After contacting customer support and explaining the problem and also pointing out that there was nothing on the product detail on Amazon that stated that items like this were non-refundable and not eligible for exchange, they were nice enough to refund my total price + shipping.</li>
      <li>However, when my new cologne arrived in the mail it smelled EXACTLY like the sample at the store.  </li>
      <li>Not the same as the original recipe/version.</li>
      <li>To make matters worse, Amazon policy does not allow the return of liquids considered hazardous, and that means this perfume!</li>
      <li>A classic.</li>
      <li>It is fresh product, but it isn&#x27;t the same product that was sold a couple decades ago.  </li>
      <li>I either have to inconvenience my relatives who live in the States or Canada, or give up.</li>
      <li>I have worn \\&quot;Lauren\\&quot; for many years but sadly it doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily available anymore.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Lauren for Her\\&quot; from Macy&#x27;s was *exactly* the same as from this merchant.  </li>
      <li>This time she reports that while she still likes it, it is very or a bit or rather different from the old &amp;#34;Lauren,&amp;#34; of which she has saved a whiff for comparison.</li>
      <li>This has been a favorite of mine for at least twenty years but somehow had allowed my wife to run out of it and never replaced it until now.  </li>
      <li>Must be old.</li>
      <li>Whether it be government regulations with chemicals or cost related issues, fragrances are now chemical bombs and have a very synthetic smell to them.</li>
      <li>The old essences/ingredients that the classics once contained have all been blacklisted and are not allowed in perfumes, per government regulation.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately this is not the Lauren that I knew and loved.  </li>
      <li>Personally, I think that this bottle is NOS (New Old Stock).  </li>
      <li>My next stop is the Macy&#x27;s website where I know I&#x27;ll get the new version labelled \\&quot;Lauren for Her\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Lauren used to have a spicey and exotic fragrance, complex yet alluring, or in a word - mysterious.</li>
      <li>So naturally she was drawn to it and has worn it for some ten years.</li>
      <li>I really should have listened to other reviewers.</li>
      <li>Yet after the first spray from the freshly opened bottle she knew something was terribly wrong.</li>

<li> I have been a customer of Amazon for as long as they have been around and will continue to be a customer for life.</li>
<li> Once that smell fades, there is a faint scent of original Lauren.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it does not smell like the original Lauren...</li>
<li> I would spray on just a minimum amount &amp; the scent stays on for a very long time.</li>
<li> but if your body is a sponge or dry</li>
<li> So if you are a creature of habit, at least as far as perfumes go, you might give this one a test spritz before you buy.</li>
<li> I am replacing an empty bottle.</li>
<li> Instead, this bottle of perfume has a sour smell.  </li>
<li> Smells a little like you just took a shower.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the fact i can order it on-line.  Price was great and delivery swift.  Same great product for 35 years.  Thank-u Amazon.</li>
    <li> I too was disappointed with a recent purchase of Lauren.  I wore it in the 80&#x27;s, and when I tried the \\&quot;new\\&quot; stuff I was sorely disappointed.  It is NOTHING like the Lauren that I remember.</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite of mine for at least twenty years but somehow had allowed my wife to run out of it and never replaced it until now.  Very glad that I did.  A classic.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Lauren. It&#x27;s one of the best scents around.  I have been using it for years and it still smells great!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas. She knows what&#x27;s it&#x27;s supposed to smell like, and she thought it smelled wrong. No way to return it, so now I&#x27;m out thirty five dollars.    Never order perfume on-line; you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this Eau De Toilette.I would spray on just a minimum amount &amp; the scent stays on for a very long time.Thank you for ordering this for me since I shop mostly on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance. It has saved many gift soltions for me. Do not discontinue. Not available in stores.</li>
    <li> I am replacing an empty bottle. I absolutely love this fragrance. It is fresh and light and makes me feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> WIFE LOVED IT, I WAS A HIT INSTEAD OF GETTING HIT---HA,HA</li>
    <li> This product is going into the hard to find catagory.  At one time they also made hand and body creams.  It would be nice of those were available along with the scent.</li>
    <li> Not the same as the original recipe/version. Acutely disappointing.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite cologne for over 30 years. I am so happy I can still find it on Amazon. It is no longer carried by the department stores to which I have access.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite daytime scents. It&#x27;s what i expected and am happy with my purchase. great value for the price as expected from amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favotire perfume.  When she is happy, I am happy.  I will purchase this product online again in the future (her birthday!!!!!).</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter, whose name is Laura. So naturally she was drawn to it and has worn it for some ten years. I wore it, too, back in the day, and she and I would in moments of stress, cry: &amp;#34;Where&#x27;s Ralph?&amp;#34; Today, of course, &amp;#34;Ralph&amp;#34; is the name of a new scent, so we can&#x27;t do that any more. And in the interim I&#x27;ve gotten charmed by old-fashioned smells (some alas out of print). Still I continue to refresh my daughter&#x27;s supply on birthdays and such. This time she reports that while she still likes it, it is very or a bit or rather different from the old &amp;#34;Lauren,&amp;#34; of which she has saved a whiff for comparison. So if you are a creature of habit, at least as far as perfumes go, you might give this one a test spritz before you buy.</li>
    <li> This is my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume, and she is difficult to buy gifts for. Lauren used to be easy to find, but not the case anymore.  I have tried to give her other perfumes but at 71 years old she is set in her ways and the perfumes she will wear. May order another to have a backup for when she runs out of the bottle I just bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This perfume stinks,, its not Ralph Lauren,, as we know it.. False advertising at its worst&lt;br /&gt;Cant get a refund either,,, so unfair</li>
    <li> One of my all-time favorites. The only complaint is I couldn&#x27;t get it directly as you do not ship this item internationally- as a matter of fact, there are a few items that I have tried to order that you don&#x27;t send overseas. I either have to inconvenience my relatives who live in the States or Canada, or give up.</li>
    <li> I thought I better step in and defend Amazon regarding this fragrance. Most fragrances from 30 years ago have all been reformulated many times. Do online research on fragrances and you will find that for one reason or another, perfumes have gone through a major transformation and it is NOT for the best. Whether it be government regulations with chemicals or cost related issues, fragrances are now chemical bombs and have a very synthetic smell to them. The old essences/ingredients that the classics once contained have all been blacklisted and are not allowed in perfumes, per government regulation. I don&#x27;t think buying from a department store will matter.  I have smelled this Lauren fragrance at Macy&#x27;s and it was NOT what it used to be. Some perfumes are so terrible now, I can hardly believe they can retain their old name as they smell nothing like the original. Regulations are to blame.</li>
    <li> I first caught a whiff of this wonderful scent in 1983 and have loved it since. It&#x27;s clean smelling. Smells a little like you just took a shower. It is very recognizable. I got exactly what I paid for and wear it on special occasions.</li>
    <li> My favorite since the first time I smelled it&#x27;s unique aroma.  Smells like orange blossoms.  Light floral fragrance without being sweet.  Sophisticated.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Lauren\\&quot; is one of the few fragrances to which I am not allergic. It&#x27;s a light floral,citrusy scent,not overpowering. I&#x27;ve received many compliments and questions about what my perfume is. I have worn \\&quot;Lauren\\&quot; for many years but sadly it doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily available anymore. I hope Ralph is still producing it. Amazon offered only a 2 ounce size when I really wanted the larger size but at least they had some of it.</li>
    <li> gets your motor running</li>
    <li> Great parfume but it depends on the person&#x27;s skin if you truly will wear it right.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great but if your body is a sponge or dry I would not buy this but&lt;br /&gt;rather look for something that is more oil based.  I have found that Spanish/Latin&lt;br /&gt;women wear this the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this phone wallet cover. The orange color is perfect. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is not the Lauren that I knew and loved.  Disappointed in what has to be a new formula.  Bummed.</li>
    <li> Was kind of worried this would end up in disaster since I have never ordered this online.  It was great! Same product I get in the department store but without the hassle of going there!</li>
    <li> This Lauren does not smell like the one I used to wear 15 years ago. I don&#x27;t know why.&lt;br /&gt;It smells ok, but is not the classic Lauren.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Lauren for Her\\&quot; from Macy&#x27;s was *exactly* the same as from this merchant.  It is fresh product, but it isn&#x27;t the same product that was sold a couple decades ago.  Based on this info, saying that the perfume I purchased through Amazon went bad is inaccurate, so I&#x27;m revising my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Lauren by Ralph Lauren has gone bad\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen that Lauren is being produced again.  I have also seen that old stock is available.  I bought it through Amazon because I thought I would be assured of receiving a good product.  Instead, this bottle of perfume has a sour smell.  Once that smell fades, there is a faint scent of original Lauren.  (I call it the 3rd layer.  The 1st layer lasts an hour, or two after being applied.  The 2nd layer follows the 1st, and lasts 6 - 8 hours after application.  The 3rd layer follows the 2nd, and lasts up to 14 hours after application.)  Personally, I think that this bottle is NOS (New Old Stock).  I don&#x27;t know how well perfume keeps, but I know that this one has \\&quot;gone bad\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return it for a refund.  My next stop is the Macy&#x27;s website where I know I&#x27;ll get the new version labelled \\&quot;Lauren for Her\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Great Price....only perfume I can use because of allergies!!&lt;br /&gt;always spray before speaking/teaching.....makes me feel good about myself!</li>
    <li> Not the Lauren I remember I gave it away</li>
    <li> Floral and delightful.  One of my favorites for years.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this before from Amazon and my all time favorite perfume was great. This time it has almost no smell and a big disappointment. Must be old.Wish I could return it!</li>
    <li> Gift for the wife - She loves it!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!. Nothing like I remembered Lauren smelling. Im so disappointed</li>
    <li> My wiife has used Lauren for many years. I purchased a 2 Oz bottle through Amazon and my wife was very disappointed. She indicated that the aroma was much weaker than what she has used in the past.From now on i will buy it from a Store that is reputable for a higher price to receive a quality product.</li>
    <li> I just love this older fragrance.  And I received it within a couple of days.  Will definately order again.  Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it does not smell like the original Lauren... I have since been told, that a different oil is used in creating the current fragrance. This is likely why it was removed from the shelves? also, this is a non-returnable purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over thirty years and I have loved the whole line! They used to have a great lotion and bath powder to go along with the perfume. People always comment on how pleasing the fragrance is.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this fragrance in the past, and this is not the scent that I remember it to be</li>
    <li> I really wanted to surprise my wife for Christmas, as this was her signature fragrance. Yet after the first spray from the freshly opened bottle she knew something was terribly wrong. Lauren used to have a spicey and exotic fragrance, complex yet alluring, or in a word - mysterious. The bottle I purchased from Amazon smells like kerosene mixed with bug spray! I really should have listened to other reviewers. To make matters worse, Amazon policy does not allow the return of liquids considered hazardous, and that means this perfume! So now I am out $50, my wife is quite upset, and in the future we will take our perfume purchases elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This scent is so feminine and takes only the smallest wisp for the entire day... I never cease to get compliments on it. May seem pricey, but consider the fact that you may need one bottle every 5 to 7 years and the cost balances out.</li>
    <li> One of my very favorite classic perfumes!</li>
    <li> I used to wear this fragrance exclusively and loved it. Got away from it through the years and was super excited when I found it again. Unfortunately, Ralph Lauren changed the formula and it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it used to. When I tried to set up a return or exchange on Amazon, I was told that perfumes were considered &amp;#34;flammable&amp;#34; and were not eligible for refund or return of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER!!!, After contacting customer support and explaining the problem and also pointing out that there was nothing on the product detail on Amazon that stated that items like this were non-refundable and not eligible for exchange, they were nice enough to refund my total price + shipping. They also did not require me to send back the perfume and I was able to give it to someone who liked the new scent. KUDOS to Amazon Customer Support for going the extra mile to keep their customers happy under these circumstances. I have been a customer of Amazon for as long as they have been around and will continue to be a customer for life. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> is and always will be my favorite fragrance</li>
    <li> love it..thanks for the great service</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed!  This is NOT the Lauren of the 1980s.  I ordered mine from Macy&#x27;s.  My friend agreed.  It does not smell the same as he remembered.  I tried the sample at the counter and it smelled horrible.  The sales lady said the sample was old and had gone bad.  However, when my new cologne arrived in the mail it smelled EXACTLY like the sample at the store.  VERY disappointed.  I am returning.  :(</li>
