### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If you decide on purchasing this product you will not get the product that is pictured but rather a sponge that is best suited to scrubbing your daughters doll.</li>
      <li>This worked great for 15 days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really great.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>it holds a good dose of soap (either bar soap or liquid) and it gives a good &#x27;rubdown&#x27; in addition to cleaning.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I laughed when I opened it.</li>
      <li>Buying these are great because they come in many colors and are fairly priced.</li>
      <li>I really liked these sponges.  </li>
      <li>Happy with the texture and ready to use it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than using a washcloth -</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have been more happier.</li>
      <li>I like it much better than a washcloth - for the shower.</li>
      <li>stinky is going to be getting some more use.</li>
      <li>The loofah is a good size, and came in the exact color I was expecting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good size - not too big but a good handful.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
      <li>It functions as it should and doesn&#x27;t appear to be of cheap build quality.</li>
      <li>Just go to your local pharmacy or discount store and get a good one for super cheap.</li>
      <li>Its the tiniest sponge ive ever seen, good maybe only for your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably because the string isn&#x27;t really a string but more of a strap.</li>
      <li>I could have spent more money at one of the bath stores but was sure these are what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from the size it looks about right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We went to Wal-Mart and bought a $2 pouf that is bigger and way more dense and held together by a stronger string.  </li>
      <li>Fell apart in the first week.</li>
      <li>A much higher quality pouf than others that I&#x27;ve ordered on here.</li>
      <li>and I need to get more especially for exfoliating!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily an item that I&#x27;d want to last forever; I like replacing them every so often just to be hygienic.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>luckily still have my old one.</li>
      <li>(and I don&#x27;t have particularly large hands).</li>
      <li>I got the impression it was on the large side, which I prefer, but the one I got form Doro Sports is 2/3 the size of my fist</li>
      <li>The picture is very deceiving.</li>
      <li>They came packaged very well</li>
      <li>Exactly the right size and consistency; just wish mine hadn&#x27;t been white</li>
      <li>I needed new sponges for my husband and I, and after reading the reviews and checking the price I ordered some.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it had a suction-cup on it until after I bought it, but it&#x27;s not a big deal really..</li>
      <li>It is very tiny and very flimsy.  </li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t really hold a lather too long.</li>
      <li>and they do not take to much time to dry.</li>
      <li>I got a pink one, and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to see how tight and thick they were</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll try it, since I don&#x27;t have any other options on hand, but I would defintely prefer something much</li>
      <li>Individually, each is a sad little wad of nylon mesh, inadequate for a good soapy scrub.</li>

<li> Individually, each is a sad little wad of nylon mesh, inadequate for a good soapy scrub.</li>
<li> My sponge was large but it had a bunch of small water holding sponges.</li>
<li> I can tell you without a doubt that it was the loofah, and not the soap, because my bf picked up a different one (he didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;d purchased this one), and that one worked as expected with the same liquid soap.</li>
<li> You can grab the new one with your whole hand and it still has lots of pouf left to scrub with--unlike the above-reviewed pouf that merely disappears in your hand as you try to use it.  </li>
<li> Way smaller than I expected and then fell apart within two weeks.</li>
<li> The only reason I chose 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I was hoping for a white one, but received a green one.</li>
<li> Have not really used this product yet.  </li>
<li> I like the shade of pink</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not easy to differentiate them when left in the shower.</li>
<li> The only thing I need these to do is last at least 6 months and not have the little string break after the first week rendering me unable to hang it on the faucet in my shower.</li>
<li> Look about average from what i have seen in other stores.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed, but then it seemed to work OK.  </li>
<li> The little rope for hanging it from a hook or whatever is something I always look for, and this one has it.</li>
<li> Poor quality and tiny</li>
<li> Unless you are 2 these will be way to small for you.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s kinda small, but works nonetheless.</li>
<li> This is a small to medium sized shower pouf with a loop to hang it after use.  </li>
<li> I have never seen a loofah this small.</li>
<li> This was to small for me and fell apart after 2 weeks of use.</li>
<li> I bought a lot of body bath poofs before and none have ever been this small.</li>
<li> Really not much more to say about this product.</li>
<li> These are the most pathetic loofahs I have ever seen.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> This pouf is so small</li>
<li> I had never seen a pouf this small.  </li>
<li> I desperately retied it, trying to make it whole again, but it was never the same henceforth; it looks like a sad bow tie now, wilting like one on a washed-up nerd after an awkward prom date with a girl who only went with him on a dare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> At least it was on the softer side, so that is why it gets 3 stars.</li>
<li> Very very small in size</li>
<li> I think it is false advertising.</li>
<li> Must have read the description wrong.</li>
<li> Give them a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> This thing is horrible.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s mini...very tiny. Must have read the description wrong.</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible. Its the tiniest sponge ive ever seen, good maybe only for your face. What a ripoff</li>
    <li> Way smaller than I expected and then fell apart within two weeks.</li>
    <li> These are the most pathetic loofahs I have ever seen. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it had a suction-cup on it until after I bought it, but it&#x27;s not a big deal really.. It functions as it should and doesn&#x27;t appear to be of cheap build quality.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner. It is a big help in the shower. The only reason I chose 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I was hoping for a white one, but received a green one. I like it much better than a washcloth - for the shower.</li>
    <li> This pouf is so small I laughed when I opened it. What a joke!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a big, scrubby pouf for showering. This pack of three together might do the trick, if I were to somehow lash them together. Individually, each is a sad little wad of nylon mesh, inadequate for a good soapy scrub. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The only thing I need these to do is last at least 6 months and not have the little string break after the first week rendering me unable to hang it on the faucet in my shower. This sponge has done both of those things. It&#x27;s probably because the string isn&#x27;t really a string but more of a strap.</li>
    <li> Good product. However, the item said &amp;#34;Colors may vary&amp;#34; and I ordered three for the family. But they are all white so it&#x27;s not easy to differentiate them when left in the shower. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> I had never seen a pouf this small.  I was a little disappointed, but then it seemed to work OK.  That is, until the string holding it together came unraveled a couple weeks later.  I desperately retied it, trying to make it whole again, but it was never the same henceforth; it looks like a sad bow tie now, wilting like one on a washed-up nerd after an awkward prom date with a girl who only went with him on a dare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to Wal-Mart and bought a $2 pouf that is bigger and way more dense and held together by a stronger string.  It&#x27;s like night versus day.  You can grab the new one with your whole hand and it still has lots of pouf left to scrub with--unlike the above-reviewed pouf that merely disappears in your hand as you try to use it.  Don&#x27;t bother with buying this one.  Just go to your local pharmacy or discount store and get a good one for super cheap.</li>
    <li> Very very small in size</li>
    <li> I needed new sponges for my husband and I, and after reading the reviews and checking the price I ordered some. I was thrilled to see how tight and thick they were and they were in white. They came packaged very well and I couldn&#x27;t have been more happier. I could have spent more money at one of the bath stores but was sure these are what I wanted. They exceeded my expectations! Give them a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed. They also have a suction cup to hang up.</li>
    <li> Exactly the right size and consistency; just wish mine hadn&#x27;t been white (but this obviously does nothing for its functionality).</li>
    <li> This net sponge is well made and a pleasure to use.  It&#x27;s much better than using a washcloth - it holds a good dose of soap (either bar soap or liquid) and it gives a good &#x27;rubdown&#x27; in addition to cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size - not too big but a good handful.  With a loop to hang it up, it doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
    <li> If you decide on purchasing this product you will not get the product that is pictured but rather a sponge that is best suited to scrubbing your daughters doll.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart, especially like the part where it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet.</li>
    <li> This worked great for 15 days. On the 16th day it fell apart. The ribbon holding the mesh together broke and the pouf sprang from my hand not unlike Mel Gibson&#x27;s guts sprang from his belly at the end of Braveheart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I luckily still have my old one. Looks like ol&#x27; stinky is going to be getting some more use.</li>
    <li> My sponge was large but it had a bunch of small water holding sponges. There was no way to shake all the water out. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Have not really used this product yet.  Gave to my girlfriend. Look about average from what i have seen in other stores. Really not much more to say about this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked these sponges.  They do not hold water and when I am done with them, I hang them up and they do not take to much time to dry.</li>
    <li> A much higher quality pouf than others that I&#x27;ve ordered on here. 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are truly a joke. I bought a lot of body bath poofs before and none have ever been this small. I was embarrassed as it was a gift mother and she thought it was a joke.  The picture is very deceiving. In fact they look nothing like the picture.  I think it is false advertising.</li>
    <li> This is a small to medium sized shower pouf with a loop to hang it after use.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while now with no signs of deterioration.  It&#x27;s not necessarily an item that I&#x27;d want to last forever; I like replacing them every so often just to be hygienic.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The loofah is a good size, and came in the exact color I was expecting. However, it doesn&#x27;t really hold a lather too long. Had to reapply soap twice just to wash one body! I can tell you without a doubt that it was the loofah, and not the soap, because my bf picked up a different one (he didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;d purchased this one), and that one worked as expected with the same liquid soap. At least it was on the softer side, so that is why it gets 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I got a pink one, and it works really well. It has a string on the end to hang it by and has a suction cup on the end of the string so I just suction it to the wall of the shower when I&#x27;m not using it. It holds soap well. It&#x27;s kinda small, but works nonetheless. It&#x27;s really great. I like the shade of pink it came in.</li>
    <li> I have never seen a loofah this small. Somehow from the photo I got the impression it was on the large side, which I prefer, but the one I got form Doro Sports is 2/3 the size of my fist (and I don&#x27;t have particularly large hands). I guess I&#x27;ll try it, since I don&#x27;t have any other options on hand, but I would defintely prefer something much larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the size it looks about right. The little rope for hanging it from a hook or whatever is something I always look for, and this one has it.</li>
    <li> Unless you are 2 these will be way to small for you.  only like 2&amp;#34; across.  I don&#x27;t like them at all.  They disappear in my hand when i am trying to shower.</li>
    <li> This thing is tiny and not well made.  It&#x27;s not even up to $1 store standards.</li>
    <li> I use poufs for decorating the bath room. Buying these are great because they come in many colors and are fairly priced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the sponge in the picture. I got a white one instead. I thought it was going to be the purple one in the picture.</li>
    <li> Fell apart in the first week.</li>
    <li> I received it! Happy with the texture and ready to use it! It is worth the price and I need to get more especially for exfoliating!</li>
    <li> Does not look like the picture. It is very tiny and very flimsy.  Truly a rip off.</li>
    <li> This was to small for me and fell apart after 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Poor quality and tiny</li>
</ol>
