      <li>Reasonable price for a set of beautiful colors</li>
      <li>The colors are nice and strong, and compared to Konad stamping polishes I&#x27;ve found they are easier to work with.</li>
      <li>I love the colors, but none of them work for stamping.</li>
      <li>Love the colors.</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love these so much&lt;</li>

      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
      <li>these colors are very lush and a very shiny finish.</li>
      <li>You will find uses for stamping and I am positive it will work for other artistic nail</li>
      <li>The polish/lacquer is too runny for stamping plates and its really too bad because the colors are really beautiful.</li>
      <li>The only down side to them is that they are super thin and sheer that certain colors don&#x27;t show up as bright as you would like them too.</li>
      <li>I like BundleMonster items and their selection and their prices are very reasonable and comparable to other sellers.  </li>
      <li>I can get the orange, yellow and green to work, but the images do not come out that clean.  </li>
      <li>These stamping polishes are far too translucent and not pigmented enough to cut it.</li>

<li> /&gt;Konad is absolutely a better product, but this stuff is significantly less expensive.  </li>
<li> but i want to know if these come in other colors like silver white and so on.</li>
<li> The other colors are too runny, especially the amethyst.  </li>
<li> No success.</li>
<li> However, in this case I was looking for Stamping Polish for plates I had previously bought from them.  </li>
<li> It was dried out when it came.</li>
<li> Green and orange and purple worked the best.&lt;br</li>
<li> of the colors work as well on a polished nail for stamping as a plain nail.  </li>
<li> would not recommend this for a stamping polish, too thin.</li>
<li> I bought other brands and they were crap</li>
<li> light/aqua blue worked the worst of the 6 colors.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been having bad luck with non KONAD brand stamping items.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed.  </li>
<li> Chose your base polish wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with these.  </li>

    <li> There are magnificent! I am so glad I bought all three in the set! I find that the color and the pigment in them are amazing!</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t marveled with this polish nail, the drops sung. very nice colors do</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with these.  I can get the orange, yellow and green to work, but the images do not come out that clean.  The other colors are too runny, especially the amethyst.  My only thought is that I can try a different stamper which I&#x27;m awaiting now.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price for a set of beautiful colors</li>
    <li> The 2nd order is on the way soon. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set of polishes. I&#x27;ve been using them for a while, and I&#x27;m really happy with how well they work. The colors are nice and strong, and compared to Konad stamping polishes I&#x27;ve found they are easier to work with. The only bummer is that they&#x27;re not opaque, so you will have to use them over lighter colors. With that said, I think the yellow and orange in particular are better than their Konad equivalents. The pigmentation is stronger.</li>
    <li> For the most part, I really like this polish. It is great to use for stamping because of the opacity. However, one of the polishes was not usable.  It was dried out when it came.</li>
    <li> not all the colors work well.</li>
    <li> Love these so much&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try the whole collection&lt;br /&gt;Very opage (spelling) colors I&#x27;m super impressed&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth. Love the colors. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Another great product from BMC, they will continue to get my business. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m only just finding these guys.  these colors are very lush and a very shiny finish. While they aren&#x27;t as good as Konad  they are really good for the price</li>
    <li> would not recommend this for a stamping polish, too thin.</li>
    <li> I was not hopeful.  I&#x27;ve been having bad luck with non KONAD brand stamping items.  Nothing seems to measure up.  This is still the case, but I am not telling you not to buy this.  For this price, DO buy it.  You will find uses for stamping and I am positive it will work for other artistic nail methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light/aqua blue worked the worst of the 6 colors.  Green and orange and purple worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;Purple stained my naked nail (when I was testing it as a stamping polish.)&lt;br /&gt;None of the colors work as well on a polished nail for stamping as a plain nail.  Chose your base polish wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konad is absolutely a better product, but this stuff is significantly less expensive.  However, the 3 star review is only based on the product.  I would probably give it a 3.5 if I could bump it up for the cost/value aspect.</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase! Bottles are 13ml and the colors are great! I use them for stamping and they work great! I recommend both collections</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and it was well received!  Shipping was quick and item as described.  I can&#x27;t comment personally on the quality of the product however since I never tested it myself.</li>
    <li> Luv the colors &amp; great for stamping!!</li>
    <li> Love the colors in this set!! I wanted to find some polishes to stamp with that we&#x27;re bright like this! The only down side to them is that they are super thin and sheer that certain colors don&#x27;t show up as bright as you would like them too. But the others are very pretty.</li>
    <li> It was originally a gift to my aunt for her nail salon, she said it worked well and was pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> loved it but i want to know if these come in other colors like silver white and so on. would so buy them as well.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, but none of them work for stamping. I tried different plates, and different stamping pads. No success. I would rather save up for Konad polishes.</li>
    <li> I like BundleMonster items and their selection and their prices are very reasonable and comparable to other sellers.  However, in this case I was looking for Stamping Polish for plates I had previously bought from them.  I was disappointed.  The polish/lacquer is too runny for stamping plates and its really too bad because the colors are really beautiful.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the stamping plates. I bought other brands and they were crap but these are great and bright colors.</li>
    <li> These stamping polishes are far too translucent and not pigmented enough to cut it. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> great colors and super fun</li>
