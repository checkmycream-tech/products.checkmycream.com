      <li>Absolutely love this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>but after you spray it on it smells so much better and</li>
      <li>Delivery on time, quality authentic product, competitor price.</li>
      <li>So pleased with both speedy delivery and the package.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the original Yves Saint Laurent product!</li>
      <li>Great original product at a very competitive price.</li>
      <li>this is the most sexy hot perfume i adore it give  u</li>
      <li>I was a huge fan of Armani sensi and was heartbroken when it was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>At first it smells kind of sweet</li>
      <li>clean smell and always gets compliments</li>
      <li>Although Chanel Allure was my signature scent for many years, I wanted something without so much citrus.</li>
      <li>of all, it&#x27;s a true EDP.</li>
      <li>However, this quickly transforms into a gorgeous white floral.</li>
      <li>The bottle is very pretty</li>
      <li>Middle notes of amaryllis and Sambac jasmine then lead the way to depth and mystery, where amber, white musk and vanilla take a brilliant turn.</li>
      <li>I love that rich spicy type that last on your skin for hours.</li>
      <li>Cin&amp;eacute;ma, a floral sophisticated and original enough for a starring role.</li>
      <li>This was new still in original package.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of this perfume, it means that I&#x27;ve bought it many times from regular retailer stores.</li>
      <li>Great and one of the not so common scent.</li>
      <li>Deep rich undertones of vanilla and amber with sweet notes of almond and clementine.</li>
      <li>It is a pretty fragrance but on me is very light...almost undetectable.  </li>
      <li>I am very picky on my choice of fragrance.</li>
      <li>I researched and found that this scent was very close.  </li>
      <li>Definitely it is a good perfume, sweet fragrance but only problem is longevity, I don&#x27;t know whether this specific piece is defective or it&#x27;s the characteristic of Cinema.</li>
      <li>a ni e feeling n gd attention from ppl arround u highly recommend it</li>
      <li>Morning blooms open in a fresh accord, shimmering with cyclamen, almond and Clementine.</li>
      <li>It is warm amber and white musk with a little balsam to keep it from being too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth every single penny wherever and however you can find it.</li>
      <li>resoning froma bove stated, I&#x27;ve concluded that they&#x27;ve sold me an old fragrance (expiry date is not indicated on the box)...</li>
      <li>This fragrance simply projects a quite confidence and says I AM VERY FEMININE.  </li>
      <li>Smells fabulous as usual.</li>
      <li>I can tell that this one sold here is definitely not genuine, it smells the same as the genuine one, but does not last of clothes for the same time !</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best fragrance EVER!!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I have been looking for this brand for years.  Very glad I found it in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance from seller: Fragrance Alley.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just as it should be,no problem wiyh the smell.B&lt;br /&gt;But the color of the fragrance is DARK! Fragrances become dark when they get old. resoning froma bove stated, I&#x27;ve concluded that they&#x27;ve sold me an old fragrance (expiry date is not indicated on the box)...</li>
    <li> I had the Cinema before and after a few years i did not find it anyware and this was the only place that seems to still carry it. At first it smells kind of sweet but after you spray it on it smells so much better and the scent last all day long. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. :)</li>
    <li> Loveliest...&lt;br /&gt;I can not decide between miss dior and cinema...&lt;br /&gt;I have switched between these two for last 6 years...</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume to give to my aunt, but I am thinking about buy another one for me! It is a great perfume, strong fixative and very outstanding scents!</li>
    <li> Delivery on time, quality authentic product, competitor price. This was new still in original package. Thank you Amazon and vendor we are delighted with this parfume!!!</li>
    <li> I have used for years and keep ordering, just love it! Always got it for myself.  Used every single day.</li>
    <li> This reminds me of Coco Chanel with it own character. A great perfume for holidays.</li>
    <li> Great original product at a very competitive price. However in the shop it is labeled as Cineama by YSL and Donna Karan for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the original Yves Saint Laurent product! Great DEAL!</li>
    <li> I have used Cinema for years.......clean smell and always gets compliments</li>
    <li> Wawoooo this is the most sexy hot perfume i adore it give  u a ni e feeling n gd attention from ppl arround u highly recommend it</li>
    <li> It is a pretty fragrance but on me is very light...almost undetectable.  The bottle is very pretty but I do not believe I will be reordering this.</li>
    <li> love! love! my perfume. it smelled just the way i remembered it</li>
    <li> I regret Yves Saint Laurent doesn&#x60;t do it anymore. I love it and I don&#x60;t know how I&#x60;ll do to change.</li>
    <li> Beautiful sensual scent!!!! I am very picky on my choice of fragrance. I love that rich spicy type that last on your skin for hours. I am impressed with Cinema and it has become a favorite of mine.... best to use in the fall/winter. This fragrance simply projects a quite confidence and says I AM VERY FEMININE.  You will get hooked on this fragrance. Dillards use to carry it now I have only seen it here. At least it arrives at my door instead of another shpping trip. Try it, enough said....Summer V  Houston Tx</li>
    <li> I bought for my wife as a gift and I love it and my wife like it to I will recommend it as a gift</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smelling really nice!</li>
    <li> Although Chanel Allure was my signature scent for many years, I wanted something without so much citrus. I actually bought this blind as it is not carried in any stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinema is everything that I wanted. The 1st minute is a little overpowering. However, this quickly transforms into a gorgeous white floral. The drydown is almost beyond words. It is warm amber and white musk with a little balsam to keep it from being too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, it&#x27;s a true EDP. It lasts and lasts. Worth every single penny wherever and however you can find it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful clean feagrance</li>
    <li> So pleased with both speedy delivery and the package.  I was a huge fan of Armani sensi and was heartbroken when it was discontinued.  I researched and found that this scent was very close.  I was delighted to find this was true.</li>
    <li> Got it on time. Smells fabulous as usual.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and the price was good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this perfume, it means that I&#x27;ve bought it many times from regular retailer stores. I can tell that this one sold here is definitely not genuine, it smells the same as the genuine one, but does not last of clothes for the same time ! Also the perfume head (the sprayer) does not function properly, it always stuck then I have to press it few times before it sprays! Very bad experience.</li>
    <li> My daughter has always loved this scent and was running out. We thought it was not available but there it was on Amazon, thank you. It was a wonderful surprise...</li>
    <li> Great and one of the not so common scent. Very French. Packaging great.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my wife, she loves this fragrance and it was a good surprise! Very nice!</li>
    <li> Definitely it is a good perfume, sweet fragrance but only problem is longevity, I don&#x27;t know whether this specific piece is defective or it&#x27;s the characteristic of Cinema.</li>
    <li> A perfume that leaves you satisfied. Deep rich undertones of vanilla and amber with sweet notes of almond and clementine. Absolutely love this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the description from Yves Saint Laurent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glamorous, seductive, startling. Cin&amp;eacute;ma, a floral sophisticated and original enough for a starring role. Morning blooms open in a fresh accord, shimmering with cyclamen, almond and Clementine. Middle notes of amaryllis and Sambac jasmine then lead the way to depth and mystery, where amber, white musk and vanilla take a brilliant turn. Set-lighting-inspired crystal flacon with gold stopper.</li>
