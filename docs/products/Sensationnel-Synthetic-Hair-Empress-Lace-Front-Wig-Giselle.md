<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this wig for a costume. Surprisingly good wig for the price.  I may even wear it for fun now.  Kind of on the thinner side but it wears well when styled right.  I also find it a bit too shiny.  I ended up remendying it by spraying a dry shampoo all over it and it gave it much more of a natural look.  Not too sure anyone could tell it was a wig.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the wig doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars worth the money don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews it&#x27;s a great price So no one should even be complaining. I got it in black and within a week I got it it went by so fast! And I love it the curls it comes with are PERFECT!!!! They are bouncy and perfect this wig isn&#x27;t a bad buy! and it is perfect for a person who&#x27;s just starting out! Thank you it is perfect and it fits very well with my hairline I can put it up in a ponytail too. Without seeing my sides. Just a perfect wig to start off with.</li>
    <li> This hair was ok. I ordered mines in jet black it also arrived on time. It did start to lose it curls after a couple days but it&#x27;s a good wig</li>
    <li> this is was my first time purchasing a wig and i gotta say... im impressed... its nice and soft and just pretty the curls arent exactly like the pic its more like romantic curls if that makes any sense... i actually wanted the color in the pic but  i picked the first choice thinking it was going to look like the one in the pic but 1 means jet black... my fault but i still like the wig itself.... id reccomnend this one!</li>
    <li> This wig is bouncy, natural, and gorgeous! I wore it many times before straightening it, and even after straightening it&#x27;s still amazing, and it&#x27;s my favorite wig. VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> normally when I get a lace front wig it fit my head to the T&lt;br /&gt;(even though I still have to tightened my wig more)&lt;br /&gt;with this wig it didn&#x27;t fit my head to the T instead its a little too small&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t get me wrong it fit with discomfort</li>
    <li> nice lace front...hair looks natural looking, soft and comfortable for everyday wear. I would recommend this to any woman that wants to look and feel beautiful.</li>
    <li> The wig was exactly what it looked it on the picture. It was quite full contrary to some of the reviews I read about it. Will definitely recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, well made and the lace is very nice and easy to blend in. The only issue I have with this product is that the wig is pretty thin but the hair has so much volume it doesn&#x27;t matter at all!</li>
    <li> looks great on the wife</li>
    <li> it shipped fast which was great but it doesn&#x27;t look like it does in the picture at all&lt;br /&gt;and it came with this part which I guess is supposed to be for baby hairs. don&#x27;t like that part its hard to tuck it in as well&lt;br /&gt;other than that the curls are lovely.</li>
    <li> I loved my hair piece. I will definitely order again. Easy to apply just do not apply heat as it will burn</li>
    <li> The hair I got I was not happy just simply on how it fit. It really didn&#x27;t frame my face as I thought it would. The company did a good job&lt;br /&gt;With package and the quality of the hair was nice and soft. It&#x27;s just this wasn&#x27;t the hair for me :(</li>
    <li> god i love it every one told me i look n my man was in love thanks i recomend this wig to every one</li>
    <li> Ehh, Not realllly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Barely any lace to make a realistc part, sheds a lot, and is kinda&#x27; thin.  I haven&#x27;t wore it out yet, but I&#x27;ll think about it</li>
    <li> very nice wig looks like real hair it was beautiful</li>
    <li> His product is nice. So is the free gift I have received! Thanks</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this wig. It is beautiful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s giving me LIFE!!! This lace front is perfect, good price, and received it a day before expected. You should definitely buy from this producer.</li>
    <li> The product was easy to manage and fit true to description. It is heat safe but up to 400. The wig fit comfortable and not to tight at all</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my head right so my hair was sticking out n I bought a red color disappointed with the way the tracks at the top were not able to style it well</li>
    <li> This wig is one of my favorites. I go back to it A LOT. It is simple and it is easy. It is long but I like to cute mine. So I think the longest I&#x27;ve ever gone with this wig is about 2 months and that was with wearing it 3-4 times a week. I of course, throughout that time, did cut it. It did end up a bob but it makes a really GREAT bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is soft. It has three combs in in the front. 2 on each side and one in the middle and one in the back. I do pull out some of my own hair in the front to make it look more natural. The part is not that deep. It used to be deeper and more natural looking, but the last one I got about a month ago, I could tell they changed it up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is an excellent piece. You can do a lot with it too. I have bought it probably 3-4 times. Probably more.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig. Although it doesnt look like the picture it is thinner. Its pretty natural looking ive had it for going on two weeks and no matting whatsoever. This will definitely be my go to wig.</li>
    <li> I love the hair so smooth and soft</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful!,the curls are so amazing! I loveeeeee it!I was nerveou when i got it but once i put on its felt so good.If you love lace wig get this wig.</li>
    <li> Shipping came fast love the wig my man said oooowee baby !!!! ppl ask me who did your hair lol</li>
    <li> I like the texture of the hair, and the caps  fits perfectly to my head, I would recommend it toanyone</li>
    <li> Giselle is beautiful I totally love her she looks just like the picture.Texture is soft curls are really nice I would buy this wig again</li>
    <li> I am loving this wig...does not shed... you can wear it everyday....easy maintenance. ..don&#x27;t sleep in. ..in love</li>
    <li> Hello perfect beauty when I get my wig I will do a wig review on my YouTube and I am all so a drag queen</li>
    <li> Chose this hair primarily to wear on vacation. As stated by other buyers the hair is thin and LOOK S nothing like the picture. They length is shorter than the actual picture also. Length I would say is shoulder.  I would not recommend this product . It&#x27;s not worth the time or the money</li>
    <li> I Love  this weave, feels amazing, looks amazing, shipping was extremely fast! And you can&#x27;t beat this price for such a good quality product! I will be buying more just to have  on hand in case they stop selling them..</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering hair online and I&#x27;m very happy I took the chance. When you first open the package the curls are different really loose,romantic and they snap right back. After combing or brushing them out the curls become wavy but if you run your fingers through it or shake your head around the loose curls come back. This is my second week wearing it and im still in love. I did have to cut the ends a bit because they did get a little trashy. Overall shes great!!!</li>
    <li> This is my go to wig!~  It is beautiful, but it is not as full as the picture provided with the description.  But that has not kept me from purchasing this same wig over and over.  The wig, if properly cared for, could last at a minimum of three months.  I don&#x27;t like to place a lot of products on the wig; I think it shortens the life of the wig.  You will receive compliments on this wig.</li>
    <li> Wig I received looks nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s really thin and only one color.</li>
    <li> Needed for pageant! Perfect</li>
    <li> I brought the wig for a friend, she said this wig did not work well for her.</li>
    <li> Love thus hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t get tangled easy.</li>
