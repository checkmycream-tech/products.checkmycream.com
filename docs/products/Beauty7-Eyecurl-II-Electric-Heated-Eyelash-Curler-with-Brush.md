      <li>This one is better at separating them.  </li>
      <li>In 29 years I have not been able to see what my eyelashes looked like curled.  </li>
      <li>This came very quickly and I was very excited.</li>
      <li>I guess so far so great</li>
      <li>product heats up quickly but it&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself using it.</li>
      <li>someone with stick-straight Asian lashes, I am SO happy with the holding power of Eyecurl II when combined with my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to injure yourself using any type eye product, let alone something that requires heat.  </li>

      <li>Well worth your money!</li>
      <li>Love it better than my old one I bought at Wal-Mart.</li>
      <li>I use it before mascara as to not have to clean mascara off of it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>but my super straight ones are going to take a lot more effort</li>
      <li>Also, battery seems to die out rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>It might take time on how to properly use it and make that good curls but its really worth it.</li>
      <li>Heats quickly and the curl lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the best because it heats up fast and really hot (Be careful!)</li>
      <li>The curler heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>they looked great but with in two hrs trying to soften/straighten just a little, it will take a lil time to train them</li>
      <li>Really works fantastic.  </li>
      <li>the old fushion one.it works better and faster.</li>
      <li>I have been using mascara everyday since I was 18 and by far this is the best eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>It takes regular AA battery which is great because it holds a charge for many days when compared with other curling wands which use AAA.</li>
      <li>I love the curl that my extensions and own lashes get out of this little wand!</li>
      <li>some if you use it right after you put on mascara and take time with it.  </li>
      <li>Heats up super quick and lifts natural lashes.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s get hot with no result and time</li>
      <li>And the first time I used it my mind was BLOWN.  </li>
      <li>Is it possible to be in love with a product?</li>
      <li>This one heats up but not so hot you&#x27;d ever get burned.</li>
      <li>Apply mascara first.</li>
      <li>(I choose Maybelline Full and Soft).  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
      <li>but I have short some straight, some semi curl, super baby soft fine lashes...</li>
      <li>but it actually does just fine.</li>
      <li>But with this heated eyelash curler they curl up so high and stay all day!  </li>
      <li>it works REALLY</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m amaze that it really works.</li>
      <li>The tip changes colors when ready which takes maybe 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like this heated  lash curler</li>
      <li>It heats fast but doesn&#x27;t hurt and gives you the curl.</li>
      <li>This is an absolute must for anyone who wants longer looking lashes.</li>
      <li>but I do make sure I keep a small pack of fresh batteries in my vanity.  </li>
      <li>so much that I keep an extra one in my car and another one in my purse for such occasions such as after-work happy hour and date night when I need an extra OOMPH.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My only issue is that even though it is hot already, the top of it remains a red color when it is suppose to be white when hot.</li>
      <li>This is better than conventional eyelash curlers!  </li>
      <li>LOVE this little gadget.  </li>
      <li>It does require a new battery each week.</li>
      <li>I first use a regular metal eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>it get this one you won&#x27;t be dissapointed, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
      <li>The other curler is better at getting them to go in the same direction.  </li>
      <li>This works far better than the traditional eyelash curlers and produces results that last all day and also makes my eyelashes look nicer than with traditional eyelash curlers.  </li>
      <li>I will differently ordering more of this product as long as it last a while....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The batteries lasted longer than the other one I had. Gets hotter than my other one did. Seems sturdy. I like it a lot. I use it before mascara as to not have to clean mascara off of it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish you could plug it into outlet to charge 😄</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product eyecurl 2 heated eyelash curler after seeing ENKORE in youtube using this.  I have long, black and downward Asian lashes so I gave this product a try and I&#x27;m amaze that it really works. It heats fast but doesn&#x27;t hurt and gives you the curl. It might take time on how to properly use it and make that good curls but its really worth it. No more crimping with my mechanical eyelash curler. Love the product and enjoying my curled lashes.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005LAE6MM Eyecurl II Heated Eyelash Extension Curler with Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIGGEST GARBAGE EVER!!  2 uses with recommended battery, 1 with a different one.  DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!&lt;br /&gt;Better use a spoon like I read from other people.  At least that&#x27;s free of charge.  RIDICULOUS, BAD and USELESS invention!!!&lt;br /&gt;The other heated eyelush curlers are as bad too.  I rather go back to the old&#x27;n traditional one.&lt;br /&gt;DON WAIST YOUR MONEY.  I ALREADY DID IT FOR YOU!!!  Remember I warned you!&lt;br /&gt;Ines</li>
    <li> LOVE this little gadget.  No more pulling my eyelashes out with the million year old &amp;#34;crimpers&amp;#34;. My eye lashes are nicely curled within seconds. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this heated  lash curler I don&#x27;t like the crimpers, they seem to dent my lashes. This one heats up but not so hot you&#x27;d ever get burned. Handle is large enough to grip. Takes just a little practice if you&#x27;ve ever curled your lashes. They will looked curved not dented up. The tip changes colors when ready which takes maybe 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me. I use Latisse and have very long, straight lashes. When I use a traditional curler, I often get pinched or end up losing lashes every time I use them so I thought I&#x27;d try this.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice and the product seems to be well made. The instructions were poor, translated into English from either Chinese or Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;The product heats up quickly but it&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself using it. I tried holding it against my lashes for about 30 seconds, bending the lashes upward, hoping to get a bit of curl. All I got was uncomfortably warm eyelids and no curl. I would not buy this again. Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Love the eyelash curler.  Really works fantastic.  Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have the same problem with the batteries that others had and that is they just don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.  Other than that, i&#x27;d order again.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with my eyelashes never curling and pointing straight down.  So bad in fact that I thought about either having them removed or try perming them knowing I was risking potentially going blind because of it.  Curlers didnt work.  at all.  So one day my husband was on YouTube looking up ways to curl &amp;#34;Asian eyelashes&amp;#34; and he found a video that showed how the Eyecurl II worked and I figured....what the heck?  And the first time I used it my mind was BLOWN.  In 29 years I have not been able to see what my eyelashes looked like curled.  And now, I DOOOOOO!!!!  The best product ever.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find that my lashes stayed curled any longer than using my regular curler.  Decided maybe the heat would harm my lashes so stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Love it better than my old one I bought at Wal-Mart. The battery lasts longer as advertised.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curler!  Traditional pinch curlers rip my eyelashes out, and they don&#x27;t even curl all that well.  But with this heated eyelash curler they curl up so high and stay all day!  Even if they fall a little bit, just whip out the curler and voila!  They look even better!  I usually curl my lashes, apply mascara, let it dry, and then curl them again.  They look amazing!  It looks like i&#x27;m wearing fake lashes, I&#x27;m so in love with them now!  And the battery seems to last a decent amount of time!  I&#x27;ll never go back to traditional curlers again!</li>
    <li> I love this curler! it works REALLY well, the only complaint i have is the cap does not stay on very well</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. more like Shiseido eye curler.</li>
    <li> Love this. Used on my eyelash extension so and on my natural. I had to practice . I like to use this before and then again after I put my mascara on. Seems to work best. I have ordered 3 for other family members!</li>
    <li> I first use a regular metal eyelash curler.  Then apply one very light coat of waterproof mascara.  Waterproof!  (I choose Maybelline Full and Soft).  Let dry a minute or two.  Then use this Heated Eyecurl II.  I apply a second coat of mascara but I always use a different brand or type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that have this curler and didn&#x27;t think it worked, use this method.  Gotta love YouTube.  I threw away the Panasonic heated curler because it doesn&#x27;t compare even though I&#x27;ve always loved Panasonic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this every day.  It doesn&#x27;t go through a lot of batteries but I do make sure I keep a small pack of fresh batteries in my vanity.  This item will get warm to hot.  I&#x27;ve never burned myself on this curler.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, than that&#x27;s quality control but I haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
    <li> I bought two different eyelash curlers.  I have one eye where the lashes grow in all different directions.  The other curler is better at getting them to go in the same direction.  This one is better at separating them.  It does require a new battery each week.</li>
    <li> This is alright if you have lots of time, it does curl eyelashes some if you use it right after you put on mascara and take time with it.  On lashes without mascara, not at all.  At least it doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
    <li> It definitely takes some working with to fully get the hang of using it.  I&#x27;ve been using the wand to heat my lashes, then using my old curling device to set the curl.  A quick dash of mascara and the lashes stay great for longer than they did before I heated them.</li>
    <li> This works far better than the traditional eyelash curlers and produces results that last all day and also makes my eyelashes look nicer than with traditional eyelash curlers.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product.  I&#x27;m considering ordering another one as a backup.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I bought this product in Asia while on vacation and accidentally dropped it on the ground after using it for couple months.  It broke so I had to purchase another one.  Thankfully, Amazon carried it.  To prep my eyelashes for the perfect curls, I curl my eyelashes first with a regular eyelash curler. Then, apply mascara.  Before the mascara dries, I use the heated eyelash curler to my eyelashes.  My eyelashes stay curled all day. Can&#x27;t live without it!! Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Never owned a heated lash curler before but I have short some straight, some semi curl, super baby soft fine lashes...I read lot of reviews, I mean lots and viewed several You Tube videos and I was sold on this one.... you can use it before applying primer or mascara  and or after I did both you can also use it one both top and bottom lashes which I love ....My already curled lashes are staying curled but my super straight ones are going to take a lot more effort they looked great but with in two hrs trying to soften/straighten just a little, it will take a lil time to train them I guess so far so great I will differently ordering more of this product as long as it last a while....</li>
    <li> This product is okay and will do its job, but I think it&#x27;s dangerous to put anything heated near your eye.  It&#x27;s easy to injure yourself using any type eye product, let alone something that requires heat.  Also, battery seems to die out rather quickly.  It will not take a rechargeable.  I also find it a bit awkward using my right hand to hold and curl the left eye lashes with a heated curler.  Probably because it makes me a bit nervous.  Think I wasted my money on this product.  A regular eye lash curler may be a bit harder on the lashes but it actually does just fine.</li>
    <li> This came very quickly and I was very excited. It takes an AA battery so it is a heavier than some of the other heated eyelash curlers. I&#x27;ve never tried one before and after reading through reviews, I decided on this one based on the youtube video by ENKORE. The curler heats up fast and is easy to use. You just apply mascara, use the curler after the mascara has dried and then reapply mascara. Easy and quick, I do it at work! My only issue is that even though it is hot already, the top of it remains a red color when it is suppose to be white when hot. It doesn&#x27;t neccessarily burn or anything. This is a good alternative to extensions or perms.</li>
    <li> I am a Asian girl with very straight and short eye lashes. I have been using mascara everyday since I was 18 and by far this is the best eyelash curler. I had used a wide range of eyelash curler: Maybelline (the best of the manual one), Shu Umera, Kevin Aucoin, Shiseido, Cover girl, etc and the heated one from Sephora, Panasonic etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best because it heats up fast and really hot (Be careful!) and It&#x27;s sturdy. other heated one usually will break in 1 year. but this one I have been using it daily for 2 years and still heat up fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tips to use: apply mascara, and use this curler. make sure you apply from bottom of your lashes.</li>
    <li> The item is not the way I expect it .thats not curl the eye lashes .who ever used be carful it that&#x27;s get hot with no result and time consuming.i prefer the old fushion one.it works better and faster.</li>
    <li> If you have stick straight asian lashes that are hard to curl, this is the product for you. Watch the YouTube tutorial, it heats up quickly, and is so easy to use. I&#x27;ll never go without this product again!!! There are many heated lash curlers on Amazon, if your on the fence about it get this one you won&#x27;t be dissapointed, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised! I wish when I was comparing curlers someone would have said &amp;#34;get this one&amp;#34; so get this one!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Works so well, and no eyelashes fall out compared to your conventional manual eyelash curler! I love the curl that my extensions and own lashes get out of this little wand!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
    <li> Tried this several times. Not as good as the panasonic one.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have lash extentions and I cant use a regular eyelash curler.  This is my second heated curler and this one and the last one are pieces of junk.  These heated curlers just dont work, mine is in the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter and she is getting good results. I would recommend for anyone who needs a polished look to their makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this! The battery lasted months before I had to change it and this product works! I have extremely short straight stubborn lashes and this does the trick</li>
    <li> I love the Eyecurl  II.  Heats quickly and the curl lasts all day.  This is a second purchase as I do not want to be out of this product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> For those with lashes that break when using a regular eyelash curler - this is for you.  It works without eyelash breakage!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT A wonderful product Very easy to use and convenient&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT GIFTS.  perfect eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005LAE6MM Eyecurl II Heated Eyelash Extension Curler with Brush]]</li>
    <li> Heats up super quick and lifts natural lashes. Also discovered  that fake lashes stay on for weeks because the glue keeps refusing at the base. Well worth your money!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is wayyyy better than the Japonesque one I bought before. It curls my eyelashes absolutely perfectly and I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning through 5 batteries a week.</li>
    <li> Is it possible to be in love with a product? I am, with Eyecurl II. This curler provides the most natural sky-high lashes of any curler I have ever tried, and the best part? The curl lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique:&lt;br /&gt;- Apply mascara first. My favorite is the Kevyn Aucoin The Curling mascara ([[ASIN:B000Z603OC Kevyn Aucoin Curling Mascara, Black, 0.5 Gram]] - see my review). Allow it to dry completely - I usually apply other makeup during this time. Then turn on the Eyecurl II with its easy \\&quot;ON\\&quot; switch. You will know when it&#x27;s fully heated because the little red dot at the tip and along the applicator turn white (~40 seconds). Then you \\&quot;scoop\\&quot; your lashes at the base and hold against your lid for about 15 seconds. VOILA gorgeous lashes which reach to the sky! You can even \\&quot;walk\\&quot; the Eyecurl along your lashes to provide a \\&quot;curlier\\&quot; curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO PINCHING, no lost lashes, just the most beautiful curly skyward lashes. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with stick-straight Asian lashes, I am SO happy with the holding power of Eyecurl II when combined with my favorite mascara. I kid you not, my curl lasts ALL DAY even when it rains. If I am going out, I will do a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; because the curl will fall a tiny bit after 8 hours, but by no means is it noticeable. I love this Eyecurl II so much that I keep an extra one in my car and another one in my purse for such occasions such as after-work happy hour and date night when I need an extra OOMPH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS EYECURL II. Get it for yourself, get it for friends - it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It takes regular AA battery which is great because it holds a charge for many days when compared with other curling wands which use AAA. I use rechargeable Eneloop batteries.</li>
    <li> This is better than conventional eyelash curlers!  Will not crease your lashes. This is an absolute must for anyone who wants longer looking lashes. I am a licensed cosmetogist and I recommend this to everyone!</li>
