### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>A great surprise!</li>
      <li>This is THE BEST flosser on the market.  </li>
      <li>Since I began using this flosser, my dentist has been impressed.</li>
      <li>If you have problems with your hands or just don&#x27;t like wrapping floss around your fingers, this is the perfect solution.  </li>
      <li>Everyone loves them, and they&#x27;re the perfect thing for folks who know they should floss but just can&#x27;t bring themselves to do it.  </li>
      <li>Oh what a great feeling!!</li>
      <li>, therefore, this works perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>Very good, a good variation of the hummingbird plus it has an on off switch</li>
      <li>This gadget takes the difficulty out of flossing and does a great job.  </li>
      <li>I use this flosser and my dentist just told me I am doing a great job flossing.</li>
      <li>Good company, good product!  </li>
      <li>Flossers are great and service was good.</li>
      <li>I used one of these for a while, then it deteriorated, and took me a while to find one that works as good as this one</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the shipment and service.</li>
      <li>I love this flosser!  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love them too!</li>
      <li>but we love them!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>and I really liked the one I had</li>
      <li>I got on the web and found them, and I&#x27;m sure glad I did!  </li>
      <li>This flosser is FAR superior to the one I was using (and I liked that one!)</li>
      <li>I do hope the cartridges are readily available, they are WELL worth the cost, this product makes flossing easy and feels good too!</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t really offer a comparison except to say that this tool works great and is lacking nothing.    </li>
      <li>This one is even better, so I&#x27;m GLAD</li>
      <li>The product is great although it would be really helpful if it could stand up on</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for making a great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>The 3 items all work perfectly as did my prior flosser until I dropped it one too many times.</li>
      <li>Hard-to-find-at-retail is getting to be more of problem all the time.</li>
      <li>My favorite power flosser was chewed up by my puppy</li>
      <li>love it..</li>
      <li>So glad I bought a 3-pack</li>
      <li>This will make you want to floss more often because of the ease of use.  </li>
      <li>But, all this being said, it&#x27;s a great way to floss, easy, fast, efficient.</li>
      <li>One hand use, quick and effective.</li>
      <li>So great that I didn&#x27;t need a cleaning in 5 yrs so far.</li>
      <li>and this allows me to floss easily.</li>
      <li>the ones you want to keep!\\&quot; and this makes it easy.</li>
      <li>and it makes flossing so easy.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a battery-powered flosser (or any flosser for that matter) that not does an excellent job cleaning between teeth but also makes flossing much much easier that the traditional &amp;#34;string-in-a-box&amp;#34; or even that &amp;#</li>
      <li>Since at the moment this item is no longer available on Amazon, I thought I should mention that, although the vibration is helpful, I believe the non-powered version of this tool would work just as well.</li>
      <li>Great product for the occasional flosser.</li>
      <li>Hope both remain available.</li>
      <li>You will not find these readily available in stores.  </li>
      <li>This product was a replacement which is no longer available in the stores.  </li>
      <li>cartridge should be used once and then thrown away, but even using one a day these remain a fairly cheap option, given the added convenience they offer.</li>
      <li>and everything went smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This item was easy to find at amazon -- so i bought a 3-pack through a marketplace seller who provided quick, well-packed service.</li>
      <li>They are quick and easy.</li>
      <li>I cannot help but assert that the Reach Access Daily Flosser is by far the best flossing product I&#x27;ve ever</li>
      <li>Makes it easy and fun, and your mouth feels so much cleaner.  </li>
      <li>and it really makes your teeth feel clean after using it.  </li>
      <li>They make flossing so much better and are great for reaching those hard to reach places!!</li>
      <li>As far as I know, they are no longer available except online.</li>
      <li>I use each disposable head more than once, but only by rinsing them off and dipping them in Listerine.  </li>
      <li>There was a time when I thought that I would not be able to find the power flosser in stores and tried a different battery-operated flosser -if</li>
      <li>Very well made, and ready to go with battery!</li>
      <li>much easier than using your fingers around the floss wires</li>
      <li>I found this treasure several years ago when buying flosser heads for a free Access Reach flosser handle.  </li>
      <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
      <li>Thanks,    </li>
      <li>And, I really needed 3.  </li>
      <li>Companies have tried making special floss and special gadgets to help make the chore a little easier, but none of them really do the job well- until</li>
      <li>These flossers are more effective and easier to use that regular floss or even Reach, especially with very tight teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy, you&#x27;ll floss everyday.  </li>
      <li>You can REACH all your teeth even way to the back, and it gently slides between the tighter ones.</li>
      <li>The wife, 12 yr old</li>
      <li>Old Gringo</li>
      <li>I have no trouble getting my ten year old to floss now.</li>
      <li>My hygienist is very impressed with my dental hygiene in the three years I&#x27;ve used it, and has recommended it to other patients who hate flossing.</li>

<li> I chose this tool over some other \\&quot;pick\\&quot; style flossers (such as Hummingbird) because I couldn&#x27;t visualize how one would reach between the back teeth with one of those.  </li>
<li> The cartridge stays put and allows you to floss every tooth in your mouth in about as long as it takes you to brush, if not faster!</li>
<li> Flossing was too difficult, too time-consuming, and often painful (the floss always cut into and caused blisters in my fingers) until this excellent product came along.  </li>
<li> The last few months I&#x27;ve been looking for them at various stores, Wal-Mart, Target, COSTCO, etc.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s made me floss everyday</li>
<li> eliminates waste on floss wires...</li>
<li> In other words, you can spend a couple bucks on a \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; floss roll and rarely use it because it is annoying, or you can spend a few cents a day on these and have a cleaner, healthier mouth.</li>
<li> I really love these flossers, and it&#x27;s terrible that Reach no longer makes them.  </li>
<li> I am not sure if they make these anymore</li>
<li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it is that, lately, it&#x27;s been difficult to find in stores that used to stock it.  </li>

<li> If flossing is uncomfortable for you this is the tool you need.</li>
<li> I hated flossing the usual way.  </li>

    <li> I used one of these for a while, then it deteriorated, and took me a while to find one that works as good as this one</li>
    <li> Very good, a good variation of the hummingbird plus it has an on off switch (no need to keep pressed)</li>
    <li> I cannot help but assert that the Reach Access Daily Flosser is by far the best flossing product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, flossing is annoying. Companies have tried making special floss and special gadgets to help make the chore a little easier, but none of them really do the job well- until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reach Flosser puts the individual floss cartridge on a toothbrush-style stick (which you can get in motorised or non-motorised formats) The cartridge stays put and allows you to floss every tooth in your mouth in about as long as it takes you to brush, if not faster! No fussing with sticking your fingers into your mouth, or fighting to get some gadget to hold the floss properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each cartridge should be used once and then thrown away, but even using one a day these remain a fairly cheap option, given the added convenience they offer. In other words, you can spend a couple bucks on a \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; floss roll and rarely use it because it is annoying, or you can spend a few cents a day on these and have a cleaner, healthier mouth.</li>
    <li> This gadget takes the difficulty out of flossing and does a great job.  It&#x27;s so easy, you&#x27;ll floss everyday.  It&#x27;s made me floss everyday and I never did before because it was just a pain.</li>
    <li> I had already owned one of these flossers but wanted to get one for some other people that had trouble trying to floss with their fingers in their mouth.  These vibrate too so that the dental floss gets between the teeth easier.    If flossing is uncomfortable for you this is the tool you need.</li>
    <li> My family enjoys using these Power Flossers.  They are quick and easy. I have no trouble getting my ten year old to floss now. I got the three pack for me, my husband, and my daughter.  Thanks so much for making a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Flossing was too difficult, too time-consuming, and often painful (the floss always cut into and caused blisters in my fingers) until this excellent product came along.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it is that, lately, it&#x27;s been difficult to find in stores that used to stock it.  I hope this isn&#x27;t a harbinger of a phase-out.  My hygienist is very impressed with my dental hygiene in the three years I&#x27;ve used it, and has recommended it to other patients who hate flossing.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if they make these anymore but we love them! They make flossing so much better and are great for reaching those hard to reach places!!</li>
    <li> Hey...  I did not get 3 units, only got two.  And, I really needed 3.  The product is great although it would be really helpful if it could stand up on it&#x27;s own - I don&#x27;t get it why they made it with a round end... ?  But, all this being said, it&#x27;s a great way to floss, easy, fast, efficient.</li>
    <li> I have been hooked on this flosser since 2000. I hate putting my fingers in my mouth etc., therefore, this works perfectly for me. I use daily. Bought one for work, home, and all 3 cars. Plus, wafe and daughter use also.   I feel as though I just had my teeth cleaned after using. Oh what a great feeling!!</li>
    <li> This product was a replacement which is no longer available in the stores.  Promotes flossing in the family.  Very pleased with the shipment and service.</li>
    <li> The wife, 12 yr old and I all have one of these and it really makes your teeth feel clean after using it.  I HATE flossing, but this thing makes it simple, quick and thorough.  Would recommend for any one over seven.</li>
    <li> Since I began using this flosser, my dentist has been impressed. My teeth are very close together and this allows me to floss easily.</li>
    <li> My item was delievered quickly and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the seller but the item itself was disappointing. In a pack of 3, one worked, one didn&#x27;t and one only works marginally well. I can&#x27;t find these in the store anymore and I really liked the one I had so I oredered it online. I was disappointed in the performance of the product.</li>
    <li> Hard-to-find-at-retail is getting to be more of problem all the time. This item was easy to find at amazon -- so i bought a 3-pack through a marketplace seller who provided quick, well-packed service. The 3 items all work perfectly as did my prior flosser until I dropped it one too many times. If you have problems with your hands or just don&#x27;t like wrapping floss around your fingers, this is the perfect solution.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I love this flosser!  I found this treasure several years ago when buying flosser heads for a free Access Reach flosser handle.  There was a time when I thought that I would not be able to find the power flosser in stores and tried a different battery-operated flosser -if I can&#x27;t use the Reach Access Power flosser I will go back to manual flossing.</li>
    <li> Great product for the occasional flosser. This will make you want to floss more often because of the ease of use.  One hand use, quick and effective.</li>
    <li> I hated flossing the usual way.  Now it takes less than one minute.  No need to wrap floss around fingers.  No need for fingers inside mouth.    I chose this tool over some other \\&quot;pick\\&quot; style flossers (such as Hummingbird) because I couldn&#x27;t visualize how one would reach between the back teeth with one of those.  So I can&#x27;t really offer a comparison except to say that this tool works great and is lacking nothing.    I use each disposable head more than once, but only by rinsing them off and dipping them in Listerine.  (Otherwise it would be gross.)  Your mileage may vary.    Since at the moment this item is no longer available on Amazon, I thought I should mention that, although the vibration is helpful, I believe the non-powered version of this tool would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I really love these flossers, and it&#x27;s terrible that Reach no longer makes them.  They are also very hard to find, even on Amazon.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a battery-powered flosser (or any flosser for that matter) that not does an excellent job cleaning between teeth but also makes flossing much much easier that the traditional &amp;#34;string-in-a-box&amp;#34; or even that &amp;#34;pick-flossers&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that if anyone finds these, you buy them...you&#x27;ll love them too!</li>
    <li> My favorite power flosser was chewed up by my puppy and I could not find another one anywhere. I was panicked because I&#x27;m an obsessive flosser, BUT I CANNOT floss with manual floss, it&#x27;s just too awkward and tedious! I came across this one and decided to try. This flosser is FAR superior to the one I was using (and I liked that one!) and it makes flossing so easy. You can REACH all your teeth even way to the back, and it gently slides between the tighter ones. The cartridge STAYS ON, which was a problem I had with my other model that I just dealt with. A great surprise! Very well made, and ready to go with battery! So glad I bought a 3-pack, now I have extras if my puppy HAPPENS to get it again (not likely!), I was lost without my power flosser! This one is even better, so I&#x27;m GLAD this happened now. I do hope the cartridges are readily available, they are WELL worth the cost, this product makes flossing easy and feels good too! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for years...a while back they disappeared from brick-and-mortar stores, so I&#x27;ve had to shop for them online.  Believe it or not, I give them as gifts, because they are definitely the gift that keeps on giving.  Everyone loves them, and they&#x27;re the perfect thing for folks who know they should floss but just can&#x27;t bring themselves to do it.  Makes it easy and fun, and your mouth feels so much cleaner.  I would bet dentists are fans, too.</li>
    <li> I use this flosser and my dentist just told me I am doing a great job flossing. So great that I didn&#x27;t need a cleaning in 5 yrs so far. Yippyyyy.</li>
    <li> convenient flossing ...easy to change heads....love it..much easier than using your fingers around the floss wires eliminates waste on floss wires...</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST flosser on the market.  You will not find these readily available in stores.  The flosser packs are but not this wand that vibrates. I was always told by my dentist, \\&quot;Floss the ones you want to keep!\\&quot; and this makes it easy.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Reach Power Flosser almost from day one.  The last few months I&#x27;ve been looking for them at various stores, Wal-Mart, Target, COSTCO, etc. and find they are not being stocked any longer.    I got on the web and found them, and I&#x27;m sure glad I did!  The company stocking them sent them ASAP and everything went smoothly.  Good company, good product!  Thanks,    Old Gringo</li>
    <li> These flossers are more effective and easier to use that regular floss or even Reach, especially with very tight teeth. As far as I know, they are no longer available except online. Flossers are great and service was good. Hope both remain available. Have shared info about this source with my dentist.</li>
