      <li>Item doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably in a shoe.</li>

<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> how bad your hammer toes are, you can wear with shoes, but not for a long period, it cuts circulation , unless you wear a larger  shoe and loosen the band covering your toes.</li>
<li> It is a bit uncomfortable to wear, however, especially after some time.</li>
<li> I bought this for my one foot because the inflamed tendons on the side of my foot is making my 3rd toe to separate, which can be very uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> The item can only be worn without a shoe for a few hours before it feels like it&#x27;s cutting off circulation and becomes painful.  </li>

<li> Uncomfortable to wear</li>
<li> oversize base will not fit into shoes.  </li>
<li> A bit uncomfortable but not to bad.</li>
<li> My hammer toe causes some of my toes to fold under others, producing painful blisters and pressure</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> They really were uncomfortable and did not help the situation</li>
    <li> This fits well and am able to fit into my shoe, however, prefer to wear it at night and take it off when it gets to be too pain ful.  I think it has already helped even though I have only worn it a couple of times.  would recommend purchase, but must wear it daily to work</li>
    <li> I wear it about 8 hours a day, sometimes it makes my toes hurt, so I just reposition straps.</li>
    <li> I recently had food surgery for my hammer toe on my left foot, which in turn had turned all my other toes to the left, and on top of each other.  My surgeon had suggested I try this product, to re-train my toes, but to my dismay, all they did was irritate my toes, and cause them to swell up.  I told my Podiatrist about it, and he advise I stop using it.</li>
    <li> The tor straightener provides a healing time, while using it.  Have to be careful though, with time of using it.  Not confortable when staying too long and walk with them.</li>
    <li> I have hammer toes and a painful corn on the outer sole of my left foot, near my little toe. There aren&#x27;t many products that provide padding in the area where my corn is located, but it looked like this product might, so I tried it. It does offer just enough protection to help relieve the pressure on the corn, and it does a good job of separating and (seemingly) straightening the hammer toes. My hammer toe causes some of my toes to fold under others, producing painful blisters and pressure calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little pad fits all right inside a sock (in fact, without a sock to hold it in place, mine works it&#x27;s way off my foot pretty quickly), and it then fits fine inside my shoe (men&#x27;s 13 wide). It is a bit uncomfortable to wear, however, especially after some time. (I generally wear it while golfing, so I tend to be in it for 3-5 hours at a time.) I also had to learn to adjust the elastic tension for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn the pad intermittently for a few weeks now, and the pad has compressed noticeably and is no longer quite as comfortable over my corn. It is a bit less rigid, too, but still enough to help keep my toes separate and straighter. It also tends to acquire foot odor. I suppose it&#x27;s probably washable, but you could also just dust or spray it. Mine seems to air out over a couple of days so that I don&#x27;t notice any odor when I put it back on. This product has helped quite a bit with my hammer toe, and, at the price, I would recommend trying it. Just be prepared that it might not be comfy to wear for long periods, and it may not last a long time.</li>
    <li> A bit uncomfortable but not to bad. fit is good but not a cure with feet problems. temporary relief a bit</li>
    <li> First of all, the item was expensive for such a simple product construction and material.  In addition, you have to purchase both a left and a right foot for a complete pair, which only increased the cost.  It was uncomfortable to wear as one size does not truly fit all feet.  You cannot include the small toe as one of the three toes because then the under pad is off center.  I could not comfortably fit in my shoes with them on.  It could not be adjusted to keep my toe straight; therefore, I would have to surmise that it does not and cannot function as advertised.

    <li> Well made and pretty comfortable, Be aware that your toes do not want to be redirected, so may eventually require either loosening the strap or removing it for a period of time.</li>
    <li> This is helping to keep my toes aligned.  Advise putting baby powder on your toes before putting it on, it slides on better.  Put on loosely if you are going to walk with it, your feet automatically swell after you are up and about for the day.  Ordering a second one.</li>
    <li> Uncomfortable to wear but it does do the job</li>
    <li> FootSmart Triple Toe Straightener, Left&lt;br /&gt;very uncomfortable, doesn&#x27;t fit the width of my foot so my big toe is falling off the padding and cuts into my foot.  this product should cover the whole width of your foot &amp; toes, so it should be able to be purchased in width sizes also.  elastic is far too tight, even with it pulled out as far as it can go.  certainly doesn&#x27;t fit on your foot like the picture shows. must have been designed for tiny little feet, which mine aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It works, but it takes days before you can adjust to it, it all depends on how bad your hammer toes are, you can wear with shoes, but not for a long period, it cuts circulation , unless you wear a larger  shoe and loosen the band covering your toes.</li>
    <li> Bought them for both feet.  Great product.</li>
    <li> oversize base will not fit into shoes.  Good if barefooted.</li>
    <li> Ok item. It&#x27;s a good break from having to tape toes down from surgery. A little bulky to fit in shoe though. Good for sleeping.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my one foot because the inflamed tendons on the side of my foot is making my 3rd toe to separate, which can be very uncomfortable.  It bothers me alittle to walk around with it on, but I mostly use it when I am relaxing.  Seems to work pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have these for my husband in a variety of types, 1, 2 and 3 toe separators.  They help when his toes are bothering him.</li>
    <li> Good product, good design. Don&#x27;t expect overnight miracles but this is the first device that has actually helped realign my toes and the cost sure beats surgery.</li>
    <li> Helped with my hammer toes.</li>
    <li> The item can only be worn without a shoe for a few hours before it feels like it&#x27;s cutting off circulation and becomes painful.  Item doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably in a shoe.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toe separator after bunion surgery to align my toes and make then straight. Ultimately, it does the job but you can only keep them on for a certain amount of time before your circulation is cut off. I also purchased the Darco Toe alignment splint and I use these with it. I can get about 4 hours of wear at night before I wake up in pain and have to remove them.</li>
    <li> I ordered a triple toe straightener for my right foot from another manufacturer and it fit great.  However, I haven&#x27;t been able to get your left foot straightener to fit my feet.  Unfortunately, at the time neither Co had both right and left products.</li>
    <li> Needed the right..The site didn&#x27;t show left/right. Now they do. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Caused irritation on top of toes</li>
    <li> I was pleased with how well this product straightened my toes.  I wear thong sandals most of the time and for some unexplained reason I curl the toes on my left foot.  The FootSmart Triple Toe Straightener helped me to gently straighten the toes and retrain myself to not curl the toes.</li>
    <li> I was unable to use these putting three toes in. Tried with the two worse toes on each foot and was comfortable. I realized it was also working as a forefoot cushion.  I&#x27;ve two pair of boots that I adore but couldn&#x27;t find a proper forefoot cushion for my size 11 foot. I decided to try the boots on with the toe straightners on and was pleased that I&#x27;ve now solved two problems with one product. The boots were expensive and I adore them and they were just looking pretty in my closet. Like the other person said, when trying to use on all three toes they did stick out but not using on just two toes and they stay in place when walking.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble getting the elastic onto my crooked toes.  Perhaps I need a lever.</li>
