<li> The one I got has flowers and looks very cheaply made - extremely disappointed!!!</li>
<li> Also the only thing wrong with the product is that it can snag your hairs in the beads.</li>
<li> A bit confused why that came in the mail and not what is pictured.</li>
<li> Not happy, and the shipping department some how lost my return</li>

    <li> Returned it because looked very cheap and even had old price tag from a previous retailer and  I bough It for more money on amazon. Not happy, and the shipping department some how lost my return so they are planning on charging me? anyways?</li>

    <li> This headband is adorable and just what was pictured in the photo. The reason I am giving this item one star is I went to put it and noticed the bands were REALLY loose. Sure enough it was way too big!!! It also was grabbing my hair when I was putting it in. I ended up using some bobby pins and it stayed fined, but it still will pull at your hair.</li>

    <li> The headband I received did not look anything like this. The one I got has flowers and looks very cheaply made - extremely disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I am not terribly upset but the stretchy band came out after i took it off for the first time. It&#x27;s really cute though so I am going to superglue the band back in. I will say that even though I had probs I would buy again because even though I&#x27;ve gotten a few duds most has been good quality especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this headband! Just what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;Pretty and well made</li>
    <li> Very cute headband. Very fancy.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great headband. Good quality</li>
    <li> I got something in the mail that looked nothing like this...It looked more like headband you would wear on your wedding day.  Silver, flowers and petals with rhinestones.  A bit confused why that came in the mail and not what is pictured.</li>
    <li> This is a junky piece that I had to throw away and find a different gift. Do not purchase it</li>
    <li> Beautiful and simple, I love it!</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars but It took longer than expected to receive it other than that It&#x27;s very pretty and comfortable to wear. I love it!</li>
    <li> A beautiful gift for a friend.</li>
