    <li> I think this product actually created a skin problem around the fingertips - dry cracking - I was careful to put it on with q-tips so I would not get any on the fingers but I am suffering from finger cuts.</li>
    <li> Cleaned up my skin so great. I love it. I use it daily two to three times a day. Even on zit breakouts. I love it. Works perfect on eczema as well as foliculitus</li>
    <li> Awesome! Couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! Worked faster and gentler than the Dr prescribed &amp;#34;Beetle Juice&amp;#34;!! Worked even faster combined with soap! Highly recommended! Fast &amp; easy purchase!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m on my second jar and NOTHING</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the Emuaid max haven&#x27;t seen any result yet to early thanks</li>
    <li> Cannot see where it has helped at all so far. Save your money(over priced).</li>
    <li> I had a severe breakout on the back of my neck for 2 months , nothing helped to clear it up. After using the product for one week I saw amazing results.</li>
    <li> Great product worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell at present,I am still using it and plan to order 1 more jar.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Will use it for any skin irritation. Totally works</li>
    <li> i hope this product would  help with my feet issues&lt;br /&gt;extremely disappointed since I invested a lot In it</li>
    <li> I purchased this for an issue with a fingernail which had a damaged nail bed, and because of the nature of the product and the fact that I am constantly washing my hands it has not really had a good chance to do what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could keep away from hand washing, and not touching anything because it is  a bit greasy, it might work fine, however that is not the case for me.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any results yet, put happy with the product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product day and night and yet do not see any visual improvement. Looks like a bad deal.</li>
    <li> This is hands down, the most amazing, useful healthy ointment for any, and I do mean ANY skin disease, condition or problem.&lt;br /&gt;I am astounded by its healing ability and I would suggest when you make the purchase, depending on your situation, buy two&lt;br /&gt;not just one, buy two and after you are doing well.  Keep another one in your medicine cabinet.  Honestly, I should buy stock in this&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Christine Krause&lt;br /&gt;clkprod@aol.com</li>
    <li> this product not for toenail fungus,don&#x27;t waste your money ant time,maybe for something else but not for toenail fungus</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my toenail fungus, but it did seem to help with skin problems, so I guess its OK.</li>
    <li> Worthless.... Don&#x27;t waste your money.... False advertising in dealing with nail infection</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF ...LITTLE PRICIE</li>
    <li> Generally I would never post a negative remark on the net. But in this case I felt I had to do so.When I read other review that were positive on this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.. Within  just four day of using this snake oil, it made...... what was a minor problem a big problem. The one nail that required treatment became so discolured and brittle, that now I will I&#x27;ll be forced to see a doctor to remove the nail. What a sham ! ! !</li>
    <li> I went to a podiatrist to have a toenail removed because it was so bad I thought that was necessary.  It was hard, very thickened and growing crooked in the thickness but not growing in length at all.  He cut it back and said it would always be that way and he doesn&#x27;t remove fungus nails because that doesn&#x27;t cure the fungus since it is in the skin, not the nail.  I bought this product as a last resort for my ugly large toenail, hoping to, at least, improve the way it looked.  I had the top of the nail ground down at a nail shop and started applying this product twice daily - -using small amounts with a q-tip.  In approximately 30 days the nail was growing out enough to now need cutting again, color was improved in the new growth and it was smoother and thinner.  You have to be  patient and continue using the cream, even though at first it will seem nothing is happening.  Remember - -things on the legs and feet heal more slowly than on other parts of the body (farther from the heart, slower blood flow).  My large toe is now very happy!!!</li>
    <li> Number one file down the toenail on top to open pours and apply morning and nite and you will be so happy in about 3 weeks.In this case this was crooked , thick, tough, discolored toenails you ever seen and it worked applying and covering with a bandaid....thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and cannot see any change.</li>
    <li> I used this on my toenail fungus and it seems to be working.  Still have some discolored nail left to grow out.</li>
