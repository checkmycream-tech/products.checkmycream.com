<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It gets very goopy in a couple weeks. If you go through top coats quickly you&#x27;ll be fine. Tries super fast, although slightly thick.</li>
    <li> I used this product before and it is wonderful. It dries in a few minutes. The same goes to the other ones I bought.</li>
    <li> I paid like 8.00 in the store. Man the price would make you think its something wrong</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Seche Vite, it speaks for itself! :)</li>
    <li> This top coat is great if you need something that dries within minutes of going out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does thicken after a while, so I took the advice of most reviewers and bought the Seche Restore Nail Polish. Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this brand does include the harmful chemical toluene, so for that I deducted a star, and hope there are future incentives to rebrand the item without this ingredient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of top coats, and this one is the best. I&#x27;ve been so spoiled by it! It dries SO fast. In a matter of minutes, my nails are completely dry. It is very rare that I mess up a manicure anymore. I don&#x27;t have enough time to bump my nails before they are dry! I can do my nails right before bed, and when I wake up, there are no streaks on my nails. I can do the dishes less than 10 minutes after I do my nails, and they are fine. It&#x27;s really incredible stuff, and paired with the right lacquer, your manicure can withstand over 5 days of hard-hitting nail wear!    My only complaint about this product is that about half-way down the bottle, it gets so gooey and thick that it becomes unusable. This has been the case for me on more than one bottle. It&#x27;s disappointing, but I will continue to buy this product, because I love this top coat that much!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product as described. My nail polish lasted 5 days longer with this top coat! I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Best top coat ever. Have purchased 5+ bottles for myself and others. Will order again!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this top coat by Seche Vite.  I am one who totally gave up on painting her nails since I always messed them up no matter how dry the nail polish seemed.  Not only does this truly dry your nails in 60 seconds but it also has a wonderful shine that makes your nail polish look professional.  It also helps your polish last a lot longer...for me usually 5-6 days.  The ONLY bad thing I can say is that it is smelly and that smell lasts on my nails for a day or so.  Even with that said, call off the search, I&#x27;ve found my answer!</li>
    <li> I love Seche Vite topcoat! It leaves such a nice texture on your nails, and does help your nails to not chip. Bottom line,  will never use another topcoat again!</li>
    <li> I love this topcoat.  It dries so fast, it is amazing!  You put it on thick over still tacky polish, and (according to the manufacturer,) it penetrates the polish, and it dries in about 10 minutes.  And I&#x27;m talking, go about your business, type on the computer, set the table for dinner, dry.   I&#x27;ve brought it with me to salons when I go for a manicure, if I don&#x27;t know if they use it, because it gets me out of there, that much quicker.  It does tend to thicken up as you get to the half full level.  (It is kinda thick to begin with.)  Try using the Seche Restore Restoration Thinner (available on Amazon)[[ASIN:B0017ZDH52 Seche Restore Restoration Thinner .5 fl oz]] ...it works great to thin out the thickened topcoat.  I use it all the time.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to use a couple good squirts of it, mix it in well...it works great for other brands of polish that have thickened up too.  The Seche top coat does tend to thicken...it&#x27;s just the nature of the beast.  But it is so great, that I put up with it, and always make sure I have the Restore on hand!</li>
    <li> Oh i luv buying this sache it workd really well</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I have ever found. Dries fast, makes polish last longer whether it&#x27;s cheap like LA Colors or expensive like Deborah Lippman. It does have a strong smell but most nail treatments do. If you don&#x27;t use up the bottle within a year it does get kind of stringy but I go through this so fast I am usually ready to buy a new bottle by the time that starts. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t buy the huge bottle.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. My nails chipped the next day.  Does not dry faster than other polishes.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat ever invented, should be a staple in every nail salon.  Great Price!!!</li>
    <li> I have had many manicures at shops that use other top coats and every time I am disappointed.  This top coat is the only product that keeps my nail polish from chipping and I can go almost a week with my finger nails looking nice.  When used on my toes, it can last up to 3 weeks without a chip.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly to a serious, mirror-like finish, just like at the salon.  Although just how fast, I&#x27;m not sure, b/c my nails still look(ed) wet, so I didn&#x27;t touch for awhile!  My pedicure lasted about 10 days, as long as (if not longer) than some of my salon jobs.  The 1-star reviewer must have done something wrong, b/c this stuff works great!</li>
    <li> The answer to all your nail painting dilemmas, or least mine since I always end up smudging them because it takes for ever for them to dry. Works fast and leaves a cute topcoat!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Seche Vite for about 12 years and I&#x27;d never consider trying another.  It drys fast and my polish looks super glossy.  My manicures last almost a week and given that I&#x27;m a nurse and always washing my hands that says a lot.  Without it my polish would be a mess after a day or two.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a friend. This top coat drys in less than two minutes, and leaves my nails shiny and long lasting. Keep the cap screwed on tight, or else the stuff inside will get gooey and thick. Otherwise, this stuff is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had a real problem with doing my nail polish and art because I would have to wait hours for them to dry and still something would always happen to my nail polish.  Someone recommended me to Seche Vite Top Coat and that was the end of that problem!!! It dries your polish very quickly and it leaves your nails looking very shiny and beautiful.  This is a great product.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Technically, this product delivers on it&#x27;s promise. Your nails will dry very quickly. But, what they fail to tell you is that with that convenience comes the price that you will have to paint them EVERY DAY. This stuff chips and peels BAD. It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re on your way out the door to an event that you want your nails done for and it&#x27;s OK if it only lasts the night, but for your weekly mani that needs to hold up for at least 2-3 days, don&#x27;t bother, because this product will not do that.</li>
    <li> Someone had recommended this on their blog and with a great deal of hesitation, I ordered it. I have NEVER had my nail polish dry so quickly. I applied it to my nail polish while it was still wet and within 10 minutes, it was completely dry. To be safe I applied another coat and waited half an hour and went to bed. Usually, the next day my nail polish would be completely ruined with dings and imprinted of the sheets. However, my nails looked perfect and had a fresh out of salon smoothness and shine to then. I had multiple people compliment me on my mani and I got to gloat about doing it myself. I honestly am so thrilled with this buy and definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Note: Many people complain about their manis not lasting as long. I usually apply 2 thin coats. My mani lasts up to a week if I&#x27;m careful.</li>
    <li> its a good top coat, but its getting heavy when time goes. when I used half of them, the rest part is almost useless.</li>
    <li> I cannot keep a nice manicure without this product!! This top coat seals the manicure in a matter of seconds!! No more smudges an dings while waiting for my manicure to dry. This product also keeps my manicure fresh looking for at least a week!! No more spending $$$$$ on expensive Salon manicures for me!! Seche Vite Dry is one of the best nail products I have ever found!! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> It has a strong smell but my polish is life proof in under 5 minutes! Leaves my nails shiny and hard. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t go off for days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It goes on well, dries quickly, and bonds through all layers of polish to ensure your manicure stays chip-free. A common problem some people seem to have, is the Seche Vite &amp;#34;dragging&amp;#34; colors on a detailed manicure. To prevent this from happening, use more polish than you think you should, and do not let the bristles of the brush touch the nail. Basically let the polish itself &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; across your nail, which ensures the colors will not drag. This topcoat dries quickly enough so you don&#x27;t need to worry about an extra thick layer of polish being too much. Also another issue is the product drying out too quickly. I have purchased (also through Amazon) a product by the creators of Seche Vite called Seche Restore. It is absolutely a miracle worker! It comes in a glass bottle with an eye dropper, just a few drops of the Seche Restore to a thickened bottle of Seche Vite, and the topcoat returns to the consistency of the product you purchased. Seche Restore is also great for restoring thickened colored polishes as well. I cannot recommend this company enough!</li>
    <li> I will say that the shine is beautiful and when you first get it does dry fast but I have a few problems with it-&lt;br /&gt;1) After a short while it gets reeeally thick. Not even the Seche Vite drops to make it thin again fixed it.So, you can&#x27;t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;2) It quickly looses its quick dry abilities.&lt;br /&gt;3) It makes your polish peel more easily.&lt;br /&gt;4) For that price I might as well get a much better top coat, like one by essie.</li>
    <li> This is the same top coat that is used in the nail salon I go to.  Now I can get a professional manicure at home.  It is quick drying and shiny!  Helps my manicure last all well!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. I found out about it at a high end salon while having a pedicure and have used it ever since. I am so glad I can get it here on Amazon. It really leaves a nice gloss over the top of polish and it makes the polish last longer and dry faster.</li>
    <li> After trying and hating the Out the Door Fast polish, I couldn&#x27;t wait to give this one a try. It dries my nails in 1-3 mins. which is great especially if you have somewhere to go. But, it does chip pretty easily, within 1-2 days the polish starts chipping at the tip of my nails. It&#x27;s not really a problem, but it can be a bothersome sometimes.</li>
    <li> THE BEST TOP COAT IF DIDNT ALRADY KNOW!! It&#x27;s great it&#x27;s fabulous, it rocks! It drys super quick &amp; it&#x27;s been my go to for years!!!</li>
    <li> love love love it would not use anything different</li>
    <li> great i will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it was possible that this could work as described, but I&#x27;m totally a convert. Along with the OPI Nail Envy basecoat, my nails are rock hard and shiny and my polish lasts so long it&#x27;s almost annoying.    I wait a little longer than the recommended 60 seconds because I like to wear opaque colors that need to be applied liberally - if you apply TOO soon, it will streak. I wait until they are dry to the lightest touch (with OPI it&#x27;s 3-4 minutes) and then glob it on like crazy. You can do two coats if you are doing a fancy design or just really want to make sure it lasts. Two people commented on how SHINY my nails were today alone. Stop reading this and buy it.</li>
    <li> I am very impatient and often wear no polish at all because 9 out of 10 times I paint my nails, I smudge them. 3 nights ago I painted my nails w/ Seche Vitebase Clear Base Coat, 2 coats of a deep red, and then while still wet a coat of my new Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat... 5 minutes later my nails were dry (not at all tacky to the touch) so I walked out my front door to run an errand and my nails still look amazing 3 days later - so shiny, no chips, no smudges. Last night I threw away every other top coat polish I had - I will never use another brand! This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence before purchasing, it seemed too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I WAS WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the smell is strong and if you&#x27;ve got a nick or have cut too close on your cuticle it CAN sting a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But MAN OH MAN, this topcoat works SO FAST! By the time I&#x27;ve finished my second hand, THE FIRST HAND IS FINISHED! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I could change my polish, real wet polish not the stickers, and coat it with the Seche then go to bed OR go out WITHOUT any chipping or smudging! No kidding! I painted my nails within 10 minutes of leaving to go out for the night and my nails were PERFECT until I changed my polish 3 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that every other day, I do a strengthing OPI Nail Envy and then another coat of the Seche simply because I like to keep everything smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, if you stab your fresh polish on accident, it&#x27;s going to dent no matter what. BUT you really have to try to ruin your polish after using this topcoat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never use another topcoat again if I can help it. This was fantastic!</li>
    <li> Greatest stuff ever for my nails</li>
    <li> This top coat is a miracle.  Ever since I switched to Zoya polishes (so many awesome colors) I had issues with bubbling. So much that I almost stopped doing my fingernails. Then I heard how amazing Seche Vite is. I was skeptical but it was worth a shot. It&#x27;s better than I could have hoped.  NO bubbles, at all. Dries completely hard in a few minutes, literally, and shines like glass.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better top coat. It smells like epoxy when the bottle is open but for a complete manicure: matte Nail Envy as a base coat, two coats of polish and the top coat, in 10 minutes flat, who cares? You can put it on as soon as you finish the 2nd coat, it doesn&#x27;t even have to be tacky.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this while i was ordering stuff for konad&#x27;s nail stamping art...i&#x27;ve read rave reviews about it..i dont have much luck with nail polishes staying..their good for a day then chipping off the next..so i had high hopes for this with the reviews..i wanted to love it..it goes on thick and dries super quick...but i did my nails with a french tip and used this as a top coat..2 days later its peeling right off..and i mean the entire nail and one big swoop..i&#x27;ll continue to use it..beings i paid for it..and does dry fast..</li>
    <li> Amazing product! It&#x27;s everything stated and more, it corrects mistakes, dries super quick, and is shinier than all get out! Delivery was super super quick too! Will most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love Seche Vite Top coat for all the reasons that everyone mentions, specifically the beautiful finish and how quick it is to dry.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that some combinations of base coat, color, and seche vite seem to lead to my nail polish coming off in huge chips very early in my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I&#x27;ve noticed is Sally Hansen Quick Dry Base Coat, OPI nail polish, and Seche Vite.. It will look fantastic, but then just chip in huge flakes from day two onward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, OPI natural nail base, OPI nail polish, and Seche Vite can give me 10 whole days of natural nail manicure, and Sally Hansen Quick Dry Base Coat, OPI nail polish, and Sally Hansen Quick Dry Top Coat can give me 7 whole days of natural nail manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you love your Seche Vite you may have to match your base and nail polish to match it. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this after researching for a better fast drying top coat.  Well it looks like my search is over because after applying this over my new polish, which is NOT fast drying, it just corrected any mistakes (which I usually make with polish) and left such a clear, smooth shine!  This stuff is amazing and I am glad I ordered the restoration thinner along with it.  Once I run out, I will definitely be ordering more.  It gives my nails a salon look, without traveling to the nail salon. Truly amazing and worth every cent!!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good dry fast coat. it makes loly 30 sec to dry yr nail after coat, so amazing. really love it. you won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Seche Vite! It smooths out my polish, is ultra glossy, and dries nails faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used. I use a coat of this every single time I paint my nails! Seriously, finding Seche Vite changed the nail game for me! I found that about half way through the .5 oz bottle, it does tend to thicken, but its nothing a little nail polish thinner can&#x27;t help. And this set is a huge bargain, especially if you paint your nails as often as I do!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! It leaves your nails looking wonderful and very professional. Not to mention that it helps your polish last for a long time! If you like to paint your nails I would definitely recommend using this top coat!!!!</li>
    <li> Enough people have reviewed it and I agree wholeheartedly! This is by far the best top coat I have ever used, and I have used many. OPI&#x27;s drip dry has nothing on Seche Vite. CND Air Dry is very thin and does not have the self-settling properties of Seche Vite.     This goes on thick. You have to be prepared for it. The instructions that are on Amazon are exactly right, and it should be easy to master the three-swipe method. This bonds with the nail polish underneath, smooths out ridges and bumps, and helps to disguise any bubbles that may have dried into the polish. Nails are bone-dry within 5 minutes and I have done laundry and styled my hair with a flatiron within 10 minutes of use. It dries thick as well and has a glassy appearance. Unless you are wearing a Matte or Suede polish, it improves the look of ANY nail polish.     I use OPI almost exclusively, with Essie and the occasional Orly color. With any kind of polish it is improved by Seche Vite.    It will thicken over time. There is a thinner that Seche Vite sells, but I have not yet tried it. Combining old bottles together can help to eke out a few more manicures, and I have used an off-brand polish thinner with no problem before. This does not yellow, but some polish colors will transfer to the brush and be re-deposited on the next manicure (i.e. ruby red polish fragments may show up on your french manicure if you don&#x27;t clean the brush).     You can&#x27;t go wrong by using this top coat. I&#x27;ve been manicuring for over ten years and this takes the cake!</li>
    <li> Sure SV dries fast and is glossy, but what at price? Here is what I hate about this popular top coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;has an overwhelming odor&lt;br /&gt;polish shrinks considerably on all edges as it dries&lt;br /&gt;polish is still dentable even after an hour of drying&lt;br /&gt;polish peels off in sheets after a day most of the time&lt;br /&gt;product thickens and becomes unusable after you open it a few times&lt;br /&gt;you have to buy special, hard to find thinner for it because it contains toluene that evaporates and needs to be replenished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite is NOT big-3-free. For this reason it simply does not react well with most B3F polishes. And is therefore useless to me.</li>
    <li> Seche Vite is my favorite top coat.   The bottle I had been using didn&#x27;t belong to me and eventually ran out.   Even the owner of it had gotten it as a gift.   Not knowing where else to look I came to Amazon and found it.   Fast shipping and legit product.   Seeing as I trust Amazon much more than the official site selling the product I was at ease buying it from here.   Helps my polish last up to 2 weeks longer than it would normally without chipping.  Base coat is essential. Without base coat you just don&#x27;t get the same results.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used.  It is easy to apply and fast drying.  I will order more and recommend this to family and friends.  The pricing on Amazon is very good,</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. On my third bottle. Will buy again and forever. People can&#x27;t believe I do my own nails since the final look is like I just came out of a salon.</li>
    <li> i FREAKING LOVE THIS NAIL POLISH! Its so shiny and so smooth! drys with in 10 seconds. i would let your colored nail polish dry for 30 seconds before putting this on.</li>
    <li> Someone told me to get this top coat. What a find. My polish stays on over a week...with lots of abuse.</li>
    <li> I really like Speed Demon top coat for nail art and I didn&#x27;t think anything could get me to switch its a great value, works good, and dries my nails super fast, well I needed a bottle for a Christmas gift because I didn&#x27;t wanna give away my last one in my stash, I always have to have an extra full bottle when mines less than half full, but when I went to buy speed demon it was on sale and of course SOLD OUT!! Seche Vite was also on sale, and I have heard good reviews from other Konad users so I had to try it. I tried this out as a top coat to seal my nail art (sealing nail art is tricky, not just any top coat will do) and I really liked it, it didn&#x27;t smudge my nail art at all and its not quite as tricky as Speed Demon, where I apply one thin coat over my nail art, and then a second one. I feel speed demon dries a little faster, and speed demon comes in a much bigger bottle but this is slightly better for nail art, it&#x27;s worth the splurge if you intend on using it to seal your nail art. Also the price on here is good even with shipping, its around what I paid to get it on sale.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this top coat! It&#x27;s the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used! It dries lightning fast and leaves a gorgeous shiny wet-looking finish.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! Dries fast and leaves it very shiny. Everytime I use this as my top coat, people always think I just got my nails done at a nail salon. And it stayed on a long time. Maybe about 2 weeks w/out chipping</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous top coat. We use it at my cosmetology school along with OPI nail polish and it&#x27;s the perfect combo. Definitely recommend it. I am notorious for screwing my nails up right after the hard work I put into doing them, so if you&#x27;re like that... GET IT! This is a great price for it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with these polish.  Gives a nice shiny coat.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life?!  Dries extremely fast and you can apply on wet paint!  The more you use- the better.</li>
    <li> Great product for protecting nails and polish, it dries on your nails like acylic. It dries fast almost instant. It&#x27;s great as a top coat and helps nails stay hard and strong with high gloss finish.</li>
    <li> Fast drying but this top coat is so thick I can only use it so many times until I need a nail polish thinner. I prefer to use a gel polish top coat and cure with UV light or use InstaDry from Sally Hansen.</li>
    <li> Thanks a lot the top coat really works. It dries my polishes within Max2 minutes(for French) nah helps to keep them longer. Love it</li>
    <li> Got here so fast!!! This product is awesome! Dries in the blank of an eye.</li>
    <li> fast drying and super shine</li>
    <li> Really like this top coat!</li>
    <li> this is truly the best top coat ever! Five minutes and you are ready to go! Can&#x27;t beat that !</li>
    <li> I have recently reordered this and still love it. Itmakes any cheap nail polish even wet n wild or the ones at charlotte russe look like salon quality. It gives everything a great shine and dries your nails really really fast! I love the top coat so much and never really needed a base bc it does last for a few days but not like shallac. So might try the base coat to just to see if that extends it even longer</li>
    <li> One of the hardest parts of nail art, and the most vexing, is the finishing top coat. Without a good top coat and a proper seal, the entire time spent on the other polish colors is wasted, and a good top coat can make or break a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing my own nails for a few years (nothing special, but I prefer to do them regularly at home so I don&#x27;t end up biting them or they chip apart), I&#x27;ve really gotten to know a few of the better brands, and why they are better. Seche Vite is by FAR the BEST top coat polish on the market, and it&#x27;s worth the extra few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best aspects:&lt;br /&gt;1) The polish is formulated to bond with the bottom layers and bring out the solvents from the other layers that aren&#x27;t completely dry, to dry everything evenly and give an even finish. I didn&#x27;t really believe this, but after a few issues with bubbling in some of my polishes, I decided to give Seche a try with it. For minor bubbling, it really evened out the texture, and dried within five minutes to a solid, thick, glossy shine. In warmer, humid weather or with thicker polishes that are older and trap air in the solvents, THIS is THE polish to go with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The quicker dry time, yet thicker coat. You can put this on your lower layers of polish, and within 10-15 minutes, it&#x27;s good to go, with just one coat. And not just good to go carefully, but good to go and do things like typing, dishes, or cleaning. It makes doing your own nails incredibly convenient, and I&#x27;ve yet to have a ruined manicure while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The price isn&#x27;t really exorbitant for the product. Yes, it&#x27;s a few more dollars than other products like Sally Hansen, but it really isn&#x27;t totally out of the ballpark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less best aspects:&lt;br /&gt;1) The thickness. This is actually one of the BEST aspects, but because thicker polishes tend to lose their solvents with time, when you get about halfway through the bottle, it gets too thick to use. You can buy [[ASIN:B0017ZDH52 Seche Restore Nail Polish, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]] and use it to restore the polish, though for the simple reason you have to buy something else to fix it, I will put the thickness in a \\&quot;negative\\&quot; category. Though since it&#x27;s just part of a good product, I suppose that&#x27;s just what needs to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is neither a positive or negative, but I&#x27;ve found that since the polish is so thick, as it dries, it tends to pull back from the tip of the nail, leaving a thinner layer at the tips. What I&#x27;ve done is wait until the top coat is dry, then take the brush and go along the edges of the nails twice, to keep those covered and help them last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone, from people at home painting their nails every now and then to more serious manicurists.

Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this top coat it makes the nail Polish dry so fast and makes it shiny</li>
    <li> I ordered Seche Vite  Dry Fast Top coat but I received 2 packs of hair color. There was not a packing slip so I had no phone number to call to get what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;I want the prduct I ordered.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best top coat there is.</li>
    <li> At first I thought okay this is a overpriced top nail coat but I was so wrong. It leaves my nails feeling silky and smooth and it adds the perfect glossy shine. I tend to get air bubbles using any other type of top coat but with this I dont. 5 star product when I run out I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! It goes on smoothly and dries incredibly fast! No more waiting for hours for my nails to dry! Excellent product and would recommend!</li>
    <li> This product flaked off of my nails within hours of application. I contacted the seller, and they apologized, and sent me another one. I assumed that maybe it was a bad bottle, or an old one. When the second one came in the mail, the exact same thing happened. It flaked off immediately. I didn&#x27;t contact the seller again, but I threw out both bottles. I&#x27;ve heard very good things about this brand of top coat, but either there was a problem with the bottles they sent me, or somehow, the product was not compatible with my fingernails. (I applied the product to bare, clean fingernails)</li>
    <li> Works really well as a top coat. Though I must say the smell is especially toxic.</li>
    <li> The best top coat you will ever find. It dries in 2 minutes or less even if you have 2 coats of polish under it. My only complaint is that after about a week of wear I notice that it yellows slightly. It isn&#x27;t really noticeable, but my nail color just isn&#x27;t as vibrant as the first day.</li>
    <li> This product makes my polish dry almost immediately.  I can put on two coats of polish and walk out the door in five minutes, which is invaluable for me since I hate sitting around for half an hour waiting for nail polish to dry. My polish always seems to chip within a day or two, and this didn&#x27;t help or hurt with that, but it seems to be a good-quality top coat and I have stuck with it for several years. I really recommend for quick drying, good quality, and shine.    Note: some pharmacies sell this, so if you can get it locally, it&#x27;s probably not worth the shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  You can apply your polish, top it off with this Top Coat and within seconds you do not have to worry about smudging your polish.</li>
    <li> love this stuff..works like magic..but gets thick quickly so try not to keep lid off long</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!!!  Apply it to both hands and by the time your second hand is done your first hand is dry...seriously!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my nails super shiny and dries fast.</li>
    <li> I love to do my own nails: love nail art in particular and this is the best top coat I &#x27;ve ever tried: it dries super fast. Literally in 2 minutes your nails are good to go: no smages or annoing inprints! Plus it does not smear my nail art, which is a must have for me in my top coat. And it lasts without chips for at least 5-6 days!!! I have tried top coat which a similar in quality but the price is so much higher!!! This is a great find!!!! I definitely recommend weather you are a pro or just an nail art intusiast! Another cool thing that this top coat does not get gluppy as some other I had before: it does not give you those annoing air bubbles like some other top coats, you mani looks perfect: nice and shiny and last for a long time. Love it!</li>
    <li> I know it contains crazy chemicals. But I don&#x27;t use it often. I applied it to my wet polish right before we were leaving for a Christmas party. Dried up in minutes. Well worth it for that fresh manicured look. Just don&#x27;t use often.</li>
    <li> It did yellow over top of my fench manicure. Not sure if I made a mistake or anything. It seems to work well on my other color nail polishes better. Then and again I only used it once over the white tips I had.</li>
    <li> Love it! Dries fast and shine lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> This product works as great as everyone says but I&#x27;m only giving it 3-stars because it does have such a toxic smell (as with any nail polish product) and it does state that it &amp;#34;contains a chemical known to the State of California to birth defects or other reproductive harm&amp;#34;.  I highly suggest that if you are pregnant NOT to use this product.  Also use this product in a room or outside with good ventilation.</li>
    <li> It is simply amazing. It is better than any top coat I have ever tried before. It keeps the polish from chipping for a long time.. much longer than any other top coat I have ever tried... and is super shiny and makes it look professional. I definitely recommend this polish! It is great!</li>
    <li> The best of the best, the glossiest top coat, period. One review after another exalted the incredible mirror-like finish that Seche Vite gives to your nails. I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed the different, unusual odor when I opened the bottle. Seche Vite has a strong smell of paint solvent, paint thinner, completely different from the sweet, distinctive smell that nail lacquers have. A caution flag went up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed on the side of the box raised yet another flag. One particular ingredient caught my attention right away: TOLUENE. The warning also found on the box did not alleviate my concerns, either: \\&quot;WARNING! This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy and will not use Seche Vite because of its questionable ingredients, specifically Toluene. Some research identifies Toluene as a potential carcinogen and contributor to other health disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may argue that while Toluene can be bad for you, just about every other chemical may equally be bad if misused. Perhaps so. The bottom line for me is that I would not want to use something that has potential health risks. There are other top coats out there that provide an excellent glossy finish without using any of these questionable ingredients; furthermore, I concluded that it is not by accident that the top nail-lacquer brands already stopped using Toluene, DBP, formaldehyde, etc. in their products.</li>
    <li> Best top cost I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Why doesn&#x27;t every nail salon have this?! This stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> This top coat is amazing. i have tried so many different top coats and this really does dry fast and keep my nail polish shiny!</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> I use this with every single manicure I do. Combined with the Vite Nail Repair, it is an unstoppable combo. I used to never, ever do my nails because 1. I have kids and inevitably, as soon as I was done, someone needed something that required my hands and 2. freaking nail polish takes forever to dry! With this, even up to four coats is dry within three minutes. I&#x27;ve used it with glitter formulas as well, and I&#x27;ve found if you put this on top of the color, let it dry, then apply the glitter polish and apply another coat, your manicure is essentially gel and will not chip and stay forever. I didn&#x27;t remove mine until it started looking &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; about a week later.&lt;br /&gt;My hands are in use and being washed constantly, so that&#x27;s saying something--most of my manicures last less than 48hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight smell with this polish but that is a small trade off for the quality and ability to have pretty nails again. I recommend it to everybody! Plus, it&#x27;s ridiculously affordable and can be shipped free, even without Prime.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;TOP COAT&amp;#34; product on the market. This goes on super smooth and dries in 3 minutes. Literally, I have put gloves on or have fallen to sleep. No smudge marks on my nails. They look like gel nails. I&#x27;ve read some of the negative reviews regarding the use of Toulene (smoothing agent) that gives that candy coated look. Personally, I don&#x27;t think the quantity of it in the bottle is huge to alarm anyone. If one has ever smelled a can of paint, paint thinner, bleach &amp; ammonia, I have to open the windows. Even bug spray is toxic. The minute smell from this bottle to me is harmless. Read up on the article that goes into further detail than some of the negative reviews ... do a search for title &amp;#34;Seche Vite and Toluene: Harmless or Harmful?&amp;#34;. That will answer a lot of concerns. I&#x27;ve tried high end Chanel, Esse, OPI ...etc. and none of them hold a candle to this top coat. The fumes from this is nothing compared to my nail polish remover, and other household products. Again, this is the best TOP COAT i have ever tried in decades. No need to go to a nail salon, as this top coat makes my nails shiny like a brand new car.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat, dries my nails very quick, leaving a silky smooth finish, keeping my nail polish looking just painted for over a week!!! One thing I didn&#x27;t like was it got all goofy half way gone, but found out about adding a drop or two of finger nail polish remover or buying their own brand just put a couple drops in and it&#x27;s like I just bought it!!! I used to never put on top coats, but the past year or more been getting into trying different designs and stamping and this was my choice for top coat, I&#x27;ve never used anything else and never will!!!!! Very happy with this top coat, regardless of what chemicals are in it, I&#x27;m not eating it or sniffing it, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not going to kill me or cause any health issues, maybe if I were to sniff it everyday to get high or ingest it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s safe, or people would already be getting sick by now. All these polishes have some type of chemicals in it, all which are not good to sniff on purpose or ingest, not sure anyone would want to ingest this!! Lol.. Just be careful, do nails in an open area. I&#x27;m sure they have to put that on the label, make people aware of what&#x27;s in it.. Just my 2 cents.. :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it until I used it.  I friend told me about it at work and it really is great - 2 coats of polish and this on top - 10 minutes on the timer and you can do whatever you want after that.  I&#x27;m actually tired of my polish before my polish looks like it needs to be removed (and I&#x27;m very picky).  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard some very good things about this brand and decided to give it a try because I&#x27;ve been fed up with crappy top coats. Well, this product lives up to its name. It dried super fast and kept my nails shiny and unchipped for 5 days. The only thing is that the smell is a little strong- the moment I opened the bottle, the entire room smelled, but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay for such a great product.</li>
    <li> its quickly dries and leaves nails super shiny amazing so glad i bought it , best top coat i have used in a long time</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great price! The shine on this top coat is great. It last forever. No bubbles ever. So much better than opi.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a number of years and will not use any other topcoat product.  It is the best..</li>
    <li> I dried a fussy girl&#x27;s polish before she could ruin it. Works great!</li>
    <li> Great customer service, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Chipped in 12 hours. I use HK Girl now.</li>
    <li> It provides an even, smooth, glossy coat, and it dries really quick. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is, if it gets on my cuticle and dries, it causes the polish underneath to lift up, which messes up the manicure. Overall, it&#x27;s a good top coat.</li>
    <li> it is a great top coat. i coat my nails with it every day so it could maintain the shine and i find that when i use this top coat, the nail polish doesn&#x27;t chip that easily. sometimes the nail polish will last me 4-5 days! overall great product and a must have if you paint your nails often.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and bought this after hearing so many women rave about it.  It does go on pretty thick, but it does make it easier to control where you are putting it, it seems.  My 1st manicure with it lasted 3 days. I did notice some tip lifting which is one of the issues some women have with it.  I will try to remember to put some extra topcoat on the very edge of my nail to see if that helps.  Overall I would probably buy this product again.  But be forewarned that it will thicken up after awhile so be prepared to use some thinner.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best nail products i have EVER used because it actually works.  within 10 min my nails were dry. picking up the baby and folding clothes dry. not to mention they were so shiny. looked like just got a fresh manicure from a professional. used with opi color and opi nail envy as base coat</li>
    <li> Fast service and a product I love.  Thanks for the great pricing!&lt;br /&gt;This gives a high shine and long lasting top coat.  The fast dry feature means fewer redos!</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s quick drying and leaves a beautiful shine.would never go with out this being my top coat.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat! It means to dry quickly in the french language, and that is exactly what it does. In less than a minute after applying it, I am able to grab my car keys and go out the door without any fears of ruining my polish. It also leaves a high glossy shine on the nail which just enhances the polished look. If saving  time is important to you, then I highly recommend that you try this top coat. As an added perk you will reap the high gloss finish too.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used.  I have my hands in water all day long and this lasts so much longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.  It is also great because it is dry to the touch almost instantly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years. It dries your polish almost instantly and keeps polish looking great for weeks. I never use anything else as the topcoat  and I&#x27;ve manicured my own nails forever as a salesperson where my hands were on display with jewelry,</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this top coat and I love it. It dries quickly and leaves an amazing gloss on my nails. I combine it with the Seche ridge filling base coat and my polished nails last 5 days with rough use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Zero problem. Simply perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat. I put 3 coats of nail polish on under it and it dried the top so fast I didn&#x27;t even have to worry about typing this review. c: Love it!</li>
    <li> Seche Vite has a reputation for being the best, and I fully believe it. I have never used a better top coat in my life. When applied, it is seriously less than ten minutes before your nails are completely dry and you are ready to go. It also provides a brilliant shine and serious protection. If there is one staple every lacquerista needs, it&#x27;s this top coat.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish. If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
    <li> i t works . i use this to freshen up my mani mid week. gets me to the next week with fewer chips</li>
    <li> From what I remembered of this product, it was AWESOME! Made my nail polish last longer, and gave it a manicured finish, but this time around was not the same.  Perhaps it is the Etsy base coat, or the nail polish  I am using, but I am not getting the same phenomenal results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product.  After trying it once, I fell in love with it.  I didn&#x27;t polish my nails often because I only have time at night.  I would get \\&quot;sheet marks\\&quot; on my nails too frequently.  This product WORKS!  No more \\&quot;sheet marks\\&quot;!  :)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best top coat I have ever used!  It goes on thick but doesn&#x27;t smudge or bunch.  How does it do that?  I&#x27;ll tell you - it&#x27;s a miracle!  I get salon results every time I use it.  High Gloss Perfection!  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it!</li>
    <li> I love the way SV works to dry my polish and give it an awesome shine. You apply it over freshly applied polish and it&#x27;s dry in minutes. It&#x27;s definitely thicker than other topcoats I&#x27;ve used. The only drawback to SV is that over time it gets thick.  It becomes hard to apply and will cause your polish to shrink under it. If you want to thin it, you have to use their product, Seche Restore, to thin, otherwise it won&#x27;t work as well. I don&#x27;t really mind doing this, as I do love the results from SV, but it is a bit of a pain. Some people may not want to deal with this, which is why I only give 4 stars. I do admit to cheating on SV from time to time with a less fussy topcoat. ;)</li>
    <li> This top coat (SVTC) is amazing!  It is super shiny, long lasting, and quickly dries to a point where you can go on about your business.  Once fully cured, it is super hard; I can push one nail down on the other and not be able to make a mark.    Tips:  1.  Order the Seche Vite Restore when you order the top coat.  SVTC is fast drying.  Once air gets into the bottle, it starts drying just like it would on your nails.  Adding a couple of drops every once in a while will keep SVTC from getting too thick.    2.  SVTC can \\&quot;repair\\&quot; smudges to wet polish.  I no longer try to repair a smudge that happens while I&#x27;m giving myself a manicure.  The SVTC will almost always smoothe it out when it is applied.  3.  SVTC is thick, and a common complaint is that it shrinks.  If you don&#x27;t cover all the way to the edges of the colored polish, it will shrink away from the edges leaving you with areas of polish that have no top coat.  If you are careful to go all the way to the edges, a bit around the end of the tip, and to use a thinner rather than thicker coat, SVTC works great.  4.  SVTC enters all layers of the polish to dry them.  They will be dry to the touch and ready to use before they are fully cured.  (Fully cured is when you can rub the nails together and they click rather than stick.)  If you push against the edge of a sort of dry nail, all of the layers can slump off that area.  You can gently smoothe them back into place -- the top will still be super shiny.  You may still see a bit of wrinkling if you look hard, but otherwise it will be just fine.  5.  Do not use alcohol to clean oils/moisturizer off your nails.  It will slightly dull SVTC.    It is by far the best top coat I have ever used.  It dries faster and harder and shinier than any other I have tried.  Even when it isn&#x27;t fully cured it is very, very highly resistent to damage.  It is so good that I give it to friends and family.  I&#x27;d give it more than five stars if I could.</li>
    <li> That is a very BAD ingredient for nail polishes to have in it ! They say it may cause some cancers.  Anyway....if you think you are getting a deal....you are not. Sallys Beauty has it for about the same price and you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to come in the mail.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!  I&#x27;ve been doing my own manicures since I was about 11 I&#x27;m now 28  and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this. I first heard about this from birchbox.... claimed to be the best top coat. I&#x27;ve tried all brands and sorts of top coats quick drying and not. some are really disappointing and some are eh. This one dries so fast even when I&#x27;ve layered it on thick with glitter or any color. The top coat gives great staying protection makes My manicure last a whole 7 days.  My favorite part is the quick-ness. I have a hard time sitting and waiting. ...I have a life! It&#x27;s one of the few things I dare not be without!</li>
    <li> With this top coat my nails are dry in like 4 minutes top. Greatest thing EVER! i bought like 5 of them lol</li>
    <li> I bought this product after getting a recommendation from a friend and boy was she CORRECT!!  This product not only adds amazing shine but it dries your nails FAST!!  I was skeptical but now I am convinced.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the natural matte finish next.</li>
    <li> The warning label on this product is only there because it is sold in California. California requires manufacturers to put a warning label on products that contain one or more chemicals in the list under Proposition 65. Cosmeticsinfo.org stated, \\&quot;The state has established a NO SIGNIFICANT RISK LEVEL (NSRL) FOR TOLUENE WHEN USED IN NAIL PRODUCTS. These NSRLs are sometimes referred to as Proposition 65 \\&quot;Safe Harbors\\&quot;.  A study and assessment of the risk posed by the use of Toluene in nail products has been conducted under the auspices of state attorney general&#x27;s office and they have determined that its use in nail care products is below the NSRL for consumers\\&quot;. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this info out is because this is my favorite top coat. The label seems to scare away a lot of people but if you do a little research you will learn that the big scary label isn&#x27;t so scary after all. There are other products  more dangerous that you probably put on or in your body than this top coat.</li>
    <li> I love SV, it is the best topcoat! Always goes on easily and stays put through working out, playing softball, and swimming in the ocean!</li>
    <li> Dries quickly, makes your polish shine!!  Preserves the manicure resisting chips!!  Love it!!  I&#x27;ve tried others but no other product compares.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great. I put it on my manicures and pedicures when I get home from the salon and it extends the last for at least a week. The warning label slightly worries me but I try not to apply it in a small room.</li>
    <li> One of the best top coats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this topcoat. It is the best. Also I love this company and would never purchase through anyone else. 5 star product 5 star company!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best and fastest drying topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  Try it, you will love it! Dries in less than 5 minutes!</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish would buy it again</li>
    <li> This is the best top &amp;#34;Fast&amp;#34; coat ever!</li>
    <li> I like this top coat a lot. It&#x27;s shiny, lasts and dries quickly. Great price. Sort of thick/goofy.</li>
    <li> This definitely keeps my nails fresh and shiny for longer. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I can eventually peel it off... but maybe I&#x27;m applying it too thickly. It&#x27;s great, though.</li>
    <li> I just recently learned that top and base cost are actually important. This is the best tip coat you will ever find, t dries fast and is glossy and hard.helos keep my manicure for many days, probably longer I&#x27;d I didn&#x27;t pick off polish all the time lol.</li>
    <li> this is the best topcoat i have come across. recommend this to all my friends, they love it, swear by it.</li>
    <li> My favorite quick dry product. Works really fast and adds shine. Don&#x27;t layer too much on, though. It will start to peel off if you do.</li>
    <li> Yes it drys super fast but its useless for more than an hour wear because it chips instantly. Even when I do nothing it chips and peels right off!!! Not buying again.</li>
    <li> Bought on here because the price for 2 was better than for 1 in a store. Just bought Restore, and a refill to go with these. The Restore Thinner will allow you to use the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> I paint my nails about once a week and I love that this product dries quickly and stays shiny. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The best top coat ever made! You put it on when your nails are wet and it lasts. The only problem is that it gets thick very quickly due to it drying so fast, so you will want to get the Seche Vite thinner. You cannot use nail polish thinner with this. It is well worth it. It will last a long time with the thinner. Well worth the money. To purchase this at my local store it is $10 a bottle.</li>
    <li> Dries my nails right away!!!! They still chip though.... No protection there... Maybe for like a day... At least for me. But i give it a 10 on drying the nail polish super fast.</li>
    <li> This product is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever used!!! EVER!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read numerous reviews on this product and its wonders of drying in no time. Even though there was much hesitation, I decided to purchase it because the top coat that I was using at the time absolutely was worthless. I&#x27;m so glad that I went ahead and purchased this because it truly takes no time to dry! If I mess up on my color coat, a simple stroke with this Seche Vite will fix it as well. This is the only top coat I&#x27;m going to be using for a long, long time!</li>
    <li> I would buy this again and again. It is the only reason I&#x27;m able to grow out my thin, peeling nails. I never take off my old polish until I&#x27;m ready to repaint my nails, because they bend right over. But after I put on a basecoat, 2 coats of color, and Seche Vite they are much stronger and have a professional looking gloss.</li>
    <li> Brand new nail polish dries fast anyway, but this product speeds it up even more.  Yay!  Makes it so much easier to do summer nails.</li>
    <li> OMG I love using this when I do my nails as it drys them almost instantly. I will surely invest in this product going forward</li>
    <li> I had pretty much given up on home manicures, until I gave Seche Vite a try. I&#x27;m hard on my nails - I&#x27;m clumsy and I type all day at work. Home manicures used to last 1-2 days tops before major chipping started. With SV, I can actually get a solid 5-6 days before any chipping begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get the best results by using the following order: 1 base coat, 2 polish, 1 Seche, 1 polish, 1 more Seche. I know it sounds like a lot of coats, but SV dries so quickly it doesn&#x27;t take too long. Also, be sure you are getting both polish and topcoat on the tips of your nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of drying quickly...seriously. No more being basically immobilized for an hour after doing your nails. Smudges are no more. Now, if you actually scrape your nail or something, yes, you&#x27;ll probably ruin it, but just going about life can be resumed about 5-10 minutes after your last coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SV does tend to get thick and gloopy. Normally I would be annoyed and find a different product, but SV is the ONLY topcoat that makes my polish last, so I bought a bottle of Restore. Oh, and I go through SV a lot more quickly than other top coats. Still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Used in salons when ive gotten manicures so I bought for myself.  It works wonderful but I didnt like how it&#x27;d get goopy/stringy in the bottle after a couple months! I ordered the INM out the door brand used that last night and very unsatisfying as it smudged a hr after applying so ill stick to the Seche!</li>
    <li> best top coat i have ever used. dries extremely fast but also stays very shiny.  I suggest this to anyone who does their own nails alot</li>
    <li> This is the first top coat that does exactly what it says. I can not believe how fast this polish dries. I am able to use my hands without nicking my freshly done nails because this polish dries fast and leaves a hard shiny top coat. I love it! This is the only top coat I will use...if I don&#x27;t do my nails at home I always take it to with me to the salon. Best product EVER! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It was a gift and we will definitely order from the again! The product does what it says, fast drying!!</li>
    <li> Best top coat, hands down~</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t do my nails without it! Makes them dry fast so no worries when I go to bed! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have previously used Orly and OPI top coats; however, they would take eternity to dry up and left my nailpolish lumpy. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try as it is much cheaper than the brands I mentioned and it truly dries immediately. It leaves your nails with a perfect seal and shine. I even did the poke test,,,,it passed. Perfect for a clutz like me! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> My friend who owns a salon swears by this and now I do too. Perfect top coat and dries in 5 min. Glossy and will make your manicure last longer. I bring this to the manicurist if they don&#x27;t carry it. Look for it in your local drug store but I think it is cheaper here online.</li>
    <li> I love it.... It keeps my nails shiny the whole week :) must buy it great product for home or on the go</li>
    <li> This products does what it says.  Drys Fast.  Put it on, in a few seconds, your nails are DRY.  I would not be without this product, and pricing is great on-line.  Would not be without this product.</li>
    <li> BEST top coat ever. Your nails will literally look like clear, shiny plastic after you&#x27;ve added this. Now I dont have to spend like a zillion dollars on top notch nail polish to achieve that plasticky look.</li>
    <li> Great product, dries nails fast and shiny.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR FAST DRYING</li>
    <li> Best top coat I ever used.  Keeps polish shiny and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple top coats and this is by far the best. Beats everything out there! Dries quick and keeps nails looking professional done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and I love Seche Top coat!!  Seche top coat is so good because if your not a nail tech your nail polish will look like you had a pro do it.  Seche evens out your polish even if you didn&#x27;t polish to a smooth finnish.  Seche helps your nail polish dry quicker too.  It takes about 24 hrs for nail polish to dry all the way through but with Seche the Top layer will be dry.  I gave this product 5 stars because I love it. I&#x27;ve been using Seche on my Clients for a long time and I always get a shiny finnish!</li>
    <li> Sure this stuff dries really fast, but it also smells awful and gets clumpy really fast. The brush also isn&#x27;t ideal. I use a Sally Hansen quick-dry topcoat, and it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy as quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad, and goes on much nicer.</li>
    <li> Ive been an avid user of OPI for many many years. My sister is the one who turned me onto the Seche Vite..and now its all I use.</li>
    <li> The best top coat!! I have been using this for a few years now, I do go to the salon to get gel manicures occasionally, but I try to do my own. This top coat not only dries quickly, but the end result looks like a gel mani. Will continue purchasing. Shipped and arrived within a week. Thank you!</li>
    <li> She was very happy and says it works great, she already is asking for more products like this one. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this while I was staying in the USA I have used it in The UK and love it, it keeps my polish on for over a week, and dries so fast no smudges. For me this was a great deal, and it was delivered quickly before my return home</li>
    <li> I am the world&#x27;s worst manicurist.  I always mess up my nails when I do them by getting them stuck on something while they are wet so this product is a life saver for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry your polish in one second- nothing will do that- but it works very quickly and produces a nice hard glossy finish.  You will be happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the great results you get with this top coat, for an extremely affordable price..  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, you will be quite pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - it works, I took it to the nail salon with me, no more smudged nails.</li>
    <li> For me the best top coat!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my very favorite top coat in the world.  I will never buy a different top coat.  Love it!</li>
