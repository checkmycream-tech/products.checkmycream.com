      <li>There are much better moisturizers out there.</li>
      <li>This is the most luxurious feeling moisturizer ever.</li>

      <li>well almost :)</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s in a pump bottle &amp; not in a tube.</li>
      <li>It is more like a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good mask</li>
      <li>but that means it will probably be perfect when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>There were many positive ones!!</li>
      <li>So, lo and behold, I did a little homework, and this works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Feels great on the skin but not enough results</li>
      <li>It smells very fresh &amp; clean, but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Instead, i put it on, wait about 5-10 minutes, then rub the product into my skin as I rinse it off in direct warm running water.</li>
      <li>A one-time only to squeeze a lot of effect is good.</li>
      <li>They are lovely, I very like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I&#x27;m going to keep looking.</li>
      <li>Great for hydrating very, very dry skin!</li>
      <li>I have no idea which ingredients might be responsible for this, but at 65 I&#x27;m really glad the endless search for a great skin product is over for the moment.</li>
      <li>I have combination dry skin, and it fix my redness with amazing result!</li>
      <li>When I first put it on it felt fine.  </li>
      <li>Already heard, this is very suitable for dry skin.</li>
      <li>It really makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>worth the money</li>
      <li>So far, it is my favorite mask --</li>
      <li>*(^&amp;&amp; and not getting my $$&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Great mask for sensitive, dry skin...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many different products... to include argan oil and</li>
      <li>I bought this mask for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I did some internet research first before I bought, and those are the vitamins you&#x27;re supposed to have</li>
      <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Great mask for lazy people!</li>
      <li>Right now it&#x27;s a bit much</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin if I am giving full disclosure.</li>
      <li>It easily rinses off and the skin is left plump and moist.</li>
      <li>Btw, it&#x27;s VERY affordable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my face was shiny just like you would expect from an \\&quot;Intense moisture</li>
      <li>Gentle yet?  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
      <li>makes my skin super soft, no harsh effects.</li>
      <li>I tried it as soon as possible and found out that the reviews were true-</li>
      <li>I have high hopes for it longer term.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll love next winter or when my skin is dry from my thyroid issues.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>This is a different mask because it feels like pure moisturizing hydration.  </li>
      <li>However this quickly evaporated and my skin was left feeling dry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this makes once so far, but I like how it feels, smells, and works.</li>
      <li>I live in an extremely dry climate.  </li>
      <li>First I exfoliate with one of those little spinning brushes.</li>
      <li>Only half a pump was necessary for my whole face, so the product lasted about 3 months (and that&#x27;s with my boyfriend stealing it).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Before purchasing this, I read the reviews. There were many positive ones!! I love that it&#x27;s in a pump bottle &amp; not in a tube. The container is great because it&#x27;s see through. The scent is just delicious!! It smells very fresh &amp; clean, but not overpowering. I leave it on an extra 5 minutes than instructed. I tissue it off with damp tissues. Then rinse with lukewarm water. My skin feels nice &amp; hydrated!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this hydrating mask to anyone with dry skin!! Btw, it&#x27;s VERY affordable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Review by Tom Chu&#x27;s wife.</li>
    <li> My skin is so tricky.......I think it&#x27;s a good product. I think I&#x27;ll love next winter or when my skin is dry from my thyroid issues. Right now it&#x27;s a bit much but that means it will probably be perfect when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> I order this all of the time.  Can&#x27;t be without.</li>
    <li> I want to be fair here.  It may be a great product for some, but it gave me a rash.  I only used it once.  I have sensitive skin if I am giving full disclosure.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin but not enough results</li>
    <li> This is the most luxurious feeling moisturizer ever.</li>
    <li> There are much better moisturizers out there. This claims to be an ultra hydrating mask that should be worn at bedtime but it feels thin and chalky. I have very dry skin and this was not effective. Buy aquaphor or use olive oil at bedtime and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been so dry and peels I have tried everything. I even tried coconut oil and bio oil NOTHING worked. everything worked while it was on my skin but once it wore off my skin went back to being dry. I put this on at night and when I wake up my face is hydrated and stays that way all day. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my face being dry and peeling since I bought this stuff. I have been using it for a couple weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this a little different than the bottle says though. I put a thin layer of this on at night and rub it into my face and neck and leave it on all night. I don&#x27;t wipe it off like the bottle says to do. If you buy this stuff you will not be wasting your money, you will love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using No. 7 products for years.  I bought this mask for the first time.  It&#x27;s just amazing how it hydrates your skin.  I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> This is not a mask.  It is more like a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It&#x27;s a really nice product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about six months and it is amazing the difference this has made in my skin.  Great for hydrating very, very dry skin!</li>
    <li> I had to get this stuff just for my forehead where it stays insanely dry and flaky. I literally get forehead dandruff, how gross is that. But since I have been treating my forehead with this, I have not had these problems as it seems to finally be under control. This cream is a bit oily, but that is what I need in that area as it cannot seem to make its own oil. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but I cannot.  When I first put it on it felt fine.  Looking in the mirror my face was shiny just like you would expect from an \\&quot;Intense moisture boost\\&quot;.  However this quickly evaporated and my skin was left feeling dry.  It did not help at all. Over the week or so that I used the product I saw no improvement and actually felt my skin was drier.  I&#x27;m now back to my usual winter moisturizer poorer but wiser.</li>
    <li> causes break outs as it clogs the skin for moisture&lt;br /&gt;Please refer to my other review about this similar product</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have dry skin and was looking for a face mask that would not dry out my skin, Boots No7 Beautiful Skin Hydration did the trick!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and have combination skin.  Just about everything but my nose is dry, especially in winter.  This is a pretty good mask but my skin feels dry again around midday.  Also, my skin feels a bit greasy to the touch even after it&#x27;s been on for a while.  It&#x27;s not bad, but I&#x27;m going to keep looking.</li>
    <li> Great mask for lazy people! I have combination dry skin, and it fix my redness with amazing result! I use it when I take shower, just 5 minutes, it will feed me skin with enough hydration.</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing review in Wall St. Journal. Tried first as a mask, but rinsing off was difficult. I then started using as a p.m. moisturizer. Wow! My skin has NEVER felt or looked so good. I have no idea which ingredients might be responsible for this, but at 65 I&#x27;m really glad the endless search for a great skin product is over for the moment.</li>
    <li> This is more of a lotion than a face mask. I used it on areas that were very dry and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a mask!</li>
    <li> It was delivered 2 days after I ordered it online. I tried it as soon as possible and found out that the reviews were true- makes my skin super soft, no harsh effects. I would love to buy 2-3 more products of this soon!</li>
    <li> I use this mask as a moisturizer. I know it supposed to be used as a mask, but my sensitive skin gets so relentlessly dry during the winter, and lately, a bit during the summer, that I&#x27;ve found wearing this mask as a moisturizer is the only thing that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a godsend for me. First I exfoliate with one of those little spinning brushes. Mine is not too expensive. Then, I apply this mask at night, or over my sunscreen during the day (especially on my forehead and neck). Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally NOTHING ELSE worked like this moisturizer for me. Now I won&#x27;t use anything else. I picked it out because I found it&#x27;s the only moisturizer that has the vitamins A, C, and E. I did some internet research first before I bought, and those are the vitamins you&#x27;re supposed to have-I was sick of paying for jars of moisturizer that didn&#x27;t do *(^&amp;&amp; and not getting my $$&#x27;s worth. So, lo and behold, I did a little homework, and this works perfectly. Yay me! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DO need to exfoliate, though, with a spinny-brush. It really makes a huge difference. Don&#x27;t settle for a washcloth- it&#x27;s NOT the same. Get the brush. You won&#x27;t BELIEVE the difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> Obviously from the title you can see what I&#x27;m using this as.  I live in an extremely dry climate.  I&#x27;ve bought so many different products... to include argan oil and this is by far the best product for me.  I break out with everything else and I keep coming back to this.  I repurchased this at ulta today and immediately saw a difference in my skin when I applied it.  Acne is flattening out and redness is going away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this makes once so far, but I like how it feels, smells, and works. I have high hopes for it longer term.</li>
    <li> This is a different mask because it feels like pure moisturizing hydration.  As it soaks into the skin, the flaky dry skin disappears.  It easily rinses off and the skin is left plump and moist. I am a fan.  It is recommended to use twice a week.  So far, it is my favorite mask -- I feel like I&#x27;m at the Red Door Spa getting a facial -- well almost :)</li>
    <li> Great mask for sensitive, dry skin...Gentle yet?  Really does the job of cleaning and opening up pores beautifully without the slightest irritation.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good ,thanks!</li>
    <li> Great hydration.  Makes my skin look great!</li>
    <li> My skin is a mixture between dry and oily. I bought this product during the transition into winter (when my skin is at its worst). It definitely exceeded my expectations but I have to admit I didn&#x27;t use as directed. It tells you to apply and wait 2-10 minutes then \\&quot;tissue off\\&quot;. Instead, i put it on, wait about 5-10 minutes, then rub the product into my skin as I rinse it off in direct warm running water. This process leaves my skin well moisturized without drying it out. Only half a pump was necessary for my whole face, so the product lasted about 3 months (and that&#x27;s with my boyfriend stealing it). We&#x27;ve bought it a second time and would recommend it to anyone who needs moisturized skin w/out being left too oily.</li>
    <li> Already heard, this is very suitable for dry skin. I have a try with the mentality to buy, did not think of really good, very suitable for me. A one-time only to squeeze a lot of effect is good. They are lovely, I very like it. I will consider to buy back.</li>
