      <li>It&#x27;s nice, I can use it, but it still works on my 5 and 6 year old granddaughters as well</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re so much better than bath towels - for one thing, they are lightweight and sit very close to the head, so getting dressed is a breeze (pulling things over your head, not worrying about a bulk towel falling off, etc.)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Turbie Twists.  Easier than using a big,bulky towel.  I travel with them too and are easy to pack and don&#x27;t take up a lot of room in your luggage.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  It barely reached around my head and was very thin and didn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great for my 8year old daughters hair also.  They last for a long time and don&#x27;t fall apart in the wash.</li>
    <li> Use these again and again in place of a big bath towel.  Design allows you to squeeze the water out of your hair instead of all the rubbing and fluffing with a towel.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and heavy and the turby twist (original) helps dry my hair before blow drying that shortens my time in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it unless you don&#x27;t mind spending money on something that is full of lint and that also comes apart in the washing machine due to the threads not being tied off. I gave a bunch of these out for Christmas last year. I&#x27;ve never been so embarrassed in my life! They are so below par that it is unbelievable. I would NEVER  buy them again! I only wish that the sellers (Amazon) would try out the products BEFORE selling them to the American public. It reflects poorly on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best product by far. It is a nice thick towel and it is well made. The quality is first rate and it is the old time authentic turbie twist, not an immitation. It survives countless washes and it look great. If you have long hair, you must get one of these. Superior to all others!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I own multiples and even take mine on vacation/travel with me. The greatest part is that I can wrap a twist on my hair when I step out of the shower and go about getting ready. I can easily fit most shirts on even while wearing the towel! Last step in my morning routine is a quickened blow dry. This frees the bathroom up to share and it allows me the freedom to run around in the morning and not decide between sacrificing my bathroom regimen for other household duties!</li>
    <li> Was not happy with this product It wasn&#x27;t the turbie twist that I was expecting It was a Aspire name that I had never heard of. It wasn&#x27;t big enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Turbie Twists for years.  A towel does not stay on my wet hair after taking a shower, so these were the perfect fix.  Mine had gotten so that the elastic was not flexible anymore.  I have had them for a few years.  These new ones are as great as the others and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 2 pack at a retail store for the same price (actually 1 cent cheaper, but whatever).  I bought them with my two young daughters in mind because they like to wear their hair in turbans after shower/bath just like I do, but for whatever reason the towels always crumple within a few seconds and the girls just can&#x27;t keep them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work but I cannot say enough wonderful things about this simple little purchase!  I have a 3 year old with long hair (all the way down her back) and a 7 year old with hair just below her ears and the Turbie Twist works perfectly on both of them.  The one with longer hair I point the \\&quot;tail\\&quot; end of the turban towards her back and wrap it around her hair and then twist it up and pull it through the elastic.  My daughter with short hair is able to bend over where her hair falls upside down on her head so I point the tail end towards her front and twist it backwards before pulling it through the elastic.  It works perfectly BOTH ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried the Turbie Twist on my own hair while it was DRY and it still held which is virtually impossible for a regular towel to do.  (I suppose it&#x27;s because the moisture makes a towel hold in place easier than one that has no dampness at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you have problems keeping regular towels on your head or your child&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> Help keep hair up and out of my girl&#x27;s face while drying. We try not to over use the hair dryer. This works well.</li>
    <li> I received 2 of these as a gift 10 years ago and haven&#x27;t used anything else since. It&#x27;s a great product that&#x27;s small and easy to wrap. I bought this 2-pack only because my daughter started stealing mine! They&#x27;ve held up great over 10 years! They&#x27;re not any more absorbent than a regular towel but are far easier to wrap and they stay put thanks to the elastic. There may be more absorbent products out there but you can&#x27;t beat the value of this one. When I ordered at the beginning of December, Amazon indicated that it may not arrive by Christmas. I contacted the seller and he responded promptly reassuring me that delivery wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I had it within a week!</li>
    <li> these are durable and work great for any length hair.  the tab to hold the towel in place on the top of your head breaks often, but you can use the Turbie Twist logo tab and it still works.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Just enough towel for your head and you save room in the laundry.  Instead of using a full size towel, just grab one of these to dry you hair.  great for vacations and/or trips.</li>
    <li> Unlike most hair towels, this does NOT use a button to secure so no more tangled hair around buttons. It uses an elastic loop that you thread the end of the towel through allowing you to make it fit snugly to your personal size.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think I have a large head and my hair is only shoulder length but after I twisted, towel too short to tuck in tightly. Kept falling off.</li>
    <li> The description is incorrect. It states that this product is 100% cotton. When I received it, the towels were made of microfiber containing no cotton at all. I am not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> i did not purchase this item on amazon but at my local fred meyer. i thought it would be great because a regular towel was too long and kept falling off. at first i liked it, but after a few washes it did not absorb the water anymore and did not dry, even after days it is still wet (it is bizarre). I have never checked if it is actually 100% cotton but i would think its not because it&#x27;s not absorbent. also, this is way too small if you have hair beyond shoulder length. definitely not recommending this product.</li>
    <li> I love this i was introduced to this by my mother inlaw and i have to buy more  cuz i had misplased the one she gave me but so happy i have this ones now i have 3...</li>
    <li> So very very disappointed. I agree with other reviewers, my old turbie twist was cotton and absorbed so much better than microfiber. If I had known they were microfiber I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased. It&#x27;s too much hassle to send them back (annoying) so I&#x27;ll keep them and use them for something else. Not sure what, but it won&#x27;t be wrapping around my wet hair.</li>
    <li> Female with long hair uses this everyday. Does not stay wet, and easy to use. Plus the 2 pack is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same micro fiber turbie twist for 7 years. Daily. The bad reviews are odd because the description says &amp;#34;microfiber &amp;#34;, not cotton. Even the one pictured says microfiber. So unless they changed the description.... These are as advertised. I have long hair and these turbans are super absorbent. Of course the turban is wet after you use it--- it absorbs the water from your hair! I also bought one for my 9 year old daughter when she was about 3. She has always had long hair and it was difficult to have her sit still long enough to towel dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Turbie is perfect for straight out of the pool as well as the shower, for both women and girls.  Especially little girls. Couldn&#x27;t be easier to use. The microfiber is superior to cotton, which gets heavy and does not wick away water as well.</li>
    <li> I love it and have given it as a gift.  She loves it also as do my other friends who have them</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that this product was not cotton.  However, I always use this to wrap my head in after I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I went through these like crazy in college, and I still love them now. I have long, thick, curly hair, and regular towels just don&#x27;t do the trick. I can walk around and DO THINGS and keep my wet hair out of my face!</li>
    <li> I love this towel. I have medium length hair and it works wonderfully. If you have a lot of hair it will probably be too thin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, I can use it, but it still works on my 5 and 6 year old granddaughters as well</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My 7 years old loves wearing these. Shipping was fast. Pretty color purple. Made of terry cloth so everything sticks to it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself, because my current on wore out. I think these are a lot softer. I use it every night!&lt;br /&gt;It was easy and fast from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like that I can put my hair up and it will semi-dry while I&#x27;m doing makeup, getting dressed etc. I do feel like over time it might put pressure on the roots of bangs because since I&#x27;ve been using it for a while I&#x27;ve noticed a few hairs have broken off about an inch away from my forehead right where the towel sits (I know it sounds lame - not to split hairs (pun intended), but I thought I&#x27;d mention it).</li>
    <li> I LOVE these!!! I received one for Christmas a few years back and never thought that I would enjoy it, but I ended up wearing it out. When I bought this two pack I keep one in my travel bag. I don&#x27;t even like traveling without it. Once you start using it, you realize how amazing it is. I have long hair and it keeps the hair out of my way while I&#x27;m getting ready and it dries it a lot faster. Buy one and you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I love this turbie twist. I just wish it was a little thicker, but it works great. I have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> Far superior to a bath towel</li>
    <li> With 3 girls in the house, all with long hair, we go through a lot of towels.  These are perfect space saving towels that pack a punch at wicking away the moisture.  Drying my kids hair took so long when using regular towels, these really make a difference at reducing the water fast in time to blow dry.  I have used these since I was a teen, 10+ years ago and they are even better today.</li>
    <li> I have had hair towels before, but this one is the best ever!  It absorbs the water so quickly and is so soft, I will buy this for a gift soon.</li>
    <li> The Turbie twist is a wonderful item. I like how it is made,and how convient it is to use. I really like the color. Thankyou for such a great product.</li>
    <li> These stay in place. You can put your make up on and get dressed and they never fall or need to be re-twisted!!!</li>
    <li> I use both towels all the time: one in the gym, and the other one at home. Washed them multiple times, the material is soft, but durable. I&#x27;m glad there are 2 of them in the pack!!!</li>
    <li> I have gotten imitations, which are made of different fabric, but they do not get the same results. The Turbie Twist is made of a very absorbent fabric, which really helps my hair dry faster. They do wear out over time. I&#x27;ve used these when I had short hair and when I had long hair, they are great for both.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I had bought some \\&quot;Twisty towels\\&quot; in the past, and assumed that these would be the same, just with a different label. However, even though i still can&#x27;t tell the difference between the material, these ones leave my hair very wet, and the towel stays wet for hours after. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, but I would buy the other ones.</li>
    <li> I bought a bargain hair towel initially and couldn&#x27;t even get my long, curly locks in it, but I could tell it would really pull out the water. Finally hunted down the more expensive variety and I love it. Gave the cheapo ones to my granddaughters for their much shorter, thinner hair. This one can handle mid-back length, thick hair with no problem and cuts drying time drastically.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law spent a lot more on QVC to buy these for my 3 year old and her 7 year old cousin.  I know that I love them.  She loves having her hair wrapped after the bath, it keeps it up so that I can dry her and lotion her up!  We travelled with it and it was great.  I&#x27;m not excited about the way the material feels, especially out of the wash, but it works so well that we use it.  I&#x27;m buying some for myself today from Amazon as they are  A LOT cheaper than on QVC.</li>
    <li> I love the turbie twist! It is perfect for my long hair and I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these towels . Just few Mns on my hair and it&#x27;s dry and soft . It fits me and my teen girl as my 18 month old babygirl . Great product !</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with this product and it does its job, but the big deal about the twistie loop instead of a button is kind of bogus. Basically, they are very similar. I got these because the buttoned ones don&#x27;t stay put that terribly well after about twenty minutes, but these suffer from the exact same problem. That said, they do fit really well for about twenty minutes, but after that I do have to do it over. The material is very absorbent, which is terrific. I will not return them as they do the job. Note: I have thick shoulder-length hair, and should warn anyone with longer hair that this will not be enough. The Aqua brand (or is it Aquis?) hold more hair in my experience. These are definitely not quite as big. So if you have a ton of hair this is not going to work for you.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I like the ability to tie it place.  I really notice a difference when I do not use.</li>
    <li> The item begins to hold onto a musty smell after a few months. I wash after each use and it is still smelly. I have to throw them away and buy new.</li>
    <li> I love these &amp;#34;turbans.&amp;#34;The alternative to these turbietwist towels is a huge heavy towel on your head, almost giving you a whiplash.....</li>
    <li> Comprei essas tocas e me surpreendi ao usa-las.&lt;br /&gt;Se soubesse que eram tão práticas já teria comprado há mais tempo.&lt;br /&gt;Recomendo.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is on the swim team and has long hair. It really bothers her when her hair is dripping down her back after practice. This is perfect to wear home so she doesn&#x27;t drip!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon. This Turbie Twist repaced the worn-out one I had gotten years ago from some mail-order catalog, where I haven&#x27;t seen it since.  I didn&#x27;t realize this item had a name.  Luckily, I examined my old one before getting rid of it, saw the tag that read, \\&quot;Turbie Twist\\&quot;, looked for \\&quot;Turbie Twist\\&quot; on Amazon and found it!  I wash my hair in the sink, wring-out most of the water with my hands, wrap a towel around my head and then take my bath.  Regular towels never stay wrapped and fall-off -- getting my hair and the towel in the way of taking my bath -- very aggravating.  But, this \\&quot;Turbie Twist\\&quot; stays put. It is sort-of tear-drop shaped -- a backward \\&quot;hood\\&quot; to fit/cover the back of your head and ears(it has a seam to help it fit from the nape of your neck to the top of your head)with a wide pointed tail end that goes to the front. It has a small elastic loop toward the top of the back seam. The loop is used to secure the turban. To wear the Turbie Twist, you bend over, fit the hood end on the back of your head and over your ears, twist the wide pointed end that falls forward around your forward hanging hair, pull back the twisted point end to the little elastic loop at the back of the \\&quot;hood\\&quot; and push the twisted point&#x27;s end tip into the little elastic loop at the back of your head -- thus forming and securing the \\&quot;turban\\&quot; that stays in place until you take-it-off by pulling the Turbie Twist pointed end out of its elastic loop.  Very clever design.  I&#x27;m not buying it to completely dry my hair.  I&#x27;m buying this to keep my wet hair out of the way, so I can work until I take the Turbie Twist \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  For wet hair, it is better than a shower cap.  After I take my bath and dry-myself-off, I take-off the Turbie Twist and rub my hair with it.  My hair is then dry enough to walk around until it air-drys or use a hair dryer if I&#x27;m going out.  I don&#x27;t think a thicker towel material would be as easy to secure.  This Turbie Twist towel stays put until you take it off.  That is why I got it and love it!  My \\&quot;2-pack\\&quot; came with a white and a lavender Turbie Twist, just like the picture.  I would be lost without this product!</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase of this product for my wife, she has beautiful long hair and this makes keeping her hair in place while drying with towel, very absornbent!</li>
    <li> What is being sent to you is not what is being advertised. The description says the towels are cotton. they were microfiber -- i hate microfiber cloths!</li>
    <li> Perfect little towel for hair drying. My hair is REALLY long and yet it still works for me. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like these towels they are great to dry your hair, but I do not care for the microfiber material, I prefer when they used cotton.</li>
    <li> not as nice as original towel material was.But works better after a few washes</li>
    <li> Great for my long hair. Better than a towel!</li>
    <li> Love these, and my hair is pretty long and I can get it all into the towel....just have to flip it up a bit before wrapping, otherwise they work well...</li>
    <li> This is a terrific idea. Made with micro fiber it&#x27;s the perfect absorbent fabric. It is a nice alternative to wrapping a giant bath towel around your head. It&#x27;s light weight and has a little loop in the back to slip the tail of the turbie twist into. If I could influence the manufacturers I would ask for it to be a bit bigger and definitely double the thickness. Over all I felt it worked well. But my hair was just as dry as if I had used a towel.(I don&#x27;t give half star ratings or it might be a 2/12).Copyright© KatherinesCorner.com-for Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I bought one for each day of the week for my teenage daughter that uses too many towels! My only complaint is the microfiber. I have an older version that is made from towel/terry cloth material that I like much better. When the microfiber is laundered, it seems to capture lots of debris into its weave- and you can&#x27;t pick it out easily.</li>
    <li> A friend let me borrow one while I was on vacation , and I loved it! Have bought several since then two for me and several cor my friends as gifts!</li>
    <li> I have used these things for about 3 years and needed to replace the worn oned. Saves a lot of drying time as they really do suck the water out of your hair. Well made. Rapidly shipped</li>
    <li> I had two when they came out years ago and finally had to get replacements.  So, I bought 4!  Awesome</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat the original Turbie Twist!  I have tried other brands and this one is definitely the best!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t think of taking a shower without my turbie.  I keep one in my suitcase all the time.  A good product.</li>
    <li> Product claims 100% cotton. Product received is 80% Polyester and 20% Polyamide - it is a weird texture and I am very disappointed with the misrepresentation of cotton versus actual microfiber. If returning it does not turn into a huge ordeal, I will not be keeping this product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girls they constantly fight over the one purple turbie twist we have so i order what i thought it will be a 2 pack of purple and i got green and pink so that is not going to solve my problem...</li>
    <li> these without buttons - but I don&#x27;t think they are as good as the original ones I bought many years ago. The material is already showing fraying but it&#x27;s still holding up and doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> These Turbie Twists were a great investment (I didn&#x27;t buy them from Amazon - I bought them from Groupon when they had a deal). I have very long, but thin, hair, and I swim several times a week. On workdays, I often shower and wash my hair twice a day, as well. This product suits my long hair very well - the ends tuck right into the pocket, as described, and then I twist it, pull it back, and thru the elastic loop in the back. They&#x27;re so much better than bath towels - for one thing, they are lightweight and sit very close to the head, so getting dressed is a breeze (pulling things over your head, not worrying about a bulk towel falling off, etc.) The other great feature is that they pull a lot of water from your hair, so your hair will dry much more quickly than with a regular towel. At home, they do dry well between showers. The ones that I handwash, however, I do not wring, but simply hang up, and those can take a long time for the water to drain and for them to dry completely (which is why I bought 9 of them at once). Another benefit for those of us who, with age, are experiencing slight thinning of our hair at the scalp, is that they do not \\&quot;pull\\&quot; at your roots the way a regular bath towel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I love &#x27;em and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> They are not real think or super absorbent but they get the job done.  My daughter has very thick hair more than halfway down her back and it works for her as well as my thinner shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Does not dry the hair. Barely soaks up any water. Does keep hair out of the way. Doesnt have a button but a loop to pull the end thru. I wonder if one had really long hair that it would stay in the turban.</li>
    <li> love it, dry my hair very fast. easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I love this turbie twist towel.  It&#x27;s much lighter than a traditional towel and winds my hair up so tightly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a towel to dry my hair since trying the Turbie Twist.  I love it!  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t hurt your neck when you have your hair wrapped up in it.  I just bought some for my friends, too!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I required. Easy and convenient. Work colleague also purchased a pack and is very pleased also. Saves using towels.</li>
    <li> I have an injured neck, so wrapping a big towel around my head for my long hair is not good. This is perfect, dries the hair, without tangling it.</li>
    <li> bought this for my 11yr old daughter who has shoulder length hair.  She loves them and they work great.  No more wet shirts or dripping hair.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the Turbie Twist in fact I gave on to my sister as a gift a d she ask me where I hit it from I said AMAZON!!!!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift that my wife also inadvertently bought for my kids also. Glad I purchased them as 1). My wifes were more expensive bought at a local store and 2). the ones she bought were not cotton but a cotton/polyester blend and were promptly returned. Whew!</li>
    <li> The package I received is Microfiber...I wanted the Original Cotton as stated on the website description.  I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting one made of cotton, but it turned out to be that micro-fiber, which I don&#x27;t like.  Otherwise, it is fine.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 9 year old who is petite. Works way better than towels. She loves it. She no longer needs my help.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second package of Turbie Twists.  I truly love them.  They&#x27;re soft, absorbent and big.  It stays in place, even after I put my rather long, wet hair into it.  Just a couple of twists and stick the end into the elastic band!  So fast and easy!  This is a definite YES!</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law turned me on to these hair towels a couple of years ago and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since.  I used to use a whole large bath towel on my head, whereas the turbie is light and efficiently dries the hair while you might be applying makeup, etc.  Love this product and have several of them.</li>
    <li> This is one of my few must-haves. I don&#x27;t even have long hair. I just like how convenient it is to put my wet hair in the turbie twist and get ready for the day.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I are thrilled with our Turbie Twists! It keeps our wet hair off of us while we get dressed.</li>
    <li> Takes all of the moisture out quickly!</li>
    <li> Non-absorbent towels.  I did not find these to be absorbent at all.  I would send them back but the package did not come with a return label or instructions on how to return.</li>
    <li> wife loves it.  works just like advertised.  quality product. I i i i i i i i i i i</li>
    <li> I love the turbie towel. It is perfect for getting out of the shower or bath and throwing your hair up in. It is so much better than a bulky towel and much smaller so I can fit this in my gym bag much easier then another towel.</li>
    <li> I love using these after the shower to keep my hair out of the way while I do my makeup and get ready. It doesn&#x27;t absorb well at all, but it&#x27;s much easier than trying to keep a regular towel on your hair!</li>
    <li> The turbie twist has a chemical smell to it that I don&#x27;t remember when I bought my first one a number of years ago.  After a couple of washings it still has an odor. Otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  They work perfectly to wrap my wet hair in after a shower.  They also work perfectly to wrap my dry hair in if I want to keep it dry during a shower.  Keep one in the bathroom and one in the gym bag.</li>
    <li> was not what was advertised sent it back</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Turbie Twist for 2-3 years now, and it&#x27;s great!  When I shower, I can wash my hair first, then the Turbie Twist absorbs excess moisture while keeping my hair (3-4&amp;#34; past shoulder length) up and out of the way, and unlike a towel, it stays put!&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that whatever the length and texture of your hair, there seems to be plenty of room in the Turbie Twist to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product to use on my child&#x27;s thick thick hair. I couldn&#x27;t get a towel to stay on her head because they were too heavy but this is awesome!  She doesn&#x27;t fuss anymore!</li>
    <li> Love these towels because they are 100% cotton and they are not easy found in the market place.  Highly recommend trying them.</li>
    <li> These are reasonable in price . If you take one in your suitcase you don&#x27;t have to keeping calling to the hotel housekeeping services  to ask for another towel. They dry quickly,too.</li>
    <li> It is micro fiber and it did not say that  I hate it and will not use it.</li>
