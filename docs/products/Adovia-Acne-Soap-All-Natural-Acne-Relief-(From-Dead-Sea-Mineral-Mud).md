### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>i tried this soap this morning and it comes off wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Great value!</li>
      <li>This soap is awesome.</li>
      <li>The best minerals and ingredients to get rid of acne!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!  </li>
      <li>This soap is a good for oily skin.      </li>
      <li>really loved how the soap moisturized my skin and made my skin feel very smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and my product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>i loved it the best thanks so much</li>
      <li>this soap has a good scent and makes your skin feel clean and exfoliated I need to order more from this seller as I used this one the fastest</li>
      <li>Some cleansiers and soaps I&#x27;ve tried would overdry my skin which would cause it to break out even more, but this one balances the oils without overdrying.</li>
      <li>This product was ok.</li>
      <li>I had tried many OTC products before this one, they all dryed out my skin to a point where my face would bleed.</li>
      <li>if it gets any better within a week i will write a review and tell you guys.</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with this soap.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if it has improved my acne as I recently started on some oral medications from my physician for my acne, it is however a wonderful cleanser.</li>
      <li>The price is pretty good for this product and the soap lasts for quite some time.</li>
      <li>By the way, I naturally have oily skin and this product does a great job on balancing my skin.</li>
      <li>I have naturally very oily skin, and my skin tone is fair.</li>
      <li>i use a gel moisturizer and that works just fine for me.</li>
      <li>This soap has done a great job clearning up my facial acne.</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a soap to keep the pores clean this might be it.</li>
      <li>The only downside I can think of regarding the soap is that its scent isn&#x27;t the most pleasant (reminds me a little of how play-doh smells), but this isn&#x27;t an issue--the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, and the effectiveness of the soap is, after all, the most important aspect!</li>
      <li>I bought this soap a few months ago and was happy with it, it will not cure acne</li>
      <li>I love using this soap in the morning instead of my old cleanser.</li>
      <li>After using it my skin feels soft smooth and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>I could see and feel results from the first use.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this soap.</li>
      <li>I can feel my skin just soaking up the nutrients, and afterwards my skin is sooo smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>It really works great if you take a few minutes and really rub it into your face.</li>
      <li>I must admit this soap works pretty well.</li>
      <li>it might have been because this was my first use</li>
      <li>This product helped some of my acne, but actually made most of my my acne linger longer than if I were not to use it at all.</li>
      <li>Make sure you do use a moisterizer after because the soap does dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>however nothing really made a difference for me.</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t really smell it unless you put it up to your nose and smell it.</li>
      <li>The soap does not have a real smell to it, but when you use it you can feel that it works.</li>
      <li>I did not notice much of a difference while using it.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product that was more natural than the usual chemical filled face washes out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other acne products</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;d recommend this if you tend to be a little oily, have sensitive skin, or are just looking for a great gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>and this is pretty much the only thing that works.</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals!</li>
      <li>i used this soap while showering and while your in the shower it leaves your skin feeling very dry, but when you dry your face off it feels better.</li>
      <li>The thing I like the most about the soap is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin (I had been using salicylic acid/benzoyl peroxide products, and they cause my skin to become very dry and scaly).  </li>
      <li>if i do end up getting a pimple due to hormones or stress it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything, this works for because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This soap will get you clean, however it is a little drying.</li>
      <li>You can find something with the same ingredients for FAR cheaper.</li>
      <li>Let me start with I am a 26 year old female with no history of acne.</li>
      <li>I will keep on using these treatments since they have been the only ones that have worked for me so far.</li>
      <li>And to top it off, they made the breakouts worse.</li>
      <li>My skin is not dried out, and it has actually gotten rid of my acne in a very short period of time.  </li>
      <li>i have struggled with acne for years not only on my face but my back as well and let me tell you this cleanser has completely cleared both problems up.</li>
      <li>It does seem to make me a little dry in some areas, but a little oil free moisturizer takes care of that!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Let me start with I am a 26 year old female with no history of acne. About 3 months ago, out of nowhere I started having severe cystic acne breakouts on my face, shoulders, and back. I had tried many OTC products before this one, they all dryed out my skin to a point where my face would bleed. And to top it off, they made the breakouts worse. I started using this just over 2 weeks ago. I can&#x27;t say if it has improved my acne as I recently started on some oral medications from my physician for my acne, it is however a wonderful cleanser. After using it my skin feels soft smooth and squeaky clean. It does seem to make me a little dry in some areas, but a little oil free moisturizer takes care of that! Overall I&#x27;d recommend this if you tend to be a little oily, have sensitive skin, or are just looking for a great gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> This soap helped with my acne problems but made my face very dry. Even after putting on moisturizer, I felt some tightness on my face, but at least it lessened the acne problems on my face.</li>
    <li> This soap is a good for oily skin.      It does remove oil and cure for your acne.    I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
    <li> This product helped some of my acne, but actually made most of my my acne linger longer than if I were not to use it at all.</li>
    <li> This product was ok. I did not notice much of a difference while using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap a few months ago and was happy with it, it will not cure acne it just helps prevent it...every glycerin soap helps to prevent acne. I like the fact that it has dead sea minerals.However, $50 for a bar of soap is beyond outrageous. I bought this for $6 last time. You can find something with the same ingredients for FAR cheaper. $50...for soap...seriously.</li>
    <li> dont wste your money i have only been useing this product for 2 days and it made may acne worstt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne forever and this is pretty much the only thing that works. It&#x27;s amazing. I can feel my skin just soaking up the nutrients, and afterwards my skin is sooo smooth and soft to the touch. No more redness.</li>
    <li> I bough this soap because of the reviews. I dont have severe acne but i get a pimple every now and then. This soap will get you clean, however it is a little drying. Skin feels tight after.     Overall dont expect miracles from it. But if you are looking for a soap to keep the pores clean this might be it.</li>
    <li> I received the soap 3 days ago, and I can already see results.  The smaller pimples I had are gone, while the bigger ones are significantly smaller.  The thing I like the most about the soap is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin (I had been using salicylic acid/benzoyl peroxide products, and they cause my skin to become very dry and scaly).  The only downside I can think of regarding the soap is that its scent isn&#x27;t the most pleasant (reminds me a little of how play-doh smells), but this isn&#x27;t an issue--the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, and the effectiveness of the soap is, after all, the most important aspect!</li>
    <li> This soap has done a great job clearning up my facial acne. I&#x27;ll be buying it regularly.</li>
    <li> The soap does not have a real smell to it, but when you use it you can feel that it works. I think that it has helped my skin, and I have tough skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 5 days since I was using this product and I can literally see pimples and blackheads washed away after every use. I look forward to washing cause I know my skin gets clearer everytime.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry and absolutely no redness. I can actually see my skin now and not covered up with dried skin and pimples. I hope it lasts forever and even during PMS days. Keeping my hopes up!</li>
    <li> Finally something that has finally gotten rid of my acne.  I was using benzoyl peroxide, just to have my acne get worse.  I didn&#x27;t want to continue to use harsh chemicals on my skin, so I gave this a try.  I LOVE IT!!  My skin is not dried out, and it has actually gotten rid of my acne in a very short period of time.  I could see and feel results from the first use.  I will definitely be buying more of this soap.</li>
    <li> This dead sea mud soap helped remove acne off my face.  It really works great if you take a few minutes and really rub it into your face. I&#x27;ve tried everything, this works for because I have sensitive skin.  No harsh chemicals! The best minerals and ingredients to get rid of acne! Highly recommend this. The bar lasts a long time. Great value!</li>
    <li> I must admit this soap works pretty well. It cleans your face and drys up the spots. Make sure you do use a moisterizer after because the soap does dry out your skin. The price is pretty good for this product and the soap lasts for quite some time. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this soap. I&#x27;ve tried many other acne products however nothing really made a difference for me. I have been using this soap for a month now and it has cleared my acne problem. By the way, I naturally have oily skin and this product does a great job on balancing my skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that was more natural than the usual chemical filled face washes out there. I use this soap once a day at night and follow up with a night cream. It dries my skin a little-- I have oily combination skin and I&#x27;m in my late 20s. I haven&#x27;t broken out as a result of this soap. Will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> this soap has a good scent and makes your skin feel clean and exfoliated I need to order more from this seller as I used this one the fastest i loved it the best thanks so much</li>
    <li> I love using this soap in the morning instead of my old cleanser. this soap is all natural and has dead sea minerals and glycerin, but no harsh chemicals. Some cleansiers and soaps I&#x27;ve tried would overdry my skin which would cause it to break out even more, but this one balances the oils without overdrying. I recommend it if you have serious acne or even occasional breakouts or blemishes.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my acne worse. I am 26 and my acne appears of a suden, I had never had acne before in my life. I was just devastated. I tried with \\&quot;2x Nature&#x27;s Cure Two Part Acne Treatment System for Males\\&quot; and combined it with \\&quot;Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash\\&quot; I saw results in only one week. I will keep on using these treatments since they have been the only ones that have worked for me so far. Of course, keep in mind that what works for me might not work for you. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I NEVER ORDERED THIS PRODUCT; MUST CHECK MY ACCOUNT. WHAT IS GOING ON? SHAKING MY HEAD;THIS I CANNOT BELIEVE, OMG.</li>
    <li> I just received my order of this soap today. The shipping was fast and my product arrived in perfect condition. I have naturally very oily skin, and my skin tone is fair. i have been suffering from acne since the fourth grade. i am now almost seventeen. i tried this soap this morning and it comes off wonderfully. i used this soap while showering and while your in the shower it leaves your skin feeling very dry, but when you dry your face off it feels better. i was hoping that i wouldn&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer, but sadly i had to. my skin was quite dry afterwards. it might have been because this was my first use but i will continue to test this product. if it gets any better within a week i will write a review and tell you guys. the soap does have a scent it sort of smells like salt. but you can&#x27;t really smell it unless you put it up to your nose and smell it. also my pores visibly became smaller after this use. i have blackheads on my cheeks. where the bridge of my nose connects to my cheeks and they were visibly smaller.  i&#x27;ll write a review in a week and tell you guys what happens.</li>
    <li> i have struggled with acne for years not only on my face but my back as well and let me tell you this cleanser has completely cleared both problems up. if i do end up getting a pimple due to hormones or stress it goes away quickly. This soap is awesome. the only draw back is it will dry your skin out a little bit. the only thing you have to remember is not to use a heavy moisturizer just because your skin feels a little drier then normal. i use a gel moisturizer and that works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin hydrated. So hydrated that you can skip lotion a day or two, just took too damn long to come</li>
    <li> Adovia Acne Soap - All Natural Acne Relief (From Dead Sea Mineral Mud had cleared up my acne a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I really loved how the soap moisturized my skin and made my skin feel very smooth. I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this soap and seller to anyone wanting clearer skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and save shipping. Did not work for my son&#x27;s acne at all. Might work for minor outbreaks but not for severe.</li>
