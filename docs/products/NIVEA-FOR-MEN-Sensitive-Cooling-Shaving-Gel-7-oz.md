      <li>works fine and provides</li>

      <li>I think they were going for a color free, perfume free thing here...</li>
      <li>Comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I love that it is not watery at all and stays right where you put it.  </li>
      <li>Very nice smell, light blue in color, very hydrating, allows a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This shaving gel produces a thick, creamy lather that goes on beautifully, and I didn&#x27;t have to go over any area more than once.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m female and go through a LOT of shaving cream like most women do in the summer months.  </li>
      <li>For a 3-pak I paid around $4 which is great as I can see this lasting a long time.</li>
      <li>Love the price and the feel of Nivea- instead of buying two different products</li>
      <li>I tried switching back and forth to make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts and every time I used NIVEA I had a closer shave.</li>
      <li>The NIVEA sensitive so far has been my favorite shave gel.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t mind the smell (my daughter says, &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t really smell manly&amp;#34;) and i haven&#x27;t seen any razor burns on them, so</li>
      <li>This product has several other great features.  </li>
      <li>My legs were super soft and smooth, continuing even into the next day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They say this is designed for Men, but my wife uses it and also really likes it.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good product from Nivea</li>
    <li> Love this shaving gel!</li>
    <li> I really like this gives me a great shave.</li>
    <li> High quality cream but it comes out slowly and has a weak lather. Only apply to your face where you are shaving it immediately as it drys up quick on skin</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used - I&#x27;m a former Edge gel user.  I get a great shave and my face feels great afterwards.</li>
    <li> This gel is a lot thicker than other gel shaving products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great. Very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed at first because it didn&#x27;t give a cooling sensation, but the gel lathering into foam and the feeling after shave made up for it,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m female and go through a LOT of shaving cream like most women do in the summer months.  This shaving gel produces a thick, creamy lather that goes on beautifully, and I didn&#x27;t have to go over any area more than once. I love that it is not watery at all and stays right where you put it.  The cooling sensation is very mild yet noticeable.  My legs were super soft and smooth, continuing even into the next day.</li>
    <li> Had expected it to be a &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; type of product ... almost &amp;#34;menthol&amp;#34; like but it&#x27;s not in any way.</li>
    <li> Bc of my sensitive skin this creams seems to be the only one on the market that acirritation.s w/o the irritation</li>
    <li> I love NIVEA anything. And this is great for shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> This is my new standard shave cream. Thought it would be tough to beat the old standby, Edge for sensitive skin. Well, this cream does win with aplomb!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I was impressed. I have a thick beard and shaving has always been painful. However, this gel foams up and appears to soften and moisturizer the hairs. Consequently, the razor removes the beard with ease and this gel leaves no irritation. My expensive razor blades seem to last longer too!</li>
    <li> I like it. works fine and provides good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t feel any &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; or colder than any other shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought this cuz it was cheap and i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. Not as much cooling as you would like but smooth.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff.</li>
    <li> For those saying this scent is not very strong, and it lacks any smell, I ask you which product you have purchased?  I got this shaving gel on a great deal for my husband, and I thought since it was &amp;#34;scent less&amp;#34; I could maybe use it too.  I discovered that I do not enjoy going around with smooth legs that smell like a man.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It comes out as a gel and as you apply to your face it forms into a creamy cooling lather.  When I used this product for the first time I noticed how well it stayed in place, almost locked onto each individual hair.  It was very easy to run my razor through this foam because it softened by beard hair.  I&#x27;ve come to a conclusion (based on length of use) this shave gel allows me to use my blades longer.  Which is a great way to save money, as 8 blades usually run me 32 dollars.  This product has several other great features.  Having NO alcohol, as alcohol immediately harms the skin and starts a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated.  Studies have shown regular exposure to alcohol-based products, becomes a damaging ordealâ€”skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding the skin&#x27;s barrier. It basically kills skin cells in turn ruining your complexion.  It has Chamomile extract which is beneficial for caring for sensitive skin.  The Chamomile plant is a natural antiseptic, antibacterial, anti fungal and offers anti-allergenic properties it is widely used in products made to treat rashes and other skin irritants.  Seaweed extract which is packed with vitamins and minerals that promote healing.  Seaweed promotes skin hydration as well as tightening of the skin. It has anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant accelerates the natural repair process of the skin while providing added protection from the harsh environmental elements in the air and water.  Kelp (Fucus Vesiculosus) is rich in iodine, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, silicon and iron and high in some B-complex vitamins. It contains moderate amounts of phosphorus, selenium, manganese and zinc and small amounts of vitamins A, C, E and G. All of which is excellent for chronic dry skin. If your looking for a product that is extremely gentle, has a great light scent and is VERY effective, this is the product for you!!is VERY effective, this is the product for you!!</li>
    <li> excellent shave cream</li>
    <li> Foams and spreads nicely and has less razorburn than Gillette (for me at least).</li>
    <li> hard to exactly control how much to squiz out.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very economical and thick.</li>
    <li> My son has very sensitive skin. We have tried many different kinds of shaving gel, but this one is the best. He does not break out in acne with this one. If this review helped you, please click &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; on the button. thanks.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Good value and quality.</li>
    <li> Has a very light, clean scent.</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves this.</li>
    <li> Long time user of the regular Sensitive shaving gel , I gave this one a try but I found shaving to be less comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I do not see the benefit of the cooling sensation if my face ends up irritated.</li>
    <li> My husband said it wasn&#x27;t that great and preferred to us the brand he was already using</li>
    <li> Nivea&#x27;s Sensitive Cooling Shaving Gel has been a great product overall.  The cooling effect is pleasant to put on and the shaving gel itself provides a close shave without causing any irritation or nicks.  In addition, the scent itself is very nice as well.  This is my favorite shaving gel / cream product and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> love this stuff better than gilette</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, as does my three daughters and wife!  I bought a three pack of this and we&#x27;ve put a can in every bathroom. The reviews from my ladies are positive! They don&#x27;t mind the smell (my daughter says, &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t really smell manly&amp;#34;) and i haven&#x27;t seen any razor burns on them, so I guess that&#x27;s good. I use it on my neck and cheeks that surround my beard. It does the job. Nice and slick!</li>
    <li> Great deal, cant go wrong. NIVEA is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great for my tough, thick beard and tender ginger skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for the product. No razor burn or bumps leave me a close shave</li>
    <li> No more cuts. Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well, no issues with this.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better shaving crams i have tried and I have tried many. My face breaks out easy so I am picky about what shaving cream I use. After using Nivea for about a week I was pleased that I didn&#x27;t break out one time and it feels so good (a cooling effect) going on.</li>
    <li> I bought a few bottles of this as well as Edge Sensitive Skin to comapre and NIVEA Sensitive Cooling wins hands down for multiple reasons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this shave cream I got a closer shave than with Edge Sensitive Skin. I tried switching back and forth to make sure I wasn&#x27;t nuts and every time I used NIVEA I had a closer shave. My skin also felt nicer using NIVEA over Edge. I have sensitive skin and found that my skin was less red/irritated when using this shame cream as well. Edge left my face with some very slight redness around my beard area. Edge Sensitive Skin does have a more noticeable cooling effect over NIVEA, but I preferred the slight cooling of NIVEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say this is designed for Men, but my wife uses it and also really likes it. She tried Edge as well, but she hated the cooling feel of Edge. Going forward, this will be my preferred choice for shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great smell too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much as you get a lot of lather for a small dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to get a year of shaving or more out of a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and cool looking gel... Comes out as a gel but turns into a foam as you mix it around. For a 3-pak I paid around $4 which is great as I can see this lasting a long time. I&#x27;ve gone through not even one bottle in about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream on the market</li>
    <li> I have three men shaving in my house - hubby and two older teen boys, so we go through a lot of shaving cream.  This seems to be the one everyone prefers best.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin, is &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; going on, and lasts longer than other brands...and I like the manly scent!  We have these on our monthly subscribe order because shaving cream apparently is needed at home, in their trucks, in their gym lockers, at school, etc.</li>
    <li> Comfortable shave. Wish the gel foamed a little less so I could see what I was shaving.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. The hardest thing is finding it locally and then hiding it from your wife.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat Nivea for sensitive skin, or slightly sunburned skin.</li>
    <li> I really like Nivea sensitive shaving gel and gave been using it for a few years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wanted something mentholated and &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.  So when I saw the ad and the photo, I was excited and ordered several.  Well, just as one of the other reviewers note, the ad is misleading&lt;br /&gt;the color of label is NOT light blue, the word &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; is not on the label and the gel is not &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; or mentholated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wanted to return the product and Expedite Me wanted to charge me a 15% restocking fee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After placing a complaint, the rescinded the demand for the restocking fee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware...what u see on the ad is NOT what will arrive if u order this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, Nivea Sensitive Gel is a great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A GOOD MENTHOLATED SHAVING GEL.  Edge, many years ago, made one, but stopped</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Nice smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves using this shave gel.  It leaves his skin smooth and soft after every shave.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, keeps the face free from cuts and burns and each can is long lasting, I bought this on sale (thanks Amazon) and that real increased the value for me.</li>
    <li> Felt a bit weaker strength than the one i bought from a nearby store.</li>
    <li> Very good product, also does not leave rust circles if you keep it in the shower from the bottom of the can since the can is made out of aluminum.</li>
    <li> Works great. I purchased the 3 pack. Comes out as gel and forms into foam as you apply to your face.</li>
    <li> Nivea shaving gel works well and feels good, but my main reason for preferring it over Gillette is that the Nivea can is made of aluminum, which will not rust. Gillette cans leave a rusty ring mark on the shower shelf.</li>
    <li> works great smooth on skin and lathers well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve originally bought him the Nivea sensitive aftershave, and was pleasantly surprised to see the shave gel on Amazon at a great price for a 3 pack. The sensitive line of Nivea products is inexpensive, yet effective, would recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice product for a change from Gillette .</li>
    <li> I liked the gel, it dosen&#x27;t make the skin dry and no need for my to apply any after shave or anything. 4 star bcoz of the price else 5 star.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with razor burn on my neck. The NIVEA sensitive so far has been my favorite shave gel. With a good, fresh blade, I typically don&#x27;t have issue with burning any more. Great product.</li>
    <li> great- very creamy and lasts a long time. A lot of Gel shoots out at one time if you press the button too long so just a short press is enough</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving cream (even though it is a man&#x27;s product) for my legs. This is the only shaving cream I can find that doesn&#x27;t give me red bumps and itchiness. I take away a star for price. I only buy it when it is on sale or has an amazon coupon, as it is a little pricey for me.</li>
    <li> More expensive than my edge but I gave it a try. Jury still out if I repeat. I think it will depend on price when I need to reorder</li>
    <li> Love Love this product.  It is the beast shaving gel ever.  I use this product to have not just my whiskers but my entire head as well.  It is an awesome products</li>
    <li> Couple things I thought I would point out which took me a little by surprise, hopefully I&#x27;ll save you the &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34;, actually neither are a big deal.  First the can shows a blue gel, mine came out an semi-transparent white. I was like, &amp;#34;did they forget to add color to mine?&amp;#34;  Secondly, another reviewer pointed out it has a nice smell...  well, if you consider an almost no-existent smell nice, this is for you.  I personally like a &amp;#34;get your ass up and moving&amp;#34; shocking smell.  This gel is very light on any odor, all be it subtle an yes &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.  So it&#x27;s all preferential... I think they were going for a color free, perfume free thing here... maybe marketing had it off.  All in all a nice gel.</li>
    <li> I dont break out after using this cream as I would have with other scented shaving creams. Its not as &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; or slippery as other creams as I&#x27;ve tried, but I supplement with some face lotion after shaving.</li>
    <li> Husband likes his shave gel.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, light blue in color, very hydrating, allows a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit for a minute, makes my facial hair softer and easier to shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product from Nivea for over two years and will never go back to any other shaving products. It is very soft and smooth on facial skin and create extremely good lather quickly. Nivea makes great men&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully well.</li>
    <li> Love the price and the feel of Nivea- instead of buying two different products my husband and I share this in the shower.  Great lather and smells nice for both of us as well.</li>
