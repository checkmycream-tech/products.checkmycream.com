    <li> It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not comparable to a sigma kabuki brush but it works great for the daily. I use it to apply bb cream everyday and it&#x27;s perfect for it.  Ok so I had given this 5 stars... Definitely not 5 starts. It felt part a month later. The glue got soft and it&#x27;s in the garbage now.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works very good with liquid foundation and feels great too!</li>
    <li> Works as well as my $30 one!</li>

    <li> Really good for the price</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. For the  quality of the brush you&#x27;d expect to be paying $10 minimum. So soft new favorite brush.</li>
    <li> blendable, no streaks. great arrived sooner than expected</li>

    <li> For the price its not bad. I use it for everyday liquid foundation. Does the job and seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> For a cheap brush, it worked very well. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this brush being it was made in China and it was only a dollar. The bristles are very soft and the brush is holding up pretty well. My only complaint would be that the brush was a little bit bigger than I was expecting so It makes it more difficult to put product under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Wish I had a spare for when I clean this one.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Helps me put less foundation than I really need. Makes me look amazing!</li>
    <li> works really well at blending foundation on skin, just gets a lot of product build up over time but that&#x27;s normal with any brush</li>
    <li> Makes a little lines but once settled just use it and it&#x27;ll smooth it out</li>
    <li> Mine smelled really bad. Like horse manure and gasoline mixed. the smell did wash out, but then the bristles lost their softness and shape. There wasn&#x27;t any shedding though. Useless.</li>
