<li> I had read some bad reviews about the beads being messed up, but mine were fine.</li>
<li> Now some will crack and become hard to get off, but that&#x27;s no problem just squeeze them in the opposite direction until you hear or feel it break</li>
<li> It is a little wait to get it</li>
<li> it was extremely difficult trying to get the hair through the beads because the cylinder was very small if you want somthing that is going to make the process a tad bit quicker</li>
<li> They are completely useless to me.</li>
<li> I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <li> I wish you were able to put no stars as a review! First off They did not resembled the ones in the picture. They are not silicone lined.  I picked these micro beads out of all the other micro beads because they were affordable in the also were supposably silicone lined. I am disappointed with this purchase. the silicone is there to protect your hair. For all the people who are okay with not having it still a the silicone is there to protect your hair. For all the people who are okay with not having it silicone, you are not aware of what damage your causing.</li>
    <li> took about two weeks for delivery but the beads are exactly what I wanted. good quality and a big amount for a good price.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems, they&#x27;re working just fine for me! No slippage. No damage. Its an all around good product.</li>
    <li> good price good product excellent if i neeed buy i buy again for my personal use i contact you again</li>
    <li> perfect. good quality after installing lasted for about 3 weeks before coming loose</li>
    <li> I found with these links they were easy to install but slipped out of my hair after about 2 weeks. I have oily hair so I figured this was the problem. I applied them to my sister&#x27;s hair and they stayed in a lot longer since she has coarse hair. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> These little guys do exactly what they say, and they came really fast too. Now some will crack and become hard to get off, but that&#x27;s no problem just squeeze them in the opposite direction until you hear or feel it break and it will slip right off the hair.</li>
    <li> the beads did exactly what they were supposed to do, but I would prefer larger beads it was extremely difficult trying to get the hair through the beads because the cylinder was very small if you want somthing that is going to make the process a tad bit quicker I would suggest a larger bead.</li>
    <li> The silicone inside the bead might come out if you use too much hair. But they worked fine for me</li>
    <li> Easy to bend and are very sturdy! I wish these were matte though. You could see the shine through my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great value and quality</li>
    <li> After waiting close to a month for the delivery, the links delivered were without the silicon lining. They are completely useless to me. I just threw them away.</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive but it was definitely worth the wait. I can&#x27;t find a deal like this anywhere else</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as pictured, haven&#x27;t used the product as of yet, but they are exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Company cheated me of my product. Said 500 pieces but only received 320  in the bottles. Will never order again!! Honesty is important!!!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail last week but it is not the same item as in the picture. The beads are longer and not silicone lined.</li>
    <li> The description was exact and they work very well.</li>
    <li> This product is great and very AFFORDABLE!!  It is a little wait to get it but once I received them, they were worth the wait.  Will definitely order from Seller again.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Hasn&#x27;t slipped at all!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived a week before the estimated time!</li>
    <li> These are great. I had my hair extensions done professionally the first time and decided to redo it myself. I bought these and was worried they would not work as well but they are great. I would recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> Minus the long shipping time, these beads never fail me. I use them on myself and all of my clients and they are fool proof.</li>
