      <li>The soap itself is magnificent as it seems to break the bonds between oil / dirt / skin for a truly &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>Use baking soda and vinegar, best way to clean them.</li>
      <li>and also my son uses baby mild which is excellent too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great and is pretty gentle.</li>
    <li> I dislike the smell. It smells too menthol-y and medicinal. In the future, I will purchase soap that smells like banana runts.</li>
    <li> Previously I had only tried the peppermint which is a BLAST of mint that you can feel! This has a great earthy scent similar to tea tree oil. It doesn&#x27;t quite pack the punch that the peppermint does, but great if you&#x27;re looking for something a little more subtle. Also this is a great price point! Retail sells the same size bottle for around $25+.</li>
    <li> I would reccomend Dr Bronners Castile Soaps to everyone.  They clean so well, and leave absolutely no residue of any kind.  The soap rinses out of the wash sponge, cloth, or whatever and leaves it clean. Wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this product and its strong eucalyptus scent!  Great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> We use it on everything? This is a great soap. But I found it costs a lot less at Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for years. Love the eucalyptus smell. Very refreshing. The stuff lasts a long time, too. The good doctor is long gone and his label rambling may seem a bit odd, but you don&#x27;t have to read it to get benefit from the soap.</li>
    <li> I dilute mine because 1) it&#x27;s very strong and 2) it makes it go further and 3) it&#x27;s expensive.  But if you dilute it in a separate bottle, a little goes a long way.  This stuff works very well for me, and I&#x27;ve tried many things that haven&#x27;t worked.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I got this as a gift, and I was like why is this girl giving me soap - is she trying to send me a message?  So, I guess it was her way of telling me that I stunk or something, but hurt feelings aside, this stuff is really great and I&#x27;m a regular customer now.  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s concentrated because it lasts longer for me that way.  I highly suggest this product to anyone who has the $$ to spend on soap.</li>
    <li> A great product that I have used for years. It has a nice clean scent and provides a nice clean feeling. Not all the perfume other soaps have.</li>
    <li> Good stuff - right price.  Nice to find this as it is not the easiest to locate.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and at good price</li>
    <li> This is my day-in and day-out shower and shaving soap.  Dilute it with water and use in a squirt bottle for body wash and shaving.  I like eucalyptus for year &#x27;round use, but particularly in winter when peppermint soap feels chilly.  I like the eucalyptus smell, and have always liked the clean feel Dr. Bronner&#x27;s leaves.  Remember to dilute at least 50/50 with water.  This soap goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Contains no harsh chemicals.  I use it for dish washing soap and for all kitchen cleaning tasks.  Plus they donate their profits to good causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it for shower/bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it - you&#x27;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Have used for several years as daily body wash &amp; shampoo.  All versions smell wonderfully and have no chemicals.  Safe and biodegradable.  Also excellent for general household cleaning - can replace a myriad of cleaning products.  Super-concentrated so a bottle lasts a long time.  May dry out skin as it is a very effective degreaser.</li>
    <li> dr brommers is the best soap no lie</li>
    <li> My husband loves this for his body soap I prefer the Rose scent. We by the large size and put in a pump dispenser and place in our shower and by our sinks for hand soap. The eucalyptus scent is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> all natural, with natural oils so wont dry out your skin. a house favorite!</li>
    <li> awfully big bottle. I love the product though it&#x27;s great especially for tattoos</li>
    <li> Love the eucalyptus scent &amp; non-toxic ingredients. Safe for the ones I love to use</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It cleans pretty much everything and rinses easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 18-in-1 Hemp Eucalyptus liquid soap for my shampoo and body soap for about 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;Very superior to all other products, and you only need 1 product!  The company must be run by lunatics,&lt;br /&gt;as the bottle is covered with all manner of weird religious crap, which I can&#x27;t read because the print is&lt;br /&gt;so small.  But the soap is fabulous!!</li>
    <li> The smell of Eucalyptus is one of the most invigorating scents which I believe men and women can agree on. I don&#x27;t mind the fruity stuff, but some men do. Likewise, not all women dig that Old Spice scent. Eucalyptus is something we should all be able to agree on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the scent, this cleans very well. I&#x27;m not one to moisturize, so perhaps I&#x27;m not the best judge, but I don&#x27;t feel this soap dries out your skin excessively the way some other soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean most of my body with this soap except for my feet (I use tea tree soap for that due to its anti-fungal properties) and the parts where shampoo is more appropriate.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t leave behind a smell.  Can use on laundry and as body wash.</li>
    <li> Forget the $1 store, by this and it will last a long time. Just washing the hair, this 32 oz will last me all year! My hair loves it and I love how affordable it is and its organic!</li>
    <li> Simply the best.  I use this as a shampoo and as my showering soap.  It goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need much.  It is just great soap!</li>
    <li> After trying out three unique types of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, I don&#x27;t foresee a time in the future without them. I bought the Eucalyptus after running out of Peppermint, and love it even more.</li>
    <li> one of the cleanest castile soaps I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are all natural. What you put on your skin or in your mouth or on your head passes even the blood brain barrier....make sure it is NON-TOXIC. You can choose your flavor and use this for the hand soap dispenser all over the house...scrub the floors...wash the woodwork...washing the car...your hair...a shower soap...bathing...to brush your teeth and for a pet shampoo. I use it on the cats and the dogs.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff for Years! I tend to add DoTerra EOs to it as well to change up the scent. Works Great!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.It&#x27;s basically a perfect product all around. It&#x27;s fair trade, organic, it produces no waste, it&#x27;s family owned and operated, no animal testing, and alsoo it smells fantastic! I wash my hair with it (properly) and my lockes are angel-soft. If you want to learn more on how awesome Dr. Bronner is, there is a documentary called &amp;#34;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soapbox&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> love it . need only few drops to make lot of lather. I use it every day. Smells great if you like eucalyptus</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I would suggest it to anyone, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Also like that it is fair trade.</li>
    <li> i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
    <li> I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s and use it for everything from floors and bathtubs to counters and dirty dishes. Dilute it with some water in a spray bottle and it seems to last forever. The Eucalyptus scent is really nice and not overwhelming at all. I expected it to be much stronger, but was pleased to find that it&#x27;s a very gentle, fresh scent!</li>
    <li> I like the peppermint soap better, but this is a good one to alternate with.  It especially leaves your shower smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it on my hair and body. It works as a great shampoo for the hair with all of the oils in the product.</li>
    <li> Best all purpose soap ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Been using it for years, decided to get my friends hooked on it, it worked!  Don&#x27;t change the product!  Smells great especially during time of cold and flu!</li>
    <li> best soap ever. The lid did cracked during shipping, but didn&#x27;t leak. Still pours into seperate bottles. My mom likes the soap too, and our family boarder collie austrailian shepherd likes also. Will buy again. Suggest the seller to protect the lids of larger bottles by taping the airpadding to the cap-side of the box. In good health, C.M.H.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other soap or shampoo anymore. I originally bought it to fight eczema on my hands. This stuff is all natural and gentle on my hands. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is correct that this soap is watery.  If you pour or pump it right on your hand, you will waste it quite a lot.  You better pump it onto a pouf, AND you only need 2 pumps! It makes great lather.  You don&#x27;t need much of it.  That makes your 32oz bottle last longer than 6 months.  I love its smell and it makes you feel clean.  If you use it as a hand soap, don&#x27;t use 2 pumps, too much lather.  One pump will do its job great.  Recommended for a soap searcher.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, and the eucalyptus is invigorating!  And remember - All One, All One!</li>
    <li> Much more liquidy than the usual shower gel like old spice, etc. but very good. requires much, much less soap to get a good lather going for a shower, especially when using the mesh lufa type things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells great. works good on hair, but girls may want to use conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tried it for shaving this morning with my safety razor, worked surprisingly well if you&#x27;re into that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;32 oz bottle will last a really long time judging on how little you have to use each time, and the fact that its not filled with a bunch of chemicals and stuff is great. really like this. will definitely spend the money to buy again.</li>
    <li> All we use in my house for the bathroom is Dr.Bronners</li>
    <li> I like the Dr. Bronner stuff.  Our son started using this and we picked it up.  Started with the peppermint (pretty strong scent), then went to the lavender (not bad, but I&#x27;m a guy and we can&#x27;t use lavender anything), now using the eucalyptis.  Stuff works great in small quantities (doesn&#x27;t take much to make a lot of bubbles).  A quart should last me at least a year, probably longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor note - I have a 2 oz. squeeze bottle with the pop-up tube next to my sink.  The Dr. Bronner soap tends to harden in the tube, so if you use it like this you sometimes have to rinse out the tube.  I try to remember to blow some air through the tube after each use (hold the bottle upright and give a small squeeze).  I have a similar but lesser problem in the fluid dispenser in our shower, but that clears with a quick pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel with 3 ounces of this in a Goo Tube, which works nicely.  Goo tubes don&#x27;t work particularly well with runny liquids, so you sometimes get a bit more than you expect.  If you are careful, the Goo Tube is an adequate dispenser for this.</li>
    <li> I love the Eucalyptus and it can be difficult to find in town...and it was a great buy here!</li>
    <li> smells so good, and keeps my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps!</li>
    <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s home on vacation and love it. Great scent and a little goes a long way. I purchased this to use as a body wash. I&#x27;ll update this in a few months to let you know how it works on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve purchased the lemon scent as well and use that as hand soap. Much cheaper and better for you than most other hand soaps.</li>
    <li> Not watered down. People be cray.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps (i.e.: peppermint, lavendar, and eucalyptus)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for many different things...brusing my teeth (eucalyptus taste the best); hand soap (watered down) in a foam dispenser; bathing my dogs; shower soap; laundry soap...etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that a little goes a long way!!! This is a great product and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I used this on my horse for a bath and ordered because she had dandruff in her mane.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on her tail. It left her feeling filmy. So I took it home and used it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to strip it of anything silky and I needed to use conditioner for sure. I had a hard time combing through my hair after as well. It may be beneficial however, I don&#x27;t care for the feeling it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> Smelly, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout. I don&#x27;t love it as it is harsh when washing your personal areas in the shower. Won&#x27;t purchase again. I bought it to make homemade wipes solution, after reading about it online,for my baby and I am glad I used it first because I wouldn&#x27;t want to wash my babies private parts with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for years and don&#x27;t anticipate changing to anything else.  Honestly, the Almond is my favorite.  This may be all in my head, but I think because of the sweetness of the almond, when I use it, mosquitoes are especially attracted to its intoxicating smell.  I have enough of a problem with attracting too many bugs, so I had to switch flavors.  The Eucalyptus is still amazing.  I have severe eczema, which is what led me to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in the first place.  While this soap has not been curative in the eczema department, it does not aggravate it in the least.  I am usually relegated to using perfume-free and odor-free everything, but this is a nice scent I can get away with and my dermatologist doesn&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Do not use for dreads. Causes really bad buildup. Use baking soda and vinegar, best way to clean them.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr B&#x27;s soap for over 45 years and still swear by it.</li>
    <li> We wash the floors with it, wash the dogs, love the smell, and kills fleas!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much this stuff lathers. It&#x27;s become my favorite soap. Got to love that it&#x27;s an all natural product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the eucalyptus, not really sure what to expect, there were some mixed feelings about it in the reviews, but I gave it a whirl. It&#x27;s all based on opinion of course, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not terrible, but I definitely prefer the peppermint. It does have a strong invigorating-ness to it, but does kind of smell of cleaner. In any case, it&#x27;s great soap, and cuts down on all the bottles in my shower. It leaves you with that squeaky clean feel if you like that. I personally don&#x27;t like using it as shampoo, it dries my long hair out and makes it very unruly, but i use it on the rest of my body, including my face. Also, i fill 1 part Bronner&#x27;s to 3 parts water in my foaming soap dispensers and it works great. Just make sure to put the water in first so you don&#x27;t get a bubbly mess.</li>
    <li> We use this in the kitchen for our hand soap. We have the eucalptus scent. I love it, it smells clean and refreshing, you get a good lather and of course it&#x27;s all natural. You can even dillute it a bit to make it go farther if you want.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life</li>
    <li> OK product. Nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> I am using this stuff regularly to deter the critters on my beans and tomatoes.  So far, so good.  It seems effective against assassin bugs and Mexican bean beetle larvae. I have not tried it on tomato horn worms because I can usually see them.  Just pluck them off a drop them in a bucket of soapy (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) water.  Dead!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid Castile soap for over 30 years and can attest to its quality, consistency and value. Wash my hair with it just about every day. Take the wee bottles through security on my way around the world. Great stuff. Lots of choice. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products to clean my face in hopes of reducing my acne. I tried this and can finally say I&#x27;ve found something that works 100%! I will still get a zit here or there, but it&#x27;s usually because I went without cleaning my face for 2 days...I just wash and it&#x27;s gone the next day! Love this stuff. I even use it for body wash.</li>
    <li> Fantastic soap in a large quantity. Eucalyptus is a great scent to use as I find it refreshing in the mornings especially.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding  the Eucalyptus one locally so I happily bought it here. I like it for a face wash and household cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint is great for laundry and  tile floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used these soaps before, please note: they have a very thin viscosity and are very concentrated. They work great for grease and dirt cutting straight but for light cleaning you will probably want to dilute with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skincare tip to make a gentle facial exfoliating scrub:&lt;br /&gt;Mix one or two drops of Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap with warm to hot water in a small container, add baking soda and mix until its thick and a paste forms. Apply in circular motion to wet face and rinse with cool water. To use as a mask for oily or combo skin, leave on until powder starts to dry and flakes off, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an old plastic 2 ounce measuring cup filled about 3/4 with water and about 1 1/2 tbsps  of baking soda.</li>
    <li> While the hemp is not my most favorite scent, it is still a great soap.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well. You can use this stuff on anything and everything. I like it because it is natural and not harsh, plus good for the environment when going down the drain with no harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for my shih-tzu</li>
    <li> Love this soap, been using it for decades.</li>
    <li> Saw the same product cheaper in Dallas. So a little disappointed about price. Product is very good.</li>
    <li> Think i will get the peppermint next time but it is a great soap.  If you have hard water do not buy.  You will hate it.  I recently got a water softener so the soap washes and rinses well, now.</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never felt cleaner than when I use this stuff- really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely watery..if you&#x27;re used to using store bought liquid shower gels, etc., this is not that.  It&#x27;s not even remotely thick enough not to run right through your fingers while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish that this had some sort of viscosity.  I just sent in an order to amazon for a brand called Kirk&#x27;s- another Castile soap, organic.  I&#x27;ll write back an update after I&#x27;ve given it a shot.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bonner&#x27;s castile soap!  It really gets me squeaky clean. I dilute it and use it to shampoo my hair and bathe with.  I usually only order the peppermint, but decided to try the Hemp Eucalyptus.  I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of the Eucalyptus at all. My favorite is still the peppermint or the original castile soap.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh, I love this soap! I could not live without this soap ever. I did some research on what chemicals are in the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; body soap and shampoos and things like that and what I found was horrific! I use this soap to clean almost everything! This is such a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I would use this for everything if my wife let me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...I make all of my hand and body soaps with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really grown tired of having to smell like some sort of dessert or like I broke open a bottle of old spice, and a lot of fragrances make me sneeze. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps seem to stick to one oil, and most of them aren&#x27;t so offensive. A more subtle scent wouldn&#x27;t be terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is really thin and pretty sudsy. It works fine as shampoo. The thinness means it goes sort of fast. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the high price (in light of how fast it goes, at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ever happened to body wash that just smelled like soap?</li>
    <li> My fiance really likes using the Eucalyptus Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap as a body wash and sometimes for shampoo. Found this great deal on amazon as it is more expensive at Target and Trader Joe&#x27;s. I really like the smell of Eucalyptus but feel like it&#x27;s on the manly side, so I like it on him but not as much on me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I use this as a face wash, body wash, and shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or leave it feeling tangled*, nor does it try out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eucalyptus in particular smells WONDERFUL. The soap itself smells a bit strong, though not unpleasant like some artificially scented soaps, but doesn&#x27;t leave the strong smell on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin, anyone who hates buying multiple bath products, or anyone who just wants a more natural/veggie soap/shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I do notice that when the bottle gets low it leaves my hair feeling a little oily. When it&#x27;s a new bottle this never a problem. I suspect this can be resolved by gently shaking before use every morning to prevent any sort of separation.</li>
    <li> no complaints.  Love this stuff.  Love the eucalyptus scent.</li>
    <li> I love both fragrances.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps. This order was everything I expected it to be as it is a BIG bottle of the same great eucalyptus soap that I&#x27;ve used for years. My two favorite scents are eucalyptus and peppermint. This is a great multi-purpose soap that is good for you and the environment. It feels great, smells great, and works well for many uses. I was introduced to the stuff as a backpacker because, unlike many soaps, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s works well in cold water for bathing and dishwashing. It&#x27;s also very concentrated so a little bit goes a long way. The size of this bottle makes it a great deal as I expect it to last me a very long time. In addition to the excellent quality, the bottles all have a bunch of odd religious ramblings about how we are \\&quot;all one\\&quot;. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and can not use regular soaps. I seem to get along fine with this. I had tried the regular peppermint version years ago, but the eucalyptus stuff seems much better.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are great and all natural.  They are plant base and healthy to your body and environment.&lt;br /&gt;The Castile Liquid Soaps are multi purpose.  A little drop goes a long way.  Try them you won&#x27;t regret it.  The fragrance is great.</li>
    <li> The eucalyptus is great for opening up pores and improving deep breathing during showers.  The soap itself is magnificent as it seems to break the bonds between oil / dirt / skin for a truly &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean feeling.  Using this soap, even a quick 5 minute shower leaves you feeling the utmost in clean.  This will dry you out however as a result so remember to apply lotion.  As an added bonus, reading the bottle does provide some entertainment.  I have tried and would recommend the Eucalyptus, peppermint and citrus versions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked every other &#x27;flavor&#x27; of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but this one smelled like cheap floor cleaner. Still a good-quality soap, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this scent again.</li>
    <li> This is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.  There is a reason why it&#x27;s still around.  If you&#x27;ve used it, you don&#x27;t need a review to convince you to buy more.</li>
    <li> Our fourth bottle, first time with the hemp/eucalyptus scent. Though this is not our favorite scent, we like the value for a soap without all the additives. My kids, my dog, and I all use Dr Bonners.</li>
    <li> great everything soap</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Pure-Castille Soap for years. The soaps cleanse well and moisturizes the skin. I particularly like the Eucalyptus and Peppermint scented soaps. However, lately I&#x27;ve been mixing the citrus scent with the Eucalyptus. Yummy!</li>
    <li> Love bronner&#x27;s soap, this one is great when you&#x27;re congested.  use it for shampoo, soap, toothpaste and shaving!  great for washing dirty hands, too!</li>
    <li> Dr.  Brenner everything ived used by this company been A++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and is a great product.  I use it in the shower and as an added bonus it doesn&#x27;t leave a messy soap residue.  However, I&#x27;ve notice when I try to reorder it on Amazon if I place it in my  wish list or shopping cart and fail to buy it within a day or so the price goes up.  So I haven&#x27;t purchased it recently and I will continue to look for the price I am willing to pay even if that isn&#x27;t Amazon.</li>
    <li> Every one i have tried is amazing. I use it from everything from mopping the floor to washing my dog. Great products!</li>
    <li> When this product arrived it smelled great - as it should.&lt;br /&gt;After almost a week in my car, and being frozen at least once, it &amp;#34;went bad.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The eucalyptus scent just went away. Still works fine as a soap, but no smell. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am a loyal Bronner&#x27;s customer and the next bottle I got was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - Love the product, but got a bad bottle where the scent disappeared.</li>
    <li> I have been using these soaps off and on for years, and every time I buy another one, I always wonder to myself why I waited so long to order them. Awesome stuff!  One other unexpected benefit of using this soap, is how it takes care of hair clogs in the shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My drain had been clogging up for a while and I was always forgetting to buy some Draino, but after 2 weeks of showering with the Eucalyptus soap, my drain is no longer clogged and has been flowing smoothly ever since....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HMMMMMMM!  Who knew?</li>
    <li> Since this year my husband got me hook on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap Hemp Almond and Eucalyptus to use it to wash my hair and body but not my face cause it broke out my so mainly I stick only to my Dudu Osun Black Soap and homemade pore strips. However, this product has took the oil and dandruff out of my hair I got rid of my other shampoos &amp; conditioners to save money on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love using this soap to wash my clothes. The eucalyptus scent lasts a long time, much longer than any detergent I&#x27;ve ever used. My only issue is that it has references to God all over it. But, other than that it is a great product!</li>
    <li> It is a great soap and i enjoyed the scent. I have since moved to the unscented, so that I can pair different essential oils with soap.</li>
    <li> No substitutes for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!  Not only does no company make better soap products, but no other company is reliably as responsible in it&#x27;s business practices.&lt;br /&gt;Have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for over 20 years and have found no reason to change brands.</li>
    <li> Use it from head to toe as well as cleaning my cat&#x27;s litter box.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a great smell and doesn&#x27;t irratate my skin.</li>
    <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s Soaps are the best soap I have every bought,  well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products on and off for several years, and am very happy with the quality and consistency of all varieties I&#x27;ve tried. After walking through a glade of eucalyptus trees in California one day (I never realized there were eucalyptus trees in California!) I suddenly realized why I like this soap so much, the aroma is fairly strong but very pleasant IMO. Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps leave no residue, cleans well and even can be used for other cleaning purposes. Very concentrated, a little goes a long way. For sensitive skin, I would recommend the other varieties as the eucalyptus and peppermint tend to dry the skin a little but no more than other soaps without skin softeners, and it uses an olive oil base. Also alot less messy in the liquid form. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love Dr Brunner&#x27;s soaps, all of them.  You only have to use very little to great effect.  The Eucalyptus is great when you have a cold or sore throat.  Good stuff !</li>
    <li> I use this product for camping. It works great in hard water; it cleans well; and it has a great scent.</li>
    <li> I love all things Dr. Bronner, so I bought this specifically for making my own shampoo, body wash, and face wash.  Since then, I have purchased different scents for different uses around my house.  Seems expensive, but remember that this is a soap concentrate so you will need to dilute it.  One bottle will last me a good year.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I mix it 50/50 with water and put it in one of those foaming soap dispensers for the bathroom and the kitchen. I like that it rinses very quickly and cleanly, and we&#x27;ve definitely noticed fewer dry hand issues around the house. I think it&#x27;s a combination of the absence of the chemicals in typical soaps, plus the fact that you spend a lot less time with your hands under the water rinsing. I&#x27;m not a scientist, so I don&#x27;t actually know if that&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s worked for my household. BTW, the eucalyptus smells like a cough drop (which I guess I should have known). Not my favorite scent, but it will do.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and is the only soap that has actually created a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; sound on my skin though it may be a bit too strong for most skin types. My wife used it on her hair and was unhappy with the drying effect. I don&#x27;t have much up there so I can use it all over. Some reviews claim it can be reduced with water and still retains lather-a-bility...I rather doubt that as the consistency is already very liquid, almost runny. I will use it and would consider buying more if the price was 2/3 ish but won&#x27;t likely buy again at this point.</li>
    <li> Huge supply.  Smells nice and lasts a long time. I use with a loofa and it lathers nicely. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I love all Dr. Bronners Products. They always work well and I love the company&#x27;s ethics. Just something to keep in mind....this soap doesn&#x27;t smell like eucalyptus lol it smells like cough drops! I had an expectation that it would have at least a reminiscent smell of fresh eucalyptus but was completely wrong. It still works just as well as all their other products but if you&#x27;re buying it for body soap, you might want to stick with lavender or something like that. I&#x27;m very critical of giving products 5 star reviews and only do so when I really love a product. Even though this doesn&#x27;t have a flowery smell, it works great. And it was probably my fault for purchasing it without reading people&#x27;s reviews and see what they thought about the scent, so I&#x27;m not going to punish them with a lesser review because of my oversight.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps are the best soaps for people with or without hypoallergenic reactions.  These are reasonably priced compared to health food stores and I like to stock up.</li>
    <li> I really liked this soap, as I have been experimenting with different kinds of soaps that are more organically based.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem for me is that I have very sensitive skin, and after about a week found that the soap was too strong for me, and it left my skin feeling like &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; like kind of dull. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Love the small and you feel fresh and clean after you use it. We use it as body wash and shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have always used this soap, it is a fantastic product, I will recommend it to anybody who likes to smell clean</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product in general. I purchased the peppermint version of the same product at Trader Joe&#x27;s for just under $10 (fyi: they only carry that one scent). I loved it, then came to Amazon to look for a good price on other scents of the same product (Whole Foods carries the full line and charges about the same for the peppermint, but asks about $15 for all the rest). I found the Eucalyptus here at a decent price for 2 bottles, so I added them to my order. This soap is so herbal, so potent, so GREEN smelling, and left my laundry smelling incredibly clean and fresh (I will confess I also tried it as a shower soap and even added a spoonful of baking soda and made a paste to wash my hair with--and loved it!). The next day I shared a bottle with my mom, who had just run out of dishwashing liquid, and she diluted it with water and used it on the dishes--and loved it! We&#x27;ve since used it on the stove, counters, floor, more laundry, and I am planning on using it in the shower again. While I enjoyed the peppermint very much too, and found the chill brrracing, the weather is getting a little cold, for my taste, for a minty soap or shampoo, so this more piney Eucalyptus scent was just perfect. I am now placing an order for the rose and also the citrus-orange (which I think my mom would enjoy even more on the dishes). I highly recommend the Eucalyptus scent for home and laundry use, or anything else you use soap for. It is that awesome. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Eucalyptus, 32oz Multipack (Pack of 2)</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face and hands if I can help it. It has the most beautiful thick lather and all the scents are light and wonderful. I have used this every day for years and I can&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean the house and wash the laundry.  I&#x27;ve tried many scents and particularly like this one.  It lingers on your warm clothes a while, and leaves the house smelled fresh when you use it to clean the floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like their other liquid soaps, there can be a slight residue on the floors or dishes.  I figure it&#x27;s a fair trade off for an environmentally-friendly product.  Sal&#x27;s Suds does a better job on glass ware and smells strongly of rosemary.  Otherwise, the eucalyptus is great for all-around natural house cleaning.</li>
    <li> The soap is great, I will say that. It&#x27;s silky and smooth and cleanses really well. The smell however, leaves something to be desired. When I first removed the cap, the scent reminded me of PineSol. Kind of like a strong scent for Eucalyptus. I much prefer the Lavender.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for a while and I love the scents. It is a true Eco-friendly soap that doesn&#x27;t give me alligator skin! I just put a dabble in a foam soap dispenser making a bottle last forever! It will make stinky laundry smell good too.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it is environmentally friendly, smells great, cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on the shower walls and windows.  It is the only soap which has enough writing on the label to constitute a small novel, but that is great reading for camping trips and other journeys.  This soap seems to have been around forever and I intend to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> On our quest to make more eco-friendly choices Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was recommended by a friend a few years ago and we&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Of all the scents I have tried the eucalyptus and orange are my favorite.  It has many uses which is wonderful but we use it mainly for showering.  It has a nice lathering ability and the scent is never overpowering.  Will continue to use this product for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice soap and I enjoyed my first shower with it. I used this as both a shampoo and bodywash. The smell is wonderful and knowing I&#x27;m using a natural product is pleasing as well. My wife (a hair dresser) used this soap and enjoyed it as well. No regrets!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr bronner&#x27;s soap lavender and wanted to try this one out. I like lavender one a lot better. and also my son uses baby mild which is excellent too. this one I can smell it strong. I will go back to lavender.</li>
    <li> If your new to these soaps, really consider the Peppermint first, there is a reason it&#x27;s carried at so many places in big bottles, where the others are usually smaller bottles.  It was a nice change, but not as strong as I expected.  Still a good soap though.</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Great all around soap. I use it as a body wash often. Good deal compared to whole foods</li>
    <li> Awesome soap. Smells like Listerine but its a good cleansing soap. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This removes laundry stains: blood, sweat, oil and food better than stain removers. And it smells way better.  I spray it on and let it sit a few minutes then wash normally. Sometimes I spray it on and wash a few days later. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> These soaps with their weird patriotic and Biblical screeds in fine print on the label have been around forever.&lt;br /&gt;Great for aroma therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I think they can be used as shampoo too.&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint is the most popular, but I like the Lavendar, Eucalyptus and Rose too quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I have them all. For skin maybe the TeaTree is best, though all of them are good for that.</li>
    <li> It arrived damaged and a day later than the latest predicted date, but the product itself is great. This size bottle will last me about 5 months of use as a body/face wash. I personally don&#x27;t use it in my hair because it leaves it feeling tacky, yet dry at the same time.</li>
    <li> I liked this soap.  My skin felt cleaner.  I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my dishes and wash my hands in the kitchen.  The ONLY type of soap I&#x27;ve found to wash dishes with that doesn&#x27;t contain something that I wouldn&#x27;t want touching my hands.  Unfortunately leaves soap scum on everything making it look dirty, but I don&#x27;t care it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll use until I can find something else that can compete.</li>
    <li> I received my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s really quickly and used it the following morning in the shower. I love that stuff. I will most likely be buying the peppermint within the next couple weeks as between the Peppermint and the Eucalyptus it makes for a great morning. LOL</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as tey claim it is. I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The smell leaves me ridiculously relaxed! Its so versatile! Ive taken baths, washed my dishes and even my clothes in this soap! Its safe for all of that. I love this so much! The only thing i dislike is the feeling in my skin and hair. That really squeaky feeling that leaves your hair in terrible knots. I need to find a great conditioner before i use this in my hair again but its amazing nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a soap that really leaves you feeling clean and refreshed, rather than feeling like you have a film on your skin, or full of perfume. This soap can dry your skin somewhat, however, this will subside when the weather is 25 degrees and above, when you always feel sticky and hot. I massage this into my scalp also, as I have very thick hair which can feel like I am always wearing a wool hat, and have found afterwards, my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or sore, and is finally feeling unclogged and clean. I would recommend this product to anyone who is tired of soaps and body washes which don&#x27;t do their job in keeping us naturally clean from morning to night.</li>
    <li> Love the soap but very overpriced on line. Whole Foods sells it for 9.75</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of Dr. Bronners every scent I have bought works and smells great.  Peppermint seems to be the most aggressive clean.</li>
    <li> This is excellent soap - we keep it in the dispensers at the bathroom sinks.  Cleans great, smells fine, rinses off just fine.</li>
    <li> Great all natural soap option!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  Concentrated, aromatic - it&#x27;s perfect for a small bottle to take camping as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, although I do prefer the other kinds. The smell of the Eucalyptus isn&#x27;t to die for, but other than that it is a great soap.</li>
    <li> I usually love the smell of eucalyptus but this is too smelly for hand soap.  It works fine as dish soap &amp; I&#x27;ll take it camping (where it smells a bit more earthy already).  But I don&#x27;t like it in the house, it reminds me of when I am sick with a cold &amp; put a ton of eucalyptus in the bath tub.  It might be a personal thing so if you can smell it in a store, rather than buying a HUGE jug online, do that instead.  I am not likely to purchase this brand again &amp; stick with Avalon organics for hand soap.</li>
    <li> One badass soap, dilute it though, especially in winter.</li>
    <li> I have tried Dr. Bronners Castile liquid soaps in two scents now..one being peppermint and then this one eucalyptus. I really like them both but, peppermint is my fave of the two. I will continue to purchase these soaps as they have multiple uses. I clean with them and bathe with them and I love the way my house smells and my skin feels. Just a wonderful product. (I wash my curtains or towels with it, then hang them to dry and the house smells great).</li>
    <li> Love this kind of soap, you save so much using this other then buying soap in containers, I like this very much it will last a long time, you just add water and the soap and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I rate this product a 5 star product due to its quality and price!  I wanted a product that would help strengthen and give life to my hair and I found it in this sulfate-free soap which I use to make my own shampoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for decades. It&#x27;s my hand, face, body, shower, shampoo, etc. soap. It rinses more cleanly than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried.  It dissolves oils really well. Eucalyptus is my favorite \\&quot;flavor,\\&quot; but the others work the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best dilution for me is 1-to-2 soap-to-water, making the final working strength one third of the full-strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for camping trips because it cleans with cold water almost as well as with warm.</li>
    <li> Bronners liquids are by far my favorite soaps. As someone with multiple chemical sensitivities, allergies, and eczema this stuff is a godsend! The Eucalyptus is my favorite, followed by Baby Mild Unscented, then Peppermint. The Eucalyptus has just enough menthol to it to relieve the itching from my eczema but not irritate it. The Baby Mild I like to scent myself and the Peppermint is good for flares or hot days when I need the extra cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as face wash, body wash, cleaning, spot treating stains, insecticidal soap, dishes, and occasionally as toothpaste. My household runs on this stuff :). Ive tried a few other scents but didnt care for them. Lavender was overwhelmingly strong, Almond reminded me too much of food, and Tea Tree oil was good but didnt help my skin anymore than the others i enjoy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat is that as with ANY true soap it doesnt work as well in hard water.</li>
