    <li> Smells good &amp; makes hair soft BUT  NO growth after 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner with the shampoo for about a month and I haven&#x27;t really noticed rapid hair growth. The conditioner kind of smells like paint.  It does make my hair soft.   I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> this conditoner is great! use it with the growfast shampoo and you will see results in about a week or so. I noticed a big difference in my hair, it grew longer and it was softer and I had no frizz. the back of my hair grew about 3 to 4 inches and my bangs grew out about 6 to 8 inchs.it smells good to and it does not make your hair greasy after 1 day like other shampoos and conditioners, and it fixes the split ends too.if you stop using this product like I did your hair will stop growing and the frizz comes back and you start to notice the split ends again. I am defintely going to reorder these products. they work best together!!! I give this product a 10 plus a 5 star rating. try it for yourself you will be amazed!!!</li>
    <li> MY ONLY SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER AND MY HAIR IS MIDWAY MY BACK</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner my hair looks and feels so healthy, with the first use made my hair so soft, money well spent will buy more definitely</li>
    <li> Never saw a difference but great shipping</li>
    <li> It does help your hair grow new healthy hair n fast</li>
    <li> Just started the product so it&#x27;s hard to give my honest opinion already!</li>
    <li> This is awesome I didn&#x27;t buy from amazon but I ran out of shampoo and cond. So glad I looked on here. It works just like it says. Try using pantene anti breakage shampoo with it. Everything works together. But I will buy some grow fast off amazon too.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt after washing.&lt;br /&gt;very drying and my hair was unmanageable and frizzy. I&#x27;m afraid to use it again due to breakage.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while as a medication I am on caused thinning of my hair - it is now filling in nicely and my stylist said healthier as well.</li>
    <li> Still I need something better. it has lasted longer than all the others before it starts to strip the hair from the use of the same product over and over.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - too bad I didn&#x27;t check the ounces before I boarded a flight - damn TSA took it</li>
    <li> Really like the scent</li>
    <li> Tried this before and re ordered i love the way it feels after, growth improved snd love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is one great conditioner. I have scalp issues and use the GrowFast Shampoo. The conditioner adds body and lift to my hair which is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used.  Each time I run out and use something different my hair is a mess!  It smells amazing and stays with you!</li>
