      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shave cream for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love this with a safety razor to get me by when i run out of soap.</li>
      <li>I can understand why some men find it an enjoyable experience</li>
      <li>find that cream is better than any gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s even better than the geiliet, whatever the name is.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell sexy or fancy, but it gives all you need when shaving</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the thickness.</li>
      <li>and I never will. :)</li>
      <li>i found Barbasol to be better in quality than Gillette foam that i was using for years...</li>
      <li>Who cares about the can that contains the shaving cream that helps me look sexy?</li>
      <li>And, if there is no difference, why pay more?</li>
      <li>My favorite shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>Are there better shave gels on the market?  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; it I just think everything else out there is better unless you shave with sand paper.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t afford better?</li>
      <li>and my shave has never been better.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Barbasol Shaving Cream for many of those years (</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering scent like many men&#x27;s toiletries do.  </li>
      <li>Good foamy/creamy combination of shave cream, just the right thing for shaving men or wommen -maybe</li>
      <li>This cream has a good smell to it, is very smooth on the skin and feels very cooling.</li>
      <li>You can spend much more on some fancy anti-something gel that doesn&#x27;t do anything better than the original.</li>
      <li>and I always enjoyed the smooth shave it provided.  </li>
      <li>was more comfortable and as close with Barbasol and Gillette/Personna cartridge blades on a non-pivoting razor</li>
      <li>Before I had just shaved over bare skin after a shower, but this method wasn&#x27;t going to fly when I had more than some stubble.</li>
      <li>Comes out very foamy, but is almost as good as edge.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the product itself is very heavy/rich cream that feel great on face, I try very hard to resist eating it as it seem very delicious cream :)</li>
      <li>This stuff kept my razor from getting clogged up and made it a smooth and easy shave.</li>
      <li>Cheap and easy fun!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin, and the can lasts for nearly a year (shaving three days a week).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and it works.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no burning, and my skin is fabulous when I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>Smooth glide, close shave,</li>
      <li>Bought it because it was so darned cheap.</li>
      <li>cheap shaving cream.</li>
      <li>We both really enjoy the scent of it.</li>
      <li>But when you feel your face, it is so smooth you will be amazed.  </li>
      <li>The shave is smooth.</li>
      <li>I have tried different foaming creams that you use with a brush, and shaving gels, and, while they offered good shave, I did not find them to be better than Barbasol.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After purchasing a vintage Gillette Adjustable DE razor as well as a Feather Popular and a shaving soap/brush kit I decided that my shave(after several shaves with the DE) was more comfortable and as close with Barbasol and Gillette/Personna cartridge blades on a non-pivoting razor I gladly switched back to my old routine.</li>
    <li> My son loves to play with this in the the tub.  Genius idea for the tub.  Cheap and easy fun!</li>
    <li> My face refuses to spend time with any other shave cream. I use the Barbasol beardbuster and my Fusion ProGlide. Life is good men, life is good.</li>
    <li> This cream has a good smell to it, is very smooth on the skin and feels very cooling. I get a very smooth shave and leaves my skin feeling nice and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Wash your face with lots of hot water and spread a golf ball size lather ball over it.  Maybe rub it a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using a super sharp blade such as the Japanese Feather in combination with these tiny bubbles, you will think that you forgot to put the blade in, it is so smooth.  But when you feel your face, it is so smooth you will be amazed.  You will experience a total absence of razor irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse and forget&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;Rinse and feel nicer with some fragrant product.</li>
    <li> It seems to me that all shaving creams work pretty much the same so I have always chosen the cheapest I could find. If you believe, however, that one brand is superior to another, of course you must follow your star rather than mine.</li>
    <li> I had my first shave at the tender age of 12 (just my mustache) and used Barbasol&#x27;s Original and when I became a grown adult I discovered Barbasol&#x27;s Soothing Aloe to be the best for my sensitive face. I&#x27;ve used Nivea, Gillette, Edge, Brute, Noxema, all in cream or gel, but nothing lathers and moisturisers my face like Barbasol Soothing Aloe. 5 amazing stars from me!</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is a CLASSIC. An American original, just like Ivory soap and Pepsodant toothpaste. I tried shaving soaps, but since the lather is never thick enough, I keep getting nicks. I use this, and never get nicks, because the lather is so thick and smooth. I use this with a vintage Gillette double edge razor. Best shave ever.</li>
    <li> Great product. Buy why are you dropping $5 - 6 bucks on a $1.50 can of shaving cream.?  That&#x27;s the beauty of Barbasol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different shaving creams/gels. barbasol has been around for years because it works. It leaves my skin nice and smooth and helps my razor cut through the stubble. I should have just stuck with it all these years rather than wasting my time and money on more expensive products.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone, it is a MUST. For me it was easy on the skin and not irritating.</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective, great buy!</li>
    <li> My husband prefers foam rather than the gel, so this product is perfect for him.  The price is right and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shaving cream.Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I really like it and it&#x27;s cheap, especially if you can get it from the local Wally World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that cream is better than any gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is smooth &amp; creamy, &amp; smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
    <li> My t-rex is doing well.</li>
    <li> Good foamy/creamy combination of shave cream, just the right thing for shaving men or wommen -maybe a chipmunk or squirrel also if you are into that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this shave cream to be fully as good as any other shave cream, but the cost is less.</li>
    <li> Writing this from a lady&#x27;s perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair. I mean, really REALLY thick hair. All the fancy raspberry-scented shaving gels marketed towards women leave my legs looking like I went at them with a hacksaw. This stuff leaves me with a baby smooth shave and NO CUTS!! I really wish this weren&#x27;t marketed as a &#x27;man&#x27;s&#x27; product because, in my honest opinion, any lady with super thick hair should use this (paired with a &#x27;man&#x27;s&#x27; razor). And best of all, it&#x27;s super cheap. Haven&#x27;t used any other shaving cream for years and I never will. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillett Fusion for a long time and switched to this and my shave has never been better.  Good price and great stuff.  If you need shaving cream stop looking and buy this one.</li>
    <li> It works as it should. No complaints. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can will rust and leave stains in your shower and on your sink.  Nothing wrong with the shaving cream itself but I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> 5-Stars because it keeps the razor blade from slicing my face. Barbasol is a true bro. Also the aloe is nice.</li>
    <li> It is cheap, does the job, helps with razor burn and is universally recommended. Great for pro shavers like myself or first timers who are just getting started.</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong with barbasol I shave my face daily and love it.my dads dad used this stuff &amp; still its one of the best shave creams out there period</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other shaving solutions and I&#x27;ve always come back to this. I will continue to buy this product for as long as I live.</li>
    <li> While my come without the dispensing cap (the top part) I had to dome some trip to get it dispense but for such low price item I did not bother to send it back as it is not worth the trouble. Anyway, the product itself is very heavy/rich cream that feel great on face, I try very hard to resist eating it as it seem very delicious cream :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who need a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is shaving cream.  It&#x27;s cheap, and it works.  End of review.</li>
    <li> Seems like a cheap product but works well like other pricier options out there. Use it everyday and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The shave cream is great. The name/product has been around for decades. But? why are you going to buy it online? You can go to your local store (Walmart) and get it for $1.50 or less.  Here you pay almost $6.00 a can???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Barbasol for over 30 years, and this aloe version is the best.  Seems to make my skin feel better.  But OVER $6 for a can you can get at the store for $1.25?  For that amount, the UPS driver who delivers it should have to shave you.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been around tooo long.  It might have been good enough for razors but it does a horrible job with wetn dry shavers.  I just recently changed to EDGE sensitive pro relief formula and its like shaving with a new blade.</li>
    <li> This Brand has been around since Chris was an Alterboy... you really can&#x27;t beat the quality/price... Nice creamy texture and softens like the expensive brands... I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product or seller.</li>
    <li> You can get these for ~$1.60 at Walgreens. However, my husband always uses this brand and has no complaints. We would definitely not buy it for this price, though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall when or why I started shaving with expensive shaving gels. Maybe the wife bought it once by mistake and I decided to stick with it. Anyway, I ran out of my $5 a can shaving gel and this was the only product available. I fully intended to use it as a stop gap until I could buy the gel again. What have I been using all these years! The gel cannot compete with this shaving cream. This cream is rich, doesn&#x27;t require you lather it up manually, and gives a close shave without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ditched the gel, and this is now my go-to product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old style can is also kinda cool.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than edge. Comes out very foamy, but is almost as good as edge. Not a bad smell. And the can hasn&#x27;t rusted in the shower like Gillette cans have.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s even better than the geiliet, whatever the name is. It doesn&#x27;t smell sexy or fancy, but it gives all you need when shaving</li>
    <li> Barbasol shaving cream has a rich, thick foam, which helps moisturize and protect the face while shaving. And it smells nice. Since this is pretty much true of all the name brands, you might wonder why it’s better to buy Barbasol. My experience has been that Barbasol is usually priced a few cents cheaper. So, if you can save a few pennies each time you pick up a can, why not?</li>
    <li> Very good product for this price.  I like the smell and yet to use this. This is the first time I am going to use this.</li>
    <li> There is something terribly wrong here.First of all I bought it retail for $1.24 at a place that sounds like Wal-Mart. Second, its cheap but it ain&#x27;t that good. No glide or lubrication and leaves your skin dry and unconditioned every time. I&#x27;ve used may 60-70 shaving creams, soap, sticks and oils and this has truly been the cheapest in every way.I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; it I just think everything else out there is better unless you shave with sand paper. Can&#x27;t afford better? A can of shave cream may last you 2 months which is literally pennies a day.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of shaving creams before trying Barbasol, and used regular (red can) Barbasol for years before trying the green can. It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin, and the can lasts for nearly a year (shaving three days a week).</li>
    <li> As a man, I have been shaving for years.  I have been using Barbasol Shaving Cream for many of those years (Up until recently).  I have started using Shave Soap for close to 2 months now, but I still keep a couple of cans of Barbasol for when I don&#x27;t have time to lather up with the shaving soap</li>
    <li> Noticing how my wife used up my more expensive shaving gels to shave her legs, I&#x27;ve decided to look for something cheaper.  Well, not really.  I&#x27;ve used Barbasol for years and I always enjoyed the smooth shave it provided.  I have tried it with multi-blade cartridge razors, DE razors, and electric razors.  It performed great with all of these options. Currently, I am using it with my Norelco 8891XL.  I have tried different foaming creams that you use with a brush, and shaving gels, and, while they offered good shave, I did not find them to be better than Barbasol.  And, if there is no difference, why pay more?</li>
    <li> The aloe really makes a difference to me. There&#x27;s no burning, and my skin is fabulous when I&#x27;m done. I just towel off and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Love barbasol shaving cream. I have tried many different gels, creams etc over the years and nothing works as well as old school barbasol.</li>
    <li> cheap shaving cream. cant beat it!</li>
    <li> Good shaving cream. A little bit goes a long way so one can will last a while. I also like the smell.</li>
    <li> For less than two dollars, you couldn&#x27;t ask for better shaving cream. I use this often and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works well without any issues and the smell of this shaving cream is also very good. I would recommend this others, for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product.  It is thick, and the Aloe does help reduce skin irritation quite a bit.  Are there better shave gels on the market?  Probably.  But, this is a decently priced product that gets the job done.  I had used the regular version for quite some time.  I saw the Aloe variation in the grocery store once, about six months ago, and have since switched to that exclusively.  I ordered it here on Amazon for convenience the last time I needed it, and it was a good value.  I do tend to buy a lot of things on Amazon, but this is one that I actually would say is probably going to be cheaper to buy at your local grocery store, especially if you are buying from an Amazon Marketplace seller who is charging shipping on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving cream.  It is smooth, feels great on the face and the can lasts a long time!  For the price I cannot beat it since it makes me feel like every time I shave I am at the barber shop!</li>
    <li> Works great. Had several days growth from a camping trip and used shaving cream for the first time ever. Before I had just shaved over bare skin after a shower, but this method wasn&#x27;t going to fly when I had more than some stubble. This stuff kept my razor from getting clogged up and made it a smooth and easy shave. Might just keep using this stuff since it&#x27;s pretty darn cheap and it works so splendidly. Just don&#x27;t leave it where kids can get to it. They will paint with it.</li>
    <li> Classic. Ever since Jurassic park, ill use no other. &amp;#34;T-Rex doesn&#x27;t want to be fed. He wants to hunt. Can&#x27;t just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my first can of Barbasol based on the recommendations on Amazon after having used Edge gel for 20 years or more.  Barbasol Soothing Aloe was on sale for $1.25/can at my local Smith&#x27;s (owned by Kroger) store, so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.  Given the low price I was skeptical of all the 5 star reviews on Amazon, but one shave proved that I was dead wrong.  Not only does Barbasol work as well or better as my previous brand, it doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering scent like many men&#x27;s toiletries do.  I am very sensitive to strongly scented shaving products, and Barbasol didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Best of all, it&#x27;s still made in the USA!  Try a can for yourself and start saving $$$ (and your skin, if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong scents like I am)!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the kind of shaving cream that suits my needs. Good price too!</li>
    <li> This is bar none the best shaving cream I have ever used.  I have tried all of the fancy ones but this is old school stuff that just works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shave cream for many years.  It is so inexpensive compared to other brands, and it does the job so well.</li>
    <li> I liked this shaving cream and will recommend it. Bought it because it was so darned cheap. Haven&#x27;t figured out what, if anything, having Aloe does. It isn&#x27;t as thick and smooth feeling as Gillette shaving gel but since it isn&#x27;t a shaving gel that&#x27;s probably not a fair comparison anyhow.</li>
    <li> No complaints, leaves my face feeling super smooth. I would recommend to anyone needing a replacement or just wanting to try out a new shaving cream!</li>
    <li> who needs that spendy stuff when you can get this at low cost? it works very well for me. for the price it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> i found Barbasol to be better in quality than Gillette foam that i was using for years...never going back to Gillette.</li>
    <li> I use Barbasol because I&#x27;m a man.  It&#x27;s shaving cream.  It&#x27;s cheap at the stores (the Amazon price is crazy high).  It gets the job done on my man face and neck.  No irritation of my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve messed around with the rest and keep coming back to the best.&lt;br /&gt;Get some.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after trying quite a few other soaps and creams both with and without a brush. To be honest I am just not one of those guys that enjoys whipping up lather in a bowl with a badger or boar brush. I can understand why some men find it an enjoyable experience but I would rather just get out of the shower and start shaving without all the fancy prep work...soaking your brush, warming the bowl, getting the right proportion of cream or soap to water, whipping up your lather. Maybe when I retire and I have the time to spend on all that stuff I&#x27;ll give it another try but for now I just use this cream with an Edwin Jagger razor and Astra SP blade and it works like a charm. If you&#x27;re gonna use &amp;#34;goop in a can&amp;#34; as the traditional wet shaving community calls it, this is the best stuff you can get. It is far better than any other canned stuff and just so happens to be more affordable. I also love that I am buying an American-made product. Pair it up with a good safety razor and a quality blade and your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> I live in new york city and getting household consumables is annoying at best and always wayyyy over priced. duane reade wants $3 for a can. I just buy this with prime and it shows up at my apartment a couple days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say whatever you want about barbasol. I dont know because this is all that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Nice item for the price. I will reorder when I need</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about shaving cream....either it does the job or not. However, I can say this shaving cream is very thick and I only need a very little (about an inch diameter blob) to cover my full shaving area. I don&#x27;t grow any beard or mustache. Also, I use it with an electric razor so can&#x27;t say too much about how it works with a blade. I cannot detect any fragrance so that might be good for some people. All in all it does the job!</li>
    <li> I am by no means a good shaver, but I follow the directions and use a safety razor to get rid of my facial hair. This shave cream does a good job of softening up the hairs, and it doesn&#x27;t feel rough or hurt to shave. I&#x27;m always bewildered when I do realize that I cut some part of my face, because I don&#x27;t notice it until I&#x27;m already clearing out the other half.</li>
    <li> I love this with a safety razor to get me by when i run out of soap. I love the smell and the thickness.</li>
    <li> For this price you cannot beat it.  You can spend much more on some fancy anti-something gel that doesn&#x27;t do anything better than the original.</li>
    <li> now I don&#x27;t skie, however the slopes of my face need something smooth and easy to make it past the rough edges and this  shave cream always hits the spot and leaves a good  feeling on my face after i use it.  i stock up on this stuff and it works.</li>
    <li> Ah, back to the Barbasol of my early shaving years! For decades I&#x27;ve been using a cream that&#x27;s two to three times more expensive. Then I decided to go back to Barbasol--just one time for the memory. \\&quot;The old is new again!\\&quot; I&#x27;m sold. Just a dab lathers thickly--might need a bit more water than other brands. The shave is smooth. And just one container lasts me for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the un-sexy design of the container and the cap. But, hey, I&#x27;m the sexy one! Who cares about the can that contains the shaving cream that helps me look sexy? (Sorry, no personal photo included).</li>
    <li> First time after many years I had pain free shaving. I tried many shaving products and razor, never ever I had such experience like after shaving with this cream. I have hard beard, ingrowing hair and sensitive skin but shaving with this was really smooth and was really quick. I have tried to avoid shaving for weeks because it was very painful but this is not the case with this cream anymore. All this years, I thought it was painful because of my sensitive skin but this cream proved me wrong and I&#x27;m very happy about it. It saves me a lot of time. I don&#x27;t have to struggle anymore for shaving. This is the best shaving cream I ever had. I&#x27;m going to stick with this forever.</li>
    <li> This product works.  I use it with a Parker 22R double edged razor, and it keeps my face safe from razor burn ( I still get mild irritation, but that&#x27;s if I have ingrown hairs, it&#x27;s not from the cream).  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good shaving cream, it makes it easier for me to shave and I feel no razor burn afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand of shaving cream for my husband for years and he’s always been very happy with it. It’s inexpensive and he says it doesn’t give him razor burn and it makes his skin soft too. We both really enjoy the scent of it. It’s not overpowering, but it’s there just enough to smell it for a while after shaving. No complaints about Barbasol from my husband or myself. We will continue to buy it for as long as it (or us!) is around!</li>
    <li> Perfect shave every time.... will continue to purchase this from you.... thanks</li>
    <li> + Good cream.&lt;br /&gt;- Tube is rusting</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I got tired of paying $3.00 each for a plastic razor that lasted a week, gave me endless nicks, and filled up our local landfil with it&#x27;s several million twin brothers.&lt;br /&gt;I dug out my Dad&#x27;s circa 1957 Gillette double edge razor, bought some good blades and went back to getting a real shave while spending about .30 per week for blades.  Of course, in the search for the ultimate shave cream to go along with my newly rediscovered way of shaving, I experimented with different creams and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I tried an expensive tube of italian shave cream...dried out quickly and required constant re-wetting.&lt;br /&gt;I tried an expensive block of shave soap and a  brush...way too messy and made shaving more of project than a simple shave.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few cans of Barbasol competitors...all too watery.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the new, low friction, shave gels....clogged the razor and took forever to rinse off my face.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I needed a small can of shave cream to fit in my travel shave kit, and found a travel size can of Barbasol that seemed just fine.&lt;br /&gt;While on my trip, I used the Barbasol and to my surprise, found that it worked perfectly.  The lather is wet, stays wet and allows the razor to glide over the whiskers with ease.  Shaving is quick, nick free and efficient.  Barbasol washes off easily and leaves a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;When I picked up a large can, I only paid $1.89 for a product that out performs any $6.00 cream that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good pairing with the Barbasol shave cream is their after shave lotion.  It&#x27;s about $1.50 at Dollar General and some other stores and leaves that old fashion &amp;#34;just left the barbershop&amp;#34; scent...which goes away shortly thereafter thus not overwhelming anyone in the elevator on the way to work.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both products.</li>
    <li> Buy it, use it, shave with it, smell it and nothing matches the price and quality of this product yet..</li>
    <li> Some people say the old way isn&#x27;t the best way, but for buck and a half and no razor burn, they can keep the &amp;#34;special gels&amp;#34; to themselves. I used to be a Gel kinda gu, until I started using Barbasol, now my skin is shaved, and doesn&#x27;t have the horrid razor burn. Who can complain about that? I sure can&#x27;t. My name is Jake and I endorse Barbasol Shave Cream with Aloe.</li>
    <li> Loved this shaving cream. I use it for my son in the shower to play with and to do sensory play on the table or in tubs. Perfect for our needs!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price at the local drug store or walmart.  Usually get it at around $1.50 - $2 for something that will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Tried the other brand name over-the-counter stuff and this performs the same if not better than most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a shaving soap, but when I need to get to work on time I just use this since its faster than having to prepare the soap and wash off the dish afterward.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shaving creams I have ever used! I don&#x27;t like using gels because they usually contain alcohol that dry your skin out even more after a shave. Creams on the other hand will hydrate, this one with aloe does the job very well. Smooth glide, close shave, no dryness afterwards. The can lasts forever! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> When I first started to shave I was using a competitors brand. I was a little boy in a grown ups world. Working 9-5 6 days a week. I was stuck in a rut with no place to go. One day I decided to make a life changing decision and I switched my shaving cream to this wonderful product. Before Barbasol I could only grow a mustachio. Now I am able to grow a lions mane! I became a man when I used this wonderful product! Now I am working 9-5 5 days a week and am now the CEO of a fortune 500 company and I owe it all to Barbasol for making me a man!</li>
    <li> I have less irritation with this one as compared other. Actually I am going to order 1 more soon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> He shaves his head and his face every day, and has tried everything out there.  This is is his favorite, and a great price also.</li>
