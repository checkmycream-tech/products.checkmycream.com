    <li> Great oil.  Love the scent of lemon. Very strong and lasts.  Used it with lavender to make a body butter.&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing and calming.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction... High quality product, will definetly buy again!</li>
    <li> love it, great srvice.</li>
    <li> This oil has clearly been adulterated. I should have realized by the price since true Melissa oil is a very expensive oil. And they don&#x27;t allow returns. If you do your research on this company, you will find their oils are clearly not pure EO&#x27;s and are not regarded favorably within the aromatherapy community.  Live and learn, I guess.</li>
    <li> I was more than happy with this purchase it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> Melissa oil is great for many things. I haven&#x27;t had the time to use it in any recipes as of yet but am looking forward to the benefits it brings to my collection. Research the making processes of essential oils before purchase. There is not much info on dr adorables collection and process of making the oils they sell.</li>
    <li> My customers are raving about my body sprays thanks to Melissa! I will be ordering more of this definetely! Yay!</li>
    <li> Great product as expected a ++++</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait for the opportunity to use this oil!  I could never afford this with another oil company, so when I saw this and it was organic and 100% pure, I just had to get it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This is one of the best if not the best essential oils I have ever tried! Great for cold sores</li>
    <li> Smells great and strong. Very useful.  However the shopping was slow which was why 3 stars.  I ordered everything else on the same day I ordered yours. Yours arrived so late.</li>
    <li> Great price for Lemon Balm, just wish it was on prime so I could avoid the shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, smells great and works wonders in my skincare routine. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Still not the musk oil of my youth.  The search continues...</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous! I love using this as a perfume each day.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this EO diluted with a carrier oil and used topically as an evening skin oil because of its sedative affect.  It helps prepare for sleep.  It can also be diffused for the same affect.  When used topically, it needs to be highly diluted.  It has a light lemon aroma that is pleasant and understated.  I mistakenly used it as a daytime skin oil one day, but it should not be used that way as it is photosensitive (although I had no ill effects).  I happened to be doing outside chores that day in the garden and noticed the bees would buzz around me when I was in their space but did not try to sting, so I think it may send a good signal to them.  I have read that it has anti-viral, anti-histamin substances and can be useful for soothing anxiety in dogs. If a user is interested in knowing more about this they should read The Animal Desk Reference by Melissa Shelton, DVM.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and strong and after 8 months now since I bought it, it&#x27;s still as nice as when I first got it.  Quality product!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! Purchased after friend referred it.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  It is great for inflammation.</li>
    <li> Love the relaxing scent!</li>
    <li> I do Young Living Essential Oils, although they are 100% pure with no other chemicals or additives, Edens Garden has wonderful oils as well. I would definitely order from them all the time.</li>
    <li> great for my products</li>
    <li> This essential oil did not have any dosage or usage listing and did not sMell like 100% therapeutic grade Melissa oil.</li>
    <li> I thought it was so awesome that there is only ONE essential oil that is primarily a person&#x27;s name.  And, it&#x27;s my name!  So I HAD to try it.  It is so awesome!  Smells very much like lemons, but there is a more flowery, sweet undertone.  You can tell it&#x27;s not straight up lemon oil.  It came with a dropper, but I read that if it&#x27;s 100% essential oil that the rubber will get gummy and ruin it all, so I&#x27;m going to try and find another lid for it.  Dr. Adorable should sell this with a regular lid, with an additional dropper or euro style dropper.  It&#x27;s likely that a lot of people don&#x27;t buy from this seller b/c they are aware of the disintegration of the rubber.</li>
    <li> Wonderful essential oil.  Melissa is another name for Lemon Balm.  I prefer the Melissa over the straight lemon essential oil when I use it as an air freshener.  I put a terra cotta bowl on top of our wood stove and add 10 drops to the water.  The water heats up and releases the oil/smell.  The smell is more sweet than the lemon oil.  It smell&#x27;s more like a lemon drop and makes the house smell wonderful.  It is uplifting and helps with spiritually clarity.  If you don&#x27;t believe that stuff then the smell as an air freshener is still awesome!  The Quality of Dr. Adorable&#x27;s oil is great.  I&#x27;ll be ordering this on a regular basis.</li>
