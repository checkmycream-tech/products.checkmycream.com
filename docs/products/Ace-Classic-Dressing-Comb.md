      <li>All of Ace products are excellent.</li>
      <li>great comb.</li>
      <li>A great value given the price.</li>

      <li>Good comb.  </li>
      <li>Nice comb;</li>
      <li>Great comb but the fine side is almost too fine.</li>
      <li>No surprises, and that&#x27;s just fine with me!</li>
      <li>I have one from 30 years ago by ACE and love it</li>
      <li>But for about $7-12 (price varies by size/style of comb) you can buy a handmade comb you&#x27;ll love, sized to your hand size and hair type, and it lasts for years.</li>
      <li>But I should have paid  more attention to the stated size, which is correct.</li>
      <li>but most combs are.  </li>
      <li>A good, well made large comb.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice sturdy comb and exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The fine tines have casting flash between them which acts to catch you hair and pull it out.</li>
      <li>Fine teeth and course teeth</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what to say other then this is a very good comb.  </li>
      <li>simple and effective</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>I was buying cheap combs and the local dollar store and found that some of them actual where damaging my hair when useing them&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I know it was a good brand and what a differance it makes</li>
      <li>It works exactly like a comb should.</li>
      <li>I really like this comb!</li>
      <li>However, for those of you looking for a higher quality, softer comb, buy a Kent.</li>
      <li>Contrary to some other reviewers, I find this comb to be quite nice.</li>
      <li>Thanks, China.</li>
      <li>This is a nice comb, but much larger than I expected.  </li>
      <li>A high quality comb.  </li>
      <li>The construction allows the comb to move smoothly through the hair as compared to other plastic combs which tend to smag.</li>
      <li>A little wide but good quality</li>
      <li>Larger than I expected but was glad of it.</li>
      <li>A bit larger than expected; too large to fit into a guy&#x27;s pocket.</li>
      <li>I am wanting one made from the bendable material as the old comb.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a nice comb, but much larger than I expected.  I was looking for something larger than the 5&amp;#34; pocket and thought this was it.  But I should have paid  more attention to the stated size, which is correct.</li>
    <li> Great comb but the fine side is almost too fine.</li>
    <li> A bit larger than expected; too large to fit into a guy&#x27;s pocket.</li>
    <li> All of Ace products are excellent. This comb is larger than the customary comb I buy. It&#x27;s a big comb. You need a lot of hair. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair. I bought the wrong comb. I should have purchased the 7&amp;#34; comb.</li>
    <li> Highest quality comb. After going through comb after comb and broken teeth when brand new I looked for the trusted brand I grew up with but could not find locally. Tines do not pull or damage hair. This is a nice sturdy comb and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> A high quality comb.  Substantial, but flexible enough to help detangle hair with minimum of pulling.  A great value given the price.</li>
    <li> Contrary to some other reviewers, I find this comb to be quite nice. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or feel uncomfortable. However, for those of you looking for a higher quality, softer comb, buy a Kent. They are a bit more expensive. But for about $7-12 (price varies by size/style of comb) you can buy a handmade comb you&#x27;ll love, sized to your hand size and hair type, and it lasts for years.</li>
    <li> AAAAA+! The best combs made -- ACE -- a great value -- a fine comb! A+!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ace combs as long as I can remember.  My mother always had this brand around the house, and she was a beautician.  Not just this size but others manufactured by this company.</li>
    <li> I like it! works well. However, I probably should have gotten a smaller one.</li>
    <li> Only an ACE comb works so well.  The others are brittle plastic and scratch and break.  I ordered 3 of these so I have one at each sink and in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I really like this comb! It&#x27;s everything it says it is</li>
    <li> Great comb, good quality, no problems.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Had one that I owned for years, finally broke it and could not find a replacement anywhere.</li>
    <li> Larger than I expected but was glad of it. I have a feeling that I will not be needing another comb for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Why can&#x27;t you find a rubber (??) comb anymore?  I have one from 30 years ago by ACE and love it but nothing can last forever.  I am wanting one made from the bendable material as the old comb.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product. I knew I was not dealing with an original ACE brand comb, but it&#x27;s just a comb, so how badly can you screw it up, right? Well, I found out the hard way. The fine tines have casting flash between them which acts to catch you hair and pull it out. Thanks, China. Another quality ripoff. 6&amp;#34; comb did not do this.</li>
    <li> Nice comb; but most combs are.  What I wanted, and hope I get, is no teeth breaking off after extended use... and this rubber comb should provide that.</li>
    <li> The small teeth are poorly made. They are actually jagged and too close together so it catches and pulls out my hair....haha seriously..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a plastic comb...well made.</li>
    <li> Good comb.  Have used ACE products for years.  Use the comb daily.  Product quality is as expected.  The construction allows the comb to move smoothly through the hair as compared to other plastic combs which tend to smag.</li>
    <li> I was buying cheap combs and the local dollar store and found that some of them actual where damaging my hair when useing them&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I know it was a good brand and what a differance it makes</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what to say other then this is a very good comb.  Does what you expect a comb to do.</li>
    <li> A good, well made large comb.  I find it easier to hold on to than the thinner Ace combs.</li>
    <li> A little wide but good quality</li>
    <li> great comb. simple and effective</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb. Fine teeth and course teeth depending on how you want to comb your hair. Mine arrived without any extra flashing or jagged teeth that would pull on the hair. It works exactly like a comb should. No surprises, and that&#x27;s just fine with me!</li>
    <li> Good sturdy comb, good price.  No complaints.</li>
