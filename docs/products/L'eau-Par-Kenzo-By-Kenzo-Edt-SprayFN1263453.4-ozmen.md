      <li>My wife picks this out, says it is perfect for a man to wear, so she must be right.&lt;br</li>

      <li>This cologne smells wonderful!</li>
      <li>He was very happy opening this up on Christmas.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo men&#x27;s cologne smells wonderful!  </li>
      <li>and you do not notice you are wearing it until people, throughout the day, lean in to inhale the air around you and compliment on how wonderful you smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very Very good.</li>
      <li>one of my favorite perfumes!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfectly nice.</li>
      <li>Original and smells great.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine many would find this scent overpowering or offensive (which is nice</li>
      <li>I am perfectly content with the scent of old spice.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>my boyfriend love it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s smooth, warm smell.</li>
      <li>So glad amazon has it.</li>
      <li>So the bottom line - it&#x27;s lovely, one head taller than Versace pour homme and two-three heads shorter than Chanel BLEU, and has longevity issues.</li>
      <li>Its one of my favorite fragrances ever</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I have bought many of these</li>
      <li>A fancier version of this and more aquatic I would call Chanel BLEU.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d personally own again, but I think for the right person this could be a nice scent.</li>
      <li>As good as before, this is exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>Its pretty cool and awesome fragrance, not much people know about it and have a great price.</li>
      <li>Still don&#x27;t know why it was so cheap</li>
      <li>I just love the way this cologne smells on me  - FRESH.</li>
      <li>So fast delivery!!!</li>
      <li>We originally found this in Aruba 10 years ago and can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
      <li>Expected great things from this due to the great reviews on another website.  </li>
      <li>It is nothing like Aqua Di Gio but has that fresh summer smell.  </li>
      <li>this cologne smells fresh and citrusy.</li>
      <li>I think this would work well when  you want to smell fresh but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Right on time.</li>
      <li>Right product</li>
      <li>What I do know is the woman is always right.</li>
      <li>It is clean and gentle with a citrus overtone.  </li>
      <li>A clean, fresh scent that is particularly well-suited for the summer months.</li>
      <li>I rarely get compliments for my cologne and it is a good thing since people usually think that I am just fresh off the showers.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Been using this cologne since it was introduced to me by a pretty saleslady at Nordstrom over 5 years ago.</li>
      <li>and I personally find it better for that than to wear as a cologne.</li>
      <li>very well otherwise I would give it a 5!</li>
      <li>Smell very well!</li>
      <li>I ordered it as a gift right before Christmas, and it came really fast.  </li>
      <li>Its a very nice citrus aroma mixed with some other senses.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my father in law and he really likes it.</li>
      <li>the shipping was fast and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
      <li>Spring-Summer type fragrance, similar to Versace pour homme, but different and a bit more uplifting scent.</li>
      <li>I find it to be a pleasant smell but unremarkable and perhaps worse, unmemorable.</li>
      <li>It has the same fresh scent after putting it on.</li>
      <li>Its not a strong overpowering  cologne very clean smell.</li>
      <li>Concentrated use might linger on a little longer, without fear of smelling like a cheap perfume but the consumption will be a lot faster for the price.</li>
      <li>I like the smell of this after a few hours but by then it is faint at best.  </li>
      <li>All you&#x27;ll get from this one is 2-3 hours max, so if by then you won&#x27;t get \\&quot;her\\&quot; really close to your face/chest, then rely on yourself or get her another drink(which is gonna be a quarter of this cologne&#x27;s price), &#x27;cause this EDT doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>The first few times you wear it, you will notice the scent all day but eventually your sense of smell becomes accustomed to it</li>
      <li>for the perfume itself, if you haven&#x27;t had it, the scent is not very long lasting</li>

<li> One of the few colognes my husband will wear.</li>
<li> The citrus notes are heavy and dominant.</li>
<li> Not strong, it also has a faint scent.</li>
<li> Unfortunately as &amp;#34;Eau-de-toilette&amp;#34</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t hate the smell but am not blown away by it at all.  </li>

    <li> Original and smells great.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend love it.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite perfumes! the shipping was fast and the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;as for the perfume itself, if you haven&#x27;t had it, the scent is not very long lasting but it&#x27;s smooth, warm smell. i like it</li>
    <li> I just love the way this cologne smells on me  - FRESH. Been using this cologne since it was introduced to me by a pretty saleslady at Nordstrom over 5 years ago. I rarely get compliments for my cologne and it is a good thing since people usually think that I am just fresh off the showers.  That is, until those with keen sense of smell ask in curiosity if I do wear any cologne.  Highly recommended for guys who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like they just came out of a small town bordello.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells wonderful! It doesn&#x27;t last long or project very well otherwise I would give it a 5!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my father in law and he really likes it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very great! I like it very much. Smell very well! i will consider a second purchase next time when i use out it.</li>
    <li> this cologne smells fresh and citrusy. it could be for both women and men but my friend loves this and hes a man so its everyones preference.</li>
    <li> found this fragrance a few years ago and have yet to meet anyone else that owns it or has used it around me...  makes a unique statement and goes well with casual or formal occasions.  heating up while dancing or other things brings out all the elements that makes this my go-to EDT.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user. This is the only one that react well with my body chemistry. It has the same fresh scent after putting it on. Unfortunately as &amp;#34;Eau-de-toilette&amp;#34; spray last but a few hours. Concentrated use might linger on a little longer, without fear of smelling like a cheap perfume but the consumption will be a lot faster for the price.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of these and I love it. Its pretty cool and awesome fragrance, not much people know about it and have a great price. I recommend to try</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo men&#x27;s cologne smells wonderful!  This cologne stays with you!  I would definitely recommend it for any man.</li>
    <li> I got this as a present to my fiance since I couldn&#x27;t wear it myself. I intended to wear it myself but its for men. Well, I like that its not sweet or predictable. Its a very nice citrus aroma mixed with some other senses.</li>
    <li> Expected great things from this due to the great reviews on another website.  I don&#x27;t hate the smell but am not blown away by it at all.  It is clean and gentle with a citrus overtone.  I like the smell of this after a few hours but by then it is faint at best.  I think this would work well when  you want to smell fresh but not overpowering.  It is nothing like Aqua Di Gio but has that fresh summer smell.  I would give it a 6 out of 10.</li>
    <li> I ordered it as a gift right before Christmas, and it came really fast.  It was just what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Very Very good. Still don&#x27;t know why it was so cheap but it was the same as the ones I have been using.</li>
    <li> As good as before, this is exactly what I want. Not strong, it also has a faint scent. I like it.</li>
    <li> Its one of my favorite fragrances ever</li>
    <li> One of the few colognes my husband will wear. We originally found this in Aruba 10 years ago and can&#x27;t find it in stores. So glad amazon has it. He was very happy opening this up on Christmas. Its not a strong overpowering  cologne very clean smell. Everyone that has smelled it loves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dislike this scent by any means - it&#x27;s perfectly nice. A clean, fresh scent that is particularly well-suited for the summer months. The citrus notes are heavy and dominant. I can&#x27;t imagine many would find this scent overpowering or offensive (which is nice is a day-to-day wear scent), but for me it&#x27;s too generic a smell. Since I don&#x27;t wear it on my body often, I sometimes spray it to freshen up a room and I personally find it better for that than to wear as a cologne. Keeping in mind that scents are hugely personal, for me L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo Men is simply too conservative for my tastes. Furthermore, it simply doesn&#x27;t last long on me at all. I find the scent to be very fleeting, which perhaps is not surprising given that it&#x27;s less expensive than many other colognes. I find it to be a pleasant smell but unremarkable and perhaps worse, unmemorable. It&#x27;s not a bottle I&#x27;d personally own again, but I think for the right person this could be a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Right on time. Right product</li>
    <li> So fast delivery!!!! I love it Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am a guy. I am perfectly content with the scent of old spice. It is what my grandfather wore, my father wore, and, since I am a man, I&#x27;ll wear for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my wife does not feel the same way and so she picks out my cologne for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne has a fruity citric smell to it. The first few times you wear it, you will notice the scent all day but eventually your sense of smell becomes accustomed to it and you do not notice you are wearing it until people, throughout the day, lean in to inhale the air around you and compliment on how wonderful you smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy. What do I know about colognes? What I do know is the woman is always right. My wife picks this out, says it is perfect for a man to wear, so she must be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who am I to argue with logic like that?</li>
    <li> There is not much to say about this EDT. Spring-Summer type fragrance, similar to Versace pour homme, but different and a bit more uplifting scent. A fancier version of this and more aquatic I would call Chanel BLEU. So the bottom line - it&#x27;s lovely, one head taller than Versace pour homme and two-three heads shorter than Chanel BLEU, and has longevity issues. All you&#x27;ll get from this one is 2-3 hours max, so if by then you won&#x27;t get \\&quot;her\\&quot; really close to your face/chest, then rely on yourself or get her another drink(which is gonna be a quarter of this cologne&#x27;s price), &#x27;cause this EDT doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
