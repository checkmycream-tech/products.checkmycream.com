      <li>AMAZING PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>I have NEVER found something that is so good for my type of hair like this line.</li>
      <li>It was a great deal, as it is much more at the salon.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best!</li>
      <li>I love Matrix products, they are so good for curly hair.</li>
      <li>This is handy for styling, however, since it provides some hold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 years now - I cannot live without it - it is awesome -</li>
      <li>I will buy some more, for sure!</li>
      <li>It seems like these two products add up to Matrix&#x27;s old #3 leave-in conditioner, which was the best thing ever.</li>
      <li>quick delivery and good value.  </li>
      <li>As someone with allergies, it is very lightly scented and am able to use it every day.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>ok....</li>
      <li>Love this hair serum.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;d better stock up just in case.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s another cone or a better one,</li>
      <li>I want more for this price when you have more, please notify me.</li>
      <li>well pleased.  </li>
      <li>The Wonder Smoothing Oil works much better.</li>
      <li>well pleased.</li>
      <li>more so looked</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, but if you&#x27;re not careful and use too much in one spot it will look like you poured cooking oil on your head.</li>
      <li>all I know is it&#x27;s light and it works.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>These things are my pet peeves because I shower in the evening, so I need something that will smooth my hair, without getting all over my pillow and smelling all night</li>
      <li>I like this product, it makes my hair sooo smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Smells good, adds shine; however, doesn&#x27;t control frizz for natural hair.</li>
      <li>I put a tiny bit on every section of my hair as I am straightening it after I&#x27;ve shampooed and dried it - it is an awesome product for sure !!</li>
      <li>of course use this sparingly like half a dime size amount on 1/4 section and it works like a charm and gives my hair a great scent, your hair will literally flow with this and my hair just looks stunning with this.</li>
      <li>My hair soaks it up and wants more but not everyone&#x27;s hair is like that.</li>
      <li>it helps your hair blowdry straight and smooth, and leaves your hair super silky!  </li>
      <li>Also a final comment, one thing I love about this is unlike most serums it doesn&#x27;t feel super oily</li>
      <li>- this feels exactly how a serum should feel and keeps your hair from being greasy or product buildup - lifesaver!</li>
      <li>This serum adds a little sheen to my permed hair, giving my permed hair a healthy look!</li>
      <li>I have thick, kinky hair that is now straight from Brazilian Blowout treatments, and this is an awesome product to put in right after showering while it&#x27;s wet and just before blow-drying.</li>
      <li>I rub a lil on the tips of my fingers and rub it into my scalp then use a lil more through the rest of the length then blow dry.</li>
      <li>and I still love it!&lt;br /&gt;Helps dry, flyaway hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This little bottle was worth more than I paid.</li>
      <li>You have to be really careful though, there is a fine line between the right amount and hair that is greasy</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>Much appreciated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need much at all</li>
      <li>and I finally purchased this after spending years without this magical product , it makes my hair so sleek and literally looks like the first day on the third or forth day after styling.</li>
      <li>Works well with the series the flat iron spray, oil and shampoo conditioner, leaves my hair lightly conditioned.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way (two squirts in the palm of my hand, quick sharing with my other palm, then first applied to the ends of my hair without reservation, blending what remains into the rest), making it a great value, too.</li>
      <li>Blow dry with a brush and you will see a huge difference.</li>
      <li>This was a way bigger bottle than I expected to get, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
      <li>It smooth my curls and left my hair soft to the touch, like a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing for frizzy thick hair.</li>
      <li>This smells good and a little goes a long way in my waist length thin hair :) makes it shine and feel very soft!</li>
      <li>hope that what the other reviewer says isn&#x27;t true.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be made of something other than your basic cheap cones.</li>
      <li>so it lasts a very long time , if you use to much you will know , your hair will look greasey .</li>
      <li>The only negative is that the top had leaked into the plastic</li>
      <li>always amazed me and left my hair not only straight</li>
      <li>This stuff works exactly like Aquage and costs half the price.</li>
      <li>but it really locked in the hair style and made my hair extremely silky and not greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buying so much Matrix tends to add up, and it&#x27;s just not worth the price anymore.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real fresh out of the shower smell, which I love, and it&#x27;s not heavy and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, or at least not in a bad way.</li>
      <li>Finally something to smooth my thick dry hair.  </li>

<li> Finally something to smooth my thick dry hair.  </li>
<li> exactly what I was looking for...rather hard to find.</li>
<li> If overdo hair gets flat and greasy looking.</li>
<li> I will buy this product for my entire life and don&#x27;t know how I went so long without</li>
<li> Growing up as a biracial child of African American / middle eastern descent I always had extremely curly, thick hair that took me hours to straighten and even when i did it never was actually straight but</li>
<li> It has little bit different smell, but it&#x27;s very, very similar.</li>
<li> Recommended for dry hair, weekly head bath with shampoo is must.</li>
<li> This is the only product i have found that keeps my hair shiny, but not weighed down.</li>
<li> a little of this goes a long way, so it will last.</li>
<li> It can be used on wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> It helps to hide my gray hair by making it look wet and not so dry.</li>
<li> It stays soft and does not get hard.</li>
<li> I while my hair is still wet</li>
<li> Use about 3 pumps of product while hair is wet</li>
<li> I have naturally curly/wavy thick hair and this product is a life saver when I straighten my hair.</li>
<li> Just use less on dry hair.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> You will weigh down your hair.</li>
<li> If your hair is finer or not as frizzy use less of this product and avoid the scalp application.</li>
<li> i get quite a few compliments on my hair, and considering i look like a dandelion without this</li>
<li> Very little needed.  </li>
<li> This is a feat because I&#x27;ve only recently stopped straightening and bleaching, and my hair is in terrible condition, especially my ends.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used this in the past and will continue to use it.</li>
<li> A small amount works well.  </li>
<li> Just use common sense.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe they stopped making this product and replaced it with some other crap.</li>
<li> I have horrible frizzed curls at the base and this helps so much.</li>
<li> Matrix was crazy to discontinue, if that&#x27;s what they did.</li>
<li> I have the frizzies bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this hair serum.  A small amount works well.  Keeps moisture from frizzing hair</li>
    <li> Great product! I have naturally curly/wavy thick hair and this product is a life saver when I straighten my hair. Use about 3 pumps of product while hair is wet and it&#x27;s a miracle worker.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this product, it makes my hair sooo smooth and silky.I both sampoo and condishiner, so i still need #3. I love Matrix products, they are so good for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have the frizzies bad. This stuff is awesome, but if you&#x27;re not careful and use too much in one spot it will look like you poured cooking oil on your head.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! I can&#x27;t believe they stopped making this product and replaced it with some other crap. This stuff is amazing for frizzy thick hair. I can&#x27;t live without it! Put a dime to nickel size amount depending on hair length and type, rub together in your hands, get some on your finger tips and run it through frizzy spots at the base of the head but DO NOT saturate. You will weigh down your hair. If your hair is finer or not as frizzy use less of this product and avoid the scalp application. I have horrible frizzed curls at the base and this helps so much. Then apply to mid shaft through the ends. Just use common sense. You should know your hair. My hair soaks it up and wants more but not everyone&#x27;s hair is like that. Blow dry with a brush and you will see a huge difference. I use this in conjunction with their shampoo and conditioner. I have NEVER found something that is so good for my type of hair like this line. The shampoo and conditioner works wonders, especially in conjunction with this product.</li>
    <li> The only negative is that the top had leaked into the plastic and I lost some product.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I still love it!&lt;br /&gt;Helps dry, flyaway hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was just in So CA for two weeks and my hair was SO frizzy. I just used A LOT extra of this and it went away.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for...rather hard to find. This is perfect for the look I wanted.  well pleased.  quick delivery and good value.  well pleased.</li>
    <li> Protects against the humidity for 24 hours. Works well with the series the flat iron spray, oil and shampoo conditioner, leaves my hair lightly conditioned.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Very little needed.  If overdo hair gets flat and greasy looking.</li>
    <li> This was a way bigger bottle than I expected to get, which was a nice surprise.  This is a fantastic product.  As someone with allergies, it is very lightly scented and am able to use it every day.</li>
    <li> This little bottle was worth more than I paid. I was accidentally shipped a keratin treatment, and instead of creating a hassle, Canas let me keep the $30 value keratin and shipped the Matrix serum as well. Much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works well, but I only like it with its partner, the #3 lotion in the sleek look styling line for matrix. It seems like these two products add up to Matrix&#x27;s old #3 leave-in conditioner, which was the best thing ever. They no longer make that product, though, and I would actually recommend finding a different leave-in conditioner for frizz control. Buying so much Matrix tends to add up, and it&#x27;s just not worth the price anymore. This is handy for styling, however, since it provides some hold.</li>
    <li> This serum adds a little sheen to my permed hair, giving my permed hair a healthy look! I love this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product from 5 years and this is too good, just perfect for my hair.Recommended for dry hair, weekly head bath with shampoo is must.</li>
    <li> This product it ok....but I don&#x27;t love it.  It seems to offer protection against my blow dryer and straightner, but it makes my hair feeel dry/coarse.  I think I&#x27;ll try something else next time!</li>
    <li> This smells good and a little goes a long way in my waist length thin hair :) makes it shine and feel very soft! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product has been discontinued and replaced by the Sleek Silk Wonder smoothing Oil. [[ASIN:B005HA92J8 Matrix Total Results Sleek Lisse Silk Wonder Smoothing Oil 3oz]]  The Wonder Smoothing Oil works much better.</li>
    <li> Smells good, adds shine; however, doesn&#x27;t control frizz for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for myself. It was a great deal, as it is much more at the salon.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff for years and it tames my frizz and big volume. Highly recommend. Like the pump bottle too.</li>
    <li> This was the second bottle of this product that I have bought.  it helps your hair blowdry straight and smooth, and leaves your hair super silky!  My bottle accidentally opened in my travel bag when on a trip, and I almost cried when it was all gone!  I will buy some more, for sure!</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and will continue to use it. I while my hair is still wet I rub a lil on the tips of my fingers and rub it into my scalp then use a lil more through the rest of the length then blow dry. This is the only product i have found that keeps my hair shiny, but not weighed down.</li>
    <li> I have thick, kinky hair that is now straight from Brazilian Blowout treatments, and this is an awesome product to put in right after showering while it&#x27;s wet and just before blow-drying. I have used it for years and swear by it. A little goes a long way (two squirts in the palm of my hand, quick sharing with my other palm, then first applied to the ends of my hair without reservation, blending what remains into the rest), making it a great value, too.</li>
    <li> This smells and feels like Aquage. It has little bit different smell, but it&#x27;s very, very similar. It&#x27;s a real fresh out of the shower smell, which I love, and it&#x27;s not heavy and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, or at least not in a bad way. These things are my pet peeves because I shower in the evening, so I need something that will smooth my hair, without getting all over my pillow and smelling all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this serum is runnier liquid and it seems to be made of something other than your basic cheap cones. Maybe it&#x27;s another cone or a better one, all I know is it&#x27;s light and it works. It smooth my curls and left my hair soft to the touch, like a child&#x27;s hair. This is a feat because I&#x27;ve only recently stopped straightening and bleaching, and my hair is in terrible condition, especially my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that what the other reviewer says isn&#x27;t true. I guess I&#x27;d better stock up just in case. This stuff works exactly like Aquage and costs half the price. Matrix was crazy to discontinue, if that&#x27;s what they did.</li>
    <li> this is great stuff for curley / frizzy hair ! you don&#x27;t need much at all so it lasts a very long time , if you use to much you will know , your hair will look greasey . my hair is naturly curley and it&#x27;s frizzy , so this is perfect for me !</li>
    <li> It helps to hide my gray hair by making it look wet and not so dry. It stays soft and does not get hard.</li>
    <li> Growing up as a biracial child of African American / middle eastern descent I always had extremely curly, thick hair that took me hours to straighten and even when i did it never was actually straight but more so looked blow dried straight. When I was around 8, I went to the hair dresser and she used this on my hair ( in conjunction with the matrix sleek shampoo and conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This always amazed me and left my hair not only straight but it really locked in the hair style and made my hair extremely silky and not greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is 12 years later and I finally purchased this after spending years without this magical product , it makes my hair so sleek and literally looks like the first day on the third or forth day after styling. I will buy this product for my entire life and don&#x27;t know how I went so long without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I of course use this sparingly like half a dime size amount on 1/4 section and it works like a charm and gives my hair a great scent, your hair will literally flow with this and my hair just looks stunning with this. Must have for life! Best serum I will ever use. Also a final comment, one thing I love about this is unlike most serums it doesn&#x27;t feel super oily - this feels exactly how a serum should feel and keeps your hair from being greasy or product buildup - lifesaver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 years now - I cannot live without it - it is awesome - I put a tiny bit on every section of my hair as I am straightening it after I&#x27;ve shampooed and dried it - it is an awesome product for sure !!</li>
    <li> Dynamite!  Finally something to smooth my thick dry hair.  They could change the pump though.</li>
    <li> Love it. Don&#x27;t use too much. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best! It makes my hair shine I want more for this price when you have more, please notify me.</li>
    <li> No-spill protection, therefore the product spilled within the packaging, was lost entirely. request replacement for the same product because if you want</li>
    <li> After a lot of trial and error, this became one of my standards. i get quite a few compliments on my hair, and considering i look like a dandelion without this, i give it the credit. a little of this goes a long way, so it will last. It can be used on wet or dry hair. Just use less on dry hair.</li>
    <li> this works well and controls frizz while making hair shiny.  You have to be really careful though, there is a fine line between the right amount and hair that is greasy</li>
</ol>
