      <li>its preety good</li>
      <li>She sent me a link to it on Amazon at a good price.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that it worked.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this can&#x27;t be a good curler,</li>
      <li>and it never looked as good as when the hairdresser used hers.</li>
      <li>The concept of curling your hair with this tool is a good one, but it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>good in handling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so excited because all of the Remington products I&#x27;ve had have been so awesome!</li>
      <li>Its a great straightener but an okay curling iron.</li>
      <li>perfect curls right off the bat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came on time, looks exactly as shown in the picture and it works great!</li>
      <li>love the versatility, size, and weight of the Remington S6600!</li>
      <li>it is lovely!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to order online (even though I love Amazon!)</li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I bought this hair tool from Target for $30 and fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>Looks great, easy to grip and use.</li>
      <li>Unbelievably amazing</li>
      <li>IT SO AMAZING</li>
      <li>Well as a straightener, it&#x27;s excellent, not so much for a curling iron.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for flattening my hair and creating the gentle wavy curls</li>
      <li>Some people have a problem with this but even a nice CHI iron has a switch on the inside.  </li>
      <li>Now admittedly I&#x27;m kind of a beginner when it comes to using hair curlers and straighteners.  </li>
      <li>The tool will perform straightning and all varieties of curling, so is a handy all-in-one for travel consolidation.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good I have gifted this to my sister</li>
      <li>I liked.</li>
      <li>The Remington S6600 Ceramic Hair Straightener does a really nice job.</li>
      <li>The Remington S6600 Styler comes with a handy storage bag, too, to keep it dust free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really nice...</li>
      <li>And I should note that I tried using their instructions, tried doing my own thing, and tried yelling at the curler, nothing seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for\\&quot; kind of situation</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and versatile, heats up quickly, and for straightening, it&#x27;s probably one of the best products we&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I bought this item for my wife and she&#x27;s really happy with the service if the item, thanks guys, keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>However, based on her experience, I recommend only at the three star level -- fair product, at best.</li>
      <li>Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
      <li>Maybe this would be good for someone with like baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>As far as the curling goes, it&#x27;s not the best, but it does the job with some trial, error, and practice.ere to point the numbers on the dial to set it for what you want.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it often, but for someone who has fought frizz for many years in this subtropical climate, it&#x27;s both novel and nice to see that sleek straightness I got with this one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!! its the best straightner ever!!!! I havent yet quite mastered curling tho, but I am getting there</li>
    <li> so many styles!!! heats up quick! very hot!&lt;br /&gt;am a fan of Wet and Dry line but this does it all! watch the video on there offical site to see how to get the hang of curling the hair! did it wrong the first time but after watching the video saw what need to be done to get the different style! this is great!</li>
    <li> Right now I use it just as normal hair straightener and it works great. Would love to try all the styles it has when I have time.</li>
    <li> This is a nice styler, its light weight which is great, it gets \\&quot;really\\&quot; hot fast! My Instyler recently died and this gets the job done just as well and I have long course rudley hair just go slow. It dose provide the different styles as advertised. This is easily one of my better hairstyling irons and I have had a ton!  EDITING; to add two pieces fell off the third time I used it and no it was not mishandled very disappointing;o(</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington hair straightener and I like the light weight feeling of this product.  I also like a swivel cord as it helps especially when you are in a hurry.  It heats up fast and I like where the switch is so you don&#x27;t accidently turn it off while in use.  As with any product that heats up, you need to be careful not to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> I love to curl my hair using a straight iron, but I admit that I am a little challenged when it comes to creating natural-looking shapes. The S6600 solves that problem for me. It has two little pieces on the side that slide out to create different widths on the iron, with a slight curve to the shape. This helps you create a smooth curl. On top of that, it works well as a normal straightener, giving me smooth, glossy hair. It heats up fast and is a great shape to hold in your hand. It is also very light and has that great swivel cord at the base. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I just got my new  Remington ultimate stylists. It was definitely money well spent.  All of the problems the other reviews have mentioned are solved simply by following the directions provided with the product and on Remington&#x27;s website.  The switch and temperature controls are on the inside of the iron underneath the plates that get hot.  Some people have a problem with this but even a nice CHI iron has a switch on the inside.  The simplicity and ease of just sliding the style wings in and out is great.  You are able to easily layer your hair with styles by straightening the bottom layer of your hair, curling loose curls in the middle, tight curls above that, and waves on top.  I would suggest this all in one product to anyone who styles their own hair because it&#x27;s a fast and easy way to get salon results at home.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT ♡ Heats up in 15 seconds , perfect !</li>
    <li> I borrowed this straightener from my roommate and I FELL IN LOVE. It used to take me 45 mins to straighten my hair, and now it only takes 15! It makes your hair silky and smooth and not dry. AND it literally heated up in 10 seconds. Unbelievably amazing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used a hair straigtener with a round shape before, and was not prepared for how much better this would make my short hair look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a short, pixie-type hairstyle, and use a straightener to basically get everything to lay flat where it&#x27;s supposed to.  I usually use the Remington Wet2Straight, because it saves me the step of drying my hair.  After using the Ultimate straightener, however, it has become my go-to tool when my hair is already dry.  Here&#x27;s why - the rounded shape allows me to twist more smoothly against my head as I style, giving my hair a much smoother look in the finished style.  Other straighteners, with their squared off edges, tended to make my hair look more like sticks as I styled.  I never thought the outer edges of the tool made a difference in the finished style - only the way I manuever the plates - but I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To try out the curling options with this product, I enlisted the help of my daughters who both have hair length past their shoulders.  I used the Tight Curls setting on one, and the Waves setting on the other.&lt;br /&gt;- I liked how the teeth on the black plastic pieces seemed to keep the hair in line as I worked.&lt;br /&gt;- Those black plastic pieces are fairly easy to adjust for the different settings.&lt;br /&gt;- However, when I was on the Waves setting, the curls I made always had some \\&quot;corners\\&quot;, where it seemed the straightener bent the hair instead of curling it.  I think this issue could have something to do with the plastic being too wide while not having heat plates extending to that width.  I switched down to the Loose Curls from Waves, and that seemed to help somewhat as I finished her style.  I did not experience this issue very often with the Tight Curls setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls on this tool are fairly easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- The dial turns easily from Low through 30 (a vast improvement over the Wet2Straight, which has buttons to push to go up and down in setting number).  However, there is no indication with an arrow or a mark for where to point the numbers on the dial to set it for what you want.  You have to turn the dial all the way in one direction to figure out where the setting point is.  Once you figure that out, though, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;- The on/off switch slides easily.  It is recessed inside the outer edges of the straigtener, though, so it is awkward to reach with my thumb, and I have to switch it with a finger.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a lock to keep it closed, not all straighteners have this feature, so I appreciate it.  It works easily and stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the Ultimate Straightener.  It works great on my short hair!  As far as the curling goes, it&#x27;s not the best, but it does the job with some trial, error, and practice.ere to point the numbers on the dial to set it for what you want.

    <li> The Remington S6600 Ultimate Styling Ceramic Hair Straightener excels in terms of being lightweight, fast-heating, easily maneuverable (with swivel electrical cord), and for creating speedy beautiful results.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the way it flattens and creates gentle waves in my medium-coarse, long, naturally wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tight curls are not a look I especially enjoy, so I didn&#x27;t try that styling effect, but I loved how the Remington S6600 created smooth, shiny hair in a fraction of the time other irons take, and with a good deal less heft to lug around (it&#x27;s fabulously lightweight and easy to operate). It&#x27;s perfect for flattening my hair and creating the gentle wavy curls I most enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the versatility, size, and weight of the Remington S6600! It&#x27;s the ideal travel iron, since it can help create a number of gorgeous looks while being slender, lightweight and easy-to-transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch and temperature control are located on the inside of this styling wand, and it&#x27;s intuitively easy to figure out how to turn the iron on and use it, even without reading instructions, which I appreciate. A blue light indicates when the iron is warming up to temperature and when it&#x27;s ready to use... and I love the automatic shut-off feature, just in case the iron gets set down and forgotten after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron does get quite hot around the outer edges, while in use, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to from using older irons. Learning to operate all the features of this iron, such as moving the combs out for different styles takes a bit of getting used to... but with practice and the right hair product, the Remington S6600 creates fabulous results. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I saw this item and it immediately caught my eye. What  a great idea - straighten or curl your hair with one tool! My hair isn&#x27;t very long - chin length, but this tool works to give it some curl and give me a new way to wear my hair. The straightener tool works great, too. It gets much hotter than other straighteners that I&#x27;ve had, but the heat setting dial makes it easy to set the temperature wherever you&#x27;d like it. Overall, I am really happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair appliance from a local retailer.  I am in my fifties, with lifelong fine hair that is now thinning.  As a result, I am very careful with the hair I have left.  I never use a blow dryer anymore, and I keep it cut shoulder length so I can still style it.  When my 15-year old salon quality Gold plated professional curling iron died this week, I began the hunt for a replacement.  I didn&#x27;t want to order online (even though I love Amazon!) because I wanted to see the appliance in person.  I chose this modestly priced Remington because the packaging said it could style from straight to tight curls.  AND IT DOES!  It&#x27;s a bit of a strange concept and doesn&#x27;t look like it would do what it says, but it does.  I can get a nice, tight, face framing curl but smooth longer layers in the back  So far, I give it a ten out of ten.</li>
    <li> This Remington hair straightener is a powerhouse for the price. It heats up quickly and straightens hair easily. Two features I like are the swivel cord and the ability to lock the appliance into a closed position so it&#x27;s easy to put away after using.</li>
    <li> OK - so, I don&#x27;t have enough hair to actually test this out, but my wife does - (Good God that woman does have a lot of hair!) ... so, here is what she has to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is nice to have a straightener and curling iron in one, neither of them work very well. I tried using it on three different occasions, thinking I was doing something wrong, as I wasn&#x27;t getting the result I hoped for. I felt like I had to press the straightener really tight on my hair to get it to straighten. I also felt like it was frying my hair all the way down. The curling iron is also hard to use as you pull out the side of the straightener to make it in to a curling iron. The odd shape made it hard to curl.</li>
    <li> Perfect！ would not trade for any others, the only thing is that it doesnt do really tiny curls, but my hair is normally like that anyway. Heats up supper fast nd cools down pretty fast too. Awesome！！！</li>
    <li> As a straightener you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. It heats up very hot and does it quickly. It&#x27;s easy to handle and straigtens my hair with a minumum of fuss. Another plus is that it shuts off automatically. (I think this should be a must on all electric styling products)  Curling, on the other hand, is another story. You can&#x27;t change the settings without burnt fingers. The curling process itself is awkward and very hard to get the desired result on a regular basis. I have made some beautiful curls with this tool... but by doing the exact same thing again I have come out with some pretty mangled looking ones as well.</li>
    <li> I like the Remington S6600.  I have straight short hair, so I never usually have a problem straightening my hair.  But I wanted to try this particular straightener for its curling ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is great.  It is lightweight, easy to maneuver, and the ceramic plates glide over my locks.  The cord swivels easily, so you can manipulate your hair effortlessly.  The controls are placed in the handle, so I did not accidently change the heat setting or turn it off while handling, which I think is a stellar feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling extensions are easy to use, but I do not think they work for styling.  The plates move easily and lock into place.  The ends of the iron stayed cool, so I could use two hands to style.  But my hair looked bent, not curled, after using.  I even straightened my hair and re-curled to a better, but still strange looking style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to use this straightener for straightening your hair, but a curling iron is probably still best for curling. Or maybe just spend some time practicing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often that I style my hair. I have long, thick, wavy hair (the shorter it is, the curlier) that tends to frizz in the humid south Florida weather, so I admit, it&#x27;s easier to just pull it back and slick it down than it is to style it day-to-day. There are times, though, that I have to make the effort, whether for work or play, and this Remington Styling tool has been a real gem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly, isn&#x27;t inordinately heavy, and fits well in my hands, which limits the arm and hand strain of working through the amount of hair on my head. I enjoy it slightly more when I use it for the loose curl than the tighter curls I tried one night, but admittedly, the hair product I&#x27;d borrowed from a friend didn&#x27;t work all that well and probably contributed to the lack of hold. My favorite feature, though, is the straightener. I don&#x27;t use it often, but for someone who has fought frizz for many years in this subtropical climate, it&#x27;s both novel and nice to see that sleek straightness I got with this one. It IS Florida, though, and my hair IS naturally curly, so I can&#x27;t say that it stays perfect for long without the judicious use of hair spray, but I enjoy it while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d more strongly recommend this product for someone who isn&#x27;t planning on using it every day, though. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair, or I&#x27;m using it wrong, but it takes me awhile to work through my whole head of hair, and going through that every day would be extremely time consuming. For one to three times a week, though, it&#x27;s perfect, and it&#x27;s nice to have one single curler/straightener in the drawer next to my hair dryer instead of three.</li>
    <li> The Remington S6600 Ceramic Hair straightener heats up fast and fits nicely in the hand.  However, it does not glide as smoothly through hair as other products of higher quality and seems to frizz fine short hair.  The curling feature does not work well at all -- my daughter has found that even though she carefully curls each lock carefully and counts the same number of seconds, the results are invariably uneven and take twice as much time as they might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not particularly expensive -- this is probably a \\&quot;get what you paid for\\&quot; kind of situation and it&#x27;s possible that for people with a different kind of hair texture -- my daughter has very thick, fine hair -- the product will work as advertised.  However, based on her experience, I recommend only at the three star level -- fair product, at best.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted has the straightening featuring and the curling feature.  very easy to handle and fast when turned on.</li>
    <li> This straightener was sent to me by accident. I had ordered a S6500 but received the S6600. I decided to give it a shot and see how well it performs -  Pros -  1. A decent straightener - light weight and does a good job of curling and straightening. I&#x27;ve got slightly wavy Asian hair that tends to take a shape of its own and is prone to frizz. I used it at the medium heat setting and it smoothed my hair out to pin straight hair in a single stroke. I&#x27;ve got shoulder length hair and was able to straighten it in under 10 min. It also gave my hair some beautiful curls.  2. Got some nice features compared to most other brands in this price range - auto shut off after 60 minutes, universal voltage support, variable temperature control, the side wings for creating different sized curls...  Cons -  1. It does snag hair occasionally. I&#x27;ve noticed while straightening if I run it a little fast through my hair, it pulls on the ends. I&#x27;ve got to be extra cautious when I reach my ends. I&#x27;m having this problem when trying to curl my hair too.   2. I don&#x27;t know if this is the case with all the straighteners, I can&#x27;t really comment because this one is my first but I&#x27;ve noticed it robs my hair of its shine. I&#x27;ve got naturally black shiny hair, but after using this straightener my hair starts looking dry and loses its lustre. I used the Tresemme heat protectant spray prior to styling and also tried applying Chi Silk Infusion and got2b smoothing lustre lotion after ironing but neither helped. That is not a good thing if you&#x27;re planning on using it very frequently as it could cause long term damage to your hair.   3. Got a few fly aways after straightening, but I&#x27;m guessing this is normal as my hair tends to be on the dry side.  Overall, its quite good for its price - an innovative product and offers a lot of features. Its worth a try for someone who is looking for a versatile tool. The shine and snagging are huge cons for me though. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars otherwise. I&#x27;m going to try a straightener with tourmaline in it to see if it helps with the shine.</li>
    <li> A positive on this tool is that it has many different settings for doing the different things (but this is a bit complicated).  The good thing is, if you have 2 or more girls who need to do their hair, this one tool will do several things (with practice).  Saves having a straightener, a curler, etc., on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool is a bit cumbersome, and the tip gets really hot.  You have to train yourself not to touch it to avoid getting burned. The circular shape makes it tend to \\&quot;roll\\&quot; when you set down, so caution with your surface is also needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Remington hair tools are really good, and I prefer my regular curling iron.  This one is just too bulky for my hands.  Practice is required to utilize this tool to the fullest.  You won&#x27;t just pick it up and get it right the first time.</li>
    <li> I absoloutely love this. I have thick wavy hair that can be a huge pain. The straightener straightens it AMAZING! Also I never learned to curl my hair and this make it super easy and quick. The curls stay in all day with the use of NO products to help it stay in place!!!! I can not tell you how happy I am with this purchase</li>
    <li> Upon reading the reviews I decided to look at few YouTube clips to see how the wave and curl options worked. I went on to purchase it and I have been very happy :)</li>
    <li> We like that it does the job, and in a pretty package as well!  Heats up fast and works quickly.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a great idea to combine a curling iron and a straightener! I have below shoulder length fine hair that is only very slightly wavy. So, it never really looks too nice unless I do something to it...either straighten it or curl it. So, a combination device seemed perfect for me, especially for trips. When I saw it, I thought that the whole red part heated up creating a round, hot surface AND an inside flat surface. It doesn&#x27;t. It is still just the flat hot plates. What the directions say is to wind your hair once around the barrel as you slide it down to create curls. The barrel has adjustable projections that change the diameter of the barrel, but only the one part heats. So essentially you are moving the heated, flat plates down your twisted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with some speedbumps while trying to do the curls (I don&#x27;t know what you call them, but you KNOW the little crimps I am referring to! ha ha!) I tried a few different times to go slower, but not stopping (to avoid the crimp marks.) I did end up with sort of a wave, but no curl. I also tried to wrap the hair tighter, but ended up popping in one of the diameter-changer projections. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device has adjustable heat on a wheel, but I don&#x27;t really know what the numbers on it (15, 20, 25, 30) mean, so I just picked the middle. Also, the heat adjusting wheel is inside where the iron opens, so it is kind of hard to see in there to choose your temperature (but I suppose it helps you from inadvertently turning it while using.) My favorite part is that a light blinks until it is ready then is steady on when it is ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give it only 3 stars because of my experience with the curl feature, but it could be that I just don&#x27;t have the correct technique (using too much hair, going too fast, my hair being too long, etc.) I will keep trying to see if it is indeed MY error. I will edit this if I do figure out how to get the tighter curls like those shown on the package.</li>
    <li> I have had my old Conair straightener for at least 10 years; it does not have various heat settings, the straightening plates are not ceramic, at each plate is twice as wide as the ones on this Remington. I was wary about trying a new straightener; I used a ceramic one a long time ago, and I was not sure how much I&#x27;d like the skinnier plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this tool. I actually don&#x27;t mind the ceramic plates (I know that they cause less heat damage, so that&#x27;s a plus), and although they aren&#x27;t as wide as the plates on my Conair, it doesn&#x27;t take *that* much longer to do my hair. The size of the iron makes it easy to throw in a suitcase for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington does have a wide variety of heat settings, but one con is that there is no little arrow near the dial to show what heat setting you are on. I just leave it in the middle because I can never tell if I am turning the heat up or down. One good thing is that there is a blue light that flashes, which indicates that the iron is heating up; when it stays solid blue, it is at the right temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for using the tool as a curler/waver, I&#x27;m lost. The instructions on the box were so simple and didn&#x27;t make much sense, so I went over to their site and watched a video on how to use it. I thought to myself, \\&quot;Wow, that looks so easy!\\&quot; I then attempted to do my hair on each of the settings and couldn&#x27;t get it to work for me at all. Every once in awhile I&#x27;d get a wave or curl, but it was so rare I just gave up. I&#x27;m sure that someone who is a stylist could get the hang of the styler, and with lots of practice most people probably could get it to work too. However, I will not be using it for anything other than straightening my hair because I just can&#x27;t figure it out. If I want to wave my hair, I&#x27;ll use my 3-barrel waver. If I want to curl my hair, I&#x27;ll use a curler. If I want to straighten my hair, I&#x27;ll either use this or my old Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not incredibly impressed by this product, and that&#x27;s why I give it 3 stars. I&#x27;m sure some people can figure it out and it works great for them, but I bet most people will struggle with it like I did.ly impressed by this product, and that&#x27;s why I give it 3 stars. I&#x27;m sure some people can figure it out and it works great for them, but I bet most people will struggle with it like I did.</li>
    <li> I have a Remington straightener that I love, so I was really excited to try out this tool that straightens and curls- how perfect for someone with limited bathroom storage space?  Unfortunately, this tool just doesn&#x27;t work all that well.  It does straighten hair easily, but I found it pulled and didn&#x27;t leave my hair as sleek and smooth as my other Remington.  As for the curling, what a disaster!  I got one perfect curl but was unable to replicate it in the rest of my hair.  The pink side panels get very hot which makes positioning and twisting the hair correctly quite difficult.  It also makes it impossible to change the size of the curl if you realize you need to; you have to first let the device cool down to make that shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great idea for a product, but I think in the end it just tries to do too much.  I&#x27;ll stick to my separate strightener and curling iron for now until someone irons out the kinks of this design.</li>
    <li> I really like this tool as a straightener. It has a nice, large surface, it heats quickly and leaves my hair straight, smooth and shiny. I like that the ceramic plates minimize heat damage (in theory at least, I can&#x27;t verify this from experience). The auto shut-off is a plus for peace of mind. 30 heat settings sound impressive but as far as I can tell it&#x27;s a high-to-low dial with 30 tick marks on it. It&#x27;s not precise enough to even be certain you&#x27;ve set it on 18 rather than 19. Still, it seems to have plenty of temperature range to accommodate various hair types.  However, I&#x27;ve watched the videos, read the minimal instructions, and tried a few times to use the other settings to create waves and curls and I just can&#x27;t do it. Occasionally I&#x27;ve created a stray ripple, and I can turn the ends of my hair under fairly well, but otherwise I&#x27;ve only been able to use this as a regular straightener. I can only imagine that this is a skill-level issue, and that this does work for some people. But be warned that it&#x27;s not easy to figure out. I&#x27;d consider myself \\&quot;average\\&quot; at hairstyling: I can use a curling iron and a straightener well enough. My suggestion is to order this only if you&#x27;d be satisfied with a good straightener, and consider other styling capability a bonus if you can make it work on your hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair, and have a large collection of curling irons and straighteners to achieve different desired looks.  I thought this tool would be perfect to get tight curls, loose curls, as well as straighten; but all I can get is straightened hair.  My natural curl is much tighter than the \\&quot;tight\\&quot; curl setting, so for me all that did was give me loose curls.  I followed the directions, and followed an online video, and felt it was difficult to use to create curls; but because the barrel is larger, it will never provide as &#x27;tight&#x27; a curl I desire (I use a 1/2\\&quot; barrel for my tight curls, and this is at least 1\\&quot;).  For someone with a different hair type and different expectations, this would be a fabulous tool--I would love to be able to have one styling tool to create my desired looks.</li>
    <li> Sorry, Remington. This is just another advertising \\&quot;hype\\&quot; that just doesn&#x27;t work...at least not for me. The curl edge, when popped out, just doesn&#x27;t have enough heat on it to curl anything unless you leave your hair in the straightner part of it for 5 minutes and turning your hair to frizz. Straightner part works fine.</li>
    <li> I was really excited at first but when i tried the product it pulled lots of hair out and didnt do a well job straightening or curling!</li>
    <li> Straights and curls as promessed (my hair is normal,  not fine,  not thick). I&#x27;ve used to make curls with my regular straightner,  and this one makes it so much easyer! For those who are fighting to make curls,  watch some videos on Youtube that show you how.&lt;br /&gt;DUAL VOLTAGE. For those who travel abroad,  like me,  it&#x27;s perfect. Works on 110v and 220v perfectly. It&#x27;s not big and very light.&lt;br /&gt;MULTIPLE TEMPERATURES. If you have difficult hair, you can choose strong temperatures. If your hair is fine and fragile,  choose the lowers one. Mine is normal so I use the intermediate ones.&lt;br /&gt;Get hot really fast and is swivel cord, making all the work easyer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied. Do everything that promess.</li>
    <li> Our bathroom counter has seen a lot of different curling irons and straigteners in its day, but the Remington S6600 has become the one styler that stays on the counter at all times. It&#x27;s easy to use and versatile, heats up quickly, and for straightening, it&#x27;s probably one of the best products we&#x27;ve ever tried. The operation is smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t stick or pull like some other straighteners we&#x27;ve tried. We were way less impressed with the curling feature. Even though we&#x27;ve done exactly what the directions say to do, we can&#x27;t get the curls to come out the way we want. More often than not, my daughter will just end up giving up, and straightening her hair anyway. But again, we love this product for the straightener, so it still gets used almost daily.</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of flat irons, so I had my doubts about this one, but it has become my iron of choice.  I have very coarse, thick, wavy hair and have found a lot of irons just don&#x27;t have much effect in my hair.  This one has worked well with and without product in my hair.  I especially like the corrugated edge attachment, which is meant for curling the hair but I find it helps draw the hair straight. I have used this to curl the ends and it works well, too.  I would recommend this for people with my type of hair, it may be too much for people with fine hair, but you can adjust the heat setting.</li>
    <li> I love that it heats up quickly and it&#x27;s great for straightening hair.  I have curly hair. The only bad thing about it is that i can never curl my hair with this straightener</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my girlfriend. And she just love it. Her hair always have been a mess until now</li>
    <li> I gave this to  my granddaughter for Christmas and I have not heard one way or the other if she likes it.</li>
    <li> I have owned a pair of hair straighteners for years, but only used them a handful of times because they were heavy, very bulky and didn&#x27;t really do the job. I have very curly, thick hair and it was time-consuming and cumbersome to use my old straighteners and it never looked as good as when the hairdresser used hers. Recently, I have become bored with always having my hair curly or upstyled, so I had started to look at getting a more up-to-date pair of straighteners, knowing that technology had moved on since I bought mine and performance generally improved. Luckily for me, I had the chance to test the Remington S6600 Stylist Multi Style Styler. Very lucky indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I set aside time made to attempt to straighten my own hair for the first time in eight years with the Remington S6600 Styler. I was very impressed as it heats up very quickly (seconds); it&#x27;s about the tenth of the weight of my old straighteners; and, as such, very easy to use. I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair first, leaving it towel-dried and infused with a straightening product, relying instead on the Remington S6600 Styler. After just 40 minutes, which is the shortest time ever I&#x27;ve spent straightening my hair, I had achieved a smooth, sleek look that I would not otherwise achieve without spending an hour in the hairdressers. Yes, that&#x27;s right: my hair is that thick it takes a hairdresser (sometimes two) about an hour to style my hair straight. It&#x27;s been raining on and off today, and I had to go out after I&#x27;d finished, but my hair remained straight and sleek despite walking through some drizzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the process of styling, I also adjusted the comb, after turning it off, and it&#x27;s true, you can get a soft curl if you desire. I opted to test a small section with the first setting, creating a long, straight look with a slight curl under at the end and, with just a few attempts - to gauge timing and turning - the Remington S6600 Styler produced exactly the look I wanted. I have yet to test the other two comb extension settings, but I expect the Remington S6600 Styler will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Remington S6600 Styler is pretty, with hot pink accents yet still delivers. They are very light, but substantial and easily tame strong, thick, curly hair with its own mind. It&#x27;s easy to handle, the on/off switch is hidden away, so you can&#x27;t accidentally turn them on, and a blue light flashes as it heats to the desired temperature, then the light remains steady until you turn the Remington S6600 Styler off, a good reminder mechanism. The Remington S6600 Styler comes with a handy storage bag, too, to keep it dust free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a dial to select heat (much like you find on an iron), also hidden on the inside of the tongs, so you can&#x27;t accidentally turn it while styling; however it&#x27;s hard to determine which setting you have selected as there is no mark with which to line up. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the lock that keeps the tongs closed as it slips somewhat (well, it did for me) and I had to watch the tongs so they didn&#x27;t open when stored. Also, the outside heated up meaning I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable putting them down, as I used both hands to re-section my hair, opting instead to keep them balanced between my legs while seated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I received the Remington S6600 styler and will be using it again, and again, being confident I can produce different styles quickly and effectively.wo comb extension settings, but I expect the Remington S6600 Styler will do the job.

    <li> I bought this hair tool from Target for $30 and fell in love with it! I first saw a product similar to this at a shopping plaza. The product was from HerStyler, an upscale beauty company. Their product however, costed $200. So I bought this cheaper version instead. It works great on my hair!! Of course, first it was hard to learn. I actually watched a video on how to use HerStyler tool, to learn how to use this one lol. But it curls my hair fast! I just put it at the base of my hairline, make sure the black combs are facing up towards the ceiling, pull down a bit, then turn the curler in, a full 360o&#x27;. Then drag it slowly down. My curls come out perfect in all 3 settings. Definitely worth the buy! I use the Herstyler Argan Oil hair serum on my hair before I curl it, &amp; Herstyler Styling Spray after I&#x27;ve finished my curls. These 3 products work so well together. Curls fast &amp; stays on for hours. I can even comb my hair afterwards, and not mess up the curls. I love it! Will be buying 2 more, 1 for each of my sisters. :)</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this curler out.  I thought, \\&quot;finally, one that looks like it might be easy to use.\\&quot;  Sadly I was wrong.  Now admittedly I&#x27;m kind of a beginner when it comes to using hair curlers and straighteners.  So after failing miserably several times to use this product on my own I took it to the expert, my grandma.  Who proceeded to try to use it on my hair and fail too.  And I should note that I tried using their instructions, tried doing my own thing, and tried yelling at the curler, nothing seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are three different settings for curls on this, I opted for the tighter curls, since my hair is only shoulder length and I figured it would be easier to get the hair around the curler.  I think I managed a few ok looking curls despite the fact that the shape of this curler made it hard to use without burning yourself on the ceramic heaters that cover it.  There isn&#x27;t a whole lot of room for your hand on the handle to maneuver the curler around, even with the swivel cord.  I also disliked that the heat and on/off button were located inside the curler, they were awkward to reach and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I failed miserably at the curler sections, with what little bit of curls I did manage I decided to use the straightener on so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go to work looking like a mess that day.  The good news is that it worked.  The bad news is that my hair felt so dry and brittle afterward that I was a bit frightened that I had ruined it.  I had it set at the lowest setting and it was still extremely hot.  The hot setting is outrageous and I can&#x27;t really imagine anyone using it without burning their hair to a crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this can&#x27;t be a good curler, but I think you&#x27;d have to be a real expert to get it to do what you want.  Those of us who are beginners or don&#x27;t use a styling tool very often are going to be severely lost when it comes to this product.  And frankly its just not worth the damage the high heat does to the hair.  I really don&#x27;t envision myself curling my hair very much with this as the tool to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M.

    <li> This straightener is great for straightening hair- but that&#x27;s pretty much it. The concept of curling your hair with this tool is a good one, but it doesn&#x27;t work well. Overall this is a great hair tool and I&#x27;ve tried other flat irons but this one is the one I always come back to. The only complaint I have is that sometimes it pulls on your hair, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> Awesome really straightens perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair that naturally has curl/wave/body to it. I don&#x27;t always like how uneven it looks though, so sometimes I straighten it, sometimes I curl it a little more - makes for a bunch of tools in my bathroom that clutter the place up.  Thought this would help, but I am totally lost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions in the box are basically worthless for anything other than straightening.  They say you only turn the wand 180 degrees, but... I got online and looked for videos on Youtube - found a few with happy, smiling models with beautiful bouncy shiny curly hair and guess what?  They were turning the wand very slowly as they pulled it through their hair.  Figuring this was my problem I went back for round #2 with the dratted thing.  Yeah, didn&#x27;t work.  I spent about two hours total today trying different angles, different plate settings (tighter/looser curls), different heat settings, different amounts of hair in each section, turning more slowly/quickly, turning less/more, watching more videos for insights...  I was determined not to let the thing beat me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to get a handful of perfect curls, but most turned out very strangely, especially toward the ends.  I&#x27;d get a beautiful curl from the scalp, but then for about the last four inches, the hair was completely flat-iron straight.  AND, if I tried to re-curl that section, the whole thing would then come out flat (perhaps a very slight wave) and fly-away frizzy.  Also, I must&#x27;ve ripped out more hair than I actually curled - the thing kept grabbing my hair and pulling it out by the roots.  Ouch!!  I looked down at the counter at one point and about had heart palpatations when I saw how much hair I&#x27;d lost.  At one point, I thought I&#x27;d just straighten the whole thing, but then I looked like I&#x27;d stuck my finger in a socket - my hair was flying away all over my head.  And it had absolutely no life to it whatsoever.  No shine, no nothing.  Went back to trying to curl it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story long enough, in the end I was so hot and frustrated that I let it beat me. I gave up and decided to haul out my regular old Revlon 1-1/2\\&quot; curling iron to \\&quot;touch it up,\\&quot; only by then the few curls I had actually been successful at making with the Remington had fallen flat!!  Basically I just wasted thirty bucks and SOOOOO much time and energy.  If you&#x27;re a hairstylist, perhaps you can get the thing to work, but I think most people will have issues trying to do anything with it (especially curling).  So very disappointing.  Especially sad considering that my hair in its natural state is far more desirable to whatever this thing did to it.  :(</li>
    <li> The description of this tools says that you can make 4 kinds of hairstyles with it but I was only able to use it for 2 hairstyles. It worked well as a straightener and I was also able to make some very loose curls (that didn&#x27;t last too long). I watched some tutorials but I couldn&#x27;t make the tight curls showed in the box. If you are looking for a hair straightener that leaves your hair feeling silky this could make the job but for me it didn&#x27;t work properly as a hair curler.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the video is all about the &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34; and not about how to use the curling iron.  Then the directions in the paperwork are not very good either.  Several people have tried to figure out how to use this curling iron but it doesn&#x27;t work for the curling parts.  Don&#x27;t know what temperature to have any of the settings on for curling and it smells like it is burning my daughters hair, so we don&#x27;t want to leave it in long either.  Better directions would be very helpful.</li>
    <li> Bought as a cheap version to the tyme iron that $200, this doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do great curls, I like my other Remington straighteners better... I keep trying to use it but the curl part just doesn&#x27;t work on my think hair even in small sections...</li>
    <li> I ordered this due to wanting an all in one. Well as a straightener, it&#x27;s excellent, not so much for a curling iron. I find it difficult to curl my hair. The heat does not get to the hair to curl it. But I do like it for a straightener.</li>
    <li> Everything excellent, as described and works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for $30 at Walmart! The picture on the box shows a few different looks! I thought... Wow! this may actually work for me! I have thin straight hair. Therefore, I was really hopinh this would work. Sadly, my regular straightener curls my hair better! Yes, this does warm up fast and gets really hot but it just does not do what I feel the box shows. I understand some people have hair that&#x27;s much easier that holds curl unlike mine, but to all those girls like me who have fine stick straight hair, do not be fooled by the beautiful girl on the cover of the box, with the awesome curls! Not gonna happen! Remington is normally very good with all their products but personally to me this one is a HUGE FAIL! I am taking it back ASAP! Oh well... I guess I shall try something new! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for traveling overseas. All it needed was an adapter.  It worked like a charm.  Get hot very quickly.</li>
    <li> My daughter experimented with this and another straightener.  This one - which is more money than the other - did not straighten as well nor do the \\&quot;curl\\&quot; feature it was advertised to.  (Maybe her hair is too thick?).  She also burned herself - the design seems like the hot area are where you normally place your hands while straightening.  The cord is long and swivels, which is nice.  But it tries to do too much and there are better options out there at better prices.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on expected date, I just had to open it right away and give it a try and I absolutely loved it, it heats up very quick and it glides very smooth, I used it to straighten my hair and by the time I was done my hair was straight and soft I love my new straightener/curler.&lt;br /&gt;I did try the tight curls setting and it&#x27;s great it does leave nice beautiful curls. I just love it and yes I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I just used this flat iron for the first time and love it.  I have medium length hair right now so I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of curling my hair with it but I used it to straighten my hair and it didn&#x27;t fry my hair like my other flat iron.  It worked really well and I have very thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and very thick, and tends not to hold curl well. But it didn&#x27;t even get the chance, because the hair would slip out of the iron halfway through the process. The hair that did make it through just kinda hung there. It&#x27;s better suited for short thin hair.</li>
    <li> I like the way it works, I have no complaints, even though my hair doesnt hold curls for the whole day, this iron allows my hair 2 stay curly longer than usual.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to bring this home to my girls - we plugged her in right away and even watched a video to make sure i was using it right. It did absolutely nothing to hair! it didn&#x27;t straighten it, curl it, wave.. nothing. It does heat up hot - and you burn your hands on the barrel no matter where you place your fingers!&lt;br /&gt;THIS THING SUCKED!!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair amazing looking hair 4 different styles Instagram approves :D</li>
    <li> Really nice... As expected.</li>
    <li> My daughter said she loves this items, she said she keeps fighting her mom for it. Thank you guys for your great work.</li>
    <li> This product is 100% true to its description. It straightens, curls, waves and voluminizes your hair. Love the shine my hair gets while using it. You have 30 different settings to choose from depending on the hairstyle you want and the type of hair you have. My absolute favorite.</li>
    <li> Its a great straightener but an okay curling iron. Would recommend if searching for a cheap but good flat iron.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use when traveling because it can sub out for my curling iron BUT, use this one exclusively now! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this type of hair straighter. I have bought my fare share, but this one is STILL working perfectly fine. I am able to make curls as well as straighten my hair. If you are looking for two in one hair utensil, this is it!</li>
    <li> 1. easy to use&lt;br /&gt;2. value for the money&lt;br /&gt;3. good in handling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;do not have auto cutoff, better to have one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good I have gifted this to my sister</li>
    <li> Bought it for body, and it is good for that.  I also like the auto shut off and quick heat up time.</li>
    <li> First the positives - has all the new desirable features like handy swivel cord, multi heat settings, light indicator to tell you when the unit is heating/ready, ceramic surface.  The tool will perform straightning and all varieties of curling, so is a handy all-in-one for travel consolidation.  But . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The all-in-one aspect of this straightener-curler may be its basic flaw.  Ends up being a bit too cumbersome/complicated, with multiple transition steps required to change stying modes and a sometimes awkward feel (and burns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight, and not really used long enough to know if it will hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal suggestion: get a straighter for straightening, and a curling wand for curling.  You know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife and she&#x27;s really happy with the service if the item, thanks guys, keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> It takes more practice to get the hang of it, it works well, but  I miss my combo flat iron/curling iron by Conair that I&#x27;ve had for 10+ years, they no longer manufacture the product any longer, it was also easier to use.</li>
    <li> was not real thrilled very hard to use on one self to keep the plates in line and put the hair in. I ended just recently purchasing the revlon straightner and curler in one and i love it very easy to use just take off the outer plates and it becomes a curling iron. Also is infused with the oils.</li>
    <li> i love this items and works  220v</li>
    <li> My wife uses a straightner everyday so she has a heavy duty (and expensive) unit. The Remington S6600 is great but not built as well as her everyday unit. But for the price this is great for occasional use or for traveling. Looks great, easy to grip and use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used alot of straigteners.  But this one is great.  Fast and efficient.  I can&#x27;t get the curling function to work right for me, but since i don&#x27;t use it that doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it comes in hawt pink, and love the price.  Alot of straigteners that work this good are 80$ and up.</li>
    <li> Recently I learned a phrase - my hair has a wrinkle. Gosh, what are the teenage girls up to nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;Well, everyone seems to have a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair actually got a real wrinkle when I left certain part of it grow and pulled together for too long, it, yeah, had a wrinkle, this tool took less than 2 minutes to straighten it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how about some fancy curls? No luck. My hair got caught in the connecting parts many times, so I lost a few. And the side of the straightener gets very hot to handle correctly. The temperature dial is miserable.</li>
    <li> I LOVE This :)&lt;br /&gt;It straightens really good !&lt;br /&gt;BUT, you have to learn how to do the curls. I had trouble learning but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll love it :)&lt;br /&gt;The curls are really tight :) and the waves are awesome ! I RECOMMEND it for a friend or family member :) THANKS Remington !</li>
    <li> I never shopped at amazon before.this is my 1st time,so before I ordered this flat iron I read a lot of review n thought I&#x27;ll give it a try, I received my order like in 3days,I was impressed.the iron work great I love it.it did had a burning smell when I 1st used it,I ordered the iron in red n I received in purple so I wasn&#x27;t happy because I like red,but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Other then that The iron is great</li>
    <li> Perfect for curls for short  and long hair!</li>
    <li> Great item  great price. My daughter uses it with no complications. Thanks Amazon and supplier.</li>
    <li> IT SO AMAZING HOW WELL THIS STRAIGHTENER WORKS. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, THE PRICE IS RIGHT, TO GET THE JOB DONE.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, great for my wife, if I liked it and would recommend it to a friend, THANK YOU, FOR SALE</li>
    <li> this item it&#x27;s not for me, but she&#x27;s said it&#x27;s beatifull.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the iron as a \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron but just found a video on how to use.  I did find instructions, which I followed, but found the ends would crimp. Was not dissatisfied to the point of returning it but would recommend watching the video.  I will try further for the curling part but the straightening part of it is nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is relatively inexpensive as far as ceramic straighteners go, but beware because like the old saying goes \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is true in this situation. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair at all. In fact when I tried to curl it, it ripped my hair out at the bottom, so I was not happy. Maybe this would be good for someone with like baby fine hair. But for someone with thick curly hair, it definately doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The Remington S6600 Ultimate Styling Ceramic Hair tool is a passable tool for flat-ironing hair. It&#x27;s pluses is that it has an automatic shut off tool (if you forget to turn it off). It has settings to straighten hair, it also has tools that will produce waves and curls, if so desired. The iron has also has an automatic shutoff feature, if left unused after an hour.  For some reason, although this iron heated up quickly, it was still not enough to completely straighten my 4a/b hair. I had to make several passes to straighten my tightly coiled strands (after a wash, condition and use of heat protection spray). And even then, it didn&#x27;t look so great in the end. It may, however work better for curlies with 3a/b hair, or 1a/b/c and 2a/b/c women looking for curls.  I know some others may have a different experience with this styling tool, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this.I have been using this tool from a very long time.Now I can&#x27;t imagine my hair without this.</li>
    <li> Omg! i own this one and it is awesome! Just be careful with the heat according to the type of hair you have!! It adds shine beautifully to hair and curls beautifully as well! The only thing I dislike is when it&#x27;s time to curl it might snag on the clips on top of the flat iron depending. But other than that, n problems whatsoever it is lovely!</li>
    <li> this is the best straightener I have ever bought! I love it. I love how my hair feels and how the straight hair holds up all day even when its humid. so worth the money id  buy another one in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> I was pretty bummed out that it wasn&#x27;t as easy as the videos. It made my hair cling to my face from the static. I tried just straightening it after the curling fiasco, and it seems a lot more harsh on my hair than my andis ceramic flat iron.  I have more of a thin/fine hair but I have a lot of it and it just didn&#x27;t work out with this tool. I even had a friend try it, she couldn&#x27;t seem to work with it either.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT ! I RECOMMEND IT !!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Finally I got one tool that I can use to style my hair in various ways. I mainly use this product to straighten and do tight curls and it works great.The only thing is that is is a bit awkward at first to do the tight curls but once you get a hang of it, it works good!</li>
    <li> Though this straightener is a little confusing at first glance (what with the adjustable side clips and all) once you read the instructions it&#x27;s clear that this is a neat little gadget. You can do your hair four different ways with this contraption, which is nice because quickly as hair styles come &amp; go, you will be able to use this for years. It&#x27;s a little hard to handle at first but I got the hang of it pretty fast. It heats up quickly and gets to about 400 degrees at its hottest. It doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as other irons I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> The Remington S6600 Ceramic Hair Straightener does a really nice job. I like how it heats up fast and is easy to use. You have to be careful, OF COURSE. It&#x27;s a hot-iron! The swivel cord is a definite plus. I thought it did a nice job on thick hair. Mine tends to be wavy and wants to obstinately curl. These things are not always across the board effective on everyone--it really depends on the type of hair you have, length, texture, etc. I thought it did a very good job on straightening hair. Would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice and it was a bit difficult but I&#x27;m sure it will get easier as I use it more. I do love the way it curled my hair though.</li>
    <li> Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
    <li> Works great! good product!</li>
    <li> I think it only works for thin hair, the straightener part works okay (just okay, doesn&#x27;t last long). The curler part is really hard to use and doesn&#x27;t work for middle length hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new flat iron. This brand and product was recommended to me by a friend. I have really curly hair. This iron makes my hair look like I never had curly hair. It is quick to heat up, easy to use . I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do any of things it suppose to.It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all. I hate it so much</li>
    <li> About&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;With the Remington S6600 Ultimate Stylying Ceramic Hair Straigthener you are promised an easy way to have not only straight hair, but slightly curled, tight curls, or just gentle waves. I was very excited about this product, but did it live up to my expectations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Heat Control and Settings&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;The speed this heats up the ceramic plates is very fast, 30 seconds. It is also able to heat up to 400°F - Salon High Heat, just like the professional straighteners, although there are 30 variable heat setting to choose from, so don&#x27;t worry if it sounds too hot for you! Warning: It does however get extremely hot! I tend to dry my hair first by a hairdrier and then spritz it with a styling product that protects my hair from heat, and boy, does it let off some steam.  It can get very hot and I don&#x27;t even use it on the hottest setting. It works like a dream, but I do wonder what I am doing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Styling&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like being able to style my hair in four different ways, with only one tool. There are no extra attachments to add, remove or even lose. And this has happened to me in the past, a hair product with lots of extra attachments seems like a great idea but when one of them breaks or gets mislaid it can ruin the product, but not with this. All it takes is one flick of the side switch to change the position of the curl slides to go from perfectly straight hair, with an added kink at the bottom, loose, tumbling curls and waves or go for a full head of tight disco curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light, so I was able to style my hair without aching arms. Using some straightener spritzer to protect my hair from the heat, I tried the full straight look at first, which came out sleek and glossy at a third of my normal styling time.  Of course, I wanted to play around with this longer, to test out all the features, and changing styles with the same product couldn&#x27;t be easier. All it took was one flick of the side switch to change the position of the curl slides to go from perfectly straight hair to get a new slightly wavy, loose kink throughout. Just wrap the hair around the barrel and pull firmly down as you go and that&#x27;s all there is to it. It took me a few attempts (and video watches) to get it right, but it was worth the effort. Knowing how to use it properly is the key to making it work exactly how it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with the ease of use and the speed of which I completed a full sleek, straight style, which must be down to a combination of the fast speed the ceramic plates take to heat up and the high heat it is capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shockingly good price for what looks and feels like a professional saloon straightener.e easier.

    <li> I bought this product for my wife because she was having some problems with her straightener. According to her this straightener is awesome. This is a professional product for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Curling mechanism doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
    <li> Do Not Buy this product i was really excited about it but it doesnt curl your at all it can straighten it the side pieces are plastic cheaply made</li>
    <li> I liked. It work for my short hair :)</li>
    <li> The straightener part works well bit the curling does take practice and I don&#x27;t think it saves you any time and it&#x27;s also inconsistent with the curls</li>
    <li> Todo Bien! Excelente precio. LLego a tiempo, lo recomiendo altamente buena calidad y responsabilidad.&lt;br /&gt;Muy Buen articulo verificado ok &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> excelente equipo recomendado</li>
    <li> When I bought this flat iron I was so excited because all of the Remington products I&#x27;ve had have been so awesome! And after 10 years of use, my wet to straight and my 2 in 1 finally gave up on me and died. So when I saw this 4 in 1 styler, I thought &amp;#34;wow! I want this, Remington can do no wrong&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, I was SO WRONG. Remington CAN do wrong and boy, did it go wrong! Unlike the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, the curling part actually works wonders with my hair (I have very thin and straight but frizzy hair). This feature was easy for me to use because I&#x27;ve had years of practice with 2 in 1 straightener and curler, perfect curls right off the bat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it came to the straightening part, that&#x27;s when things got ugly. The curling adjustable parts are made of some plastic that gets really hot and smells really disgusting, like burned rubber... And that smell passes off to your hair! Uggh. Also, I don&#x27;t if it&#x27;s because of those plastic parts but when you pass the plates through your hair, it makes this horrible noise that you just know must be completely ruining your hair! So, when we finally come to the straightening part, it completely burns my hair! I thought maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using in the hottest level (30) but no! I tried different levels and with all, same results. At the end, I turned out with my hair completely burnt, feeling like it was straw and having no shine at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a total freak when it comes to taking care of your hair, and my hair is always beautiful and healthy even when I style it everyday, so of course, this situation was for me, a big no no. Now, I will have to end up storing this styler in oblivion and buying one that&#x27;s more expensive but takes care of your hair which is what I should have done in the first place.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this straightner specifically.  She sent me a link to it on Amazon at a good price.  This saved me a lot of time running all over town to find this specific one.</li>
    <li> Curls and  straightens beautiful. I love that it heats up quickly and it swirls at the bottom so the cable doesn&#x27;t get wrapped up. TRULY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I needed a straightener for a very long time, so I decided to give this a try. I also had a curling wand but I burned myself 24/7, so that&#x27;s why I really like this product. It came on time, looks exactly as shown in the picture and it works great!</li>
    <li> 1 1/2 years later and I am still using it and it works great still. No problems at all. I love how fast it heats (3min) which to me gives me enough time to section out my hair and then grab this to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a new hair curler, but then noticed some ladies in the locker room using flat hair irons.  My hair&#x27;s been on the &amp;#34;old lady frizzy&amp;#34; side in the past couple of years, and so I started doing some research on flat hair irons.  I thought all you could do was flatten, but much to my surprise, you can curl, too!  Well, after some more price searching online, I found this one &amp; got it right away.  It does curl, but for me the curls droop away by noon.  I use Got2b Guardian Angel Heat Protect &#x27;N Curl Spray, but even with just 2 or 3 spritzes, I think it&#x27;s still too much product for my fine hair, which is probably causing my hair to not keep the curl, even w/ hairspray.  I&#x27;m paranoid about burning my fine hair, so I need to find that fine line between putting in too much product and putting in just enough to protect my hair, and it may start keeping the curl.</li>
    <li> I am using it for a month and works pretty well, it warms very fast and is super easy to use</li>
    <li> I brought this after seeing the vids for what this flat iron claims it can do but i was very disappointed. it can straighten very good but the curling not so good. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product but it just cannot do what it advertises to do. If u have high hopes well u would not be too impresses after using it. That&#x27;s my two cents on this product.</li>
    <li> its preety good it doesnt burn my hair or anything and it makes my hair really soft so yea its good</li>
    <li> The best hair straightener i ever had.Now it&#x27;s so easy to have hair straighten and curls all together in one product. Now  i am so happy with my new hair styles.</li>
</ol>
