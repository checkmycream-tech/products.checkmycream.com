### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so this is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>I loved how it peeled off almost perfectly.</li>
      <li>This peel is great.</li>
      <li>I guess it does some good.</li>
      <li>so I knew they were good despite the price.  </li>
      <li>But the good side is it leaves your skin smooth.</li>
      <li>Perhaps its meant for light use, but I can say it smells really good.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin for the most part and prone to breakouts.  </li>
      <li>that my skin started to break out more.</li>
      <li>I thought the peel-off mask would have more of a \\&quot;pull\\&quot; when I removed it, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>So I make sure to spread it then and even on that area.</li>
      <li>This is another mask that I love.</li>
      <li>I also love the mint julep mask.</li>
      <li>so i was glad to find it on amazon</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a peel off mask anywhere since.     </li>
      <li>The thickness would have been ok if it worked better</li>
      <li>If you  have mild acne and have large pores then this is a very good product for your skin.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s better to wash your face with a very mild cleanser before you put this mask on.</li>
      <li>I wet my fingers and did the best I could spreading it out.</li>
      <li>I used to have great skin, it wasn&#x27;t until recently (just turned 30)</li>
      <li>So just give it a try as it&#x27;s a cheap product.</li>
      <li>Supposedly, this one fit the bill.</li>
      <li>I just put a light slathering of night cream on</li>
      <li>And the smell is super strong if you put some on the bridge of your nose.</li>
      <li>Over-all, I was pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>But so far I&#x27;m very very pleased with the product, feels like it tightens my face and softens my skin and its fun to peel off when it dries.</li>
      <li>The strong smell used to sting my eyes for the first 3 or 4 uses</li>
      <li>Its a little sticky, but dries nicely, and does leave your skin feeling nice.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a gentle masque this is ok for moisturizing, but if you really want a strong peel off masque</li>
      <li>This is by far the best if you want to brighten your skin, tighten you pores, eliminate black heads..</li>
      <li>It makes my skin very smooth, and clear.</li>
      <li>Also, you want to clean your face first - preferably with warm water to open your pores a bit.  </li>
      <li>I went back after 5 minutes to look in the mirror and something amazing happened.</li>
      <li>Its fairly inexpensive and is worth trying if you feel like your skin is flakey or rough.   </li>
      <li>it leaves your skin supple and fresh.</li>
      <li>It is thick and very moisturizing, helps to pull of gunk and dry skin and leaves  my skin bright, clean and happy.</li>
      <li>I put on my regular moisturizer after and my face felt clean and smooth and glowing.    </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy unless I can read the label first.</li>
      <li>My skin felt soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any pore size diminishing, but I don&#x27;t have very large pores.    </li>
      <li>product is very economical, VERY hard to use, but the end result is quite good.</li>
      <li>but I believe with regular use it could help preventing them from becoming clogged.   </li>
      <li>With my first use, I could really see how it sucked out all the dirt and oil from my combination skin.</li>
      <li>My face is tingling gently, but in a good way; it feels clean and tight, and my skin is definitely radiant.  </li>
      <li>and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite.</li>
      <li>I bought because I have oily skin with large pores, which is very blackhead prone.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help much with clogged pores like it claims</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to pull out my blackheads like a Biore strip, because a gentle peel-off masque like this one isn&#x27;t really made to do that.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say to much.</li>
      <li>After applying the product and peeling it off my skin feels so much smoother.</li>
      <li>I appreciated the speed that my product got to me.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have much lift force.</li>
      <li>This peel-off mask seems to get most if not all of the dry skin off my face, particularly around my nose area.    </li>
      <li>I have the most problems with my pores and where if I&#x27;m not careful the mask with build up and not dry.</li>
      <li>Overall, the results are worth it if you can put up with the chemical smell and have the patience to learn the application technique!</li>
      <li>I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn&#x27;t remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off</li>
      <li>So, first I could barely squeeze it out of the tube.</li>
      <li>Get off the easily washable layer of dirt and dead skin so that the masque is really pulling from beneath.</li>
      <li>The Queen Helene website touts their products as being \\&quot;inspired by nature&#x27;s finest ingredients, because they are safer and often more effective, than harsh chemicals and unnecessary additives\\&quot;, that they use \\&quot;good-for-you ingredients.\\</li>
      <li>I believe this will help foundation go on more evenly due to the fact that it smooths similarly to a foundation primer would.</li>
      <li>What I expected it to do was tighten my skin and do a mild cleansing to my pores, and I felt like it did that.  </li>
      <li>I left it in the draw with all the other products I don&#x27;t really use because they do nothing special.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use lotion very often and am constantly exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>has a very pleasnt scent, and you can feel it cleaning deep while the mask is drying.</li>
      <li>and wow, my face feels refreshed and revitalized.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product especially at the price.</li>
      <li>However, it is so strong it has made my eyes water, and drip tears down my face until the peel in dry.    </li>
      <li>This is definitely part of my new regimen.</li>
      <li>After peeling off I notice it really helps my acne as well as pore size and my breakouts don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
      <li>I mean really!!!</li>
      <li>it does not dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>I was at a beauty store getting some skincare products when I came across this and the Mint Julep masque, so I decided to get this gentle peel-off masque to use 1-2 times a week during the weekdays (less intensive) and then the Mint Julep masque to use once on the weekend.  </li>
      <li>I use the clay mask early in the week and then use this one later in the week if my skin is very dry because it moisturizes well while evening out my skin.</li>
      <li>While it doesn&#x27;t do anything bad, I haven&#x27;t seen much good from it either.</li>

<li> but it didn&#x27;t clean the pores in my skin as well as other peel off masques have in the past.  </li>
<li> You definitely have to let it sit and dry</li>
<li> : It is goopy and messy, but if you are careful you can get it on without messing up too much.  </li>
<li> It slowly helps to shrink your large pores but you have to be patient.</li>
<li> The only bad thing I did notice, is that it has such a strong, harsh chemical smell, which I don&#x27;t mind that much and can tolerate for the results.  </li>
<li> These are hard to find and I really like this one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m an average guy, not too interested in beauty products or anything, but recently I decided that it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea to start taking care of my skin/body a little better.</li>
<li> A long time ago I used to use the Avon Peel off Mask.  </li>
<li> 3) Took an inordinantly long time to remove.</li>
<li> It had a very strange texture on my skin.</li>
<li> Some parts of my face didn&#x27;t get any, but I thought I&#x27;d let it dry anyway and see how it went.  </li>
<li> You put it on, let it dry and pull it off.</li>
<li> I apply a thin layer first to my T zone and then spread out.</li>
<li> I have very dry flaky skin</li>
<li> I have very dry skin</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because the scent bothers me a little.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot in the last few months</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t adhere well to black heads, and when I peel off the mask, I don&#x27;t see the white and black heads on the peel, like I do on biore strips.    </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used peel-off masques before, including one by Queen Helene at a friend&#x27;s house, and I&#x27;ve used other QH products</li>
<li> I&#x27;m hoping their other products are healthier than this one.</li>
<li> After I tried the QH Mint masque, I wanted to try their other products.</li>
<li> I started noticing my pores are smaller or invisible, no more black heads</li>
<li> This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry</li>
<li> It may take some practice if you haven&#x27;t put on a peel off mask before, but it is the typical type of application with any peel off mask.    </li>
<li> also I have a slight redness around my nose &amp; its disappearing too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a tube that was old, but it was so thick I had to squeeze the tube very hard to get the masque out.  Then the application was thick and uneven.  The thickness would have been ok if it worked better but it didn&#x27;t clean the pores in my skin as well as other peel off masques have in the past.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.  If you are looking for a gentle masque this is ok for moisturizing, but if you really want a strong peel off masque this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
    <li> I started using this mask about a month ago to help with some blocked pores. I used to have great skin, it wasn&#x27;t until recently (just turned 30) that my skin started to break out more. Maybe to hormone changes? I don&#x27;t know. Anyways, I started to use this mask to help with small blocked pores that were making my skin dull. This peel is great. You definitely have to let it sit and dry otherwise you are just putting goop on your face. I apply a thin layer first to my T zone and then spread out. I noticed that my chin I have the most problems with my pores and where if I&#x27;m not careful the mask with build up and not dry. So I make sure to spread it then and even on that area. I highly recommend this product especially at the price. I also love the mint julep mask.</li>
    <li> After I tried the QH Mint masque, I wanted to try their other products. I have never used any peel off mask so had my doubts about this product. With my first use, I could really see how it sucked out all the dirt and oil from my combination skin. I think it&#x27;s better to wash your face with a very mild cleanser before you put this mask on. If you  have mild acne and have large pores then this is a very good product for your skin. It slowly helps to shrink your large pores but you have to be patient. The strong smell used to sting my eyes for the first 3 or 4 uses but now it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. So just give it a try as it&#x27;s a cheap product. Give it some time and you will see the big difference in your skin. I have noticed that my skin is getting brighter and softer.</li>
    <li> 1) Product is difficult to apply to face. 2) It never formed a mask; just stayed as goop. 3) Took an inordinantly long time to remove. It was very unpleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I started noticing my pores are smaller or invisible, no more black heads &amp; I&#x27;ve had problems with them since I was a teen, wish I would have known this would help alot sooner!  Wasted so much money on biore strips.      This is by far the best if you want to brighten your skin, tighten you pores, eliminate black heads.. also I have a slight redness around my nose &amp; its disappearing too.</li>
    <li> I dont have bad acne or anything, just some larger pores on some areas of my face, and the occasional black head... so I can&#x27;t really say to much. But so far I&#x27;m very very pleased with the product, feels like it tightens my face and softens my skin and its fun to peel off when it dries. I&#x27;m an average guy, not too interested in beauty products or anything, but recently I decided that it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea to start taking care of my skin/body a little better. So what... my guy friends think I&#x27;m weird. (I actually think they secretly want to try it, but they&#x27;re afraid) I like this product and how it makes my face look younger and clearer and thats why its gets a 5 from me.</li>
    <li> While doing some research on pore minimizing I came across this product.  I have oily skin for the most part and prone to breakouts.  After peeling off I notice it really helps my acne as well as pore size and my breakouts don&#x27;t last as long.  This is definitely part of my new regimen.</li>
    <li> Its a peel off mask, I thought its suppose to peel off at least some gunk in my pore. Zip, Nada, none. And the smell is super strong if you put some on the bridge of your nose. But the good side is it leaves your skin smooth. I guess it does some good.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it helps to remove dead skin cells. After applying the product and peeling it off my skin feels so much smoother. I believe this will help foundation go on more evenly due to the fact that it smooths similarly to a foundation primer would. Its fairly inexpensive and is worth trying if you feel like your skin is flakey or rough.   It doesn&#x27;t help much with clogged pores like it claims but I believe with regular use it could help preventing them from becoming clogged.   I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because the scent bothers me a little. It has perfume and 2 colors in it and the perfume lingers after the masque is removed.</li>
    <li> This product claims to \\&quot;lift and draw out impurities from the pores\\&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t have much lift force. It doesn&#x27;t adhere well to black heads, and when I peel off the mask, I don&#x27;t see the white and black heads on the peel, like I do on biore strips.    Perhaps its meant for light use, but I can say it smells really good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this product before now but I like it.  I use the clay mask early in the week and then use this one later in the week if my skin is very dry because it moisturizes well while evening out my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had been looking for a peel off mask that would help shrink pores. Supposedly, this one fit the bill. Price couldn&#x27;t be beat, either. So, first I could barely squeeze it out of the tube. I ended up literally putting the tube on the side of the sink and leaning on the tube with the base of my hand with all my might. After finally getting a big lump of it onto my sink,I then tried to spread it on my face. It would NOT spread! It stayed together in one gooey lump. I wet my fingers and did the best I could spreading it out. Some parts of my face didn&#x27;t get any, but I thought I&#x27;d let it dry anyway and see how it went.  I went back after 5 minutes to look in the mirror and something amazing happened. I guess from the heat of my skin the product had smoothed out all over to a shiny consistency which is how it should have started out! After another 5 or 10 minutes, I peeled it off in almost 1 piece. I loved how it peeled off almost perfectly. I immediately could tell that my pores were smaller as well. I put on my regular moisturizer after and my face felt clean and smooth and glowing.    So, bottom line...product is very economical, VERY hard to use, but the end result is quite good.</li>
    <li> The Queen Helene website touts their products as being \\&quot;inspired by nature&#x27;s finest ingredients, because they are safer and often more effective, than harsh chemicals and unnecessary additives\\&quot;, that they use \\&quot;good-for-you ingredients.\\&quot; The Grape Seed Masque contains dyes. I was very disappointed when I received the product and read the label. I&#x27;m hoping their other products are healthier than this one. I won&#x27;t buy unless I can read the label first.</li>
    <li> This product comes out of the tube like glue. So thick that it is very difficult to get it out. It does not spread on to you skin as described. This product stays in a clump of jelly like substance and just will not spread. I would not recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I tried this product and did not feel like it did any thing.  It had a very strange texture on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn&#x27;t remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don&#x27;t see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don&#x27;t really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used peel-off masques before, including one by Queen Helene at a friend&#x27;s house, and I&#x27;ve used other QH products so I knew they were good despite the price.  I was at a beauty store getting some skincare products when I came across this and the Mint Julep masque, so I decided to get this gentle peel-off masque to use 1-2 times a week during the weekdays (less intensive) and then the Mint Julep masque to use once on the weekend.  I have combination skin (oily T-zone, normal/dry cheeks) and I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot in the last few months so I wanted something that was going to help with the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this tonight.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to pull out my blackheads like a Biore strip, because a gentle peel-off masque like this one isn&#x27;t really made to do that.  What I expected it to do was tighten my skin and do a mild cleansing to my pores, and I felt like it did that.  My face is tingling gently, but in a good way; it feels clean and tight, and my skin is definitely radiant.  I also noticed that some of my big pimples have been brought to a head after peeling this masque off.  I didn&#x27;t look too closely at my nose, where I have some small blackheads, but I&#x27;ll see in the morning.  My skin felt soft and smooth afterwards.  I just put a light slathering of night cream on and wow, my face feels refreshed and revitalized.  Ahhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is goopy and messy, but if you are careful you can get it on without messing up too much.  I did this in bed.  Also, you want to clean your face first - preferably with warm water to open your pores a bit.  Get off the easily washable layer of dirt and dead skin so that the masque is really pulling from beneath.</li>
    <li> this works well... it does not dry out your skin. it leaves your skin supple and fresh. helps diminish the facial lines as well.  i would buy again.</li>
    <li> A long time ago I used to use the Avon Peel off Mask.  They discontinued making it and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a peel off mask anywhere since.     I have very dry flaky skin and whenever I use a lotion I break out, so I don&#x27;t use lotion very often and am constantly exfoliating.  This peel-off mask seems to get most if not all of the dry skin off my face, particularly around my nose area.    I don&#x27;t really notice any pore size diminishing, but I don&#x27;t have very large pores.    The only bad thing I did notice, is that it has such a strong, harsh chemical smell, which I don&#x27;t mind that much and can tolerate for the results.  However, it is so strong it has made my eyes water, and drip tears down my face until the peel in dry.    For an application, you have to put it on relatively thick, but thin enough to try out.  It may take some practice if you haven&#x27;t put on a peel off mask before, but it is the typical type of application with any peel off mask.    Overall, the results are worth it if you can put up with the chemical smell and have the patience to learn the application technique!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this mask does wonders for my skin. It makes my skin very smooth, and clear. This mask is very hard to find so i was glad to find it on amazon</li>
    <li> These are hard to find and I really like this one. I do not like the clay masks so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times in the last two weeks. While it doesn&#x27;t do anything bad, I haven&#x27;t seen much good from it either. I bought because I have oily skin with large pores, which is very blackhead prone. I thought the peel-off mask would have more of a \\&quot;pull\\&quot; when I removed it, but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m going to keep trying though, using different thicknesses to see if it changes anything.</li>
    <li> Its a little sticky, but dries nicely, and does leave your skin feeling nice. Has not casued any drying out, when used in direction on label (about twice a week).&lt;br /&gt;Also has a very pleasnt scent, and you can feel it cleaning deep while the mask is drying. Over-all, I was pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I loved it! I appreciated the speed that my product got to me. I will be doing business with you again!</li>
    <li> I thought I would peel away the junk in my pores, like with those strips, but all that peels away is the stuff itself. Feh.</li>
    <li> This is another mask that I love. I use it weekly or bi-weekly. You put it on, let it dry and pull it off. It is thick and very moisturizing, helps to pull of gunk and dry skin and leaves  my skin bright, clean and happy.</li>
