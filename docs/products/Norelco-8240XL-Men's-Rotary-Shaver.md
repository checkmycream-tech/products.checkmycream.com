      <li>It looks nice and fits my hand comfortably but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>try it men love this try</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with them.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to clean and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The hinge which connects the head assembly to the razor body is a friction-fit design which allows the head unit to detach all too easily.  </li>
      <li>The head holder easily falls off and the heads have come out in my lap while driving.</li>
      <li>and my husband has done so well and liked it so much I purchased one for him also!</li>
      <li>The battery still takes a full charge after all this time, and their customer service has been outstanding.  </li>
      <li>this razor is fine.</li>

      <li>It shaves close, its easy to clean and holds a charge.</li>
      <li>It would be a great help if there were something to indicate the battery was getting low.  </li>
      <li>but I still enjoy my 4845 XL.</li>
      <li>This has never been an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;After one year and nine months, this still delivers a close comfortable shave that I would recommend to others.</li>

      <li>I am very pleased with the this razor and the new type of heads.</li>
      <li>Makes for a clean smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>It is very comfortable, fast and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I think I will use the brush to clean the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled to be a new owner of the #8240xl; and remember, do not shave while charging the&lt;br /&gt;razor, because it shortens the battery life.</li>
      <li>I choose not rinse my razor but tap on the head assembly to clean it.  </li>
      <li>rinse the cutters under tap water, to clean the unit.</li>
      <li>you can clean out the shaver head with tap water.  </li>
      <li>So far, this one seems to be working better than most for him.  </li>
      <li>have not had to clean the unit, but the instructions indicate that I can either used the supplied brush&lt;br</li>
      <li>This razor has a very smooth shaver and very durable.  </li>
      <li>With the Braun 7000 series, you had to use their special cleaning solution ($5/3 weeks).  </li>
      <li>My last Norelco razor was a Spectra 8894 XL, loved this razor.  </li>
      <li>This one cuts really close and gives a better finish than he used to get.</li>
      <li>Used it for several years, but never got a good shave despite changing foils and cutters every 6 months.  </li>
      <li>This does not deliver \\&quot;blade-close\\&quot; shave, but on many mornings my real blade shaves are too close.</li>
      <li>Actually, it&#x27;s as good as a blade, which I never thought possible.</li>
      <li>The Remington is NOT a bad shaver.  </li>
      <li>I bought this do to the other great reviews.     </li>
      <li>Even hard-to-mow-down neck stubble vanished quickly.    </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t shave that quickly.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find that little had changed in it&#x27;s performance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: Battery life is amazing: I got a FULL MONTH daily usage on the first charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always likes Norelcos -- they just work best on my face. This one is light and easily fits the hand and has excellent battery life. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He&#x27;s used electric razors his entire shaving life, and has used the  Norelco&lt;br /&gt;brand with very satisfactory results. This particular model has been a real \\&quot;wow\\&quot; for him! He gets an incredibly close shave&lt;br /&gt;which he feels is even closer than before (even after a blade replacement on an older version) and is a very happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;What a win-win! A man who enjoys shaving, and a wife who loves her freshly shaven man. :-)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] I have used and enjoyed the comfort of&lt;br /&gt;various Norelco shaving products since the early &#x27;70&#x27;s; I ordered the #8240xl to replace my old Norelco,&lt;br /&gt;because the bearings were going bad after many years of dedicated service. The cost of the 8240xl reflected&lt;br /&gt;a good discount over the every-day price, and was delivered with a nearly complete battery charge. I have&lt;br /&gt;only used it once, and so far my face and beard require no break-in time because I continue to use the&lt;br /&gt;triple-header format; meaning that my face is set for the new razor. I enjoy the triple-header format (as&lt;br /&gt;opposed to a square or rectangular cutter) because my face is round-not square. Also, the razor casing is&lt;br /&gt;contoured to fit my hand, for easy maneuverability against the beard grain. Since I&#x27;ve only used it once,&lt;br /&gt;I have not had to clean the unit, but the instructions indicate that I can either used the supplied brush&lt;br /&gt;or rinse the cutters under tap water, to clean the unit. I think I will use the brush to clean the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am thrilled to be a new owner of the #8240xl; and remember, do not shave while charging the&lt;br /&gt;razor, because it shortens the battery life. The green blinking L.E.D. indicator light means that the unit&lt;br /&gt;is fully charged and ready for use. Enjoy!--G.E.C.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver. Very easy to clean and very easy to use. No issues what so ever! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco electric razor I&#x27;ve owned and the worst by far.  The first was a corded L1118, which although heavy and bulky, worked very well.  My second Norelco, which I still have, is a 5801XL.  It was, and still is, an excellent razor.    I bought the 8240XL last December but did not use it until March 2011.  It didn&#x27;t take long to learn to hate this razor.  There are three major flaws with this model, as far as I am concerned:    1.  The release button to open the cutting head assembly is too easy to activate.  I have accidentally hit this button any number of times while shaving, which caused the head assembly to pop open while the razor is on.    2.  The hinge which connects the head assembly to the razor body is a friction-fit design which allows the head unit to detach all too easily.  I choose not rinse my razor but tap on the head assembly to clean it.  It is a given that the head assembly will fall off each time unless I hold it in place, and even that does not always work.  Also, I do not bang on the head assembly, but gently tap it.    3.  The locking mechanism which is supposed to keep the cutting heads secured in the head assembly is too easy to accidentally unlock when cleaning the razor.  I have had it open at least three times while I was cleaning the razor, allowing all the cutters to fall into the sink.  Of course, there is no way to make sure the right pieces go back together, so shaving quality immediately suffers.  Norelco even recommends not mixing up the cutters and the foils for this very reason.    If I had it to do over, I would not buy this razor again, and I do not recommend it for the reasons listed above.  It is poorly designed, and Norelco took a step backward as far as I am concerned. The 5801 is a much better razor, and I only bought the 8240 because new blades in an old razor is not a good investment.  Yes, the 8240 is quiet and it worked well until it came apart the first time, but those are all the positives I will give this razor.  I will look to another brand next time, unless Norelco makes some major changes in these razors.</li>
    <li> No complaints about the shave quality, but I am not pleased with how easily this shaver falls apart. Although not ideal, I shave on my 40 minute drive to work. With a slight bump, the top opens and the shaved whiskers are all over my shirt and littering the console. The head holder easily falls off and the heads have come out in my lap while driving. If you plan to shave in the car, I do not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> After using a Remington oscillating type shaver for more than 10 years I needed to change.  My beard had coarsened so much that some of the thick hairs would no longer go through the Remington&#x27;s foil.  I had to use the sideburn trimmer on my neck and my cheeks.  The Remington is NOT a bad shaver.  The battery still takes a full charge after all this time, and their customer service has been outstanding.  It&#x27;s just that my beard sort of \\&quot;outgrew\\&quot; the Remington&#x27;s foil and cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After studying the reviews of dozens of shavers I settled on this one, the 8240XL.  The reviews suggested that all the manufacturers (including Norelco!) were \\&quot;cheaping out\\&quot; and saving every possible nickel during production but the 8240XL seemed to be the best of a bad lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it was a revelation.  I switched it on and thought there was something wrong with it because it was so quiet.  Then I dragged it across my face in one of the spots where I&#x27;d had to use the Remington&#x27;s sideburn trimmer, and the hair just...  disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave closer now in about a fifth of the time I took before.  If this Norelco lasts as long as the Remington, I will be very pleased indeed.  Check back with me in ten years or so and I&#x27;ll let you know.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Battery life is amazing: I got a FULL MONTH daily usage on the first charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: After more than a year, I STILL get 5 weeks usage between charges.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as quickly or as closely as when new, but that&#x27;s to be expected, I have gone more than twice the recommended time without replacing the cutters and foils, and it still performs quite adequately.</li>
    <li> I previously owned  a Norelco aritec which for me was totally worthless. I could not get a close shave  at all. It was expensive but very ineffective- it still is. This shaver-  the 8240-works the way the old Norelcos did. I am very pleased- cleaning is easy, it shaves close and the charge lasts a long time.  I recommend this even for tough whiskers like my neck whiskers. It is a winner.</li>
    <li> I tried electric shavers when I first started shaveng and they didn&#x27;t work.  They pulled, they hurt,they caused a rash.  Now I am 70 and a friend recommended this Norelco.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It works great with no problems I had years ago.  It is very comfortable, fast and smooth.  Works great.</li>
    <li> As far as I can remember, I have always used Norelco Razors.  I am very pleased with the this razor and the new type of heads.</li>
    <li> My husband received this shaver from me for Christmas to replace an older Norelco rotary shaver. Seems within 2-3 hours his face is still beard rough.</li>
    <li> Good electric shaver!  Light weight and gives good shave.  Battery life is excellent.</li>
    <li> Checked all the reviews before I bought this and was so happy I did, my husband says it is one of the best electric razors he&#x27;s ever had in his life.  Would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous electric shavers in my life, but never a rotary. I was never happy with shave quality, but liked the convenience of electrics. I doubted a rotary would get around my goatee beard, or my bone structure. I was willing to try this due to the 45-day guarantee. I am wonderfully surprised. This gives a remarkably close shave, better than any electric I have ever used. Actually, it&#x27;s as good as a blade, which I never thought possible.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews of this product and several other models of the Norelco razors on Amazon, I chose this one.  It was less $$ than some of the models.  My husband really likes the razor - especially that he can rinse it off after he uses it.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say my husband seems to love this razor.    The last 3 razors I have gotten him ended up returned or tossed out.  One other razor was so confusing he had to spend 2 days reading the instruction book &amp; trying to get it to work right.    He does have a history of using Norelco in the past.  So far, this one seems to be working better than most for him.  No complaints.    Very very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This review is written by my husband: I&#x27;ve used these three-headed Norelco shavers for 20 years or so and I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with them.  Didn&#x27;t realize that this model is missing an important feature - a warning light when the battery is running low.  The first time this happened the razor suddenly stopped in mid-shave. I realized the battery was expended and a recharge took care of that.  Other then the needed warning light this razor is fine.</li>
    <li> There seem to be several identical shavers listed here. Mine does not have the low charge warning light.    I bought this and waited before using it. Just another Norelco. So what?    The what is the shave seems particularly close and VERY QUIET.  I never thought Norelcos were loud compared to some foil models put out by Braun or Remington. (Moreover in my experience, I get closer shaves with a rotary.)    This has the light sound of a pretend toy shaver while delivering excellent electric shaver performance. Quite remarkable. Even hard-to-mow-down neck stubble vanished quickly.    If the noise of your shaver bothers you, try this Norelco (or models like it.)    This has the standard Norelco \\&quot;clean under the tap\\&quot; method, which to me is far prefgerable to some makers&#x27; refillable cleaner systems. I have one of those too, but I got tired of buying special razor cleaning cartridges every month or two.      This does not deliver \\&quot;blade-close\\&quot; shave, but on many mornings my real blade shaves are too close. Styptic pencil, anyone?</li>
    <li> We followed the instructions explicitly for charging the battery upon receiving the shaver.  My beard is  not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; , but I definitely do not get 17 shaves per charge.  I can only get 7 to 10 shaves, then the razor stops with no warning.  It would be a great help if there were something to indicate the battery was getting low.  I usually shave in my car and it often stops before I have finished shaving. Any suggestions???</li>
    <li> My husband Loves it!  I bought this do to the other great reviews.     My husband took one look at it and said...  \\&quot;he could not use it that his beard was to thick and that he&#x27;s had one years ago like this one!\\&quot; I said \\&quot;no try it men love this try it!\\&quot;      He did and ....HE LOVES IT! This is why I LOVE Amazon!    July 6, 2011    I also bought one for my son he has Very sensitive skin and my husband has done so well and liked it so much I purchased one for him also!</li>
    <li> After finally giving up on Remington&#x27;s foil shavers (my last one was both extremely noisy and gave a mediocre shave), I tried this Norelco and was very pleasantly surprised. It is very quiet, it gives me a shave in a comparatively short time, and it provides the best/closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric. The only negative thing I can think of about this shaver is that the pop-up trimmer is pretty narrow--but that&#x27;s a very minor issue. I think this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> The razor performs as expected. However, much to my dimay I neglected to price shop this item locally. Costco sells the same thing,WITH A SET OF EXTRA HEADS for the same price, and the body of the razor is more attractive.</li>
    <li> My third Norelco this is the best one.  Been using them for thirty years.  Have never exchanged heads.  Always soften beard first.</li>
    <li> This is not that great a razor, in my opinion. I didn&#x27;t buy mine online, for which I&#x27;m thankful because of the price. I got mine at Kohl&#x27;s a while ago for about $35. It doesn&#x27;t work that well. it doesn&#x27;t shave that quickly. It&#x27;s just a very ordinary machine, and I&#x27;d recommend that you go with something else.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for a gift for my boyfriend. He has used electric razors in the past but didnt feel like they shaved close enough. I took a chance and purchased this because regular razors irritate his skin. He loves it! It shaves close, its easy to clean and holds a charge. The only thing that is a small negitive is when its plugged in the light flashes. So we arent sure if its low charge or needs to be charged because it always flashes, ......but still very happy with quality and performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor two years ago to replace my older 4845 XL model and I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t get rid of my older model that had gone through two batteries and a cutter. As mentioned by others, this razor (8240 XL) does not have a low battery indicator and stops dead while you&#x27;re shaving. Hopefully, you didn&#x27;t travel without the power cord. The shaving ability is awful. I have to pass the razor over the same spot several times to get a clean shave. On the older model I would only have to pass it once and getting stubborn hairs with the 8240 XL requires a tweezers; and I have a light beard - I can go four days before anyone suspects I haven&#x27;t shaved. It looks nice and fits my hand comfortably but that&#x27;s about it. I would not recommend this razor to anyone but I still enjoy my 4845 XL.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. It is his forth Norelco razor and he has always been very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent PHILIPS shaver made in the NETHRTLANDS,  REGARDS/RSB</li>
    <li> I have tried to use this razor about 5 times now, and every time it is very painful and slow process.  I dont shave every day, and with this I would never be able to because it takes a week for my face to heal from the prior hackjob.  it works decent on flat areas of the face, but for under the chin and around the corner of the chin, the blades do not rotate well to catch the hairs, which requires many many passes over the same area to catch all the hairs at just the right angle.  It takes much longer than if i buzzed it with a simple trimmer and then used a manual razor/shave cream and causes more irritation than a 2 stage shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  this works a lot better if you shave regularly and the hairs are really short to start.  Unfortunately it still misses lots of hairs and if you go back to get them, it will cut you up.  If I have to switch from this to a regular razor with cream to do the final touches, theres no point in using this thing at all instead of just using cream and razor for the whole thing.  Wish I had gone with my gut and returned this right away within the return period, but it wasnt A-PRIME so I would have had to pay for the return shipping which caused me to hesitate.</li>
    <li> Shaves clean, quiet and easy to hold which makes a difference to arthritic hands like mine. Also comes with a nice carrying case</li>
    <li> Based on reviews, I gave this a try. After many months I am still amazed at how long it goes on a charge.    I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for over 40 years and this is the best so far. It is so much quieter and closer shaving than my previous Norelco, I wished I upgraded years ago.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for around 2 years and can honestly say this is the best I have found.  I love the fact I can use standard shaving gel with it and just rinse it off and it&#x27;s ready for the next day.  I have had ZERO complaints with this shaver and about to order some more blades so it will last another 2 years.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have another one, so I knew what to expect. It has worked just fine. Ok.</li>
    <li> I never had any trouble with Norelco the brand has a very good rep in my eyes,  My dad has had this product for a few months now and I have not had any complains from at all,  So I do recommend this product not only one my dads silence but on my own previous experience with the brand itself.</li>
    <li> Great Electic Razor! Very Satisfied. Must confess though, I was very concerned about quality issues after Phillips bought out, or aquired Norelco. With Norelco being a far superior product in its past. I was happy to find that little had changed in it&#x27;s performance. Historically, Competitive buyouts usually kill off the great ones!</li>
    <li> and he loves it. He had an old version for many years and he swears for this brand. He uses it every morning before work and recommends it.</li>
    <li> Used to be a Norelco user, then was given a Braun 7000 series shaver by the family.  Used it for several years, but never got a good shave despite changing foils and cutters every 6 months.  Went back to Norelco with the purchase of the 8240XL and am glad I did.  Much better (closer) shave, especially around the edges - chin, lips, adams apple, etc.  Very quiet.  First full charge and I&#x27;m still using the shaver after 4 1/2 weeks.  Plenty of charge time for me.  But the feature I like best ....... you can clean out the shaver head with tap water.  With the Braun 7000 series, you had to use their special cleaning solution ($5/3 weeks).  With the money I&#x27;m saving just from that, I could buy a new shaver every year.  Yes, as others have noted, there is no low charge indicator light on this model, but with the length of charge and the 3 minute quick charge if you do run out, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a big issue for me.  Would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Norelco 8240XL in April of 2011 after nursing along an older model that would not hold a charge even after replacing the batteries a couple of times. When I could not find replacement blades I knew it was time to upgrade. I did extensive research and decided on the 8240XL.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally pleased with this shaver; it gives me a quick comfortable shave at 5:30am five days a week. The thing that is most impressive to me is, it runs for weeks and weeks without having to charge it. There has only been one occasion since I bought this that it was not charged enough to run. The beauty of this shaver is, you can plug in the cord and continue with the daily duties.&lt;br /&gt;As far the couple of random reviews of the shaver falling apart or opening up, I would have to ask are you a klutz or accident prone? This has never been an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;After one year and nine months, this still delivers a close comfortable shave that I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> works great, after having a beard for many years, this shaver did nit cause any irritation,so I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT</li>
    <li> i was very nice to use at start, then after a couple of weeks, it started to be rough and slow to shave. it keeps getting worse to use, a waste of good money</li>
    <li> Comfortable to use easy to clean</li>
    <li> My last Norelco razor was a Spectra 8894 XL, loved this razor.  It was well constructed, strong motor, a 100 minute battery and a good readout.  When the battery went on this razor I purchased another Norelco razor which at that time was just a strange bunch of poor quality razors, so I purchased a Braun which broke after six months.  The Braun took three times the amount of time to shave than the 8894XL and did a really poor job on the neck.  I called a razor repair shop so see if I could get the 8894XL rebuilt, he said parts were no longer available and the best choice now is a Norelco 8240XL razor.  But this razor would be no where near the quality of the 8894XL.  He was right, flimsy construction, short life battery, a weak motor, and a lame light indicator.  The electric razor industry has left consumers with some very poor choices for electric razors.</li>
    <li> No issues so far with this shaver. I had it for over 2 years now and still works just as well as when I bought it. These shavers don&#x27;t give you the kind of close shave that you get from a razor, but do save time shaving. Enjoy watching TV every morning or working on computer while I am shaving. Cant do that with a razor. The shave is close enough to pass off for a well shaved look, but you realize that by evening the un-shaved look is just a bit more obvious than if you were to use a razor. Again, it is no razor but pretty close to it and I am happy with it. It was pleasantly surprised how well and long this has been working, considering the quality issues I have been facing universally with many cheaper but poorly built made in china products. The only reason for taking a star off is that the shaver design can probably be enhanced to contour to the face edges better.</li>
    <li> This razor has a very smooth shaver and very durable.  Makes for a clean smooth shave.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a razor for their man</li>
    <li> The shaver cuts closer and more comfortably than nearly all other brands of electric shavers, and this head with 3 rows of slots and blades cuts much better than the Norelco shavers with only one row of blades.  So far, the battery charge lasts longer than most other razors.</li>
    <li> I have been using razor blades for years now, because shavers never, ever worked for me. I suppose my neck hair is just too course. But I was sick of the rash I get from using razors, so I decided to actually buy an expensive shaver. I am glad I did, because it is definitely worth the price. This is the first shaver I have used that actually gets all my neck hair and gives me smooth skin. simply awesome. I actually like shaving now.</li>
    <li> He has been using the 3 head type razors for many years and for him they worked quite well. He didn&#x27;t realize that they could be even better. This one cuts really close and gives a better finish than he used to get. The battery life time is average but everything else is quite good.</li>
    <li> Good product and works like I thought it would. Does not work well on longer stubble as I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This item was bought to replace an older Norelco Shaver.  My husband has been pleased with his Norelco Products for years.  In his opinion, they get better and better.  This one was no exception and he was very pleased. It does a good job and does it quickly, even for a retired guy that might not take grooming quite as seriously as he once did. :)</li>
    <li> Great razor works perfect! finely i got one with bigger and better head with bigger cutting surface and easier to clean.Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> My only problem is with having to recharge the battery more often and sooner than I did with my previous Norelco.I purchase this for my husband Carnig and this is his only complaint.Is there a reason for this?His previous Norelco also came with a nice stand to put the razor in when not in use and when recharging the battery.</li>
    <li> Great shaver but is lacking a charging stand. Shipped in a good timeframe. Brand new and as described by shipper.</li>
    <li> I read through the previous reviews and they were mostly positive. The negative reviews did not keep me from buying this product. This product has lived up to what was written about it. It cuts very closely, it is quiet, and it takes less time because it cuts the whiskers the first time very close. My caregiver has to shave me and she was very impressed with it. The shaver was well worth the money I paid for It.</li>
    <li> smooth, easy to clean, have owned it for almost two years and have never had a problem with it. I recently lost it during a vacation and needless to say, I will be buying the same one again.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace model i purchased 12 years ago. It is now very light plastic but works well, just would be better with a heavier material</li>
