<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this is a fine, quality toothbrush.  For the designiation &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; I thought that the firmness was really solid, which I like when brushing my teeth.  Plus it has a nice big toothbrush head, which I&#x27;ve noticed some brands annoyingly getting away from lately.</li>
    <li> I would give this toothbrush 10 stars if the system would let me.  After using the toothbrush for the first time, my teeth felt about as clean as they feel when I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the Dentist.  I was really surprised that it cleaned this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and gums but had no problems or bleeding gums when I used this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than my regular Colgate toothbrush but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this toothbrush because it&#x27;s so unlike many others. The wraparound cheeks really change the dynamic of the brushing experience. My teeth feel very clean after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like your teeth are getting a full brushing experience. There wasn&#x27;t any part of my mouth that felt under appreciated by the brush. The medium brushes feel great and this lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new toothbrush, you&#x27;ll want to give this a try. It&#x27;s different and you definitely can&#x27;t always say that about toothbrushes. I simply love this product.</li>
    <li> I actually like the large size of this toothbrush. I feel like it does an adequate job of cleaning my teeth without having to go over the same area as many times due to its larger design. I understand this design is not for everyone but I really like it. Great product!</li>
    <li> It was very easy to open the Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush. The bristles are more stiff than the soft toothbrush, so if you have sensitive gums, you might want to try the soft toothbrush. This was easy to use and works like any other toothbrush. You put your toothpaste on the bristles, put the toothbrush in your mouth and brush vigorously. If you&#x27;ve used a toothbrush before, using this won&#x27;t be rocket science. Like any other toothbrush, this does a fine job keeping teeth clean, just remember to also floss.</li>
    <li> Does extremely good job of brushing and massaging gums</li>
    <li> I choose the medium bristle because I like a stiffer bristle, but this toothbrush definitely was a bit too stiff the first time I used it.  However, they did soften with a few uses.  The rubber scrubbing on the back and sides of the head is useful for cleaning the tongue.  It does mean that you can&#x27;t just rest the toothbrush on the side of the sink - you definitely need a toothbrush holder to keep it upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the brush and handle worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has done a fine job of cleaning my teeth.  At least, there&#x27;s been no visible change that I could perceive.</li>
    <li> Colgante knows their oral hygiene and makes fine products. This toothbrush is no different feels nice in hand with sort of firm but not too hard bristles. I use allot of their products and enjoy trying these different types of brushes for travel and to give my electronic brushes a break. This is a good brush it will reach those hard to reach spots plus  cleans tongue and gums too. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a few of these toothbrushes that are equipped with the little rubber flaps in place of bristles, and I am discovering that these fancy features do nothing more than make it difficult to do a quick, simple clean. I do like the lengthier bristles along the side, but perhaps that is only amplified by the lack of bristles in the middle.</li>
    <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush in the morning and bedtime, but for those in-between brushings, I use a manual toothbrush.  I like the design of this Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head toothbrush.  The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  I thought the bristles were much too harsh for a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; toothbrush, and felt more like a harder bristle.  I would buy this type of toothbrush again, but with the compact head and soft bristles.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel toothbrush for me.  It cleans well and is easy to use. These have fewer bristles with a rubber layer inbetween but work very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Colgate whitening v toothpaste and now the toothbrushes too. Nice brush with strong handle. Works great and is good quality.</li>
    <li> This brush feels really good in my hand while I am brushing. I like the 360 feature, this brush os very well designed. I found that cleaning the bite of my teeth the sides were also being reached by the brush. The bristles got between my teeth also helping to get a deep clean. The brush is massaging and gentle as it gives an excellent clean.</li>
    <li> The differences between the Colgate 360 Total Advanced and the Whole Mouth Clean versions are subtle. One has to hold them up side by side to really see the differences. They both clean very well and are a serious step above the typical every day toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes have staggered bristles for not just cleaning the outside of the teeth, but also in the crevices and additional long bristles for getting around the gum line. Where the two versions start to vary is the alignment of the bristles on the brush head. The bristles on the Colgate Total Advanced brush are more tightly compacted together, and there appear to be more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also both brushes have soft rubber \\&quot;polishing cups\\&quot; inside of the bristles. The polishing cups inside the Colgate Total Advanced brush is a little smaller than the cups inside the Whole Mouth Clean brush, but that appears to be because the Total Advanced bush has more bristles, so there&#x27;s less room for larger polishing cups. Note that the \\&quot;polishing cups\\&quot; are actually just small rubber pieces nestled in-between the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads of both brushes are nice and full in size. And both brushes have a rubber textured back on the brush head, which cleans the cheeks and can be used for cleaning the tongue. One small difference is the Total Advanced brush also has a little bit of textured rubber on the side of the brush head which they call their wrap around cleaner. Where as the 360  Whole Mouth Clean brush does not. It just has the rubber on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the last difference I noticed is the handle of the Total Advanced brush looks to be just a tiny bit larger (wider) than that of the 360  Whole Mouth Clean brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the 360  Whole Mouth Clean and this 360 Total Advanced brushes are serious tooth brushes, having many more features than the average brush. And both are 5 star brushes and clean teeth really well. In the end which on comes out as the favorite will be personal preference. I like the 360 Whole Mouth Clean as my favorite, but the Total Advanced brush might be a more favored choice for many.like the 360 Whole Mouth Clean as my favorite, but the Total Advanced brush might be a more favored choice for many.</li>
    <li> best for cleaning just don&#x27;t grind it into your mouth let the brush do the work for you - if your gums bleed you are pressing too hard. - Mega bristles cleans entire tooth and gum at same time, and the Wraparound cheek and tongue cleaner does it&#x27;s thing too.  If you are looking for a quick mega clean before running out the store, this is for you - it is the fastest brushing ever due to the size of the brush. I mostly use the brushes for travel now and for when I don&#x27;t want the electric brush to wake the house. I will often use the soft bristle for adding a final polish after cleaning with the electric or medium toothbrush. The tip of the brush is raised to better clean the back teeth and between teeth. A nice thick handle for ease of holding. My family have used Colgate toothpaste and toothbrushes for almost 100 years. While I have always tried the newest product on the market I always find myself coming back to Colgate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Colgate: The Colgate® 360°® Total® Advanced Floss-Tip† Bristles toothbrush provides 4x deeper* reach for a healthier whole mouth clean.

    <li> I have a hard time getting into these fancy toothbrushes. Do all the bells and whistles actually do something real? I gave this one a shot and actually like it. The brushes envelop my teeth perfectly and clean them adequately. The tongue cleaner on the back is rather interesting. I&#x27;m a tongue cleaner, and I think this one works well for that. The only thing is that if you keep you brush on the counter (instead of in a cup), the tongue cleaner sits on the counter. Kinda nasty.</li>
    <li> This full headed toothbrush does a thorough job of cleaning the teeth and mouth. The bristles are definitely medium and those with sensitive teeth and gums should consider getting a soft brush. The handle is sturdy and easy to hold. The integrated tongue cleaner is convenient and effective. The full head looked intimidating, especially in comparison with the compact heads I&#x27;ve been using but it worked well. Colgate is a leader in oral hygiene and this toothbrush demonstrates why. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I brush my teeth for a single purpose - to get them clean. This Medium brush has what seems to me to be very stiff bristles. The cups are supposed to hold the toothpaste in better to help whiten and shine your teeth. The toothbrush feels awkward in my hand and in my mouth. I&#x27;m just not a fan of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other &amp;#34;tongue and cheek&amp;#34; scrapers on toothbrushes before, these aren&#x27;t any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a three - not my cup of tea (or my cleaning choice AFTER my cup of tea).</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush getting all the tight spots.  The head is a little bigger than what I am used to so I have to be careful and push to the back to get the last molars, once I get there, it doesn’t take much brushing to clean them.  The bristles are a little firmer than what I like so I have to slow down in my brushing – which is good because I can easily end up with receding gums for brushing my teeth too hard.  Deep cleaning, highly recommended for an adult, not for kids, nor people with sensitive teeth or gums.</li>
    <li> 360 is a great name for this product because it makes you aware that brushing your teeth really should be a full mouth brushing.  With this brush they give you the ability to brush your tongue as well as your gums.  The width of the brush head also gives nice coverage so you feel your getting a far better clean than with a traditional brush.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This brush head is huge and covers a lot of territory at one time, but for me it&#x27;s overkill, and uncomfortable to use. I have fairly small teeth, and not a lot of space inside my mouth. The brush is so big that it&#x27;s hard for me to brush vigorously in places where space is tight, especially in the back of my mouth. The back and sides of the brush head bang up against my cheek and gums. Sometimes it hurts, because the back side of the brush head has a rough surface meant for cleaning your cheeks and tongue. That&#x27;s what the &amp;#34;360&amp;#34; designation is all about. By the time I get my teeth clean, the inside of my cheeks hurt from all that rubbing. The claim is that you kill more bacteria in your mouth this way, but I can&#x27;t see how rubbing your cheeks raw gets rid of any significant amount of germs. I&#x27;ll stick with a smaller brush.</li>
    <li> All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  Although Colgate has a number of studies to validate the effectiveness of the brushes (see their website), I failed to find evidence of the American Dental Association seal of approval.  Perhaps it is too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.  Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes but I prefer powered ones for daily use.  I use the manual ones at work and when traveling.  Both clean equally well but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cultures promote tongue cleaning much more than do Americans so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  Tongue cleaning reportedly reduces bad breath and reduces bacteria known to contribute to periodontal problems, tooth decay, gum infection, gum recession, and tooth loss (Wikipedia). I have now added it to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the four designs from this line that I tried, you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Colgate has made big jump forward in brush design with this brush.  I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Total Advanced Full Head is my favorite of the line, I am too old to be using the medium head.  I gave it to my son to try and he liked the brush a lot but commented on the stiffness of the bristles.  He had no problems with the brush irritating his tongue, gums, or the sides of his mouth.th this brush.

    <li> The bristles are firm and cover the teeth well.  I especially like how the handle feels; there&#x27;s a slight bend to it so that it moves with the action, and the hand feels firm; no slippage.  The firmness of the bristles may be too hard for those with sensitive teeth, though.</li>
    <li> works great and bristles aren&#x27;t super hard</li>
    <li> Since I was going on vacation, I packed this instead of my Sonicare. (I have a problem with mold collecting in the area of the metal pin if I travel with it still damp). Now, I have not used a manual toothbrush in a few years so these medium bristles were a bit rougher than I expected. I did need to dispose of this after a single use. (My dentist advised against anything other than soft or extra soft ... to avoid abrading gums and destroying enamel ... I can now see why). However, I did like the tongue and cheek cleaner. Additionally, I liked the full head ... it gave a very clean feeling. I think this toothbrush would be perfect in a soft/extra-soft style.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, just dislike how you don&#x27;t get to pick the color you want though</li>
    <li> I like my bristles a little firmer so this brush worked very good for me.  I like the tongue and cheek cleaner built in and it really helps with the bad breath, along with using Biotene.  It has a nice feel along with a good size handle.  I feel my mouth is clean, and it works like a good toothbrush should.  I recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Spouse liked this toothbrush. Found the fit to be good, ergonomics solid and medium bristles a good compromise between scrubbing power and softness. And unlike other version, no bristles fell off during first use.</li>
    <li> The Colgate 360 advanced represents a new trend in toothbrushes to move toward including rubber flaps of some type in and among bristles.  This results in less bristles and not everyone will like this change.  The first few weeks of use, I could not get used to the feel and felt like my teeth were never really clean compared to traditional brushes with high bristle density.  Now, I can tolerate it.  However, I would rather have more bristles.  This brush does include an excellent tongue scrubber (not scraper) that can also be used to clean your gums and cheek as well as your tongue. In the end, whether you like this toothbrush or not will be a highly personal preference.</li>
    <li> I just began using my new Colgate 360 medium yesterday, and my mouth feels CLEAN!  This toothbrush is very comfortable and easy to hold, and has a soft little non-slip thumbgrip, which is very nice.  And as a vigorous brusher, I can say that the bristle pattern and the medium bristles leave my teeth, gums, and mouth feeling very very clean, but without any discomfort at all.  A+!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a nice handle that is easy to grip, medium bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums and a tongue and cheek cleaner that works.  It is also shaped nicely to allow for easy brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has surround bristles that clean both side of the teeth. For me this means the bristles are wide enough to cover all of a tooth. It also has a wrap around cleaner that cleans cheeks and my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a tooth brush I look for a few things. I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy. Finally, I like toothbrushes that have tongue cleaners because there are times when I eat something like chocolate or yogurt or drink tea or coffee and my tongue and even gums feel like they could use a cleaning.  This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking.  When I brush my teeth they feel clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few weeks and it does a really thorough job of cleaning my teeth and leaving my mouth feeling fresh. The bristles hug my teeth nicely without irritating my gums and the tongue cleaner is a plus. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m at travel or at work I need a brush that&#x27;s convenient to stash.  The handle on this brush is very easy to grip.  The head is really big. It seems like it takes less time to brush my teeth and the extra width helps me get my gums better. Because of the extra width I recommend a softer brush.</li>
