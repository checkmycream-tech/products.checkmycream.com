### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been using it for about three monthes now and are very happy with its cleaning power.  </li>
      <li>Yaaaayyyyyy free market!!!!</li>
      <li>Another reviewer for this great toothbrush alluded to the fact that if the Phillips Co. didn&#x27;t come up with a solution to this rip off</li>
      <li>And a really good way to dissuade customers from ever buying one of your proprietary systems again.</li>
      <li>Good luck with that.</li>
      <li>I love my intelliclean tooth brush, but why did the price of the replacement heads jump to $185!?  </li>
      <li>For the price they want for (2) replacement heads, I could almost buy another system, but not one I would like better than what I have!</li>
      <li>Well, now, they either aren&#x27;t available or I have to sell a kidney to buy them!!</li>
      <li>and I just love it!</li>
      <li>so we each have our own.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great and really does a great job.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Intelliclean 8000 series system - it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>even Ebay is charging $100 or more just for replacement heads.  </li>
      <li>We love our Intelliclean systems - yes plural.  </li>
      <li>I think it would have been much better if Amazon had just dropped offering this product with a disclaimer about it being discontinued by the manufacturer as the reason why.  </li>
      <li>Most companies when a product has been mfg discontinued will discount the product to get rid of it.</li>
      <li>The most important part - our mouths have never felt cleaner and we have the dental records (or rather lack of) to prove it!  </li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t understand why companies make good products like this and then take them off the market after you have invested so much in them.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use, easy to maintain, and easy to change toothpaste and brushes.  </li>
      <li>Well I have loved this Toothbrush for years and it seemed the only way to get my teenager with braces to keep her own teeth clean.  </li>
      <li>Put on securely</li>
      <li>It was a significant purchase.</li>
      <li>I find this very discouraging!!</li>
      <li>That is what I have been doing and having success.</li>
      <li>Time to buy a new toothbrush, the brush is not that good to pay that much just for two new heads.</li>
      <li>and Amazon is trying to get more out of the replacement heads than the actual toothbush cost to purchase.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to get them several times.</li>
      <li>I agree, My family has used their product since the first one came out and we upgraded as they improved.  </li>
      <li>Are you really there?    </li>
      <li>They really don&#x27;t want anyone to buy their product.</li>
      <li>If a company wants loyalty, they need to assure that reasonable support will be there throughout ownership.</li>
      <li>I bought the whole system for $35.00, a price reductioin from $129.00 because Philips had stopped making them.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this item many times from this site at a very reasonable price (less than $40.00).  </li>
      <li>Manual brushes don&#x27;t cut it and most other mechanical hurt her mouth or break the wires.  </li>
      <li>heads and toothpaste will continue to be available in the long run.    </li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m down to one, I thought I&#x27;d order more while I&#x27;m thinking of it.</li>
      <li>because one of their sellers has too high a reserve.  </li>
      <li>I love the Sonicare products, but would buy a new system for less than the toothbrushes offered here for $185.00.</li>
      <li>right now that&#x27;s only at $30.</li>
      <li>I could by a brand new unit for this price.  </li>
      <li>When everybody else buys a new system, (or is that your motive?)</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t a $2 toothbrush that i just toss and buy a new one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather buy a new system than pay this for replacement heads.  </li>
      <li>After buying the first one we bought a second</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to go back with Sonicare thanks to this little stunt by it&#x27;s makers, but really, this technology just isn&#x27;t found in most other tooth brushes.</li>
      <li>The only thing I can suggest is calling your dentist (if you bought yours through them-I did) and see if they can locate you some replacement heads at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Had I known they would discontinue this item in a few years, I certainly would not have invested in it in the first place.</li>
      <li>Anyone in their right mind would go out and purchase a newer model for half the price which is what I will probably do.</li>
      <li>Toothpaste and brush heads were generally available and then were being sold at a price that could only mean that the 8000 series was not working out for Sonicare.  </li>

<li> Apparently not.</li>

<li> My wife and I have been using the Intelliclean system for at least 2 years now - we were very early adopters.  </li>
<li> Amazon is crazy to charge $179 and has definitely turned me away from their site as a reasonable alternative to shopping at a store.</li>
<li> Find some other sucker to buy your toothbrush heads.</li>
<li> I am frustrated too since my wife and I both have these brushes and will never be able to afford heads for them again, but I choose to get angry at Phillips (Sonicare) and the jerks who are selling these heads at rates that would make ticket scalpers blush.  </li>
<li> Phillips does not manufacture the Intelliclean toothbrush anymore, therefore replacement parts (brush heads, paste, etc.) are hard to come by.  </li>
<li> I have purchased refills for my intelliclean at least 2, if not 3 times from Amazon 25.00- 30.00 for a 2 pak.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t blame Amazon, only the silly people who would pay $186!  </li>
<li> I think it is ridiculous that someone would try to gouge consumers on amazon though</li>
<li> If you want to see who&#x27;s charging this ridiculous rate, click on sellers, then if you have time you could give them a call and tell them what you think of their business practices.  </li>
<li> and I think that it is ridiculous and unreasonable.  </li>
<li> Toothpaste may seem expensive but one little tube lasts for a month brushing twice a day every day.  </li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t enough the economy is bad, (and I did lose my job after 31 years), and the gas prices have risen, NOW, one of things that did bring me comfort is gone too.  </li>
<li> But Alas... now I have to go looking again because Philips will no longer make or support this product.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed but not surprised when it didn&#x27;t take off.  </li>
<li> Wish I understood the mindset behind this??</li>
<li> , that is even worse.</li>
<li> (I bought mine approximately 2 years ago and paid a lot of money for it.)  </li>
<li> What&#x27;s wrong with these people??????????????</li>
<li> I guess because Sonicare no longer makes this model they have discontinued making replacement parts, which is wrong on the part of sonicare.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s like getting mad at e*a</li>
<li> I also am disappointed of Phillips Sonicare&#x27;s decision of obsolescence and not informing customers who registered their product with them of this situation.  </li>
<li> I dont know if that&#x27;s an amazon markup or the manufacturer, but it&#x27;s just stupid.</li>
<li> This is just disgusting!</li>
<li> That&#x27;s insane.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s outrageous!</li>
<li> I too am astonished by the outrageous mark-up on Sonicare IntelliClean replacement brushes.  </li>
<li> I think that it is a shame that this item is being offered at this outrageous price!  </li>
<li> Outrageous price for brush head refills!</li>

    <li> $215 for two toothbrush heads?  What a joke!  While this model may have been discontinued, there is no reason to price gouge.  Find some other sucker to buy your toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> I was looking for replacement brushes for my Sonicare.  I guess because Sonicare no longer makes this model they have discontinued making replacement parts, which is wrong on the part of sonicare.  I think it is ridiculous that someone would try to gouge consumers on amazon though, that is even worse.</li>
    <li> I love my intelliclean tooth brush, but why did the price of the replacement heads jump to $185!?  I will probably never buy another sonicare because of this.</li>
    <li> I have purchased refills for my intelliclean at least 2, if not 3 times from Amazon 25.00- 30.00 for a 2 pak. I thought it had to be a mistake when I saw 185.00..Apparently not.They really don&#x27;t want anyone to buy their product. This is just disgusting!</li>
    <li> Well I have loved this Toothbrush for years and it seemed the only way to get my teenager with braces to keep her own teeth clean.  Manual brushes don&#x27;t cut it and most other mechanical hurt her mouth or break the wires.  But Alas... now I have to go looking again because Philips will no longer make or support this product.  Really how hard is it to keep making replacement heads as long as they sell Philips!?  There is obvious demand... even Ebay is charging $100 or more just for replacement heads.  I don&#x27;t blame Amazon, only the silly people who would pay $186!  I really don&#x27;t want to go back with Sonicare thanks to this little stunt by it&#x27;s makers, but really, this technology just isn&#x27;t found in most other tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Phillips does not manufacture the Intelliclean toothbrush anymore, therefore replacement parts (brush heads, paste, etc.) are hard to come by.  I too, think $185 is ludicrous for a pack of replacement heads.  For that amount, you could buy a newer brush system!  I also am disappointed of Phillips Sonicare&#x27;s decision of obsolescence and not informing customers who registered their product with them of this situation.  (I bought mine approximately 2 years ago and paid a lot of money for it.)  The only thing I can suggest is calling your dentist (if you bought yours through them-I did) and see if they can locate you some replacement heads at a reasonable price.  That is what I have been doing and having success.</li>
    <li> Outrageous price for brush head refills! There&#x27;s a pack on *B*y right now that&#x27;s only at $30. Almost $200? That&#x27;s insane. Good luck with that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not only Amazon folks, it&#x27;s eBay, the web (just look at the \\&quot;Sonicare store,\\&quot;)  Target, etc.!! I&#x27;ve seen the range go from $60.00 to over 200.00!  Another reviewer for this great toothbrush alluded to the fact that if the Phillips Co. didn&#x27;t come up with a solution to this rip off they were through using their toothbrush systems.  I agree, My family has used their product since the first one came out and we upgraded as they improved.  Never were we \\&quot;forced\\&quot; into this type of gauging situation before.  I hope everyone takes the time to get in touch with sonicare and express their outrage!  I know I am!</li>
    <li> I have had my IntelliClean system for several years and I just love it! When they stopped selling the replacements in the store, I was so upset. Then I heard about Amazon.com and I was able to get them several times. Well, now, they either aren&#x27;t available or I have to sell a kidney to buy them!! For the price they want for (2) replacement heads, I could almost buy another system, but not one I would like better than what I have! It isn&#x27;t enough the economy is bad, (and I did lose my job after 31 years), and the gas prices have risen, NOW, one of things that did bring me comfort is gone too.  I just don&#x27;t understand why companies make good products like this and then take them off the market after you have invested so much in them. Had I known they would discontinue this item in a few years, I certainly would not have invested in it in the first place. What&#x27;s wrong with these people??????????????</li>
    <li> Amazon is just the site that displays this for the seller.  It&#x27;s like getting mad at e*a* because one of their sellers has too high a reserve.  I am frustrated too since my wife and I both have these brushes and will never be able to afford heads for them again, but I choose to get angry at Phillips (Sonicare) and the jerks who are selling these heads at rates that would make ticket scalpers blush.  If you want to see who&#x27;s charging this ridiculous rate, click on sellers, then if you have time you could give them a call and tell them what you think of their business practices.  You could even mention that you will NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN!  Yaaaayyyyyy free market!!!!</li>
    <li> I too am astonished by the outrageous mark-up on Sonicare IntelliClean replacement brushes.  I bought mine about 3 years ago, along with extra brushes.  Now that I&#x27;m down to one, I thought I&#x27;d order more while I&#x27;m thinking of it. Several months ago, my sister-in-law and her husband purchased the \\&quot;Oral-B Pro-Care, 5000 Series upon recommendation of their dentist.  They&#x27;ve been using it for about three monthes now and are very happy with its cleaning power.  So, I&#x27;m going to migrate to that system as soon as my Sonicare brush expires (6 months).</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00076ZPJI Philips Sonicare IntelliClean System Brush Head Refill (2-Pack)]]  I think that it is a shame that this item is being offered at this outrageous price!  I have purchased this item many times from this site at a very reasonable price (less than $40.00).  Now that this item has been discontinued by Philips Sonicare you have jacked the price up and I think that it is ridiculous and unreasonable.  I could by a brand new unit for this price.  If this is an example of your business practices you just lost a customer.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Sonicare Intelliclean toothbrush was discontinued mfg 2-years ago and Amazon is trying to get more out of the replacement heads than the actual toothbush cost to purchase.  I find this very discouraging!! Most companies when a product has been mfg discontinued will discount the product to get rid of it. Wish I understood the mindset behind this??</li>
    <li> The last time I replaced my Sonicare Intelliclean toothbrushes, I paid 29.95 for 2.  I would rather see them just \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; than the price gouging they are doing now. I bought the whole system for $35.00, a price reductioin from $129.00 because Philips had stopped making them.  I love the Sonicare products, but would buy a new system for less than the toothbrushes offered here for $185.00.</li>
    <li> I purchased these same brushes at the end of last year for about $25. Amazon is crazy to charge $179 and has definitely turned me away from their site as a reasonable alternative to shopping at a store. I think it would have been much better if Amazon had just dropped offering this product with a disclaimer about it being discontinued by the manufacturer as the reason why.  Anyone in their right mind would go out and purchase a newer model for half the price which is what I will probably do. Amazon just lost my business.</li>
    <li> I have done some research on this product. Sonicare has discontinued it about 2 month ago. Amazon is price gouging you. The regular price is 29.99 for a set of two brush heads. Do not buy these at this price.</li>
    <li> I have had this system for a couple of years. I think it&#x27;s great and really does a great job. I was finally out of head replacements and stopped here to order. But what they h*ll are they thinking charging $135 for two replacement heads? That&#x27;s outrageous! I dont know if that&#x27;s an amazon markup or the manufacturer, but it&#x27;s just stupid. And a really good way to dissuade customers from ever buying one of your proprietary systems again. If a company wants loyalty, they need to assure that reasonable support will be there throughout ownership. Or give me an inexpensive way to migrate to the newer system.    This wasn&#x27;t a $2 toothbrush that i just toss and buy a new one. It was a significant purchase. And one i will not make the mistake of repeating.</li>
    <li> My son purchased a Sonicare Intelliclean toothbrush a year ago.  We could not find the replacement heads HX 8100 so we called Sonicare.  They stopped making them 2 years ago.  We were advised by Philips to try Amazon or [...] to find the heads.  At over $25.00 for a (2) pack it is cheaper to buy a new version of an electric toothbrush as you can buy replacements for those for much less.</li>
    <li> Time to buy a new toothbrush, the brush is not that good to pay that much just for two new heads.</li>
    <li> there has to be some mistake, Amazon.  Are you really there?    I&#x27;d rather buy a new system than pay this for replacement heads.  When everybody else buys a new system, (or is that your motive?) what will you do with the leftover replacement heads?</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using the Intelliclean system for at least 2 years now - we were very early adopters.  I was disappointed but not surprised when it didn&#x27;t take off.  Toothpaste and brush heads were generally available and then were being sold at a price that could only mean that the 8000 series was not working out for Sonicare.  Hopefully brush heads and toothpaste will continue to be available in the long run.    We love our Intelliclean systems - yes plural.  After buying the first one we bought a second so we each have our own.  They are easy to use, easy to maintain, and easy to change toothpaste and brushes.  Toothpaste may seem expensive but one little tube lasts for a month brushing twice a day every day.  Put on securely I&#x27;ve never had a problem with leakage or clogging - neither has my wife.      The most important part - our mouths have never felt cleaner and we have the dental records (or rather lack of) to prove it!  I highly recommend the Intelliclean 8000 series system - it&#x27;s great!</li>
