    <li> Short black is plenty long enough.  These are now my favorite.  They look natural, and I don&#x27;t add mascara - they don&#x27;t need it if you want a natural look.  I just add a little brown to my bottom lashes, and it looks great.</li>

    <li> these lashes are so cheap but they dont look too bad..the problem is that they shipped me the wrong lenght !!!&lt;br /&gt;plus the packs come with no plastic on it so the pack on the top has all the lashes messed up.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes, easy to manage, I love the flare on them. And affordable.</li>
    <li> All where there none missing even tho kinda hard for some to pull off but overall for the price excellent.</li>

    <li> you cant beat the price, but they are flimsy and easy to pull apart. just use extra glue and its all good.</li>
    <li> I read previously reviews before ordering these.  They were all correct.  I have tried a number of lashes but from now on I won&#x27;t use any others!</li>
    <li> This product is horrible ! The quality is so bad and it looks cheap.. don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re looking for quality eyelashes...</li>
    <li> I have ordered these for years now.  They are not pre packaged but I like it that way. Much easier to remove than the ones in the store.</li>
    <li> Very hard to remove from container.  Do not stay on as well as other brands.  Price is right.</li>
    <li> they real cool. I have em on right now and i love the way they make me look lol</li>
    <li> Loveeee these lashes. Amazing price for so many packs! Will be buying again for myself and my clients! (:</li>
    <li> loveeeeeee it !!!!!! ima a make up artist and this has saved me a lot of $ i usally used ardell but these are way more affordable</li>
    <li> Great price and service!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very handy and precise. I love it. I would recommend it to anyone. I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> Perfect length, great price, arrives quickly!  I am completely satisfied and will be returning for future purchases.  I use false eyelashed daily and this is best deal yet.</li>
    <li> Purchased these (on my brothers account) and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier! The quality and price are excellent! I&#x27;m not purchasing from anywhere else in the future! so happy!</li>
    <li> i love these. i wear them everyday. my only tip before using them: take a blow dryer on them for a few seconds it softens up the glue. Trust me this saves on time and possibly breaking the lashes when taking them off of the package.</li>
    <li> I have been using individual lashes for 30+ years.  I have used several different manufacturers and these lashes are the easiest to remove from the package (the tip re hair dryer is great…but not too close :) Wish they would come out with the short double flare (great for inside and outside lashes…close to nose and temple).  When using Duralash and Ardell I have always had a lot of waste due to damage from the heavy glue that adheres them to the package.  These are much, much better and the price speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these lashes on more than one occasion. They are great. I just only wish that they had some extra shorts. I have tried other lashesthat are extra shorts but they don&#x27;t stand a chance against these lashes I&#x27;d rather use these short lashes than any other brand even if they did have  Extra short.packing is not the best but still will worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> The price is great but on occasion they get stuck in the tray and become too mangled to use.  All in all, they are worth the money it&#x27;s just a little annoying to ruin so many lashes.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Glad I purchased them. I have no issues with removing them from the tray. The knots aren&#x27;t too big.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with product and price.  Shipping was prompt and I would advise anyone buying them, great deal.</li>
