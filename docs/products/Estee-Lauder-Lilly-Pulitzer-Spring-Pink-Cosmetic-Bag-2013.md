<li> Thank you amazon, this bag looks really rich and expensive.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s small enough to be lightweight in my purse, but large enough to hold everything I need - small brush and comb, lip gloss, mascara, compact and some other odds and ends.  </li>
<li> I put just about all my products and even a few brushes in there</li>
<li> They were not listed as being included but I was not sure if I would receive them as well.</li>
<li> She loves it because it&#x27;s small, durable and of course it&#x27;s Lilly !</li>
<li> Not looking for another one anytime soon, and that is weird</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if its fake or not</li>

    <li> great price, fast ship, nice item</li>
    <li> I already knew what the bag looked like prior to ordering (I&#x27;d been fawning over the bag at the store, but I don&#x27;t wear Estee Lauder Makeup, so I couldn&#x27;t justify buying products that I did not need just for this gift.) I&#x27;m so happy to have found it online for such a great price! The shampoo/conditioner bottles were not included, however, but are pictured in one of the photos (this is fine with me, because I would not have used them anyway). They were not listed as being included but I was not sure if I would receive them as well. But again, that&#x27;s completely okay by me!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and its the perfect size for my daughter to keep in her sports duffel bag.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> Very stylish, love the pop of colors. Has enough room to carry the necessities without being too bulky. The bag is well-made.</li>
    <li> i use this for my makeup on the go, it is as described by the seller and sooo cute !...it holds a bunch of stuff btw, not too tiny at all !</li>
    <li> I was about to order a cosmetic case for $40.00 then I said I am going to go to Amazon and see what I see.  I found this inexpensive make up bag.  I dont carry tons of make up but the little I have fits great plus there is more room than I thought.</li>
