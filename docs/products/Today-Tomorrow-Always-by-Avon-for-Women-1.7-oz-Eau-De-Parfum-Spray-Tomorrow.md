    <li> this is one of the very few fragrances which \\&quot;stay\\&quot; with my Wife.  It is not overpowering, yet definitely is noticable.</li>
    <li> The perfume was exactly as I expected. It arrived earlier than I thought it would. It&#x27;s a perfume that had been bought before, but in a smaller volume, so this is definitely a step up. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This Parfum is one is my favorite, has a good price, is a great item and it smells fantastic.  Will definately by this again!</li>
    <li> I wear this everyday and have gotten so many compliments.  It&#x27;s a mild fragrance, not over powering.  I would recommend this to everyone!  Great buy, great price.</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever......</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sent! I would suggest it to anyone who likes a powdery woodsy fragrance. Somewhat a blend of sandalwood and flowers. Lovely.</li>
    <li> this smells amazing.  My boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A HONEYSUCKLE BOMB WAITING TO LITERALLY EXPLODE!!!!  THIS IS NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES THATS FOR SURE.  WHAT IS IT WITH AVON AND THE DAMN HONEYSUCKLE?????????

    <li> Very good!!! I love it</li>
    <li> My mother taught me that a woman is incompletely dressed without wearing cologne or perfume -- fine cologne and perfume. So for decades I chose my scents carefully and with little regard for cost.  To help a colleague who was supplementing her income by selling Avon products, I bought a bottle of Tomorrow. The first time I wore it, I received a compliment and compliments have arrived frequently during the ten years I have worn this cologne. The last one came a few days ago in the supermarket. I now rarely spray anything else on my neck and wrist.</li>
    <li> Such a great fragrance and it stays with you</li>
    <li> The perfume is worthy of being like a department store fragrance, and if I had to recommend and Avon fragrance to purchase, this one would make the cut. It is spicy  and like a warm sweater.</li>
    <li> have used avon scents for years...this one is tomorrow !</li>
    <li> I love this Avon perfume! I tried out a sample of this product that I received from an Avon Rep and right away I knew I had to buy a whole bottle.

    <li> Love this. Soft and suttle...Package was very well secure.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this perfume for years and will continue. Light, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, and scent lasts.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Lasts all day and has a slight vanilla scent to it. Kinda strong so a little goes a long way for me.</li>
