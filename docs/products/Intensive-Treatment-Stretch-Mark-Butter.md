<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is great stretch mark butter---thick, but doesnt feel sticky on your skin--it actually feels really lightweight.  a must have for any first time mommy-to-be!  also makes a great shower gift :)  while I still did get stretch marks, i feel like it did soften my skin and prevent them from being worse.</li>
    <li> Moist and thick, easy to use in winter, daily used for 4 months, no stretch mark found in my belly</li>
    <li> I love this butter.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of others and they are greasy or smell bad.  This one is beautiful and my skin doesn&#x27;t itch any more.  No stretch marks and I&#x27;m at the end of the jar.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and smell. Amazing thickness.</li>
    <li> I used this product at around 8 months of pregnancy. I used Mamma MIO tummy butter and stretch mark eraser for the first 8 months and NO STRETCH MARKS. The minute I decided to pay less and listen to retail stating that it was the \\&quot;best on the market\\&quot;, I switched and used it for a week. Within the first week, stretch marks started to appear on my hips and worsen. I immediately switched back and stopped the progression. This cream is too light, does not keep the skin moisturized, and it smells good at first and then very chemically. It also caused my skin to itch, especially my hands. I would NOT recommend this cream for people wanting to prevent stretch marks and definitely not for the treatment of them.</li>
    <li> Smell good but can&#x27;t feel the effect at all. I used it during pregency, but still have lots strech marks right now.</li>
    <li> Have used this throughout my entire pregnancy- at 34 week mark and not a single stretch mark! It feels amazing on my skin and smells fabulous!! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Used this for both my singleton and twin pregnancies - love the smell and the non-greasy silky texture.  Rubs in well and didn&#x27;t come off on clothes.  Used it twice a day with great results.  I know stretch marks are hereditary, but I survived with minimal skin damage I&#x27;d like to think it was because my skin was perfectly hydrated.  Smells like the spa...I&#x27;m almost out of my last jar and might keep using it postpartum.  Worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I received a Basq gift basket for my baby shower and I love it so much! It is something I would not have treated myself to, so I am glad my friend thought of something for the mom to be. I started using everything right away, but my favorite is the Basq stretch mark butter. It is so silky smooth, and smells delicious. I loved using it pregnant, and still use it afterwards, I just can&#x27;t stop. I am a mother of twins, and if I came thru a pregancy with NO stretch marks, I imagine you can too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this cream will actually work against stretch marks as I think you&#x27;ve either got the skin type that gets them or not, but I love the scent of this lotion and it feels really indulgent, and you may as well make the most of being pregnant.  It absorbs quickly and leaves you feeling moisturised all day and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it above any of the other stretchmark creams out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! So far so good! It&#x27;s may be a bit early to say my belly is soft. No complaint. Hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Gearing up for my wedding and trying to loose wait. The small stretch marks on my arms have visibly reduced so far. I also use the Basq Body Oil to help moisturize and tone everything as well!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream as a recommendation from a friend.  I have always used something different, but found that it wasn&#x27;t working as great as i would have liked.  I have been using the Basq Stretch Mark Butter for over 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m impressed!  I am 31 weeks pregnant with my second and can already feel a difference in my skins elasticity. I am using this product near hips and my husband commented on how soft my skin felt.  I also feel like my stretch marks aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable. I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars...yet.  I felt 2 weeks was too soon to rate a 5, but at this rate, it&#x27;s very close![[ASIN:B0037W6PJS basq skin care Advanced Stretch Mark Butter, 4 ounce Jar]]</li>
    <li> smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy. Seems to be working well!</li>
    <li> Love this butter. Used in last two pregnancies during and after and I highly recommend. I used twice a day and had no marks. Creamy light texture and beautiful smell.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I bought it for a friend and she is has been using it several months after her baby was born and she is very happy; her strecth marks are disappearing; she even wants a second one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few stretch mark products during my pregnancy and this is by far the best! The consistency is perfect, it smells nice and it&#x27;s not oily, it dries very quickly. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth and not sticky or oily. It also relieves itch. It has a nice soft smell that is not overpowering. I have been using this since the beginning of my 2nd trimester and am 35 weeks now.  So far no stretch marks. I know it&#x27;s more genetics than anything else, but I love the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd pregnancy and have used many balms in the past.  While I was happy with the natural balms from the past, They were VERY oily and ruined many blouses.  I LOVE how this sinks into my sink and does not mark fabric.  I also have NO itching.  The scent is light.  I&#x27;ve been very lucky to only have 1 stretch mark…could be part hereditary or balms?</li>
    <li> i use it for 6 months and even after my baby was born. i can seldom see any marks around my belly.</li>
    <li> The cream does not work as described. I used it twice during the day and night, however, I still get stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I was very worried about getting stretch marks because I got them going through puberty and I was pregnant with twins.  I used this cream during the day and the oil at night and I am happy to report I got NO stretch marks!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, my belly was itchy and this is the only cream that helped. I used it since I was 4 months pregnant and have little to no visible stretch marks. I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s been a great help!</li>
    <li> Look forward to putting it on every morning. Makes me feel so good! So far no stretch marks. I&#x27;m in my 31st week. Love it!</li>
    <li> Although it didnt keep me from getting stretch marks, it kept my belly and hips moisturized. The smell is pleasant and easy on the nose. I also like that it isnt messy or greasy like some creams and oils I tried. I am looking forward to seeing how it will help with the stretch marks after I have my baby.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  The real test will be after my baby is born.  As for now no stretch marks.  Smiles...</li>
    <li> The best stretch mark cream, The best stretch mark cream, my wife loves this and she does not have any stretch marks, I am a happy camper</li>
    <li> It minimizes the marks for sure but doesn&#x27;t rid them completely. My tiger stripes are on my thighs and buttocks so no pics from me. I guess I was hoping for a miracle cream but alas not yet.</li>
    <li> I bought Basq Citrus Sugar Body Polish，basq Intensive Treatment Stretch Mark Butter &amp; Basq Resilient Body Oil toghter，I think it is useful.</li>
    <li> No Stretch marks yet! I&#x27;ve been using this butter for about the last 6 months during my pregnancy and I am very pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I used this product every day when I was pregnant.  I have 2 kids and used it both times.  This product works wonders because even after 2 pregnancies, I have absolutely NO stretch marks!  I am a firm believer in this product and highly recommend this to ANY mom-to-be!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to use during my pregnancy and I&#x27;m only 4 months along so haven&#x27;t noticed any stretch marks. I started using it early to prevent any marks and so far it&#x27;s been great. The cream has a nice scent and goes on smooth. I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I regret not finding this cream sooner because it is amazing! I opted for cheaper creams with my first pregnancy and my skin definitely paid the price with all of the stretch marks I got. I decided to try this cream for my second pregnancy and I did not get even the slightest stretch mark anywhere on my body. I&#x27;m now on pregnancy #3 with this cream and haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks yet with this one either. The only downfall is that the container is pretty small for what you are paying so you&#x27;ll need to restock often.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. it works. thank you</li>
    <li> Not sure if it does much to prevent stretch marks - but its a nice rich cream.  I used some on my eyes, shockingly, and the results were fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Wish I would of known about this cream when I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
    <li> Ive tryed alot of different creams and ouls for my stretch marks, ive only used one whole jar of this product but i can honestly say i think itsaking a difference, i jus ordered my second jar. When you put it in it almost immediately reduces the redness in my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> The product description says all Basq products are tested for zero skin allergy. I used this for 3 days and I broke out in rashes</li>
    <li> This butter is great! I love the clean, fresh lavender smell and the feel of the product is nice too. It is not too greasy, but heavy enough to really moisturize.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for stretch marks - I&#x27;ve been using it since about 3-4 months pregnant and do not have any stretch marks to date (I&#x27;m now 2 weeks to being due).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> 32 weeks into my 3rd pregnancy and I have no new stretch marks.  The stretch marks that I got from my earlier pregnancies are also no longer pink at all and have faded to a shiny white.  I am hoping they will continue to fade while preventing new ones.</li>
    <li> I know that genetics has an influence on whether you get stretch marks but I think that taking care of yourself counts for something too.  I used this butter at least once a day, usually before bed or after a shower.  It wasn&#x27;t sticky, smell was pleasant and it was a treat for myself to use.  I bought a few to last throughout my pregnancy and gave it to my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came out with no stretchmarks and I had a 9 lb baby.  Started at 120 lbs and gained something like 30ish lbs.  My baby was over 2 weeks over due and gained significant weight quickly at the end,but my skin held up.  My stomach doesn&#x27;t look any different than before I had a baby and even the nurses at the hospital commented on how great my skin looked.  Like I said, maybe I was just blessed with good genes, my mother had four babies and no stretch marks, but I stand by this product.  I tried the cocoa butter stuff sold everywhere and hated it.  I would spend the money again no question.  Outstanding product with great reviews for a reason.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It has worked so well to reduce and repair my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I started to use it when I was 16 weeks pregnant at least 2 times a day, so one 4 ounce jar usually last for a month and a half.  Now I am 33 weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks at all. Love it, about to order another one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks at all. I have sensitive skin and this was great.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Been using it religiously,  but I have not seen any changes.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it said it was amazing!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use much of the butter after buying it</li>
    <li> Lovely. I realized how much it was good after i used different cream.</li>
    <li> I received a jar as a gift from a friend who swore by it during her pregnancy, and did not end up with any stretch marks.  I&#x27;m 28 weeks along now and I&#x27;ve been using it once daily since I started showing; so for at least two months consecutively (and on and off before that).  It absorbs quickly, is not greasy or sticky at all, soothes my itchy belly and leaves it nice and soft, and even though it is scented it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.  So far I have no stretch marks, but my mom never got them either so who knows if it&#x27;s genetic or the cream!  I probably won&#x27;t buy another jar just because it is pricey, and also because I got another brand of belly butter as a gift so I&#x27;m gonna try that before I spend any money.</li>
    <li> Pretty good.I love amazon.I love the freedom and democracy of the United States, I hate dictatorship of the Communist Party.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product religiously 2-3 times a day for a week and there is absolutely no change. It also has a very strong smell like Nair and I accidentally rubbed my eyes after getting some on my hands, and though I had rinsed my hands after applying the product, it still made my eyes burn. So far, I am not impressed, but if anything changes, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: I have been using this product religiously for over a month and there is some improvement, but not much more than would naturally happen during this time period.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m been using this product for 3months now. I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks. The cream smells good and is not greacy so you can put your clothes right after you do the product. I can recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Wished I had better results but I know everyone&#x27;s body responds differently. I have been using this product for about a month and have seen some fading in certain parts of my body and not so much it other parts. In all fairness, I didn&#x27;t start using this product immediately after delivery and I&#x27;m not able to always apply it 2x&#x27;s a day.</li>
    <li> This cream is great!  In my 9th month of pregnancy and have been using this 2x per day pretty much the whole time.  I have NO stretch marks, despite a bust that increased in size from a 32aa to a 32dd!  Soaks into the skin well, didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Seven and a half months along and no stretch marks so far! This stuff smells great and I use it religiously morning and night.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get 1 stretch mark :)</li>
    <li> I liked this cream while I was pregnant because it was thick and moisturizing. I don&#x27;t think it prevented stretch marks, per se. From what I understand, they are mostly genetic anyway, and very few products, if any, can prevent them. I still liked this cream for my skin and used it faithfully until my daughter was born. I hated the scent of Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter and the oiliness the cocoa butter left on my skin. This cream was much less oily and had a nice, herbal scent. It is a bit pricey for what it is, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot and I found it to be a little luxury I afforded my very pregnant self.</li>
    <li> This is well worth the money. I have used if for a little over a month and it has drasticly reduced my strech marks. The only down side to it I would have to say is the smell. I know, every says it smells great but I much rather have the smell of the Coco butter than this. Other then that I love this and will be buying it again once I run out.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended I use to dimish stretch marks - she used during pregnancy with twins and swears by it. I am a fan too! Im using this daily and exfoliate first; key is you have to use it regularly. Im really dedicated to keeping my skin looking good!! THe texture is light and whipped. Loving the light fresh aroma too!</li>
    <li> Great lotion, started using it since the beggining of my pregnancy and no marks so far. Its not greasy like other lotions I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.Duran, Chicago</li>
    <li> 28 weeks pregnant with twins and starting to get stretch marks.  The product has a strong smell so I immediately wash my hands after use. Iveused it daily since I was 8 weeks pregnant. It&#x27;s too expensive if it&#x27;s only going to be as good as a normal daily lotion. I recommend going with something less expensive.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and texture, it absorves fast leaving skin super soft. Im seven months within my first pregnancy with already 30 pounds gained, I have been using basq oil and cream since first trimester and so far no strech marks. I plan to keep using it after the baby.</li>
    <li> Great quality cream! Truly protects against stretch marks and minimizes the appearance of existing ones! The scent is amazing too! I will only be using this stretch mark cream from now on.</li>
    <li> Looooove this product during pregnancy.  Used it everyday.  Very thick and helps relieve itching.  Absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> I had a few stretch marks on the side of my belly at 20 weeks of pregnancy, I immediately started using the Advanced Stretch Mark Butter and the marks disappeared a few weeks later, I am 35 weeks now and so far no stretch marks,I will update this review after I give birth, so far very happy with this product, it worked like a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> Used this post op based on recommendation of a friend who used it throughout her pregnancy.  She loved it and so do I.  My Dr had warned I would have a thick, long scar and now I have a hair line.  My Dr and nurses are impressed with my results and recommending basq to their patients.  This really works - I am so happy with results.</li>
    <li> While this is targeted for stretch marks, it also works amazing for an everyday cream.  It&#x27;s THE best I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s got a rich texture without being too greasy or leaving a film on your skin.  Would highly recommend to anyone, adn great for the kiddos too!</li>
    <li> great cream! Not greasy at all. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks, not sure if it was the cream or just luck. It really helped with the itching too!</li>
    <li> I usually love this cream but this one came with small glass like pieces in the lotion. Every time I put it in it scratches my skin. Not happy at all</li>
    <li> This butter is more of a cream, but it does leave the skin feeling moisturized and more supple. The smell is different and hard to describe, but not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told that staying hydrated and luck are really the only two things that keep stretch marks away. I drank nearly a gallon of water a day when I was preggo. I used this day and night after the first trimester. No stretch marks. I did use their oil in conjunction...just mixed in a couple squirts. Either way...smells great and worked.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied I use this twice a day during pregnancy and no stretch marks highly recommend!!  Thank you very much driving comfortable to wear</li>
    <li> mom of 2 only left 4 feedback and all of them are for basq products clearly fake feedback. i havent bought this product buy im getting sick of these fake feedbacks by companies fluffing up there reviews when we count on eachothers real feedback to make purchases on here.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m not very consistent in my use of this product. I usually use it after each shower (so once a day) but sometimes I forget to use it. I&#x27;m a little over 4 months pregnant with my second child. I&#x27;ve gained faster in this pregnancy than with my first. With that said, I do not have stretch marks on my stomach so far, but I do have stretch marks on my hips/upper thighs. I&#x27;ve been using the stretch mark cream for several weeks. I rub the lotion all over both my stomach and hips. With my son I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my stomach but I did on my hips as well. I believe that the marks went away after I had him. So not really sure how much the lotion is helping and how much is just my body and genetics. The lotion does moisturize my skin very well and keeps me from getting itchy as my belly grows.</li>
    <li> Not  bed..... But not sure</li>
