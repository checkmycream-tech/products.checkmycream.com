<li> I usually take about an hour and a half or more to fall asleep...</li>
<li> Only thing is since using this I&#x27;ve gotten some strange dreams...</li>
<li> There is so little scent of lavender in this bottle that at first I sprayed twice, but ended up with a soggy pillow and still very little scent.  </li>
<li> It only takes a few minutes before my body starts to relax...</li>
<li> This spray smells extremely floral, just not like lavender.  </li>
<li> Not exactly what I anticipated.  </li>
<li> I was just in Napa Valley and purchased some lavender soap and other lavender products</li>
<li> It helps to comfort and go to sleep, especially if you are having a hard time.</li>
<li> My son has recently had a hard time falling asleep at nap time,  </li>
<li> Definitely not worth the money</li>
<li> Wears off after about ten minutes, but after a few days your pillow has a faint constant smell of the spray.</li>
<li> though this will help if you have trouble sleeping!</li>
<li> It smells like perfume, and the floweriness is very heavy and concentrated.</li>
<li> Slow shipping</li>
<li> Unless I&#x27;m blind.</li>
<li> My husband thought I was crazy.......</li>
<li> I wonder if they added the chamomile for cost cutting reasons, or because the tea is associated with sleep.  </li>
<li> Too bad.</li>
<li> very sorry i bought two bottles!  </li>
<li> Simply awful.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s awful!</li>

    <li> great SCENT! I spray it on my pillow before going to bed... very pleasing and calming scent! and great price for as much as you get!</li>
    <li> Wears off after about ten minutes, but after a few days your pillow has a faint constant smell of the spray. I love it. Super relaxing and calming.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I anticipated.  I had a different reaction at the hotel that provides a sample mist  for their customers.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, even though the smell doesn&#x27;t last much, but loved it anyways!</li>
    <li> Great product; great seller, great price</li>
    <li> Fast service and delivery. It helps to comfort and go to sleep, especially if you are having a hard time.</li>
    <li> Broken top but didn&#x27;t return as will use as possible and then not purchase again. Would not buy again. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Gosh, when I spray this, it makes me take a deep breath thus I get relaxed, love it.....also like the lavender vainilla scent.</li>
    <li> There is so little scent of lavender in this bottle that at first I sprayed twice, but ended up with a soggy pillow and still very little scent.  Definitely not worth the money and I will not be ordering again.  If I can figure out how to remove the top, I will add a small bottle of lavender scent essential oils to continue using this spray.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all-time favorite scents from B&amp;BW. Neither the lavender or chamomile is overpowering. They combine to make a soothing scent that is calming and helps me to unwind. I started with the lotion and had to get this pillow spray. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Try it you will like it</li>
    <li> This has really worked for me.It does help me go to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;I think u wll like it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help you fall asleep.</li>
    <li> smells amazing every time i goto bed, allows me to rest well and peaceful. wish the bottle was larger but still works great</li>
    <li> I use this every night before I go to bed to help me relax. It not only makes the bed smell nice, but the room smell nice too. It only takes a few minutes before my body starts to relax... my mind, well that takes a while longer, but it helps. :D</li>
    <li> Was delivered on time, exactly as described.  Do you want a good relaxing sleep without the use of prescription pills?  Buy this pillow mist, just a bit will do the job of relaxing you and letting you settle in to a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> I got this to help me sleep.  I spray it on my pillow about 15 minutes before I go to bed.  I fall asleep fast.  My husband thought I was crazy.......but after he just smelled it on my pillow and he had a good nights sleep, he doesn&#x27;t think I&#x27;m crazy anymore.</li>
    <li> I wanted a lavender spray to help me sleep.  This spray smells extremely floral, just not like lavender.  It smells like perfume, and the floweriness is very heavy and concentrated. I think it&#x27;s a mistake to mix the lavender with chamomile. Lots of research has been done showing lavender helps you sleep, but not so for chamomile unless maybe you&#x27;re talking about the tea.  I wonder if they added the chamomile for cost cutting reasons, or because the tea is associated with sleep.  In any case, this spray just does not smell like lavender.  While I love the smell of lavender, this smells totally different, and I dislike this scent so much that I cannot use it.</li>
    <li> I love this spray! Puts me right to  sleep!</li>
    <li> My son has recently had a hard time falling asleep at nap time,  so I thought I would try this product.  We have only had it for three days, and I have used it for him at nap time and bedtime, and I swear he falls asleep within 5 minutes! It smells so great that I spray it all over my linens as well!</li>
    <li> Turns out I&#x27;m very allergic to lavender and it caused my eyes to become all puffy.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; service!</li>
    <li> I just love the soothing smell.  It is so relaxing!</li>
    <li> wonderful for aromatherapy use! Beautiful relaxing fragrance. Combine with body wash and lotion before bed time then mist your pillow... then SLEEP!</li>
    <li> It does improve my sleep!</li>
    <li> Good item. Slow shipping</li>
    <li> Way too overpowering for aromatherapy - i use it as a garbage can spray now....very sorry i bought two bottles!  UG!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE LAVENDER/CHAMOMILE PRODUCTS AND LOVE ALL OF THEM, EVEN THO I CANNOT FIND THE 3-WICK CANDLE ANYMORE, AND IT WAS...&amp;#34;THE VERY BEST&amp;#34;......I DECIDED TO ORDER THESE PRODUCTS FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, FOR CHRISTMAS....THEY LOVE THEM ALSO!!!</li>
    <li> I could not be bothered to go to the mall to purchase because I always! always purchase more than I should. So perfect if you do not have a coupon from Bath and Body Works.</li>
    <li> Nice lavender smell.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on pillows and sheets before bedtime.</li>
    <li> Very soothing on our pillows.  Also calms my doxie during storms.  A One.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like lavender to me. It smells like cheap perfume.  I was just in Napa Valley and purchased some lavender soap and other lavender products this does not smell anything like those.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Helps lull me to sleep with soothing fragrance!</li>
    <li> This was very perfumey. It smelled like a hotel lobby full of old ladies. I tried to give it away, but no one wanted it.</li>
    <li> I love smell of Lavender and Chamomile and I&#x27;m Stuck on it too!! Thank So Much for sending so Fast!!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like chamomile or lavender! It&#x27;s awful! It smells like cheap bathroom cologne. Makes me nauseous! I threw it out immediately!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this stuff in the store anymore. Unless I&#x27;m blind. But this stuff helps me so much I love it. I just wish the smell last longer.</li>
    <li> I usually take about an hour and a half or more to fall asleep...I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 nights now and every time I use this I fall asleep within 10 minutes and sleep great through the night. Smells great as well! Only thing is since using this I&#x27;ve gotten some strange dreams...vivid dreams but that&#x27;s not really a bad thing as it makes it interesting lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly though this will help if you have trouble sleeping!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this pillow mist and will probably always buy it.  I spray a soft mist on my pillows at night and love crawling into bed - into absolute heaven.</li>
