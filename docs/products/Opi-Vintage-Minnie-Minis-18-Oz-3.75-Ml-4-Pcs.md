<li> The formula on these is a little thin</li>
<li> so nothing is broken ^^</li>

    <li> I love these colors especially being a Disney fan.  It is great to have the small size so I don&#x27;t have to commit to large bottles.  It is also great if you want to travel with multiple colors.</li>
    <li> They were super..  Thank you..</li>
    <li> everything was perfect , the color , and price !</li>
    <li> This is the only mini set I&#x27;ve ever gotten that I actually liked all the colors!  Packaging was adorable, too.</li>
    <li> I love it, it was exactly what I wanted.  Great service too.</li>
    <li> Gift for my granddaughter. She LOVED it. The small bottles are much more practical; I&#x27;ve never used up a bottle of polish before it became a gloppy mess or I simply tire of the color.</li>
    <li> Was happy to find this product on amazon. I bought it as a gift for my sister in law. The packaging is cute and the colors look great. Giving four stars because I think for the price it should be 4 bottles of colored polish and not just 3 colors and one topcoat.</li>
    <li> After a lot of trial and error, I decided to just stick with OPI nail polish and nail care products because they work the best for me and are far better than what is being manufactured by the competition. However, OPI isn&#x27;t a cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;That said, this set offers value for a reasonable price. I had 20% knocked off at the store when I bought this so for under $9 including tax I got four mini/Minnie bottles of polish from the Minnie Mouse collection. Being inspired by Minnie, these are all vibrant pink girly shades that are especially cool for summer.&lt;br /&gt;The polish goes on easily. The brush is small, but the polish is of average consistency for a OPI polish. Two coats are adequate for complete non-streaky coverage. My only suggestion is to use a base coat and top coat to extend the life of your manicure and to prevent chipping or breakage.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of using this OPI mini set is that it is an economical way to test out colors that you may or may not like. These are also really great to use on little girls. My granddaughter loves these colors.</li>
    <li> Colors even better than expected! From the chic Color of Minnie, to the slightly sheer &amp; sparkly I&#x27;m All Ears- a very happy little collection!</li>
    <li> very cute colors and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the colors are lovely. Easy to use nailpolish OPI is amazing and has never let me down. This would make a great present for any gilr or woman or would be a nice treat for yourself.</li>

    <li> i love all the colors that comes with the Minnie Mouse nail polish set. I recommened people out there if there a big fan of Minnie Mouse to buy it u won;t regrett it. I say this is worth every penny i spent on it. and i enjoyed the colors.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish, I have been a disney fan for 24 years. I love this nail polish, fast shipping, product even better than stated. I get a lot of compliments and love this seller, and will always continue to refer this person.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI mini sets as it&#x27;s difficult to finish a full sized bottle. This is a great way to try some fun colors that I don&#x27;t want badly enough to buy full sized. The brush is decent for such a small bottle. The formula on these is a little thin but it varies I know. 2 coats and you&#x27;re good to go. I was happy with the price and shipping I received from the seller.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I thought it would be, I am never disappointed with OPI products.  Once again they hit it out of the park. I ordered the Minnie Minis and got them the next day! I would buy from this seller again, and recommend them to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I loved the OPI Vintage Mini Collection! I recently went to Disney World and this is a perfect reminder of my trip. The pink \\&quot;If you Moust You Moust\\&quot; was the most brillant bright pink everyone loved it.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I was expecting!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and the polish was wrap in bubble wrap so nothing is broken ^^</li>
    <li> I really like the light pink nail polish against my fair skin. All of the color are great though. I noticed the red chips more easily than the other colors for some reason.</li>

    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you prefer the pink and red colors in nail polish, you will love the Vintage Minnie Minis.  I bought the set for myself but I also think it would make a great gift for any girl or woman, of any age, because the packaging is adorable and the colors are so pretty. It is really nice to have a nail-polish set that I will use all of the colors in, because in so many of the sets I like some colors but the others I just wouldn&#x27;t wear and don&#x27;t know anyone who would.  In the \\&quot;Vintage Minnie Minis\\&quot; I will be able to use ALL of the colors.  And I received my order in record time!</li>
    <li> Gave this to a Disney loving friend of mine. She loved it. The quality of OPI mixed with Disney &#x3D; Winner.</li>
