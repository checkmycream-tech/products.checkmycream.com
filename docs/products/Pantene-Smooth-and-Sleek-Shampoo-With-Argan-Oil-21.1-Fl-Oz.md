<li> I just read the other review of this product and wondered if we were talking about the same shampoo!  </li>
<li> If you have very dry hair, this might work for you.</li>
<li> As someone with thick curly hair, I love argan products but they can be really expensive.</li>
<li> No other product has ever worked so well for my thick, dry hair like Pantene.</li>
<li> I am not sure other people&#x27;s experience</li>
<li> No more frizz, no more dry ends.  </li>
<li> I have thick somewhat dry hair and the argan oil works wonders on taming it!  </li>
<li> i have thick and wavy hair..</li>
<li> my hair is usually frizzy!</li>
<li> I hated this stuff and regretted buying a giant bottle of it.  </li>
<li> This is a horrible product, you should definitely avoid it.</li>
<li> This is hands down the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> dirty--</li>
<li> My skin is oily anyway and this product is breaking me out and my hair is now dirty and lifeless.  </li>
<li> I ended up having to shampoo my hair with dish soap, it was so bad.</li>
<li> I will never buy this crap again.</li>

    <li> love it does what i need for my hair</li>
    <li> This is hands down the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. The silicone and oil in the shampoo stick to your hair and make it look dirty-- I switched to this shampoo and couldn&#x27;t figure out why my hair was suddenly dirty all the time, no matter how many times I washed it. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used before. I shampooed twice with a clarifying shampoo to get the residue out, and that only made the buildup partially go away-- I ended up having to shampoo my hair with dish soap, it was so bad. This is a horrible product, you should definitely avoid it.</li>
    <li> I just read the other review of this product and wondered if we were talking about the same shampoo!  I have thick somewhat dry hair and the argan oil works wonders on taming it!  No more frizz, no more dry ends.  I also use the condition and the leave in moisturizing product.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> I love the texture and scent!  Lathers up nicely and rinsed out well.  Good for my long, thick, curly hair!  Great price.</li>
    <li> This arrived super fast and packaged very well. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for years and I love them both. My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I hated this stuff and regretted buying a giant bottle of it.  It left tons of residue on my roots and didn&#x27;t really clean it, just left it more greasy, dull and flat.

I will never buy this crap again.</li>
    <li> The scent of this is just amazing! A must if your wanting to switch or if you love the brand this is a must!</li>
    <li> I keep going back to this product.  I&#x27;ve tried everything for my frizzy wavy hair, but nothing works better than this.</li>
    <li> No other product has ever worked so well for my thick, dry hair like Pantene. Absolutely love the weightless moisture and shine. Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and the matching conditioner really help with my frizzy hair. I live in the South where it is humid all the time. I love this product and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. I have long hair and it&#x27;s silky soft</li>
    <li> I bought this product from target! i have thick and wavy hair.. my hair is usually frizzy! i started this product and I could see the difference right away.. my hair looks smooth and shiny. I get a lot of complements about my hair since I started using this product! I am not sure other people&#x27;s experience but I am defiantly continue using it! it is worth to try it!</li>
    <li> Like using this for hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a Target (not from this vendor) and i have long straight caucasian hair.  My skin is oily anyway and this product is breaking me out and my hair is now dirty and lifeless.  If you have very dry hair, this might work for you.</li>
    <li> Wow keeps my hair nice and soft. You can tell the difference with this.</li>
    <li> Pantene was nice enough to send me some samples of this (and the conditioner).  I am amazed at the results.  Now this is the only product for me and the only one I buy.  I have normal to sometimes dry hair depending on the  weather and what I do to my hair.  Like the name my hair is definitely more smooth and sleek, I love the feel of my hair.  Thanks Pantene for a great product!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My hair has very frizzy dead ends and just all my hair was not in the best shape but since I&#x27;ve been using this, my hair is outstandingly smooth, soft, shiny and frizz-free! It may not be for everyone but it&#x27;s for me!! This conditioner works amazing on my hair! I&#x27;m complemted all the time on how shiny and soft my hair is! I recommend this 100%.</li>
