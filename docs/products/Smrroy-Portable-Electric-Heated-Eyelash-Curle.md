<li> Pretty hard to apply if you can&#x27;t read Japanese Lol&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
<li> A bit hard to get use to at first</li>
<li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking they were actual temporary tattoos, and I&#x27;m no good at stickers.</li>
<li> Ok there where problems at first with these like i have insanely moist eyes and they would fall off</li>
<li> You just cut them out, lay on your eye lid, and use a wet Qtip to wet it</li>
<li> the edges curl up right away and look weird.</li>
<li> Last longer than I thought they would..a little tricky to put on, but once you get the hang of it, no problem!  </li>
<li> If I can figure them out I will be shopping for other types.</li>
<li> Other</li>
<li> Actually, they hardly stick on at all.</li>
<li> Hard to cut them all out close enough to the black</li>
<li> so that way you can get it all the way down to your lash line.</li>
<li> so I dulled them up with some black shadow.</li>
<li> Yes they are shiny but just put some black eye shadow on</li>
<li> I thought they would be a little longer,they also get stuck together when peeling off of the paper.</li>
<li> when I received this product I was not impressed, I have problems applying the stickers to my eyes, it does not seem to fit properly and it feels very uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Dont waste your money.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> I really thought these were so silly and ridiculous</li>
<li> These are not easy to apply.</li>
<li> It was too small and didn&#x27;t follow the shape of my eyes.</li>
<li> These are too small for my eyes.</li>
<li> really small.</li>
<li> But, that was my bad for not reading the entire description.</li>
<li> Not very impressed,  won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
<li> very thick, and don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
<li> Move carefully with some warmth as the eye is a tender area :(  </li>
<li> Waste of money.  :(</li>
<li> Useless, wouldn&#x27;t stick at all.</li>
<li> was not impressed at all.</li>
<li> NOT self adhesive like the ad said :(</li>
<li> I have this annoying habit of rubbing my eyes just as I walk out</li>
<li> These are practically impossible to remove without oil or something!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Terrible.</li>
<li> Plus they don&#x27;t feel disgusting on your eyes which is a bonus.</li>

    <li> These are small, and they don&#x27;t stick on very strongly. Actually, they hardly stick on at all. But, this didn&#x27;t really matter for my purposes, seeing as I just wanted the outline of them to draw a winged eyeliner stencil on an index card.</li>
    <li> They were fun! I wish there were more to a pack and don&#x27;t know if I used them right the directions were in Chinese! UGH !!</li>
    <li> These are not easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The best way is the old fashion way.  The seller shipped product as promised.  No problem there, it is just I do not like these.  Waste of money.  :(</li>
    <li> not what I wanted. very thick, and don&#x27;t stay on. the edges curl up right away and look weird.</li>
    <li> These were dissapointing because they are not what I thought from the description- they are like temp tattoos that you have to cut &amp; somehow put on your eyelids... NOT self adhesive like the ad said :( boo boo...</li>
    <li> came too late for me to use... cute for halloween</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I thought they were silly and interesting. They were so cheap I decided to order a set and if I didn&#x27;t like them then I could let my daughters play with them. But they work. They are a bit more shinier than I like so I dulled them up with some black shadow. I have this annoying habit of rubbing my eyes just as I walk out they door so I always have to carry liner with me so I can touch up in the car. I rubbed these and they stayed....for 3 days. As it started to fade I took a hot shower to help loosen them, then rubbed a little lotion on my eyes with a cotton ball to remove. I really thought these were so silly and ridiculous but I am so happy I gave them a try. I love them. I plan to order more for myself, sisters and friends. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I must say i bought a pair of these, looks wounderfully beautiful on me......now i must admit , that if ur sweating/ the corner part tends to not stay in place....But it did gave me a whole differ look. As a matter of fact im now ordering 2 more packs, and i cant weight. Thnks to the maker of this product.</li>
    <li> These are too small for my eyes. I thought they would be a little longer,they also get stuck together when peeling off of the paper. Happy I didn&#x27;t spend much on these.</li>
    <li> Last longer than I thought they would..a little tricky to put on, but once you get the hang of it, no problem!  Fun different look for a night out!</li>
    <li> I love these for when I&#x27;m on the go and they are totally affordable and very nice. A bit hard to get use to at first but I figured it out. Plus they don&#x27;t feel disgusting on your eyes which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> when I received this product I was not impressed, I have problems applying the stickers to my eyes, it does not seem to fit properly and it feels very uncomfortable. was not impressed at all.</li>

    <li> Super hard to get on but super fun when they&#x27;re on!</li>
    <li> Terrible. Dont waste your money. They dont stay at all. Cheap for a reason.</li>
    <li> its &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. it&#x27;s a sticker, not a tattoo</li>
    <li> Hard to cut them all out close enough to the black so that way you can get it all the way down to your lash line.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed,  won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> They dont work on the eye lids.</li>
    <li> Ok there where problems at first with these like i have insanely moist eyes and they would fall off so i tried to use eyelash glue to keep it secured. And also they started in the middle of my eye so i took an angled eyeliner brush and drew a skinny line from the starting point of my eye to where the sticker begins.  Other then that i love them.</li>
    <li> Not super easy to apply</li>
    <li> Pretty hard to apply if you can&#x27;t read Japanese Lol&lt;br /&gt;Good news is they shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking they were actual temporary tattoos, and I&#x27;m no good at stickers. But, that was my bad for not reading the entire description.</li>
    <li> Good, but it may make up the display for the truth, but a great experience and you need a bit of adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> These were easy to apply if a little time consuming. It&#x27;d probably be easier to learn how to use liquid liner! Oh well.. my only mistake was that I did not bring a remover with me on my trip... These are practically impossible to remove without oil or something! Move carefully with some warmth as the eye is a tender area :(  Worth it! Loved these :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this. It was too small and didn&#x27;t follow the shape of my eyes. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it would stay on anyways.</li>
    <li> Useless, wouldn&#x27;t stick at all. The edges crumpled really easy. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Ad is misleading. These are not temp tattoos, they are plastic stickers that dont stay on.Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> really small. they are easy transfers in a very black color but they would probably only fit on an asian or an 8 year old</li>
    <li> Amazing to use. Cut close and even them up as much as possible. Removed mine with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> o.k.  not spectacular  but nice</li>
    <li> These are great! I don&#x27;t know what people are complaining about. They take seconds to do. These are very easy to use. You just cut them out, lay on your eye lid, and use a wet Qtip to wet it and they are done almost instantly. Yes they are shiny but just put some black eye shadow on and they are perfect for every day use. They wash off easy in the shower it you actually wash your face they won&#x27;t last for days they last for A day. I love them and will most definitely be ordering again :)</li>
