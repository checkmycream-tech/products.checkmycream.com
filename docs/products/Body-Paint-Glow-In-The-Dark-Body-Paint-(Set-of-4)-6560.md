      <li>It was more like a gel(or finger paint consistency) than it was a paint</li>
      <li>I had this really cool idea/design in mind for the paint, but it did not even glow on our skin!</li>
      <li>would probs buy another kind even tho thanks anyways</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t show up in the light-</li>
      <li>Then take it away from under the light and then off the lights see if it will glow then.</li>
      <li>But people if it doesn&#x27;t glow then stick it under a light so it can charge.</li>
      <li>The product was not bad.</li>
      <li>Im actually super dissapointed with these stuff.</li>
      <li>It is a product easily found in Adult stores.</li>
      <li>And they don&#x27;t glow very much.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much,   Liza</li>
      <li>Would love to have my money back</li>
      <li>make sure you display images of the ACTUAL product and not stock photos from goodness knows where.</li>
      <li>It glowed but not as much as I thought id would!</li>
      <li>These are beautiful colors and they do glow in the dark, but they DO NOT DRY ONTO YOUR SKIN.</li>
      <li>It did not glow under the light, and it would only glow if one had a black light so close it was touching the body.</li>
      <li>But the colors that are sent do like up nicely in the dark.</li>
      <li>Okay, I bought this product for my sister because she likes black lights and glow in the dark stuff, and the product photos displayed looked fairly innocent, and the description makes it sound like it&#x27;s meant for raves.</li>
      <li>it only appears as a very transparent light color.</li>
      <li>If you look in the second photo (smiley face) there is a UV light or something used.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a concert for a group of friends and the paint didnt really glow.  </li>
      <li>I used the paint to do a photoshoot and it worked really well for what I was attempting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i have the pest from this colection really,, thanks seler</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does glow though, pretty cool actually.</li>
      <li>The glow in the dark body paint was good, I did not like that it did not really dry</li>
      <li>No matter how long I sit next to a bright light, they will not glow in a dark room.</li>
      <li>Packaging is overly sexual we used it for a high school glow in the dark volleyball fundraiser.</li>
      <li>Not as vibrant as I thought they would be.  </li>
      <li>Once they are on the skin they completely disappear so you cant really tell were you painted and were</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t glow more than a few minutes once applied.</li>
      <li>the middle of the night you can bring an exciting new twist to those special moments with our new and improved glow in the dark ADULT body paints\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>First off, I was expecting something completely different from the photos here and the description.</li>
      <li>The product was shipped to me very quickly which I appreciated, however the product hardly worked.</li>
      <li>These actually show up brightly in black light!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big facepainter, and the only thing these are good for is a little shine and sparkle over other colors.   </li>
      <li>the package design makes it very obvious that this is meant for adult activities.</li>
      <li>you could barely see it glow in the blacklight.</li>
      <li>I should have expected from body paint that came in a rather risky packaging (Bikini girl) that it was not going to be high quality.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think they were really glowing in the dark.</li>

<li> and I don&#x27;t think they were really glowing in the dark.</li>
<li> They were poor quality and were not user friendly.</li>
<li> There were four 1oz tubes and the consistences was very watery and did not stay on very well also was applied very thin.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re going to sell a product, for crying out loud</li>
<li> Also it only comes in blue, orange, yellow, and green, which is shown in one photo.</li>
<li> This is highly sexual packaging, and a very small quantity of gooey thick stuff (not really paint).  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry, doesn&#x27;t glow, stains clothing.</li>
<li> Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange.   </li>
<li> I was kind disappointed as it didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would.  </li>
<li> So i tried to find glow in the dark body paint and thought i was getting six different colors in decent sized bottles but got four which hardly glow in little bottles...</li>
<li> In fact, the little product blurb on the back specifically says it: \\&quot;In</li>
<li> originally bought this body paint to wear to a show, turns out it doesn&#x27;t even glow in the dark and is very thin in consistency</li>
<li> Did not glow like I expected</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t glow as expected.</li>
<li> They are thin and watery and don&#x27;t stick to brushes or skin very well.  </li>
<li> Some of the other product photos seem to be blacklight.</li>
<li> You only receive four small containers.  </li>
<li> Painted all over myself for a concert, went to check it out in the dark and...</li>
<li> but it glowed in the dark like it said.</li>
<li> This paint does not glow in the dark at all.</li>
<li> I bought this for face paint for a glow in the dark party.  </li>
<li> The paint does not glow at all in the dark.</li>
<li> I was going to paint faces for Relay for Life, but I should have just donated the money I spent on this gooey, no glow junk!!</li>
<li> /&gt;It arrived in a package that looked like it had been stepped on and one of the bottles was half opened and spilled a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> About the only thing you could do is pour them on yourself, but they have this ridiculous oily sheen that reflects your skin underneath and makes you look like you&#x27;re sweating all the time.  </li>
<li> Its a slimy oily mess.</li>
<li> /&gt;There are only FOUR that come in this arrangement, the picture is not a good indication.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not worth the purchase!</li>
<li> How am I supposed to give something like this to my little sister?</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> a waste of money.</li>
<li> Does not glow, is not paint, waste of money.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> These paints did not glow and were not easy to apply.</li>
<li> The paints that came were very small and don&#x27;t be confused, there are only four colors.</li>
<li> Its a small package with very little paint in each container and the paint doesn&#x27;t glow all that well.</li>
<li> This is a terrible product - first off, mine did not glow - first fail.  </li>
<li> you didn&#x27;t - fail all around - don&#x27;t buy these pick a different manufacturer.</li>
<li> There is not much more I can say than that.</li>
<li> Another disappointing thing is that they almost never dry.</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s hard not to wipe it off yourself accidentally.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to make it visible on your body.</li>
<li> It was hard to put on and did not work well.</li>
<li> so I can at least donate that to the cancer cure foundation.</li>
<li> did not like it in the least.</li>
<li> It went on thick -</li>
<li> You must apply it in a thick layer to glow.</li>
<li> just disappointed the jars weren&#x27;t a little larger.</li>
<li> These paints were really thin in texture, so very little coverage.</li>
<li> This company is not a good company they lied to me over the phone</li>
<li> Didnt glow and was extremely hard to get off!</li>
<li> ...was very dull</li>
<li> and when i called the company to see if i could get a refund they said that they had never gotten an com plait before and that i must ofve done somthing wrong and by their reviews this is obviously not true   i would never buy this item again or anything from this company!!!</li>

    <li> I like it. But people if it doesn&#x27;t glow then stick it under a light so it can charge. Then take it away from under the light and then off the lights see if it will glow then.🐒🐒🐒</li>
    <li> originally bought this body paint to wear to a show, turns out it doesn&#x27;t even glow in the dark and is very thin in consistency so it&#x27;s hard to make it visible on your body. would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Im actually super dissapointed with these stuff.Despite the fact that it is NOTHING like the picture, more like just 4 oz or something, it&#x27;s infact completely useless.It&#x27;s not even paint, it&#x27;s just bottled neon-colored goo.Waste of money.Blahh.It doesn&#x27;t even glow darnit.</li>
    <li> First off, I was expecting something completely different from the photos here and the description. The paints that came were very small and don&#x27;t be confused, there are only four colors. And they are not the colors in the photo, either. Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange.   And they don&#x27;t glow very much. No matter how long I sit next to a bright light, they will not glow in a dark room. I&#x27;m a big facepainter, and the only thing these are good for is a little shine and sparkle over other colors.   Another disappointing thing is that they almost never dry. So it&#x27;s hard not to wipe it off yourself accidentally.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product - first off, mine did not glow - first fail.  Second these are not paints they are a gels - and go on like a gel.  Once they are on the skin they completely disappear so you cant really tell were you painted and were you didn&#x27;t - fail all around - don&#x27;t buy these pick a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Okay, I bought this product for my sister because she likes black lights and glow in the dark stuff, and the product photos displayed looked fairly innocent, and the description makes it sound like it&#x27;s meant for raves. I just now opened the box and the package design makes it very obvious that this is meant for adult activities. In fact, the little product blurb on the back specifically says it: \\&quot;In the middle of the night you can bring an exciting new twist to those special moments with our new and improved glow in the dark ADULT body paints\\&quot;... and then it has an image of a woman in metal studded lingerie being painted by a male hand. How am I supposed to give something like this to my little sister? Can you say \\&quot;awkward\\&quot;? If you&#x27;re going to sell a product, for crying out loud make sure you display images of the ACTUAL product and not stock photos from goodness knows where. That way the consumer actually knows what they&#x27;re buying.</li>
    <li> So i tried to find glow in the dark body paint and thought i was getting six different colors in decent sized bottles but got four which hardly glow in little bottles...</li>
    <li> I am totally disappointed in this product. The paint does not glow at all in the dark. There is not much more I can say than that.</li>
    <li> These paints did not glow and were not easy to apply. They were poor quality and were not user friendly.</li>
    <li> Ordered these paints last Christmas and they&#x27;re a bit watery.  Not as vibrant as I thought they would be.  Even with a blacklight and I don&#x27;t think they were really glowing in the dark.</li>
    <li> perfect,, i like this item and thanks seler good work&lt;br /&gt;i have the pest from this colection really,, thanks seler</li>
    <li> Painted all over myself for a concert, went to check it out in the dark and... It Doesnt actually glow when on the skin. Wouldnt reccomend it for anybody</li>
    <li> I used the paint to do a photoshoot and it worked really well for what I was attempting. It was more like a gel(or finger paint consistency) than it was a paint but it did the job.</li>
    <li> Packaging is overly sexual we used it for a high school glow in the dark volleyball fundraiser. It worked well on the players.</li>
    <li> I was kind disappointed as it didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough cause you could barely see it glow in the blacklight.</li>
    <li> The glow in the dark body paint was good, I did not like that it did not really dry but it glowed in the dark like it said.</li>
    <li> This paint does not glow in the dark at all. It was hard to put on and did not work well. I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> We hadn&#x27;t used this until recently and it was horrible!  It went on thick - didn&#x27;t glow at all and wouldn&#x27;t come off the kids skin for two days and not without scrubbing...</li>
    <li> Nothing like the pictures. You only receive four small containers.  Doesn&#x27;t dry, doesn&#x27;t glow, stains clothing. I purchased it for a music festival and after one show it rubbed off on people in the crowd.</li>
    <li> The colors were not as bright as I had hoped they would be.  My grandkids had a good time playing with them.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t glow as expected.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with any instructions or warnings whether it stained clothing or caused irritation. It did not, but it&#x27;s nice to have reassurance. You have to use a lot to get it to show up on skin. It glowed but would have liked paperwork of some kind. I sent an email asking him my questions because that&#x27;s what he requested you do if there was a problem, but I never got a response.</li>
    <li> Worked well ... washed off well ... just disappointed the jars weren&#x27;t a little larger.</li>
    <li> These actually show up brightly in black light! thumbs up</li>
    <li> Waisted money buy this stuff. I was going to paint faces for Relay for Life, but I should have just donated the money I spent on this gooey, no glow junk!! Would love to have my money back so I can at least donate that to the cancer cure foundation.</li>
    <li> Its a small package with very little paint in each container and the paint doesn&#x27;t glow all that well. and you only get 4 colours as opposed to the 7 colors advertised</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t look like the picture and you don&#x27;t get to pick out the colors. But the colors that are sent do like up nicely in the dark. I do like the way it goes on and the colors that are sent are nice.</li>
    <li> Bright, light, and I did not have any allergies for that, which is good;)  Thank you very much,   Liza</li>
    <li> The product was shipped to me very quickly which I appreciated, however the product hardly worked. It did not glow under the light, and it would only glow if one had a black light so close it was touching the body. I would not recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> If you look in the second photo (smiley face) there is a UV light or something used. This may be why everyone says it doesn&#x27;t glow. Also it only comes in blue, orange, yellow, and green, which is shown in one photo. This is highly sexual packaging, and a very small quantity of gooey thick stuff (not really paint).  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> This product did not even work. I purchased it for a 200-mile relay race, during which team members would run at night time. I tried the body paints at home beforehand, and they did not glow at ALL.</li>
    <li> This company is not a good company they lied to me over the phone and their product is not good!!!  this product didn&#x27;t work at all!!! and when i called the company to see if i could get a refund they said that they had never gotten an com plait before and that i must ofve done somthing wrong and by their reviews this is obviously not true   i would never buy this item again or anything from this company!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t glow, waste of money, total sham, unbelievably bad, yuck, putrid, nonsense, grim, liars, foul, despicable, lousy, ugh, insert additional complaints here!!!</li>
    <li> CRAP!! Forgot to read the reviews before I purchased.  Terrible product.  Does not glow, is not paint, waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a concert for a group of friends and the paint didnt really glow.  Quite the dissappoint.  Maybe we didnt follow directions?</li>
    <li> It glowed but not as much as I thought id would! would probs buy another kind even tho thanks anyways</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to buy it to test, but maybe someone else can.  Some of the other product photos seem to be blacklight.</li>
    <li> These paints were really thin in texture, so very little coverage. We wanted to do some face painting and it just didnt work . Ended up throwing them away.</li>
    <li> Did not glow like I expected...was very dull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;Below standard product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like it in the least. I wish I didn&#x27;t spend the money on this.</li>
    <li> I should have expected from body paint that came in a rather risky packaging (Bikini girl) that it was not going to be high quality. Also says it comes with different colors in different packaging. I ordered 2 boxes, all same colors came. I guess this will not be used for my intended purpose, Halloween, but it might still spice up the bedroom... We will see!</li>
    <li> did not work well at all. a waste of money. I would not recommend it to anyone. I think it was a rip off.</li>
    <li> There were four 1oz tubes and the consistences was very watery and did not stay on very well also was applied very thin.</li>
    <li> Didnt glow and was extremely hard to get off! Do not buy this product! Waste of money</li>
    <li> The product was not bad. It only glows under a blacklight FYI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only FOUR that come in this arrangement, the picture is not a good indication.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try contacting the seller to try to pick my colors, which I would try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a package that looked like it had been stepped on and one of the bottles was half opened and spilled a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does glow though, pretty cool actually.</li>
    <li> This product does not work well. You must apply it in a thick layer to glow. It doesn&#x27;t glow more than a few minutes once applied. It doesn&#x27;t show up in the light- it only appears as a very transparent light color. It is a product easily found in Adult stores.</li>
    <li> I had this really cool idea/design in mind for the paint, but it did not even glow on our skin! Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for face paint for a glow in the dark party.  The consistency was like slime.  It would rub off into eyes and clothing.  I trashed it!  Not worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> These are beautiful colors and they do glow in the dark, but they DO NOT DRY ONTO YOUR SKIN. Its a slimy oily mess.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t glow and didnt stay on my skin at all and stained all the fabric that I even got close to</li>
    <li> These body paints are completely useless.  They are thin and watery and don&#x27;t stick to brushes or skin very well.  About the only thing you could do is pour them on yourself, but they have this ridiculous oily sheen that reflects your skin underneath and makes you look like you&#x27;re sweating all the time.  Horrible.  Avoid.</li>
