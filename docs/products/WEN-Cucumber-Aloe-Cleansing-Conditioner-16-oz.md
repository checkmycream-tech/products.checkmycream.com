      <li>They are very shaddy and wll try their best to keep getting your money.</li>
      <li>and honestly I wish I could go run to a store to get it instead of dealing with mail-order.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;ll be returning to my sweet smelling and beautiful friend, Mr. WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner.   </li>
      <li>I switch them up depending on what kind of hair</li>
      <li>I really like this product, but it took some experimenting to get my best results.</li>
      <li>Worth the Money!!!</li>
      <li>I like this one the best so far, but I just ordered another bottle, and this time I&#x27;m trying the Lavender</li>
      <li>I have very fine, brittle hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair but lots of it.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that I dye every 4 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Love love love it!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used Wen, it worked great.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s if I&#x27;m taking it kind of easy.  </li>
      <li>I tried twice more just to see if I had messed up, but no each time my hair came out with grease and wax.  </li>
      <li>I was constantly telling everyone to buy Wen and how wonderful it was.   </li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t get stuck into a commitment from the Wen hair site and that I purchased it from Amazon instead.</li>
      <li>rise thoroughly making sure you don&#x27;t feel anything in your hair&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the bottle, though.  </li>
      <li>I have also noticed that my hair handles the abuse of drying much better than it used to -</li>
      <li>My hair looks even better than with the Wen product.</li>
      <li>i cancelled and still got charged, so its better to buy via amazon than wen website.</li>
      <li>I chose to use Amazon to purchase my Wen Hair Care products for the price deals and shipping is better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve converted my mother and most of my friends.  </li>
      <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell of the cucumber as I don&#x27;t like cucumbers that well, but that turned out to be my favorite smell.  </li>
      <li>it smells refreshing and minty.</li>
      <li>5-10 pumps (more if you need) and put on the top part of your hair, massage in&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think the formula without the sudsing agents helps but the lack of alcohol in the styling products probably help my hair the most.  </li>
      <li>The FAQ on Chaz Dean&#x27;s site say that after about a month you should notice that you can go more days between washes, thus justifying the price.</li>
      <li>Decided I would make myself try it for a week instead of two and see if it got better.    </li>
      <li>my hair is much better.    </li>
      <li>I purchased WEN after I complimented a colleague on how healthy her hair looked.</li>
      <li>The company says more is always better, but it wasn&#x27;t in my case.  </li>
      <li>In my quest for healthy looking hair, I have tried every product imaginable.</li>
      <li>Now that my hair is so healthy</li>
      <li>My hair looks better the day after I wash it and is definitely more manageable then.</li>
      <li>which I thought ok</li>
      <li>Ok I LOVE Wen, ALOT.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After seeing the infomercials and reading many reviews online, I decided to give Wen a shot.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Ok...</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, from what I&#x27;ve heard, the Cucumber Aloe is the most \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot; of the varieties.  </li>
      <li>I think all the formulas have menthol in them (which gives you that lovely tingle) and that may smell medicinal to some people.</li>
      <li>and I decided today that I can not go one more day without writing a glowing review..  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love what this product does for my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had healthy hair.</li>
      <li>but I had a TON of split ends no matter how many times I got it trimmed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always in search of products that promise to make my hair feel and look stronger, fuller and more stylish.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I know that WEN works well for many people, including the friend that recommended it to me, so I am probably an outlier in the population of WEN users.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo will not cleanse oily hair! It does give body and conditioning, not an everyday shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for about 6 months now and have tried several flavors and this my new favorite. Left my hair so soft. The last few months, I have actually had people ask me \\&quot;what have I done to my hair ?? It looks great\\&quot; it has finally grown long without breakage. It was so dry and brittle before. It it really true what they say.it actually good for your hair!</li>
    <li> Wen absolutely RUINED my hair. I have fine, formerly curly hair. When I first started using Wen, my hair definitely felt smoother, but it was flat unless I blew it dry every day. Gradually, Wen relaxed out all my natural curls. Soon after, I noticed short, broken off hairs near the front of my scalp, where I had had to scrub so hard to try and get my hair clean with the stuff. I stopped using Wen, only to realize that my curls were permanently relaxed out. Now the broken pieces are growing back curly while the end are still flat and gross. I&#x27;d cut it all off, but I&#x27;m getting married in two months and need the length. I can&#x27;t BELIEVE I have to get married like this. Every day is a horrible hair day now. It&#x27;s so embarrassing. So, I would say, if anyone is sick of their curls, buy Wen, but use a gentle shampoo first to get your hair clean. Then use Wen as an overall conditioner. Your hair will be smooth, flat and curl-free in no time. Good luck.</li>
    <li> When I started using WEN products well over 2 years ago, I had purchased a complete set of the various shampoos through HSN.  I got to try all of them and by far some worked better than others.  For MY hair, the Tea Tree Oil and the Cucumber Aloe work best.  I have thin fine hair that gets oily quickly.  I&#x27;ve found that the Tea Tree moisturizes without going overboard and the Cucumber seems to really deep clean.  I switch them up depending on what kind of hair week I&#x27;m having.  The only negative I have for this product is that you better plan on spending a lot of time in the shower.  If you don&#x27;t rinse it well, your hair will feel kind of icky.  So rinse, and rinse and rinse and when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed too much, rinse again.  I don&#x27;t really think  you can rinse too much!  The reward comes, when your hair is so shiny and clean without feeling stripped and it stays that way for a couple of days.  I used to use extra styling products like mousse to add body, but now I don&#x27;t have to!  I color my hair and since I&#x27;ve been using WEN, I&#x27;ve noticed the color lasts forever (until the roots grow in that is).  My stylist only has to do my roots.  I ran out of this stuff a few months ago and tried  using my old shampoo...oh my God, it was awful.  Now I&#x27;m stuck on this which is a mixed blessing, because while I love this product, I find it way too expensive...and honestly I wish I could go run to a store to get it instead of dealing with mail-order.  But I&#x27;ve gotta get my &#x27;fix&#x27; and if I have to go this route, then this is a good way I guess.  Anyway, use it right and WEN will not let you down.</li>
    <li> My mom gave me the 3-month initial supply of Wen.  The big package that comes in Sweet Almond Mint essence, and the package included 2 16oz bottles of cleansing conditioner, 1 2oz jar of deep conditioning mask, 1 4oz jar of Deep  conditioning mask, 2 different sizes of styling creme, and 1 tube of the texture balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff.  It&#x27;s got it&#x27;s drawbacks, the first and most obvious being it&#x27;s price.  I didn&#x27;t join the \\&quot;club\\&quot; so I order my bottles of cleanser thru Amazon, and it usually runs me $36/bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second drawback is that you have to use SOOOOO much of it (which his highly influential on the first drawback I mentioned-see above).  My hair is really fine, but it&#x27;s really long and thick.  Basically, the strands of hair are fine like baby hair, but I have LOTS of them.  And my hair almost comes to my tailbone, so, I&#x27;m using about 25-30 pumps per wash, and that&#x27;s if I&#x27;m taking it kind of easy.  If I used it according to the directions and infomercial, I&#x27;d have to buy a bottle every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd drawback is I have to rinse my hair for 6-8 minutes to get it all rinsed out, otherwise my hair feels oily and weighed down. About 6 weeks ago I spoke with a customer service rep from WEN about this , and she told me I have to rinse my hair for a LONG time.  This bothers the part of me that tries to be eco-friendly when I think about how much water is getting wasted.  I try to tell myself that that&#x27;s probably the amount of water spent doing separate rinses for shampoo and conditioner, but still....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, from what I&#x27;ve heard, the Cucumber Aloe is the most \\&quot;clarifying\\&quot; of the varieties.  I LOVE the smell.  I can see how some people might think it has a medicinal smell, since it has a hint of eucalyptus scent (I couldn&#x27;t find eucalyptus as an ingredient, but I might have missed it).  To me, it just smells plant-y, and minty, and clean.  I like this one the best so far, but I just ordered another bottle, and this time I&#x27;m trying the Lavender essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES have it&#x27;s benefits.  My hair is definitely softer, and in better condition. But, my hair was in pretty decent shape to begin with since I always used salon brands, anyway.  Also, my hair color lasts about 3 times longer when I use WEN than when I use traditional shampoos/conditioners. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I like it. It did make a noticeable(to me, anyway) improvement in my hairs softness, texture and shine.  But, you can get close to the same results using a less expensive but still professional shampoo/conditioner combination that your stylist reccomends.  For me it pretty much boils down to what I can afford that month..     It DOES have it&#x27;s benefits.  My hair is definitely softer, and in better condition.

    <li> I really like the cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner for my fine and dry hair.  I gave the product four stars instead of five because it is pricey, you have to use a lot of product each time you shower, and it&#x27;s only available online.  I originally used the sweet almond mint, and I really like the smell and feel of it on my scalp, but the cucumber aloe is much better for fine hair.  When I first got wen, I tried to scrimp on how much product I used and the result was hair that didn&#x27;t feel clean.  Now I use several pumps of the product, but only just enough to where I see a little on the comb when I brush it through my wet hair.  If you use enough product and follow all the wen specified steps, you will be amazed at how soft and healthy your hair looks (and how fast it works).</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few weeks back and I am not impressed with it at all. My number one test for any hair product is when I brush my hair out after it dries and it doesn&#x27;t go \\&quot;Poof\\&quot; with frizz. Well this product failed. My hair still goes poof! I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t get stuck into a commitment from the Wen hair site and that I purchased it from Amazon instead. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but I dry it straight nearly every day. My hair has been much more manageable and less frizzy after just a few weeks. I have also noticed that my hair handles the abuse of drying much better than it used to - no more split ends! The best part is that my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade like with most shampoos. I also find that I can go longer in between getting my hair colored as it isn&#x27;t rinsing down the drain each time that I wash it.  There are a lot of posts that talk about the amount that you should use. I have found that I can use significanly less without any real difference. My hair falls just below my shoulder blades, and I use a total of 6 pumps each day - three for the top, two for the middle and one pump for the ends. My hair never looks or feels oily even with the reduced amount.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for about 4 months now. I really like this product, but it took some experimenting to get my best results. I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and went to the Chaz Dean website to read up on the different Wen formulas and their directions for use, which were very helpful. The directions on the bottle are abbreviated. I chose the Cucumber Aloe because it is supposed to be gentle on sensitive skin. When I first got the Wen, I followed the directions for rinsing, the 16-20 pumps of product, and leaving it on your hair for 5 minutes or more. The immediate result was softer, moisturized hair. After a week the result was limp, waxy hair and lots of dandruff (I already had dandruff but stopped using dandruff treatments to try the Wen). I was frustrated about having almost half a bottle left of expensive product, so I went back to my old shampoo and conditioner for two days and decided to start over. I cut way down on the amount of Wen I put in my hair, and that did the trick. The company says more is always better, but it wasn&#x27;t in my case.  To me, the two most important things to know about Wen are rinsing and amount. You want to rinse your hair very well before applying Wen to your hair and rinse well afterward, especially if you have soft water. Now after rinsing my hair, I cleanse my scalp first with white vinegar as a dandruff treatment (cheap, environmentally friendly, and it works!), and use 4 pumps of Wen on my hair. I massage it in, comb it through, clip my hair up, do the rest of my washing, and rinse the Wen out at the end. Once a week I wash with a residue removing shampoo. Using just 4 pumps also makes the product last a lot longer.   Why did I make this much effort to make it work? Part of it was not wanting to waste money, but also I wanted to recreate the immediate great results. With Wen my hair is softer, smoother, and appears thicker. I don&#x27;t have to use lots of other things to make my hair behave. The only other product I use on my hair now is a heat protectant for the heat styling and occasionally some hair spray. The lady who has cut my hair for 5 years asked what I was using because my hair has never looked healthier. I like that it&#x27;s made of natural ingrediants, and I like the smell of the Cucumber Aloe (I didn&#x27;t care for the Lavender). There are some negatives, cost being the most obvious. I think all the formulas have menthol in them (which gives you that lovely tingle) and that may smell medicinal to some people. And the pump stops working when the bottle is 1/3 full and then you just have to pour it into your hand.   I would say if you want to try Wen, don&#x27;t be afraid to deviate from the recommended amount. I think it probably is a really great product for all types of hair, but some types of hair need more (or less) than others.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair. I&#x27;m always in search of products that promise to make my hair feel and look stronger, fuller and more stylish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the WEN Cucumber Aloe cleansing conditioner for about two weeks and it just didn&#x27;t work for me. First I tried it using the recommended amount - 16-20 pumps. Seriously, I could barely fit that much in my hand, and half of it ends up on the shower floor while you&#x27;re trying to apply it to your hair. Nevertheless I followed the instructions precisely and I liked the way my hair looked and felt immediately afterwards. It was soft, smooth and felt luxurious. However, by the end of the day my hair was limp and lifeless. It just felt completely weighed down and I couldn&#x27;t wait to shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the next several days I tried reducing the amount of product I used, and I also made sure that I was thoroughly rinsing my hair. But the results were basically the same -- my hair looked good immediately afterwards but became completely limp by the end of the day. After about two weeks of earnest effort I gave up on the WEN system. I&#x27;m using up the product by applying it as a regular rinse-out conditioner after I shampoo. I am using only ONE pump and it works as well as any other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, to make my hair smooth and easy to comb out. I wouldn&#x27;t buy WEN just for this purpose but it&#x27;s a good way to use up the leftover product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairstylist told me that all quality hair conditioners have cleansing properties, so if you want to try the \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; effect, you can use your regular conditioner alone as a shampoo (you&#x27;ll need to use more than your usual amount to work it through your hair), and see how you like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I didn&#x27;t base my rating on these factors but I personally don&#x27;t care for this scent; it smells chemical-ly to me. It looks like WEN is no longer carrying it on their website so perhaps it isn&#x27;t one of their better-selling products. And last butcertainly not least, this product clogged my shower drain almost every time I used it. We have a stall shower with a low-flow showerhead. This product is very thick, and not particularly water-soluble... when you rinse it out of your hair you see it going down the drain in big globs. If you use the recommended amount it&#x27;s like taking a handful of peanut butter and dropping it down your shower drain. If you have strong water pressure you may not have a problem. If not, you might find yourself snaking out your drain every week as I unfortunately did.</li>
    <li> Did. It like the smell or the product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review for ANYTHING! In my quest for healthy looking hair, I have tried every product imaginable. I have no idea how much money I have spend over the years...  I purchased WEN after I complimented a colleague on how healthy her hair looked. She told me about WEN, so I thought why not! There was an amazing difference in my hair after the first time using WEN. My hair was soft, shiny and the frizz and damage that has plagued me was almost non existent.   I give this product the highest of ratings.</li>
    <li> I love this product but only gave it a 4 star rating for the following reasons.  The product is a little beyond my budget, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that would help with my dry, tangled hair so I can get a comb through it.  So I purchased WEN not as a clensing conditioner, but as a leave in conditioner product.  To use this product in that way - I give it 5 stars.  I wash and condition my hair as I normally would, then while still damp use 2-3 pumps (shoulder length hair) and massage through hair - starting underneath and working through to the top of my hair.  Then comb it through and let my hair dry.  I have perfectly straight hair and for me it leaves my hair smooth, shiney and no frizz.  Love love love it!  I&#x27;ve only tried the WEN Cucember Aloe Cleansing Conditioner and my hair is not smelly, greasy or oil from it and I&#x27;m leaaving the small amount I use in my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product-She has ordered it before and will again. Vendor is very prompt in shipping.</li>
    <li> After trying the Sweet Almond Mint with good but not amazing results, I purchased the Cucumber Aloe.  I love it so much, I would marry it.        This last time I ran out of Wen, I forsook my poor cleansing conditioner, and tried the knock off brand (Hair One) to save money.  Despite its high ratings, Hair One dried out my hair and left it greasy.   It doesn&#x27;t have the same sheen anymore.       So, I&#x27;ll be returning to my sweet smelling and beautiful friend, Mr. WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner.   Because, really, beauty has a high price.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a glowing review right after purchase.  I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the bottle, though.  It did not get rid of the oil in my hair and it looked stringy and limp after about a week of use.  I believe I was using the product correctly.  You take a chance on this stuff.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Firstly, let me tell you that I love this product. It makes my straight hair shiny and reduces frizzies, but the whole you-can-go-longer-without-getting-greasy-headed thing never happened for me. I still have to shower daily, which is why I became obsessed with the amount of product used and the cost per shower...    So using the minimum guidelines for each dose, you&#x27;ll use about 1oz per shower. At the prices offered here, that&#x27;s about $2/shower. I think I make decent money, but I can&#x27;t live with myself for spending that on my hair each day. It&#x27;s just crazy. I would stand there lathering thinking \\&quot;I want my two dollars!!\\&quot;.     In protest, I went back to the my old shampoo - and immediately regretted it. Even my husband noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t look as good, and that says something since he&#x27;s not really the type to notice, well, anything.     So... enter Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, my rescuer. They just came out with a self-branded version of this product for sale in their stores and on their website which is fantastic. It&#x27;s about half the price, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s purely psychological, but I love it. My hair looks even better than with the Wen product. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;m serious.      Best yet, Sally&#x27;s sells little single-use packets if you&#x27;re not ready to commit. You could grab a couple of those and give it a go before you totally opt out of the real thing. (Of course, for $10 you could just buy the whole bottle... Compared to the Wen spend, that&#x27;s small potatoes!)</li>
    <li> I tried this product due to others reviews and recommendations. I those this product because I have oily to normal skin type with thin blonde hair. I find this product to clean my hair well with 28-32 pumps and leave in the hair for 3-5 minutes. I can feel it starting to do something in my hair. Then I rinse it out. I often put 1-2 pumps in after washing to use as a leave in conditioner. I don&#x27;t think this give me the shine and smooth appearance others talk about. I may try the sweet almond mint instead.</li>
    <li> I have long, virgin, baby fine hair. It gets dry in the winter and has no body. I tried Wen and liked the way my hair looked for the first hour. After that it just started looking greasy and limp. I even asked my two best friends how my hair looked &amp; they said it looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it that day. However, I loved how the ends of my hair looked. I had not realized how dry they were until I used Wen. So now I use my regular shampoo &amp; only use a small amount of Wen on the ends of my hair as conditioner.</li>
    <li> I had tried the Amaxon.com sample of all the Wen shampoos.  I kind of liked them all.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell of the cucumber as I don&#x27;t like cucumbers that well, but that turned out to be my favorite smell.  The almond is my least favorite, but  if someone gave me a life time supply of it I would use it and be very grateful anyway.  They made my hair look better, but when I ran out I went back to my old products.  I&#x27;m 45 now and for the 1st time in my life my hair just seems old and worn out.  After several recent months of really bad hair days, I went back to cucumber Wen.  My hair immediately responded.  People are giving me compliments again on how I look.  It has been months maybe years since that has happened.  I think it is my hair. Even better I am getting ready for work faster as I can cut the time it took to put in conditioner. I don&#x27;t care about the cost.  I was at the desperate point.  I was thinking of getting a short short cut or a hat or something.  I hear about ladies wearing wigs in their 40s.  I&#x27;m about being natural.  I think 45 is too early to have to start wearing a wig.  So far, with Wen my wig days will hopefully be postponed a good long while.  My 4th week back on it and I hope I have the good sense to stick to it this time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super expensive and you only get a little for what you pay for are my only complaints. My hair is really oily on the top and dry at the bottom.. I feel like this conidtioner is the only hair product that addresses these issues. I started using the vanilla almond but I never liked the smell. I prefer Cucumber Aloe bceause it smells refreshing and minty. Also, if i used 16+ pumps that is reccommended.. I think I would need to buy this product every month. I use 1.5-2 pumps instead.</li>
    <li> My grandmother bought this conditioner for me knowing that I have a unique hair type. I have really fine and really curly hair. I have had problem with products making my hair feel like straw and not protecting my hair from damage. First of all I hated the smell of this conditioner... it is very unpleasant and my fiance told agreed with me. Second of all after following the instructions to a T my entire scalp burned and when air blew on my head it made it even worse. This is horrible and does ruin your curls and isn&#x27;t worth the money. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Yes, I really wanted to love Wen.  I loved the concept of it-natural ingredients, good for your hair, etc.  My best friend swears by it, won&#x27;t use anything else, and says it has changed her life.  Her hair looks great from Wen.  However, it just did not work for me.    Day 1:    Followed the instructions exactly but did not put in any at the end as a leave in conditioner because my hair is on the oily side.  The results-my hair was so dry and lost some of the shine it used to have.  Not impressed and think it has made my hair look gross.  Promised myself I would try it for at least two weeks though.    Day 2:    Followed the instructions exactly and put one pump on as a leave in conditioner.  By mid-day my hair was very oily and gross-looked like it had not been washed in a few days.  My scalp was very itchy and uncomfortable.  Decided I would make myself try it for a week instead of two and see if it got better.    Day 3:  Followed the instructions exactly and put a dime sized amount into my hair as a leave in conditioner.  By day 3, my hair seemed like it had product build-up, even though I absolutely followed the instructions on rinsing for a long time in cold water.  My scalp continued to itch and feel uncomfortable.  My hair seemed heavy and limp-gross.  I gave up and went back to my Dessert Essence Organics line of shampoo and conditioner and my hair is much better.    A couple of thoughts?  I have gluten sensitivity and do not eat foods with gluten.  Maybe the hydrolized wheat protein in the product irritated my scalp?  My hair has been oily later prior to Wen and Wen just made it a million times worse.  Maybe the product does not work on fine, oily hair?  I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong b/c I really did follow the instructions exactly.  What a disaster...</li>
    <li> I have an oily scalp and \\&quot;HAD\\&quot; very dry fine straw like hair\\&quot;. I used only Wen for 2 weeks and my hair felt and looked great Not greasy at all, but it is expensive.  Now that my hair is so healthy I changed to washing with Pantene and using Wen as a leave in (3-5 pumps instead of 30). My hair has never looked and felt so great. Worth the Money!!!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Ok...I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 5 months and I decided today that I can not go one more day without writing a glowing review..  CHAZ - you are a MIRACLE WORKER and I LOVE YOU!!!!! My husband and children are so embarrassed by me when I go around singing your praises to anyone who will listen but I don&#x27;t care. I must share the good news of Wen Hair Care with the world!!  My story - I was a tow head as a child with beautiful long blond hair that everyone admired. By Junior High I was already having problems. My hair has always been thin, wavy/curly, oily scalp and DRY, DRY, DRY everywhere else!!! Which, of course, I now contribute to cheap shampoo. Anyway, I am 35 now with color treated long blond hair and before I found Wen I was using the best shampoo I could afford and had to use tons of conditioner and leave-in. If I just blow dried my hair after all of that it would be a frizzy mess. So I would spray heat protectant and then straighten with a flat iron. It would look pretty good straight ironed but I had a TON of split ends no matter how many times I got it trimmed. I also had tons of short little frizzy hairs around my face that never grew more than an inch or so and a tiny bald spot on the back of my head that I was always trying to cover up.  ENTER WEN - I started with Sweet Almond Mint and LOVED the smell!! I immediately noticed a HUGE difference. The biggest difference I noticed was that after I blow dried my hair I felt no need to straighten out the frizz. My hair looked great just blow drying it for the first time in my life. My hair was so shiny and soft that I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same hair. I also used the Tea Tree oil and it made an even bigger difference. The only downside seemed to be that the Sweet Almond mint seemed to be a little too heavy for my hair type. It would feel a little weighed down by the end of the day.  Enter CUCUMBER ALOE!!! -THE BEST!! I will NEVER be without it. My hair is shiny and light and even looks great the secondday. I just bought the Cucumber Aloe Oil and LOVE IT too!! It is the perfect formula for my hair.  My routine - I use 4 pumps of the big bottle of Cucumber Aloe on the main part of my head. Lather it up with a little water and scrub, scrub, scrub my scalp. Then I rinse it really well with lukewarm water. Next, I use 2 more pumps of CA on my head again but this time add 2 pumps of Sweet Almond Mint on the rest of my hair, concentrating on the ends like a conditioner. I scrub again with a little water, comb through and clip to my head while I finish my shower (which includes the Lavender body creme - heavenly!!) Then I rinse thoroughly and use cool water at the end for added shine. I use a little SAM as a leave in and then the SAM styling creme although I can&#x27;t wait to try the CA version when this one runs out. Then I blow dry it on warm in sections with a boar bristle brush. I also oil my hair overnight at least once a week too. PERFECTION!!!  Added benefits -  1. I am using the lavender body creme on my face and I am not kidding when I say that for the first time in my adult life I NO LONGER HAVE ANY ZITS!!! A MIRACLE!!!  2. I&#x27;ve even given it to my 14 year old son (talk about acne!!) to use and his face has totally cleared up. Major miracle!!  2. The little bald spot at the back of my head is GONE!! Another miracle!!  3. I have a TON of new hair growing around my face. I can&#x27;t get over it. I keep showing everyone who will look. IT&#x27;S AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair looks in about 4 or 5 years. I KNOW that I will have MUCH thicker and prettier hair when all of this new hair grows in.  4. I have to search for split ends.  5. No more wads of hair in my brush or in the shower!!  Buy this product. I am not kidding. If you do it right and find the right one for your hair you will not be sorry!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever want to use another shampoo. I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if it was less expensive or at least available for Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Ok I LOVE Wen, ALOT.  I&#x27;ve used the sweet almond mint and tea tree oil cleansing cream so far...I don&#x27;t do styling products so haven&#x27;t even bothered with those.  I&#x27;ve been out of the tea tree oil for awhile and couldn&#x27;t remember what it was called.  I mentioned about the fact that the back of my scalp will get itching once in awhile from the normal wen, so the representative offered me the cucumber aloe.  I tried it today for the first time tonight.  It started to tingle right away which I thought ok well once I rinse Ill be ok.  By the time I got out of the shower by scalp was burning so bad its not even funny.  I even rewashed my head and its still burning!  Its way past a tingle now and hurts.  I am throwing the entire bottle out!  I swear I had tried the cucumber aloe before and didn&#x27;t have that result!  So maybe if you never tried this one you might want to test out a small spot first!</li>
    <li> Wish you carried the styling gel in the 6 oz. bottle pump.  thanks, Ronn of Denver.</li>
    <li> It seems to do an average job of cleansing and conditioning. My hair looks better the day after I wash it and is definitely more manageable then. You have to use a quite a bit (about 20 pumps for shoulder length hair) which means you go through it fairly quickly and at $35, it&#x27;s a lot to pay for what amounts to an average shampoo/conditioner. I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot but will save my money and try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and love it, it does not dry my hair, it keeps it soft and nice and it does not contain the foaming chemicals that damage and dry your hair and scalp. Expensive but nice...</li>
    <li> I used to order wen from the wen web site but after they tryed to rob me blind saying I owed $60 on products I never received and would not send me more unless I gave my money away,I thought my wen days were over until I found wen on amazon with much lower prices, much better service and no rip offs .I will only order wen from amazon from now on. It&#x27;s a product that leaves your hair manageable without need for conditioner and has no unnatural chemicals.So if you are interested in taking care of your hair %100 naturally try wen but do not throw your money on the wen web site as you will loose money and if you try to close the account they will keep billing you after they had confirmed you owed nothing.From my  experience buy it here on amazon .</li>
    <li> I wear human hair wigs. After a while they get frizzy and dry. Wen replenished the moisture in the wig and the shine is wonderful</li>
    <li> Normally I have very coarse dry hair. After using this product for a month, my hair has been transformed!  It leaves my hair soft and easy to style!</li>
    <li> I NEVER buy things on infomercials.  But I saw this informercial several times and I thought I would give it a try.  CHANGED MY LIFE.  I have very fine hair that I dye every 4 weeks.  I have used Kerestasse and other expensive brands to keep my hair from essentially disintegrating.   Because my hair is thin, it gets oily rather quickly, but too much shampooing leaves my over-dyed hair brittle.  Not to mention the fact that its wavy so I blow dry it every time I wash it.   I was skeptical that a \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair completely limp and greasy.  I am AMAZED. I haven&#x27;t \\&quot;shampooed\\&quot; my hair since October.  My hair is SO soft and has tons of volume (just make sure to get the cucumber, its less heavy than the sweet almond mint).  I&#x27;ve converted my mother and most of my friends.  I&#x27;m constantly running around asking them to feel my hair, hahaha.  I have thrown out all of my other hair products.  Literally.  Leave-ins, sprays, etc.   Its also awesome for travel.  You only have to bring one thing!  And its great as a leave in before and after you go into the ocean.  My hair was soft and frizz free (though curly) in Costa Rica!     Seriously.      Buy this.</li>
    <li> My hair was the kind that always got comments on how beautiful it was and people were always asking me what I use on it.   Then I got Wen. It made my hair soft and I could actually not use some of the other products in my hair and I loved that it saved me time. I love the scent. I was constantly telling everyone to buy Wen and how wonderful it was.   ****One day I started noticing my hair coming out in the shower and when I brushed it. Just a little bit. Two weeks later.....I was losing massive amounts of hair***** I went to the doctor and after getting all the tests done that they could the only other thing it could be was Wen. So I stopped using it just to see... My hair is damaged beyond belief. I have to use all of these other products on my hair just so I can run a comb or a brush through my hair. My hair is still falling out but not as bad since I started using a shampoo and conditioner.   I really wish that I NEVER tried Wen!!</li>
    <li> I love wen! But the bottle I ordered from here had no tingle(my favorite part) ,the consistency was not at all like my other bottle and it left my hair dull and didn&#x27;t feel clean . I was very upset considering that the cost is the same. I only bought from here bc I don&#x27;t like the automatic withdrawal from my account every month. Guess I&#x27;ll have to find another brand :(</li>
    <li> I have heard so much about WEN that I had to buy it.  I followed the directions perfectly &#x27;30-40 pumps, massage in for a minute, let stand 3-5 minutes, rinse thoroughly&#x27; and when I got out my hair had waxy build up. I was ticked I mean wasn&#x27;t the whole point of this not to have waxy build up? To have volume?  I tried twice more just to see if I had messed up, but no each time my hair came out with grease and wax.  Finally I googled &#x27;WEN instructions&#x27; and it came up with a video on YouTube.com Here&#x27;s the proper way that should be on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. rinse hair thoroughly, like for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2. 5-10 pumps (more if you need) and put on the top part of your hair, massage in&lt;br /&gt;3. 5-10 pumps under your hair massage in&lt;br /&gt;4. 5-10 pumps on the left side&lt;br /&gt;5. 5-10 pumps on the right side&lt;br /&gt;6. any extra pumps on the bottom or top, just fill in&lt;br /&gt;7. Slightly tilt your head in the water until it gets a little wet&lt;br /&gt;8. massage in your scalp for a minute, this should be easier because of the water you added&lt;br /&gt;9. comb through&lt;br /&gt;10. clip it up and let stay for a solid 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;11. rise thoroughly making sure you don&#x27;t feel anything in your hair&lt;br /&gt;optional&lt;br /&gt;12. before you get out use a pump or so to run though the ends of your hair like leave in conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you see how detailed that is? That&#x27;s what should be on the back of the bottle because I can tell you now I only wash my hair with WEN and it is not greasy, no waxy build up and my hair looks really healthy.  I have fine blonde hair that I dye so it is slightly damaged, but I have a ton of it so it can be a pain to get the shampoo out from under the layers, I really really like the Cucumber Aloe and just bought a bigger bottle, my hair is mid back and I find I really only need 5-7 pumps per section so don&#x27;t use the 40 plus pumps, saves the product and me money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping with all might that it would be my hair rescuer! My hair is a mix (half indian and peruvian) and it frizzes a lot. The first time I used Wen, it worked great. After 2nd 3rd 4th 5th time my hair seemed weighed down, frizzy and oily. You really have to wash your hair with SUPER cold water to get less oily results. But who wants to do that??? And worse of all is that I kept on getting charged. i cancelled and still got charged, so its better to buy via amazon than wen website. They are very shaddy and wll try their best to keep getting your money. Also blowdrying my hair after using wen was a mess!!!!!!!!! it left my hair looking horrible...its better to air dry.  I am currently looking  for a better cleaser..will keep you posted</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  I have long hair and only shampoo once a week and this product leaves it totally clean without harmful detergent type strippers that can be in shampoos.  It is every bit what the infomercials say.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the supplier made it difficult to buy this as they would only sell the shampoo with packages of products I didn&#x27;t want or use so I found single bottles through Amazon  Great for troublesome hair  Have moved onto something new now.  Always trying new beauty products</li>
    <li> Although I love Wen hair products I was not crazy with the cucumber aloe, perhaps the smell was not appealing to me.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Cucumber Aloe Conditioner from Amazon (seller WEN). Definitely not the same as Chaz Dean&#x27;s WEN. Bottle looks similar, but smells terrible - almost like medicine/chemical. I also purchased the Tea Tree from the same seller, should have known better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying from this seller, if you think you&#x27;re purchasing the real deal. I want my money back.   I love Chaz Dean&#x27;s cleansing conditioners, this IS NOT his products!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love what this product does for my hair but it caused my scalp to break out in a type of painful, cystic acne. I have never struggled with acne in my life and only developed these bumps where the Wen product came into contact. Unfortunately, this also included my back and shoulders due to lather run-off. I had to weigh the pros and cons of continuing to use the Wen line and decided that the beauty benefit in this case was definitely not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this product, I do, I really like the concept of a detergent free shampoo. But I do feel that this product is causing me to experience hair loss. I have been using WEN consistently for a month having tried both the cucumber aloe and sweet almond mint. I used the recommended number of pumps per section and rinsed really well before and after. But I am extremely alarmed by the number of hairs I lose during each shower; after one month of use the thickness of my ponytail is half the size it used to be. I know that WEN works well for many people, including the friend that recommended it to me, so I am probably an outlier in the population of WEN users. I tend to have sensitive skin and many products containing natural ingredients irritate my skin, maybe the same is to be said about my scalp.</li>
    <li> I hate wen!!! It is the worst hair cleanser EVER! My hair looks greasy &amp; terrible. I have to pin my bangs back &amp; I can&#x27;t get rid of the grease. I think I have to completely strip my hair to get rid of the clumpy mess at the top of my head. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin to get my hair back to it&#x27;s usual soft gorgeousness. My scalp itches like crazy. If I didn&#x27;t have a job, I&#x27;d stay inside at home. That&#x27;s how bad it is. It&#x27;s been like this for almost 3 weeks now. I followed the directions to the letter &amp; the 1st day my hair was beautiful.  The 2nd day &amp; going forward, my hair is a disaster.  I am so furious. I tried to use regular shampoo, doesn&#x27;t help. Tried wen again, no change. The only part of my hair that even remotely feels good is the ends. This is complete crap &amp; I am miserable.  Everyone swears by and says they&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo. I will shave my head before I use it again. No joke. I will use the rest of it on my kids hair, because it workd great on their hair. Complete waste of money.  Not to mention, I cancelled the subscription like 3 times and they continued to ship it to me &amp; bill me for it.</li>
    <li> I do not know about people with straight hair but this product damaged my long red curly hair in less than a week. I have used the same hair dresser for 10+ years and when I went to see him for help I walked in the door, he took one look at me, and said, \\&quot;what happened to your hair?\\&quot;  I told him I&#x27;d been using WEN and he said \\&quot;that&#x27;ll do it\\&quot;. My hair is my \\&quot;trademark\\&quot; if you will.  I am a little obsessed with it and now I am in tears.  I have stopped using the products for almost a month now and am still having the same issue with dry, dull, scraggly, damaged, limp, no body and little to no curl or only curl in certain places then straight parts that look like dogs hair.  My hair dresser cut off 3 inches to try and get rid of some of the damage on the ends, didn&#x27;t help.  I had healthy long naturally curly hair before I used WEN.  I am not taking any medication, I don&#x27;t swim in pools, i don&#x27;t lay in the sun or go to tanning salons, i do not flat iron my hair etc.. Without wanting to offend anyone it&#x27;s almost like I used a relaxer for an african american hair.  That is they best way to describe what has happened to my hair from using WEN, it&#x27;s like a put a relaxer in it.  I guess I should feel lucky that my hair didn&#x27;t fall out like so many of the other users of WEN.  I should have googled the product before purchasing it.  Also, please note that if you order the product they automatically send you refills and charge your credit card.  They don&#x27;t wait 90 days to send you your 90 day refill, they send your 90 day refill in 60 days so they can get in an extra charge before you cancel.  Worst purchase ever.

    <li> The label is all wrong, the information on the back doesn&#x27;t match up with the Wen products I ordered from the Wen infomercial. The bottle is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work exactly the same as the normal Wen stuff, you have to use more than usual. Even then your hair isn&#x27;t as soft and beautiful as after the real Wen.  The color isn&#x27;t quite right. Even the pomegranate one is still a crisp white color. This isn&#x27;t as white. The consistency isn&#x27;t as good, not as thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful if you chose to buy this particular scent from this particular seller/group of sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other sellers on here selling this Wen that you might try out first. But this is definitely not worth the money. The real Wen products leave you amazed after the first use. This does not.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair but lots of it. My hair also gets oily so it must be washed every day! I was afraid this would make my hair look greasy but it did not. And I can go a day without washing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had healthy hair. I don&#x27;t have to do much to keep it shiny. My problem has always been that I have an oily scalp and dry ends. If I use a clarifying shampoo, my roots might make it through the day without looking greasy, but my ends will pay the price over time. If I use a shampoo for normal hair, I can&#x27;t go more than 12 hours without my roots looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the infomercials and reading many reviews online, I decided to give Wen a shot. It is pretty expensive, but I figured that I could probably make the 16 oz bottle last at least a month. If it really did balance my scalp and halt the oil production, it was well worth it. I chose Cucumber Aloe because it was advertised as beneficial for those with an oily scalp and dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using 20+ pumps per wash for my long fine hair for a couple of weeks, after which I cut my hair to just above shoulder length (10 pumps at this point). I&#x27;ve got about two washes left in the bottle, and it will not last a full month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using all of the pumps at once as well as the &amp;#34;rinse, repeat&amp;#34; method. Yes, my hair was soft and manageable. It did an ok job of cleaning my hair, but it did nothing to slow down the oil production on my scalp. The FAQ on Chaz Dean&#x27;s site say that after about a month you should notice that you can go more days between washes, thus justifying the price. Bottom line is that I can buy sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner that will last two months for less than one bottle of Wen that won&#x27;t last a full four weeks AND get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you abuse your hair with color and excessive heat, Wen would do wonders to improve your hair. I do neither of those things, so Wen did not make a big difference for me.</li>
    <li> It took a while to make up my mind weather or not to buy this product with all the bad reviews.  I finally decided to give it a try and I love it!  I have very thin hair and living my the panhandle it is fizzy most of the time due to the humidity.  With WEN it now has body and the fizz is totally gone.  Thanks!!!!!</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I ever used, I wish they made this product when I was a kid, because I bet I would not have sufferd any hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if made my hair feel good after one use .it is z good doze and great price .</li>
    <li> This product is poisonous. My entire scalp, face, all down my arms, back BURNING immediately. Unfortunately I got a tiny bit in my mouth - my tongue immediately blistered. Some went down my throat, I started vomiting uncontrollably and vomited for 10 minutes. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. TOXIC. I&#x27;m supposed to go for major brain surgery in 2 days and now my head, face, arms, back is on fire with a rash - I&#x27;m certain they will not let my surgery happen with my skin in this terrible condition. I will have to have it postponed and hope that this terrible burning scalp rash goes away FAST. Thanks to Wen I may not get the surgery I need when I&#x27;m supposed to get it.  NEVER again will I buy this product - I don&#x27;t even want it in my house.  Google the ingredients. Total poison.&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: The next morning:  Several more blisters on my tongue have appeared, and my saliva glands are hyperactive (can&#x27;t stop spitting) and I&#x27;ve vomited twice this morning and am still very nauseous.  Here is what I found googling &#x27;Wen Hair Care Toxic\\&quot; (copy/paste into your browser) http://candisbeautyblog.blogspot.ca/2012/04/consumer-alert-wen-hair-care-products.html</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would be much different from what I have tried (and I have tried sooo many). I have been searching for a long time now for a cleansing system that not only works well on my hair but tends to my scalp as well. This product works pretty good to clean and moisturize my hair but as with others, I still have areas on my scalp that are so dry, I get large flakes (not sure if this is the left behind by the shampoo or dry scalp, the itching is almost unbareale as well in these spots)I will not buy this product again for it is very pricey to leave my hair the same as many other shampoo-cleansers/conditioners have done so many times prior. My daughter of 10 has had an oily scalp problem so I let her try this product for a week, when her haired dried, it was more oily looking than before she cleansed. I also did not care for the strong scent it left behind on my or my daughters hair. What I did like was the fact of not have to condition seperately and I enjoyed the cool tingling it left on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, it made me have excessive hairloss. Plus this is a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t even feel like shampoo so it doesn&#x27;t foam and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling clean! This product has something that causes a lot of volume, but don&#x27;t fall for the commercial because this is not a good product once I started using it for about a wk my hair starting falling more than usual so I stopped and it took a while for the hairloss to stop. This is not a good product at all, I don&#x27;t recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been seeing the infomercials for a while now and decided to try it. LOVE IT! Wen has totally changed my hair, just like the infomercial says. Incredible!</li>
    <li> After watching an informercial for this product while I was on the elliptical I got sucked in and ordered a bottle (best to do on Amazon so you don&#x27;t end up getting a bottle a month via the website). I used it in place of shampoo for a few days and found that it left my hair fairly greasy, and this is coming from someone with chronically dry, chemically colored hair.  I then tried washing it with shampoo and using this just as conditioner. It worked well as a conditioner, but I decided that at the price, it made for a more expensive conditioner than I was willing to purchase long term. I bought one bottle and don&#x27;t see myself getting more in the future.</li>
    <li> I switched to WEN over the summer when my hair was beyond damaged.  It slowly recovered.  My hair is much softer now and it is healthier.  I think the formula without the sudsing agents helps but the lack of alcohol in the styling products probably help my hair the most.  I also stopped using heat on my hair.  I keep trying different scents.  I&#x27;ve tried the regular almond, then cucumber, most recently the pumpkin.  They are all nice.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple different  Wen products and really like them all!  This one is great for daily or weekly cleansing and makes my hair feel really detoxified!</li>
    <li> Is it me or does this scent smell like NAIR ?  Have not been happy with Wen products after prolonged use.  At first it is wonderful but eventually my hair became straw-like with heavy breakage.</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other reviews I read that the labeling was a little off and I&#x27;m not sure the consistency of the product was the same as I received from Wen so I bought the other Wen Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz that Amazon sells and I&#x27;ve only used it a few days and it is more true to what I received from Wen. I chose to use Amazon to purchase my Wen Hair Care products for the price deals and shipping is better. I&#x27;ve been using the Wen products for a few months and notice the difference in my hair texture and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hair healthy and clean&#x27; I love love love wen and so does my hair! I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I raved about this product for the first couple of weeks. But I have slowly noticed that my once naturally curly hair is stringy. And today, As I blew it out in prep for straightening, I am seeing breakage. I have never had a problem with breakage. I also noticed that after prolonged use, my scalp felt itchy and my hair greasy a day or two after use, causing me to wash it more often than I normally would with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had resigned myself to the cost after the initial results, but given that I&#x27;m washing it more often than with other products,I started to reconsider. But now that I see how stringy my once tight curls have become and the breakage, I am regretting my purchase and the rave recommendations I gave friends about this product.</li>
    <li> A friend uses this product and has beautiful hair. I tried it sooooo many different ways...more produce, less product, longer, shorter retention time, cold water, hot water, more often, less often. Did live chat to try find out what I was doing wrong: apparently more is better, but that still didn&#x27;t work for me.... Could NOT get it to cooperate for me. I gave it away. I have very fine, brittle hair. It left my hair feeling like I had left a thick balm in my hair...the kind that guys use to get their hair to stay in one spot forever. It looked wet-greasy on my hair. Thick and goopy. Ew. I really tried. I guess I just fit in the 10% of people for whom this product falls flat :(</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Oily Scalp and Dry Ends...Wen Products are great on my wavy, coarse hair. I don&#x27;t use anything else except a clarifier every few weeks.</li>
    <li> The lovely lady says that this is much, much better than ordinary shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;So, even though this is a little costly, if Mama ain&#x27;t happy, ...</li>
