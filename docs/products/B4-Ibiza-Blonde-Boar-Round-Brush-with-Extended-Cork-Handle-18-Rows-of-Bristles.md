      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>Such an impressive brush.  </li>
      <li>It is weighted perfectly and the handle is long enough to make it easy to use, well-balanced and perfect for styling.  </li>
      <li>the best money EVER spent on a hairbrush.</li>
      <li>The brush is lightweight and easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>The quality is excellent just not right for me.  </li>
      <li>I have been using round brushes for MANY years and haven&#x27;t quite found the perfect fit... until now.  </li>
      <li>I just wanted something, anything to give my fine hair volume.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the cork handle.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money for sure.  </li>
      <li>I bought it based on the great reviews, but this one is definitely not for me.</li>
      <li>It looks smooth, shiny, polished.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true...</li>
      <li>and I found this to be true.  </li>
      <li>Makes your hair shiny and full of volume.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.... saves me from going to the salon for a blow dry, simply amazing all I need is my Ibiza hair brush and my hair dryer...</li>
      <li>I am older but have a thick head of hair and this brush is perfect for me, I love the cork handle</li>
      <li>I purchased this amazing brush and have never looked back.  </li>
      <li>but I promise you will get your monies worth, and then some.  </li>
      <li>It looks like I stepped right out of the salon.</li>
      <li>Good hair days everyday.  </li>
      <li>A great investment and one that will last you a very long time.</li>
      <li>the positive side, the junction between the head of the brush with the handle does not pull the hair, which is good, and the brush is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me, and definitely not worth the $50 price</li>
      <li>I have  very straight hair after drying with this brush and using straight serum.  </li>
      <li>I went for the blonde brush because I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I got the blonde brush version since my hair is so fine.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a snob about my hair so trust me when I say, this brush is an absolute god-send.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It does a great job of adding volume and shine to my thin hair.</li>
      <li>I have very long fine blonde hair that becomes easily tangled.  </li>
      <li>I have medium length extremely fine brown hair that is flat and lifeless otherwise.</li>
      <li>I only ever very rarely have had any hair pulled at the handle.  </li>
      <li>High quality and really grips my hair without pulling my hair out.  </li>
      <li>the brush makes my hair very static and also makes my hair look dull and with no volume.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>While this brush is ok, it&#x27;s definitely not worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>You can buy a boar round brush at a Ricky&#x27;s for $10...and have a better brush.  </li>
      <li>A hair brush is a very personal thing for me, it&#x27;s rare that I get one I like a lot, but I live with the purchase and just try and get used to it.</li>
      <li>I thought the exact same thing.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks soft like a bunny, healthy, shiny, and fluffy!  </li>
      <li>One from me and one from my cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine but thick straight shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>( the dowager Duchess is now 20years old and has refined taste) on the bathroom counter brushing her face against it ..</li>
      <li>, better late than never.</li>
      <li>The bristles were not as soft as they should be being a boar brush.  </li>
      <li>and my hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I have another brush of the same diameter that is beautiful, but it is not at all effective because the handle is too heavy and too short making it impossible to use.  </li>
      <li>I also use less product now since the brush really does seem to give my style more body even with less product.</li>
      <li>I have long hair, which is a little fine and somewhat oily.</li>
      <li>I have straight baby fine hair texture, but a lot of it, and my hair is half way down my back.  </li>
      <li>I have so many brushes, especially round brushes that I have collected over the years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical when I read the other reviews about Ibiza creating silky, shiny and smooth hair but all that went out the door when I tried mine for the first time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It did take me awhile to get used to, but this brush has been great for my hair.  It gives it shine and volume that I love....and needed.  I no longer use curling irons of any sort.  I simply blow dry with my Ibiza and go.  Give yourself some time to practice and get the hang of it.  Feel free to look at Youtube videos that show how great this brush works.  My hairdresser used it and got me hooked....I am getting to be just as good as her now.  :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a snob about my hair so trust me when I say, this brush is an absolute god-send.  I have been using round brushes for MANY years and haven&#x27;t quite found the perfect fit... until now.  I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical when I read the other reviews about Ibiza creating silky, shiny and smooth hair but all that went out the door when I tried mine for the first time.  It&#x27;s true... all of it.  Ibiza does not disappoint.  Can&#x27;t wait to add another one to my collection, that&#x27;s how happy I am with the purchase.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the cost; it may seem like a big chunk-o-change at the outset but I promise you will get your monies worth, and then some.  A great investment and one that will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> I love this Brush! &lt;br /&gt;Especially the featherweight lightness of it. &lt;br /&gt;This Brush truly brings the shine in your hair to Life. &lt;br /&gt;If this brush were around 25 years ago, it would have saved many a Stylist (and I know many) from getting Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. &lt;br /&gt;Well, better late than never. &lt;br /&gt;You have a sure WINNER with this &#x27;Baby&#x27;. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Sylvia McNeal  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  High quality and really grips my hair without pulling my hair out.  I have  very straight hair after drying with this brush and using straight serum.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have very long fine blonde hair that becomes easily tangled.  This brush works wonders on it.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t know about it years ago.</li>
    <li> It is weighted perfectly and the handle is long enough to make it easy to use, well-balanced and perfect for styling.  I have another brush of the same diameter that is beautiful, but it is not at all effective because the handle is too heavy and too short making it impossible to use.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A hair brush is a very personal thing for me, it&#x27;s rare that I get one I like a lot, but I live with the purchase and just try and get used to it. Not so with this brush, whoever designed it must have thought like me. I am older but have a thick head of hair and this brush is perfect for me, I love the cork handle it&#x27;s like the icing in the cake. Great product amazon, way to go.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I have owned. I have curly hair, and it&#x27;s perfect for smoothing and volume. Love it!</li>
    <li> I initially was very skeptical of buying this hair brush. I don&#x27;t buy into claims of  &#x27;star&#x27; endorsed products, or care for that matter which Hollywood elitist hairstylists use them...etc. I just wanted something, anything to give my fine hair volume. I was at my wits end. I figured if worse came to worse I would return it, because $40 plus for a hairbrush is ridiculous to me.  OMG...the best money EVER spent on a hairbrush. Believe the hype. This is the one and only brush that has ever worked to give my medium length, layered, flat-to-my-head, hair volume...that stays. It is like a miracle. Love this hair brush. Am investing in another one pronto.</li>
    <li> You can buy a boar round brush at a Ricky&#x27;s for $10...and have a better brush.  The bristles were not as soft as they should be being a boar brush.  While this brush is ok, it&#x27;s definitely not worth the price.  I don&#x27;t understand all the raving about it.</li>
    <li> $50 for a hairbrush?!  I thought the exact same thing.  And then.. I caved.  I purchased this amazing brush and have never looked back.  Noticeable difference in the appearance of my hair. I have shoulder length, layered hair.  It looks smooth, shiny, polished.  My husband noticed.  That fact alone, is truly amazing.  Dry time diminished.  My hair lies as it should.  The brush is lightweight and easy to manage.  Good hair days everyday.  I&#x27;m tempted to get a back up.</li>
    <li> This is two reviews .. One from me and one from my cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine but thick straight shoulder length hair.  This brush is too big to roll my hair into a Bob drying.  The quality is excellent just not right for me.  It has been relegated to the guest bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I must say my cat loves it!  I find her ( the dowager Duchess is now 20years old and has refined taste) on the bathroom counter brushing her face against it .. Purring her head off.  HRH would give it 5 stars.  I guess you can&#x27;t put a price on making your cat happy.</li>
    <li> My hair started breaking while I was using it.  Do not recommend.  Went back to my Moroccan Oil brush, and no more broken hairs on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. I had only ever bought cheapy brushes, so I cannot compare against other high-end brushes. I decided to try this after being sick and tired of cheapy brushes ripping my hair out on the rubbery handles. This brush is nice in your hand. The bristles give good tug on your hair while not pulling at all. I only ever very rarely have had any hair pulled at the handle.  My hair looks soft like a bunny, healthy, shiny, and fluffy!  It looks like I stepped right out of the salon. I have medium length extremely fine brown hair that is flat and lifeless otherwise. I got the blonde brush version since my hair is so fine. My cheapy brushes never made my hair look this good. I also use less product now since the brush really does seem to give my style more body even with less product. I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend this kind of money on a hairbrush, but my hairstylist uses them and loves them and whenever she does my hair, it looks amazing.  I went for the blonde brush because I have fine hair and it&#x27;s working great.  Glides through the hair, makes blowdrying easier and faster and my hair is soft and shiny.  Worth the money for sure.  I will be buying these as gifts for Christmas for my sister and mom as well.</li>
    <li> I just received my Ibiza round brush, and while the brush is a little pricey, it&#x27;s well worth it.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a boar brush for YEARS, and have spent a lot of money on brushes that just can&#x27;t get through my hair.  I have straight baby fine hair texture, but a lot of it, and my hair is half way down my back.  My hair snags and snarls by just turning my head.  This brush just smoothes it all out, and stimulates the scale in the process.  I wish I had found this brush 20 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> Such an impressive brush.  It just glides through my hair with the perfect amount of tension to create volume and shine.&lt;br /&gt;The company states that it does not catch or tangle and I found this to be true.  It runs through soooo smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I am not very good at blow-drys, but this baby made such a difference.  I have so many brushes, especially round brushes that I have collected over the years but none of them comes close to this.  I would definitely recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Awesome for blow drying your hair! That&#x27;s what I purchased it for. Makes your hair shiny and full of volume. Not as great for just brushing your hair.</li>
    <li> not sure all the hype about this brush. I bought it based on the great reviews, but this one is definitely not for me. I have long hair, which is a little fine and somewhat oily. I have always used boar brushes but still haven&#x27;t found the perfect one. the bristles on this brush are so hard that it pulls my hair and slightly hurts my scalp. Also, I don&#x27;t like the cork handle, its just ugly looking and looks cheap. the brush makes my hair very static and also makes my hair look dull and with no volume.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the junction between the head of the brush with the handle does not pull the hair, which is good, and the brush is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me, and definitely not worth the $50 price but maybe someone with a different hair type might like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping hair from getting frizzy</li>
    <li> This is good brush, I have used it a couple of times, I guess I expect every brush that I buy to do miracles and blow out my hair.  Its a good brush I really enjoy the cork handle.  When I used this on my hair it does give my hair a bit of shine!  I rated this brush 3 stars instead of 4 because of the price, its a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more.... saves me from going to the salon for a blow dry, simply amazing all I need is my Ibiza hair brush and my hair dryer...that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairbrush I have ever purchased! It does a great job of adding volume and shine to my thin hair. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
