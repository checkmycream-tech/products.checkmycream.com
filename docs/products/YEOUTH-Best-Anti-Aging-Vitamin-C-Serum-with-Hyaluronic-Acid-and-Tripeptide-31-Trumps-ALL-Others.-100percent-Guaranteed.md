<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice consistency ..no smell and goes on smoothly with no greasy after feel.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Skin feels 20 years younger!</li>
    <li> My review can&#x27;t be totally honest as I have not used it very long, but so far, it feels good on the skin, no breakouts, burning, etc.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used Tripeptide and I love it! I have recommended  it to all my friends. I really like Yeouth and will definitely order this product again!!</li>
    <li> Good product, skin feel soft and glowing. Thanks . I will order it again and recommend to friend and family</li>
    <li> Product works phenomenally well. LOVE IT! I will most definetly purchase again and with the holidays approaching quickly, I plan to purchase for a family member going through chemotherapy. She is going to adore the way it makes your skin feel and look, I&#x27;m sure of it!!! Wish I had known about this product when I was going through chemo. Five HUGE stars all the way around. Nice job YEOUTH : )</li>
    <li> First time trying anything like this.....goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and my skin feels soft...Enjoying the feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a month. It&#x27;s Awesome! I just turned 40 and was feeling like I could use a little help. I have sun damage and some fine lines.  My dark spots are fading and it does a good job filling in the lines.  I love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels on my face and under my makeup. It has made a change for the better for my sun damaged skin. Living in Florida there was alot of damage.  Pours are smaller.  Would give more stars but only been using for 2 weeks.  Will come back later and let you know more after a month.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Works awesome under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Best serum I have ever used. I&#x27;m 44 I have tried many products and this is the one .ladies buy a couple bottles because you don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.  It soaks in and softens lines around eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product through a promotion and I have been using it now for a couple of days I like how this product applies it makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated  ,it does not leave my skin sticky at all</li>
    <li> Finally, a skin product that is really making a positive difference in the way my skin looks and feels.  I have sensitive skin so it is hard for me to try new products.  That is why I am so glad I took the chance and tried “Yeouth”.  My best friend has been using it for a while and every time we meet her skin not only looks amazing but everyone thinks she is 15 years younger than she is.  She finally told me her secret is “Yeouth” and I had to try it.  Now it’s my skin that has a beautiful glow.  I have been using “Yeouth” for one month and now I can see a beautiful radiance from my skin.  My face feels soft and smooth and the small lines around my eyes and mouth have faded.  I cannot wait to see how my skin looks after 6 months!  You must give “Yeouth” a chance.  Believe me, you will love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It delivers exactly as it says. I don&#x27;t use a lot of different products on my face because I have very sensitive skin. But, I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future. My skin looks much smoother and clearer. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and I got it with promotion for $1. Only use it for a few day, but so far I feel more hyrdrated after using it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a week now ,I like the product , don&#x27;t let your face oily like other.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! After only one week I have noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> So far so good and a little goes a long way!! A little early to tell about any results as far as wrinkles goes :) Will stick with it and review again in a month. Loved the free lip balms, thanks!!</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff! Will purchase from you again!</li>
    <li> My favorite product.  love this item. Use it morning and night</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my skin. At my aged I have encountered dry skin which I never used to have, this serum brings continued moisture and diminishes my fine lines and dryness that age my face. My friends are wondering if I am &#x27;&#x27; more rested&#x27;&#x27; so I am definitely going to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Just noticing how much better and healthier my skin looks. I&#x27;ve had some sun damage, and it&#x27;s truly almost gone. My skin is smoother and the tone is so even!</li>
    <li> I recieved it when I was supposed to. I have only been using it for 3 days so I have not had enough time to judge whether it will work or not, but sure hope so:)</li>
    <li> It makes your skin feel really smooth - I love it.</li>
    <li> so far I love it.... just received it yesterday and applied it to my face before going to bed and then again this morning. Sometimes I have allergic reactions to new products, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any with this product. This product went on extremely smooth and only 3 drops were needed to cover my face. The bottle is pretty big so it should last a while with only using 6 drops per day. I hope to see some good results in just a few weeks with continued use.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to try this product, I&#x27;m turning 60 soon and don&#x27;t want to look my age for another decade if possible. I love the ease of use and no big production to apply. Here&#x27;s to a youthful 6th decade looking the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; 40!</li>
    <li> I tried a friends a few months back and loved this stuff. I finally got to purchase my own. I love the way it makes my skin feel and the visible results are amazing. This is a product that everyone should try thats concerned about beauty. IT WORKS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try out Yeouth&#x27;s Hydraulic AcidP plus,  and it does not disappoint.  It feels so soft and smooth going on. After 2 days of use I&#x27;m happy to say this is now definitely a part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Like it, it works on me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It moisturized my skin.</li>
    <li> Really great comes with free facial spray purchased one for myself and one for my mom absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week and I can already see the difference on my face. I get compliments from family, they say my face is glowing. I&#x27;m so happy with this product, I hope to get more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love the way this serum glides on.&lt;br /&gt;The jaw line immediately tightens up.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to all of my friends</li>
    <li> Im looking forward to seeing the results this product provides! It&#x27;s a gel and a little bit seems to go a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and so far I really like it. I look forward to seeing the results after continued use for 4-6 weeks. I apply twice a day, in the morning before I apply my make up and right before bed. A little goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or oily. So far so good. :-)</li>
    <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t been using Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus for very long or religiously every night I can see and feel a difference in my skin. I love how soft it makes your skin feel. Lines and pores do seem to be less noticeable, even my neck seems to look smoother. So far I love the product.</li>
    <li> A very good product..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.  I am 54 years old, have some frown lines between my eyebrows and large pores.  After using this twice a day, I have noticed a difference, my frown lines have softened and my pores are smaller.  The spray mist goes on evenly.  The serum is thick and takes a minute or more to dry and it doesn&#x27;t burn at all (that was my worry because I have sensitive skin)  I will use a moisturizer afterward because when it dries it makes my skin feel tight.  I was hoping it would lighten up my dark spots on my face by now, but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference there.  I will be patient and write another review after I&#x27;ve used it for 8 weeks.  But for now, pretty happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I really like it. I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet from every day use but I like how it feels when I apply it on my face daily. I really like the packaging and they including another serum bottle inside to use alongside the serum. You apply this before you apply your daily moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t make my face oily, sticky, or greasy.</li>
    <li> Received the serum but it left a white film on my face.  Not sure it works did not use it after that.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! I have slightly sensitive skin so I was a little worried about using this product, but it works great and is not harsh on my skin at all!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I can tell it works!</li>
    <li> very nice will buy it again</li>
    <li> What a great serum.  This stuff is making my skin looks years younger.  Highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but it does not irritate my sensitive skin so that is a plus. I haven&#x27;t seen all the benefits of this product yet but I&#x27;m going to give it a shot. Makes my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;m a little younger,so I don&#x27;t use it daily. Only once or twice a week. However, I love the feeling after I put it on! It&#x27;s very light and it makes my skin smooth!</li>
    <li> I have not been using it too long but  I like the feel of it when I put on my skin and then afterward&lt;br /&gt;put my moisturizer on. Too early to tell .</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast! I am currently using the product, can&#x27;t wait to see what it does!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product back to Nov 16 and received it with Prime no-rush shipping on Nov 21, 2014. I finally have chance to try it and have been applying this serum on my neck and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are reasons that I like about this serum. 1. First of all, the serum came with a bottle of free Soothing facial mist. I usually wash my face, spread the mist, apply this serum; then put my moisturizer on. 2. I personally don&#x27;t like strong perfume product. The serum doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell when I smell it from the bottle. 3. This product is effective. After using it for a bit over 2 weeks (about 1-2 drops each day), my face and neck skin does get tighter. It lightens wrinkles on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it also have some drawbacks. 1. Every once awhile, there will be white substance on the area that I apply this serum on. I tried only using the serum without the mist and moisturizer, the white substance still showed up on my face. 2. After applying it on my face, there is a strange smell. It kind smells like very very very light ammonia. I don&#x27;t like that smell at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used it for about a week, but I already see the difference. My skin is much softer, smoother. The serum is absorbed quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling or a residue behind. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it..my skin feels so incredibly soft after putting it on..I can notice a difference in my acne scaring and my overall skin tone</li>
    <li> It had been doing good. I need to use a little longer to see better results.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I&#x27;ll be checking to see how well it works in the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> the product package very well, very smooth.</li>
    <li> It absorbs very quickly and goes on very smooth. I like how I can use it along with facial products that I&#x27;m currently using. I feel like there&#x27;s already some difference by using it for only about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days, but my skin does seem more vibrant and softer. However this product leaves a white crusty film on my entire face once the product dries. Also it clumps up into a bunch of little balls when I apply moisturizer over it. If it wasn&#x27;t for the residue it leaves after it dries this would be a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> At first I had trouble with this serum, it has this weird scaly after effect. But then I figured that I was putting way too much on my face that when it dries, it leaves some residue. So the technique is to put just a tiny bit, just enough for your face. And bam! You can feel a tightening motion as it begins to settle. A little goes a long way. Remember dont put too much to avoid the scaly effect. Works perfect under makeup too</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually tried this yet but I&#x27;m excited to and since I just got it today, I&#x27;m going to start tonight! My box came with a small free gift of soothing facial mist which is a bigger plus for me! I love than I cant fit it into my daily regimen without worrying about too harsh of chemicals since I have sensitive skin. I also love that this is labeled &amp;#34;medical grade.&amp;#34; All of my regimen products are bought from medical spas that are under care by a doctor, so it&#x27;s important to me that the manufacturer takes the time to let me (the customer) know that the quality of this product is of medical grade. Also, I always look on the ingredients to see if the first ingredient listed is water because that means the product is mainly made of water when that&#x27;s the first ingredient listed. It&#x27;s not, which is great because I was expecting it to be when I ordered it. Awesome!!! I will update my review in a few weeks in regards to results!</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 stars because of the customer service. I only just received this 2 days ago, so results of the serum are not visible for me to tell yet. The serum is gel like, thicker than a serum. Not at all like in the picture where it is a clear like water consistency. But they did send me a facial mist as a bonus. When I opened my package, I was pleasantly surprised. It was even a full size bottle, like the serum. I love it when companies include freebies as a bonus. So I just wanted to say thank you. I will post my results in a about a month because I usually wait a month to get the best results. So far I am using this morning and night. I hope this helps. Thank you once again for the awesome service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 week and can already see great results. I have pretty sensitive skin - I have light complexion and freckles and  this product is gentle, but effective. Great buy!</li>
    <li> make skin more smooth</li>
    <li> This amazing stuff got rid on the dark spots on my face! I&#x27;m so amazed!</li>
    <li> [Wife purchased this]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While affordable, it does make the skin dry.  When applied foundation on face, would get some flakey things on surface of skin.  Cannot easily be absorbed by skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement in my skin since I began using this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Purchase this for my mother and mother inlaw and they both fell in love instantly. They said they have never used a cosmetic product that worked so well, so fast!</li>
    <li> OMG  This hyaluronic acid is the smoothest gel I have ever used.  I recently underwent electronic micro needle therapy at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I believe the combination of the gel and the facial treatment are the reason I see such a terrific improvement in the fine line between my eyebrows and a scar on my chin.  And, this 1 ounce bottle is half the price of a similar product that my doctor sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the effectiveness, the best part is the gel is thick so it doesn&#x27;t run down your face as soon as you use the dropper to apply it!  How many time have you had to wipe a runaway drip of another, thin skincare product just before it goes in your eye?  You wont have that problem with Yeoth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about this serum.</li>
    <li> I am still in the early stages of using this product but I am enjoying the benefits of this serum. I use it right before I apply my moisturizer and having even starting using some on the cracks on my feet and it actually works amazing. The cracks are beginning to smooth over and feel a lot softer. I look forward to continue to use the Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus Serum and continue to see its benefits.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using for a few days now and can already see a change in my skin. It feels fuller and much smoother. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice a bit thick I can see myself buying again</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described. The seller was very informative when I do have questions about the shipment. I&#x27;ve used the product for three days now and I definitely feel like my face become smoother. Some products in the market are greasy, and my skin is very sensitive to oily products. But this product is not greasy at all. It felt light when you apply it on. The only slight problem I have is that my face becomes a bit sticky with the product, but it does go away once the serum is fully absorbed into the skin.  The packaging might seem small, but one drop actually goes a long way. I was able to cover my entire face with two drops.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Bought it as a deal and absolutely love it, I will buy more when I run out!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin smooth</li>
    <li> Clears skin to a more youthful appearance and works on problem acne areas without clogging pores and enhances the clarity of complexion while eliminating dark spots!</li>
    <li> Been using Yeouth tripeptite for two weeks, and I do notice a slight tightening to my skin.  I will continue to use it &amp; hope for long lasting results.</li>
    <li> So far so good!!!! Ladies you must try I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> just started using the product and I&#x27;m seeing nice resluts.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I read the reviews on this serum &amp; had to try it out.  I have just started using it but love the way it feels on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water or irritate my skin at all!  I am so tired of using the TV shopping channels&#x27; products that are so expensive &amp; do nothing.  Or the products advertised in magazines &amp; being disappointed.  This is the way to go!  You don&#x27;t use much serum &amp; notice results right away.  I am really excited to use this &amp; hoping for the results in other reviews.</li>
    <li> only been using for less than a week but it feels great on my skin.  Wears very well under makeup too!  1-2 drops is all that is needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this product once daily before bed for a week and love it so far. I have no wrinkles yet but do have uneven skin tone and some pore problems. When I wake up after using this product, my skin feels smooth and hydrated. I have been using less foundation lately. My skin loves this stuff.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using for another week and this is now my go to product. I have also had no breakouts since I started using this (which I&#x27;m prone to). My dark spots and acne scars are fading. Seriously I love this stuff. Gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> Received the product super fast.  I&#x27;ve been using the product twice daily for a week now and haven&#x27;t seen no improvement. Will continue to use and hopefully will see the improvement soon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff my face feels amazing! Thank you for the opportunity to try this!</li>
    <li> So far been using it for about a week and no complaints. I have extremely sensitive skin &amp; this hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all. Excited to continue using this product to see where it takes my face!</li>
    <li> Works with mom so busy ! Yes!!</li>
    <li> I did not want to write a review until I tried it.  Well all I can say this stuff is awesome.  My face is glowing and I see less wrinkles aleady.  This stuff is not only affordable but it beats out all those other creams I tried including expensive cosmetics at the departement store.  I will buy again before I run out.  you have to put water on your face before and then with damp face put the serum on.  It feels great and fresh my face loves it.  I can tell.</li>
    <li> I paid for this product myself after reading the  rave reviews from other people - who apparently was gifted this item. This product is flakey, and my 38 yr old dry skin feels even drier after the application,  which is usually not the case with other Hyaluronic Acid serums.  The serum is in a gel form and it has no scent.  It feels pleasant during application and then dries matte.  I&#x27;m returning this item after trying it for 2 weeks of daily use because aside from no improvement in my skin,  it makes my foundation roll off - flakey is the only way to describe it.  It also flakes off when I use lotions.  What the heck?  Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type?</li>
    <li> This was given to my mom and she said she love how vibrant it makes her skin feel</li>
    <li> Great product! I haven&#x27;t use it for long but it gives a nice result already. I actually always like the result of hyaluronic acid. I bought an expensive cream that give good result on my skin</li>
    <li> Feel great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best serums  I&#x27;ve ever used... When I first applied  a tiny bit of serum on my face, I felt  my skin was tight..But later, I could feel my skin  really smooth...I really loved it... Don&#x27;t apply too much, just a tiny bit on your face twice a day ( the morning and the evening), it will make your skin smooth...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference!</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell, but it was highly recommended !</li>
    <li> I have had the product for a short time but am pleased and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum on my face every night before bed. I like the way it feels on my face and there isn&#x27;t a fragrance which I like. it&#x27;s only been a few weeks but I do like it and I will probably continue using it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! Allows your skin to just soak up moisture &amp; plump up!! Bottle lasts a long time-very viscous &amp; you need to apply only a very thin layer of it! I use this first then apply NuJu moisture cream on top &amp; my skin has improved dramatically. I will not ever go without this product-really believe it is making a big difference in wrinkles, skin elasticity &amp; pore size. No scent &amp; NO breakouts. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one.</li>
    <li> This product has completely improved the look of my skin! I had dark spots previously from old breakouts and since using this serum they are barely visible! I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> Refreshing serum, wait to absorb and relieve my dryness. Love the mist came with it too.</li>
    <li> Working very well... I can see the improvement... I know that it took a while for me to post but I wanted to see the difference &amp; I can see my brown spots going away... thanks!</li>
    <li> Have only used one week and I thoroughly like it. Anxious to see results after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I can see the wrinkles disappear are the eye area!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I notice how smooth it has been leaving my skin.  I have added this to my new skin regime.  I apply it every morning and night and I can see an all around improvement in the texture of my skin.  I would definitely recommend to all the ladies!@</li>
    <li> This is an amazing Serum. I do believe I sloughed a layer of old skin after one use but so mild on my skin. Excited to see what using for  a while will do..</li>
    <li> Great product. I was skeptical at first but this is sooooo good. Keeps my skin moistured and prevent it to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is super sensitive and most of skin products give me break outs and problems but this item is super good.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it and bought two after trying the first one.</li>
    <li> I Need an refresh on my face without surgery so far it has made my face a little smoother with using a college cream I bought from Amazon Mason beauty cream.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 4 weeks ago and have seen some improvement overall with the appearance of my face. I apply this only at night after I  have cleansed my face. It comes in a glass bottle with a dropper. The consistency of the serum is gel like and sticky, although a little of it goes a long way. I have received compliments on how my face likes softer in appearance and how clearer my face looks. I have notice a slight diminish of my frown line. Overall, this product is very good if you keep a daily routine, you will see results, but not right away.</li>
    <li> This is a nice addition to any beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Not what the picture says. The service deserves a 5 but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> Have had this product a week or so. Seems like a good product but still early to tell for me. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I really love the packaging as it came very well protected and I can see a difference in my skin tone in just two days!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you put moisturizer on after, as a little white residue can remain on the skin if you over do it like I did:)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;m using it on the back of my hands and I have seen a very noticeable difference with my age spots. My mom has been using it for 3 weeks on her face and some very deep set wrinkles in her forehead have disappeared plus a couple brown spots. Will be purchasing again for sure!</li>
    <li> This product is very good if you keep a daily routine, you will see results, but not right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this less than a week, but so far, so good.  From the 1st night I used it, the next morning my skin appeared to be clearer &amp; it seems that the frown lines between my eye brows are getting better.  I put on my regular moisturizer after this soaks in &amp; is dry.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens by 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great I saw results in just a few day after a week wow this product is a keeper and it not a filler so u don&#x27;t get that I&#x27;m melting feeling if u cry or go out in rain.works great on neck and Hands also!! I love this stuff hope it stays available on the market cause I live looking younger u will to I gotta go tell no show all my friends!!!</li>
    <li> I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find a product to soften my fine lines and uneven skin tone. I am so over the moon with YEOUTH VITAMIN &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; SERUM. The results were mind blowing!! I love this product and will continue to order it. I told my daughter about it and she is now using it as well!!</li>
    <li> Personally, I really like this product. I bought a hi dollar product but for my skin this is much better.</li>
    <li> It is a bit sticky at first however, overall good stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product, providing smooth and soft sensation to my facial skin. Only requiring small amount each time, and the 2 oz bottle certainly lasts me more than 6 weeks.  Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I have only been using this for a few days, once in the morning and once before bed. Love the results so far. My skin is so smooth and soft, and I am beginning to see a change in the texture and clarity of my skin. Pore size appears diminished already. Off to a great start!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been three days since I started using.  Skin is softer, redness is going away, pores look smaller.  I can&#x27;t wait to see after a couple more days what this product can do.  I used with moisturizer...and even put on neck.  I&#x27;m allergic to everything but so far...no problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after I read the reviews because my skin gets really dry in the winter and I&#x27;m about to be 50 and feel like my skin needs more TLC. I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long but it definitely makes the skin feel smoother and your makeup goes on really well after you apply it. I use it at night and sometimes put a moisturizer on top because it makes the skin feel tight. But I really like that feeling, It came nicely packaged and there was no damage to packaging. It would be nice if it came with a bit more information about the product and the application of the product but it&#x27;s not difficult to figure out. Anything that adds moisture to the face is a definite plus to me. And it&#x27;s a good price and I received my order quickly.</li>
    <li> I just start use it and seem I like I going to like it because when I put them on first and then my face cream after and made my skin so soft and I hope my age spot and other work. The delivered came in a day early and the  package was ok! If there is any change will let you know!</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping with wrinkles.  It does make your skin feel tight-I still used my regular face cream afterward and the tightness went away.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different Anti Aging  Serum&#x27;s and cream&#x27;s , and so far this is above all the best .I had a really bad problem with my neck . It looked so bad . I think they call it TURKEY NECK .  I also had lots of wrinkles above my lips and around my eye&#x27;s . and bags under my eye&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;They are not completely gone , but I can see a huge improvement .&lt;br /&gt; With the other products I used , I didn&#x27;t see much improvement at all .&lt;br /&gt;I will try to order more of this and hope it doesn&#x27;t cost so much that I can not buy it . This is the only thing that would make me stop using it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;  CAROLYN</li>
    <li> I have only had it for a few days but have noticed a difference!! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been useing Yeouth for 2 months and i&#x27;m no longer self conscious about the appearance of my neck. :)</li>
    <li> This is just amazing...love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I have tried a few and this one is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> Being the hopeful skeptic I am I thought I would give it a try. My face was peeling from my retinae. Within 2 days all peeling is gone and my skin feels so smooth. I am a true believer now.</li>
    <li> Like the product,it goes along way!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two months now.  After the first month I went to see my sister and she asked me &amp;#34;what are you doing, you look 10 years younger&amp;#34;.  I noticed that my face was smoother, and my skin was lighter.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had long enough to see any results, hoping for good results!!</li>
    <li> One of the best anti aging products I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Just Received my shipment, Don&#x27;t feel I have used it long enough for a review on the Serum&#x27;s results but I like the way it feels on my skin and my makeup looks really good!</li>
    <li> The holy grail of skin care has helped my scarring and wrinkles so much . I am 39 and people mistake me for thirty all the time</li>
    <li> Have only used for a short time, but liking the results so far! My mom has also used and also liked the results so far!</li>
    <li> I like the result it seems to produce but it is way too gummy and no matter how thin it is applied, it peals off and causes makeup to flake in clumps. Try to reformulate without the excess gumminess.</li>
    <li> I like the product and can see improvement. I wish it came in larger amounts so you could use it on your whole body like a body creme.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin moisturizer. Best product for the face that I have used. Many compliments!</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel! Great product!</li>
    <li> I would say this product is pretty good.  I use tritanoin cream (RetinA) so I need extra moisture and it definitely feels really good on the skin.  I am not sure about their claim to have Vitamin C - the strength would be minimal as Vitamin C is supposed to be kept in dark containers as not to lose strength. Otherwise, it is a nice product if you need a little extra moisture.  Not sure about the anti-aging claims.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to review product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It has helped the light wrinkles on my face and it looks as if the deep wrinkles aren&#x27;t as bad.  I actually see more results on my hands.  I use on my face, hands, neck, and chest and so far am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I can already tell a significant difference in my skin texture. I have also noticed lightening of my post acne scarring. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  It feels so smooth and tightens up the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gel like stuff that flakes on me. It actually dries my skin out. I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so I applied moisturizer over it. I looked like I wiped my face with wet toilet paper. No matter what I do, I get the same: NO anti-aging effects, lots of white flakes and dry skin. Will never recommend this to anyone. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Allergic reaction to this product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Feels light on skin and leaves it smooth and perfectly ready to absorb my moisturizer. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This serum is not good for me.i feel dry when I used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m like it. But I need to use it more</li>
    <li> So far, so good...I can see the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> this using it but not to much of a change yet, I don&#x27;t know how long I need to wait to see results.</li>
    <li> I ah e used it for 4 days.  So far I really like the results.  It only takes a very small amount to make a difference.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> I have only used a week. This product. Goes on smooth. Moisturizes my skin. Fills in my lines. No burning. Nice product</li>
    <li> I like it the product and it is working</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Besides the wonderful tightening of my skin after application, my stubborn age spots are REALLY fading fast and I have a very smooth feel to my skin! And my skin color looks healthy, pink and SOFT!! SO glad I decided to drop all the fancy, expensive stuff, and just go with what REALLY works! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks let you know in 6 weeks</li>
    <li> This tightens up skin instantly and pores disappear.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. With the first application I felt immediate tightening of skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> So far, is been a great product. I have extremely oily skin plus acne prone and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I used under make up and works just great. I will buy this again in the future. My mom &amp; me love it..</li>
    <li> I just started using it! It feels great on the face a bit sticky at first</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2-3 weeks now.  At first it was great, I thought my face looked a lot smoother and even toned (even though it was such a short time).  You only need to use one large drop of this all over your face.  Don&#x27;t use more than that or when you put moisturizer on it will pill a bit.  At this point I still think it&#x27;s a great serum but my pores seem to be getting more clogged than usual.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s this serum but I will update the review when I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Free bottle facial spray included. Have only used a few days. My face feels soft and hydrated. Would like to review after using for several weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use this every night and especially the night I derma roll. My skin is softer and looks a lot better. Getting better after each use.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I can feel my skin becomes smoother and shinny. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be lightening the &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; on my face and the back of&lt;br /&gt;my hands. My face also seems brighter...I&#x27;m glad I invested in this!</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to apply and my skin looks awesome!</li>
    <li> I just received the serum about three weeks ago, but I&#x27;m impressed with so many positive reviews. I&#x27;m looking forward to see more results. Right now, I like the way it feel on my skin. As a man, I have no problems in saying I want healthier skin tone also. So far the product has my &amp;#34;thumbs up&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;AGS,Sr.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I have been using this serum for a couple weeks and definitely notice a difference in the texture of my skin. It is so soft and even brighter. Be sure to follow all instructions. The serum should be applied to damp/wet shin and allowed to absorb and dry before applying moisturizer. A little really does go a long way. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I havent  seen to much result yet but I know I will bec Ive been using it for only a week. Why will you recomed as a moisterizer?</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a week now and am seeing good results. I would recommend the product to others.</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes the winkles almost go away. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> i dont like it i still dint get my other order</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a bottle, and yes, this stuff works!  My girlfriend commented on how beautiful my skin looked, and another asked me if I had met someone. (haha, no!)  I bought this to minimize pours, help with blackheads and fine lines.  I can honestly say that it is working. This serum is great, can&#x27;t wait to see what another bottle does!</li>
    <li> Any performance by a &amp;#34;hope in a bottle&amp;#34; product is very subjective.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look any worse, maybe the lines are a little less prominent.  Can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
    <li> On my third bottle, took awhile to see results? I am 55 and my skin was damaged. I will keep using my skin is less blotchy.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for two weeks and I can say it is working fine. As a matter of fact I am thinking of placing a new order.</li>
    <li> Helps decrease appearance of wrinkles and dark spots. Just use two drops twice a day on damp face, after it dries put on your favorite moisturizer cream. I saw a difference in a week or two. Very good product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;T see many changes  just  jeat.</li>
    <li> Like it but the jury is still out</li>
    <li> I bought two of this.  One for my sister-in-law, and one for my best friends.  Both of them love it~</li>
    <li> I love this product it tightens on contact and leave your skin soft and smooth and not slimy or oily feeling. I see visible difference in the texture and tone of my skin and decreased wrinkle appearance and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and a half! great price great price</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful for my skin. Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it. Must be used with a moisturizer. Goes on easily. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Although I have only used half of the contents, I can definitely see an improvement.  I am using it on the back of my hands and seeing improvement also.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Pleased with product. A little goes along way. face is soft and smooth. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to judge wrinkles but face feels nice.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;m getting ready to order my second bottle, made me a believer.</li>
    <li> I received the product, and just started using it.  Have not had a chance to see if it works.  I am optomistic.</li>
    <li> Not doing anything much better than my usual moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used this every time after cleansing my face. After finishing the bottle, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the appearance of my fine lines. But my skin texture did seem a bit smoother than before. It was however a nice cool feeling every time after applying and it was not sticky like other serums.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any change and it has been a few weeks.  Don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Been using it a few weeks now, not sure if I see any changes yet</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome serum. My face is so much smoother and younger looking. I will definitely keep buying more.</li>
    <li> My package arrived in tact, have just started to use this product so far so good.</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for about 8 days, but I do notice a difference in my skin.  I also notice that I am religious in using it twice daily, morning and evening.  I keep it handy, which is a reminder to be vigilant.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how regular use changes the lines and wrinkles I have begun to get in my face.  At my age, I have a very youthful look anyway, and it is being enhanced more now.  Loving it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I saw results in my skin immediately!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had ir longer now, and it fantastic.  Love it.</li>
    <li> From thievery first day that I tried it I saw a difference in my skin. Sort of like a tightening effect. Leaves your skin silky smooth and makeup goes on easily. I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> Thank you Iovr it. Will order again!!!</li>
    <li> I am no sure... This beauty treatment don!t help me in my needs.</li>
    <li> Well it didnt work for me but to many wrinkles all ready</li>
    <li> I love the way my face and hands feel and look after using this!</li>
    <li> I have been using for 3 days and my skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful going on-we will see how it works!</li>
    <li> Too sticky - threw bottle away.</li>
    <li> Another disappointing product that doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising. Fortunately I paid very little for this product.</li>
    <li> Have used it 2 x a day but so far haven&#x27;t seen any  improvement.  How soon should I begin to see it?  Have been using the product for approx a month but see no apparent improvements.  9/16/15</li>
    <li> Great product. A little goes a long way. My face feels softer and smoother. With fines lines almost nonexistent.</li>
    <li> nothing to compare to,</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It has all the right ingredients!</li>
    <li> Been using one week and I can see a difference. Love the way it quickly dries so you can put your moisturizer on.</li>
    <li> The face serum half of it leaked out because the top was not screwed over night tight enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for 4-5 days, so I&#x27;m not sure the review will be what it might have been later. I know about Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid for the face. Several high-end cosmetic companies include these in their products. So the price here is good. But this is drying and can sting a little bit. Would be nice if they included some samples of their other products so we could experience the entire line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks.  I noticed softer skin overnight and a reduction in fine lines after a few days. My frown lines between my eyebrows reduced significantly, and I can see a difference around my eyes. A light spray of rosewater to hydrate before applying serum, a little goes a long way.  I really like how soft my neck and face feel.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see actual results/differences in my skin but I love how it makes my skin feel right after I apply it. I apply a dime size amount and after it dries, I apply my daily moisturizer. I use this on my face only at night though. Great product and it comes with a mist! :)</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  It seems to really help hold in the moisture, is not sticky and does not break me out.</li>
    <li> I honestly feel that there is a difference in m wrinkles</li>
    <li> I saw noticably smaller pores and clearer skin in less than a week!  It&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
    <li> It really works.  A few minutes after applying, I feel a definite tightening of my skin.  Even those vertical lines on my forehead are diminished.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a very short time, but immediately saw results. It very visibly hydrated dry areas, especially on my aging neck. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Just received this product and so far so good.  Makes my skin feel smooth and anxious to see how it does over long term.</li>
    <li> Love the quick way it goes in.</li>
    <li> I just received this product the other day. Really can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s working or not...not enough time yet. Like all women I&#x27;m looking for that fountain of youth..if I find it in this product I&#x27;ll sing the good news out to everybody. Seriously my skin is really dry and aging. I contribute a lot of my problems with health conditions, but at age 76 I should be happy I&#x27;m around to complain. Feeling older when looking into the mirror sucks! Wish I could turn back clock and having started taking care of skin earlier..hint to all ladies. FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH WHERE ARE YOU?</li>
    <li> Good for aging skin!  Can feel it tightening!  Would recommend it for all ages</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply on the skin. After one week used on the skin sure see the difference. My skin feel more smooth.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, but too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> Still trying this product out.  I see some change but will continue to use as directed.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Sealed properly when it arrived. It contains 1 Serum and 2 extra Lip Balm. I prefer to use this product at night for better result. I apply a few drop and rub it in my face until it spread evenly. It really works! After few weeks of using it, I started to see the results already. It does not give any messy residue and any other side effect in my skin. I love the lip balm also. Overall, great, great product and affordable price. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I feel that this produch has helped some, but I am disappointed that I did not have better results.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I am 74 years young and trying to keep my skin from having that old ripply look. I have good genes so I am ahead of the game, but I truly believe that genes need help. I have had some medical issues and have been on pain medication and have noticed changes in my skin especially some dark marks. I have been using this faithfully day and night for almost 2 weeks and what I&#x27;ve noticed is a softening of the lines around my lips and cheek bones. Mostly I have a nice glow to my skin, it is smooth and my pores are smaller. I am surely looking forward to more changes with continued use.</li>
    <li> Makeup optional skin. It makes my face fill firm and soft. Oh and the brown spots on the back of my hands are fading away. I have tried a lot of different skincare products and this is one of the best! Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. It came on the date then said. I have only used the serum 3 times. The gel seems like it soaks right into your skin.</li>
    <li> The products arrived in a prompt manner and in good shape.  The tea is as always excellent and the Anti Aging Serum seems to work, although it is too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I cannot see any improvement in 30 days.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I had ever used. I am using the hyaluronic acid plus for almost 3 months and already see the results. My face is getting smoother.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long but so far so good.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing great results in about 30 days.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It works wonders on my skin and I have recommended to others!! I will definitely purchase over and over and over.......Tried another brand and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective.</li>
    <li> Product came very timely - I&#x27;ve only used it a few days, but it certainly makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice ant difference.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working really well</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference around the eyes!</li>
    <li> I can see some differences but think it will take longer to see a lot of improvement.</li>
    <li> I have used several more expensive products in the same category and it my opinion this is the BEST Anti Aging Product for me. It goes on lightly and clearly. I have seen a difference in the large pores on my face. Significantly reduced while using Yeouth/</li>
    <li> I have not notice any difference :(</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long, but so far it seems to work really well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few time but I think it is working!  It is very comfortable on my face and I can have it on all day without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one week and i do like alot! i do see my skin more radiant, smoother. I do use it in my hands and arms and i see a difference for the better.  thank you very much, i see myself re-ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for your money. My pores look smaller and it quickly absorbed into my skin!  I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks cant wait to see results after a month!</li>
    <li> The product&#x27;s consistency is very different than from the previous one.  I do not know if the change is for better, I seemed to like how it used to be.</li>
    <li> no changes so far  after 2 weeks used both products in the a.m. and at night</li>
    <li> my friends tells me it makes my skin looks younger.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  Once it dries it does show a tightening effect on my skin.  And when dry skin just feels smooth, no stickiness.  I use this under my regular moisture cream and am pleased with how my skin looks.  There are no miracles, but this does make skin look great and improved.</li>
    <li> It has dried out my skin and makes it flaky.  Not at all what I expected it to do.  I followed the directions but it does not work well with the moisturizer I typically use.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about 6 days, so I&#x27;m sure I have not given this product a fair chance.  I need to write again when I&#x27;ve used it at least 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I am quite satisfied with the results of your product.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few days now, I haven&#x27;t seen any results of it working so far. Perhaps it takes a longer period of time to see results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only five days I&#x27;m using this , yes I&#x27;m feeling good. Thanx  Yeouth !!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, it truly lives up to expectations.  It really enhances your moisturizer, protects from sun.</li>
    <li> I have not been using it too long yet, but so far I really like the way it makes my  face feel and look more refreshed</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars and may in time but I&#x27;ve only used a wk so far. i&#x27;m 53 and I am using every morning and night..although I do believe I like it. I agree with applying when face is moist, just finished harsh Mn winter. I am not really a review type person but I will be happy to let sll know my results in a fee wks.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on the day they said, beautifully packaged. Started using the day I received it, and beleive it or not I can already see a difference, the fine lines around the eyes aren&#x27;t as noticeable, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like the results my skin is so radiant</li>
    <li> I like anything with hyaluronic in it.  I think I will really like this .</li>
    <li> I have used this product a couple of times. It dries my skin and feels like there is grainy pieces in it. My lotion didn&#x27;t help the dryness.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Minimizes lines around my mouth.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. My skin is looking better every day.</li>
    <li> I been use for one month my darker spot it&#x27;s getting lighter . I love it!</li>
    <li> Did not notice a difference in my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Only used this for one week.  Waiting for miracle to take away the wrinkles...LOL.</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old. I have been using product for 5 weeks and I am amazed at difference in my skin. I am ordering a bottle for my daughter and another for myself.</li>
    <li> one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used&#x3D;&#x3D;you can actually feel it work..</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was skeptical when I first ordered it that I was wasting money (I&#x27;m over 60). But it turns out I love the improvement I have seen in my fine lines and the general smoothness of my skin. I use it mornings before my moisturizer and makeup, and at night before applying my moisturizer. It is thin and light, and I think it&#x27;s doing what it is supposed to do. Do I look 10 years younger? No. But there is definitely a change for the better in the appearance of my skin. I plan to reorder today.</li>
    <li> It was probably supposed to remove dead dry skin, but when I used it every day and then put on my moisturizer and make-up, my make-up would peel...looking awful.  However, if I did it at night and it peeled it was fine...I compare it to retin-A, so I am sure it is doing what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle and it really does work</li>
    <li> Have used as directed.  I have not noticed anything different with my skin, I guess I was hoping I would have something great to say about this product.  I will continue to use &amp; hope to see some improvement.  If I do, will certainly let you know.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I have only used it for a month and already see results in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> the Hyaluronic Acid plus Vitamin C &amp; Tripetide 3 has worked wonders on my skin, my face looks so much clearer and younger so it&#x27;s a keeper for me that&#x27;s why I am placing my order again, and will continue to reorder</li>
    <li> Just started using this product a few days ago and so far I like it. I hope it starts taking care of some fine lines I have. It had a present light scent, and the packaging was really nice and protected. It is a little sticky at first but after it absorbs, the stickiness goes away.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference at all since I have been using this product.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Could see the difference immediately.  Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement right away.</li>
    <li> Only used product for couple days but I honestly have to admit my face has more of a glow, skin looks healthier. I can&#x27;t wait to see results in week or two!</li>
    <li> Well, after 15 years of dealing with stubborn &amp;#34;little bumps all over my face that you can see next to a window&amp;#34; acne, that wouldn&#x27;t respond to anything, this serum smoothed out my complexion AND worked on fading scars. It was reasonably priced, it had great reviews, so I decided to give it a try.. I had been let down for 15 years so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything to touch my skin issues after all this time. I had tried seeing a dermatologist, Proactive, Paula&#x27;s Choice, Paleo diet, ACV, probiotics, even my own urine (yup) and nothing worked satisfactorily. All I was looking for was a scar treatment to even out these red and purple marks I got from trying to squeeze the junk out of some of the little white bumps.. But I got a smoother complexion, too. My new face wants to slap my old face for not knowing the cure was in.a $20something bottle of this.. Wish I had known sooner, it would have saved me a lot of physical and emotional turmoil. Would like to buy a lifetime supply of it, honestly, as it has not lost its effectiveness after all the time I&#x27;ve used it.. Unlike anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a review based on a 2x per day use for @ 3 weeks. My skin tone and texture has improved as well as dark spots are fading. A+ products</li>
    <li> It works for me.  This is already part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this for approximately 6 months.  I can definitely see a difference in the radiance of my face.  I use it morning and night faithfully.  I would recommend this to anyone who is concerned about having a bright look to their face.  I think my hands have also benefited from using it just by applying it to my face.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> This products works!  Have only been using for one month but my face is smoother and pores are smaller.</li>
    <li> Been using for 4 weeks have notice a difference in age spots</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for two days, but believe it or not in those two days most of my fine lines have disappeared. I was hesitant at first about buying it because all the serums say that fine lines will disappear. However, this really did what it said. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> skin feels smoother but no fantastic difference</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 4 days &amp; it is too soon to tell how effective it will be. What I can say is it only takes a small amount to cover your face. A little dot covers the neck. It leaves the skin smooth &amp; soft. It feels clean as soon as it dries. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and do see a noticeable improvement.  My skin feels softer, firmer and brighter.  I am impressed with these immediate results.</li>
    <li> I cannot say that I notice any improvement yet.  I had  high hopes, but not yet</li>
    <li> my skin feels softer. I would like to give it a little more time for the dark spots. I actually ordered some for my daughter to try.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It goes on so smoothly &amp; dries non sticky. It&#x27;s great before your moisturizer. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I feel I can already tell a difference in my skin! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m 60 yrs old but, people never guess my age they usually think I&#x27;m about ten years younger. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about two weeks now &amp; &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; my skin cleared up from breakouts &amp; almost all of my dark spots are disappearing. My skin feels very soft too! If this keeps happening people are not going to been able to guess my age at all! My fine lines are disappearing too along with the loose skin on my neck. Great results, love the product!</li>
    <li> I love this Serum. I have used very expensive products that do not compare with this product.</li>
    <li> I have always taken Vitamin C orally in high doses because of Linus Pauling&#x27;s studies on it.  I never get sick because of it and people would tell me that I have nice skin.  Now that it is in this liquid form, it works even better.  I started diluting Vitamin C with water and would apply to skin.  This makes it much easier.  I love it!!  How come the price was so much higher than my last order.  It was a different brand name called BELTAIE, or something similar.  What is the difference?</li>
    <li> So far so good, only been using it for a few weeksn too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.... Pure Junk !!!! Only gave it one star because its required .</li>
    <li> I really can see a difference. YIPPY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days, and so far, so good. I have very sensitive skin and using this product has not been a problem for me at all. My skin already seems a little smoother, which is surprising, since it&#x27;s only been a few days. It was also nice that I had a 25% off coupon to use for my first purchase. The seller, also sent an email follow-up after the sale, which was a nice touch!</li>
    <li> seems to be a good product, too soon to know</li>
    <li> Works good, will order again</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, very plumping and age spot disappear in a couple weeks, I will use this stuff for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s that good, hands down the best!!!!</li>
    <li> From the first day my skin feels wonderful. Will be ordering more as soon as I see what the end result of a month looks like</li>
    <li> I love this product so I bought 2 more bottles ! Try it ladies... I think you&#x27;ll find that you love it too....thank you, Goldie!</li>
    <li> great product will order again. . huge difference, works on hands too</li>
    <li> My skin feels moisturized all day and all night long.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but do feel my face tighten and looking more refreshed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Goes on better with slightly moist skin. My skin is looking better, fine wrinkles are less.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My skin is really showing improvement, less wrinkles and a lovely glow!!</li>
    <li> love, will order again</li>
    <li> I am using it now ca. 14 days, I cannot see much difference</li>
    <li> no huge difference...but maybe a little</li>
    <li> Great , exactly as ordered</li>
    <li> Luv it!! I will buy again :)</li>
    <li> Amazing serum, wish I could bathe in it.</li>
    <li> I think this is going to be &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; for me.  I have to take a lot of medication, so my skin had  looked tired, grey and had lost it&#x27;s glow.  Then early this year (March 2015) I purchased YEOUTH from Amazon UK.  I love this product, and recommend it to anyone who wants to have that youthful glow.  I will be 61 years old this year, and my Darling Grand-daughter, aged 5, says my face feels soft and lovely when she kisses me.  My daughter will be 40 years old this year, and I will be buying her a YEOUTH Serum so she can start as she means to go on.  Have absolutely no doubts that this product will work for you if you are thinking of trying it, but don&#x27;t expect the real results until you have been using it for more than 2 weeks.  I got immediate results, which just kept getting better; you won&#x27;t be sorry you tried it.</li>
    <li> Sticky,gummy and flaky. Make my face dry. I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Does not work .  Olay7 works best</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Amazon&#x27;s service is the best.</li>
    <li> my skin feels so smooth...will buy again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I just don&#x27;t see a lot of difference in my skin. I will continue to use it up and see is there are any better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually had several compliments about my skin since using this product! I have already ordered more! I will be using this product again and again!!</li>
    <li> I have only used it for 3 weeks, however my skin feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have only had a week, but I know I am going to love seeing the results.  I still love the C Serum and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Love the way my face feels after I put it on.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the texture of my skin after trying the Hyaluronic Acid Plus and am excited to order my next bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and have found it to be e best product of this kind I have ever used before.  Yiu can really feel and see the difference after just a few uses.  Love it !</li>
    <li> Have not usrd long enough to see results</li>
    <li> I think it has helped me to restore elasticity to the skin, I feel satisfied. However, I must clarify that I apply the product before the night cream and the day I normally use and have been used previously</li>
    <li> This serum really does the job!  Very happy with how fast I received it.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have used numerous anti aging products but this product is by far the best! I could see a difference in my brown spots in just two weeks and also the fine lines. The best $30 you&#x27;ll ever spend.</li>
    <li> I started hearing about this product and was searching to find it. I wanted to find the one that had the combination of the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C combination. This was recommended to be the best. Everything I heard was very positive, so when I found it I was extremely excited. I have been using it at least twice a day and it has only been a week. I have noticed a complete difference in my skin for the better. You were absolutely right about it amplifying your favorite moisturizer and sunscreen. I don&#x27;t think I could live without this now, after having used it. I am 63 and have fairly wrinkle free skin, but have noticed more wrinkles with age. I am counting on this product to help keep the wrinkles under control so that my aging is done gracefully and naturally. So far it has  proven to be a positive and most satisfactory choice to go along with my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Just using it for the second day. So far everything is ok  I was very impressed with Amazon......you said I would receive Yeouth on Sunday and sure enough I did.  I am using Yeouth  as directed and so far no problems. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about a week, but love the way it makes my face feel. I will follow up after 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is just fantastic. Much cheaper than the &amp;#34;oz&amp;#34; product on TV and starts working from day 1. By the second week others had noticed a difference in my skin tone, light wrinkles are gone, even my freckles are lighter in color which is a big plus for me,lol... My skin is back to looking the way it did 10 years ago and that&#x27;s just from 3 weeks use... I was carded the other day while trying to purchase lotto tickets... She couldn&#x27;t believe i was 44 yrs old....Would highly recommend this product to family and friends...</li>
    <li> Received my order in a timely fashion. Have been using for a few days can see some difference, but still early. Like the way that it goes on and the way it makes my skin feel. Hopefully the longer I use this product the more results I will see.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this because of it&#x27;s simplicity, adding several products into one, each of which has been recommended by an aesthetician.  So far, so good!  No stinging like many hyaluronic acid products, just enough to know it&#x27;s working!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a short time but my skin feels soft and moist after using it.</li>
    <li> This product works so good and I love it and I will continue using it ....</li>
    <li> Not really sure what this stuff has in it, but I can say that my skin seems to be in much better condition. I use in conjunction with my regular face wash and lotion. I put the serum on first after washing my face and then apply face cream. I just hope If I decide to purchase more it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  I have been using it since July 1st twice a day.  I have followed all the directions exactly but its more money I spent wasted.</li>
    <li> These combined ingredients are scientifically proven to work. Finally they are together at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Only a few days into use and my skin is looking better.</li>
    <li> I may give this product more stars as I use the product for a longer period of time. With only one week of use, I am starting to notice that my dark spots on my hands, arms, and chest are lighter.  My only negative feedback is that I would like a thinner serum as at times it is hard to get it out of the bottle.  Time will tell, but I may reorder if the dark spots continue to fade.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, saw improvement in just the first time I used it. I use it right after my toner while my skin is still wet.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a week and see subtle changes and will continue to use. I will use and buy another bottle hoping for some magic. Then I will post a before and after photo</li>
    <li> I read about this serum, I have been wanting to try it.  I like it so far.  It feels so good on my face and neck.  It will take a while to notice how it works, I will have to reply again when I see the results.  Shipping was fast.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff made a difference to my skin felt much more hydrated and less wrinkled</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days but can see noticeable improvement in texture and color of my skin. I&#x27;m 46, and don&#x27;t have terrible wrinkles, but I&#x27;m starting to see wear....and I have sensitive red spots. My hands WERE starting to look dried up and old, but I&#x27;m rubbing what&#x27;s left from my face to the back of my hands. That&#x27;s been dramatic. You still need to use a good moisturizer after this, but I always use natural things: Emu oil, coconut oil, various essential oils and the occasional Lush brand product.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this, but I have to say I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;ll update my review if it changes.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feels smooth to the touch .</li>
    <li> Fountain of youth in a bottle! Within days of using this revolutionary product I started noticing a difference in the texture and look of my skin! My skin is smoother, the fine lines are decreasing and my pore size has diminished! After spending my younger years in search of the darkest tan I am spending my later years looking for the highest quality serum to reverse the damage I caused to my skin.</li>
    <li> I think it is a little too early to evaluate the product but as of yet do not have any complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this . Am getting ready to order again . Can&#x27;t live without it .</li>
    <li> I like and would purchase again. I use the vitamin c and hylauronic every night, now it is just one product to use not two. I like the feel it gives my face and feel it is doing its job.</li>
    <li> After you put it on and let it dry, then you go to put moisturizer on, and it causes your skin to rub off .Just use it at night with nothing over it and see if that works better, and If I notice difference in my skin..Will know more in a month or so</li>
    <li> I like it.... I&#x27;m sure my skin looks softer... I will order again... :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product and plan to continue using it!</li>
    <li> works very well I saw results very quickly</li>
    <li> I used my first bottle because I was trying to rid a single &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; that appeared under my eye after what I believe was due to a rash I had around my eyes.  Initially I thought it was working or at least &amp;#34;filling&amp;#34; the crease daily, once in the morning and once at night.  I started noticing after application and adding my daily toner/moisturiser (Cetaphil cream) my face would start flaking once I put on my Neutrogena sunscreen.  It looked as if I had dead skin everywhere, but it was merely the mixture gelling together creating an annoying flaky mess I would need to wipe off.  The exact same would occur if I didn&#x27;t apply the sunscreen and used my BB cream.  So in the end, I would suggest not combining anything other than your daily toner/moisturiser with your Yeouth serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a week but I do feel the difference in my face. Now I&#x27;m going to try the yeouth face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used it now for one week and I must say I already see results. Best stuff I ever used.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and I try to keep her happy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel I am seeing a difference. I&#x27;ve been using this awhile and I still have some lines around my eyes and on my face. I specifically put the serum there but they are still there. I keep hoping for results, especially since so many have seen them.</li>
    <li> This is my second order.</li>
    <li> Love it!! The product exceeded my expectations. Recommend it highly!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> too soon to tell .ask me again in another month</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I just starting using this and can see the difference already.  I also use it on my hands and can see the improvement-less noticable wrinkles!  I am ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 2 months and I love my skin.. My skin looks more youthful and radiant</li>
    <li> My skin is showing definite improvement.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product...</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My skin look great.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in the short time I have used it.  I have always worked out in the heat which has taken a toll on my skin I wish I had known about this product years ago.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few days.  Seems to working.</li>
    <li> Love it,see a big difference.</li>
    <li> Used it 3 days 2x/day and see so much improvement. I Am so happy I decided to try it. Will definitely continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Using it night &amp; day but not ready to comment yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product along with hyaluronic acid but already love it, will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for three days but so far I like it.  It will take time to see that real results.  I have noticed the one dark spot on my face is starting to fade which is great in only three days.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it makes my skin feel and helps repair sun damage.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. I have used this product as directed for several months and I can now honestly give you my assessment. After examining my skin using a magnify mirror I was happy to see improvement to fine lines around the mouth area .</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days, I&#x27;m not seeing anything different, I will continue to use it for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months, now...  More actually, I&#x27;m on my second bottle!  I use it everyday, twice a day, as part of my morning and evening skin care routine...  After washing and on damp skin, I apply the Yeouth Vitamin C Serum and leave it to dry for several minutes before applying moisturizer...  I actually have been able to see a difference in the clarity of my skin and very often, I get compliment on how soft and nice my skin looks!  It&#x27;s very nice to hear...  A little goes a long way, but I already have a back up bottle in my cabinet...</li>
    <li> It burned my face.I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> so far so good.. love the way it makes my face feel</li>
    <li> It is okay but I really haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my face. I do like the way it goes on it is very smooth.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference in skin after weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this serum for 2 weeks , buttery skin already looks less wrinkled!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it FOREVER if it keeps improving my skin!</li>
    <li> Love this product will buy moisturizer too Amazing results in such a short time/</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for a wonderful product and for the special gift included I loved it as well A+++</li>
    <li> Great for my combo skin! With being pregnant my skin varies and this product can be used for areas other than my face as well&#x27;n</li>
    <li> OMG! I love this product! I have very dry skin and I can tell you that it works so much. Most products leave a sticky feel on your face after its applied. However, this product leaves your face smooth! I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!! Highly recommend to everyone! This comes with a very nice package with fast shipping. It also includes 2 FREE chapsticks which I didn&#x27;t expect. It is really awesome! Love the surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the product, it absorbs very fast. not sticky at all. works well with lotion and product. Keep my skin hydrates for the whole day. My skin is so soft and smooth after using it. love it!</li>
    <li> What I noticed about this serum that really stands out from others is that is a much thicker formula that is almost gel like. This means it takes longer to absorb and can feel a little tacky at first but it definitely works to lock in your skin&#x27;s natural moisture. That being said I found it to be more effective when followed by a lightweight moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Fast. Really really fast.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. The packaging and consistency tell me that this is grade A in quality. I was very impressed with the special spray most gift that was included and after following directions and using the products, my face feels wonderful. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see the actual difference but it feels amazing. This seller truly cares about customer service and I really love everything about my experience with them. I think this serum is worth a try!Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> it is effective! Now my 2 daughters and my husband want 1 too, so I have to buy 4 more using your coupon.</li>
    <li> Have only used fir a week, so no testimonial yet! Skin feels good.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet leaves a white residue.</li>
    <li> Great product that truly works along with vitamin c serum. Good point, it is very affordable on Amazon.</li>
    <li> the serum is very rich and I did feel my skin get more moisturized. However, it is hard to apply to apply to the whole face.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Started using it and am very pleased with the results. I think I will be using this product always. Beats all the products I used to use. Price is just perfect for me. :) Thank you for prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue am so disappointed...</li>
    <li> It was only ok just like all the others out there.</li>
    <li> I was wondering about the ingredients because it&#x27;s not totally natural pure hyaluronic acid like it says.  It contains phenoxyethanol.. look it up.. it is an bacterial inhibitor and also can cause all sorts of nasty things like exema and worse.  I don&#x27;t want that one my face. Pitching it today. Gotta read labels before purchase.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is a treatment that actually repairs fine lines, wrinkles &amp; age spots.  But what I do see after I apply this product is that my face tightens up for the time that I am wearing it.</li>
    <li> It is still early days for a full evaluation... but I have to say in the 3 or 4 days of use, my complexion looks better. I really don&#x27;t care about wrinkles (I regard them as a badge of honor) but the the dark spots and visible pores  seem to be improved and I will be ordering more of this product. I loved the special offer but wish they had some larger sizes.</li>
    <li> Great transaction &amp; price! Only had for a few days, but I can tell a difference! A+++++++</li>
    <li> Almost a week now since I started using this product, Not even a small sign of improvement of my face, I applied it twice a day as instructed, lets&#x27;s see for another week.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and can&#x27;t use a lot of the anti-aging serums on the market because of that. This one is different. I can use it on my skin without it adding to the oil. Fantastic. It also seems to work well. I have been using it for about 4 months and can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon&lt;br /&gt;Embroidery On Demand</li>
    <li> I have had the product for about a week now and I really really like it!  Lately I have been noticing more brown spots on my face and nose and thought I&#x27;d give Yeouth Serum a try. So far it has lightened most of the spots and one seems to be gone completely. It is also great for fine lines and wrinkles. I use the serum twice a day as directed followed by Jojoba oil and my skin looks and feels great.  PLUS, it makes make up go on and stay on wonderfully.  I look forward to prolong use and the potential for even better results as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 people tell me my skin looks amazing and this is the only new product I tried, love it!!! thank you, I am back for more</li>
    <li> Have only been using the serum for a week and only once a day but I can already tell a difference!</li>
    <li> It seems to tighten my skin when I put it on but haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic difference in my wrinkles like I thought was to have hapoened or hoped it would. Jeannie Boyd</li>
    <li> I DONT ENGLISH,PLEASE WRITE ESPANOL,.NO UNDERSTAND LAS INSTRUCCIONES.</li>
    <li> I have been using Yeouth for 1 week; on 77 year-old skin, there is not much difference &amp;#34;yet&amp;#34;. I will soldier on and I do like the product very much!</li>
    <li> Just starting to use  I really like the way you give complete instructions on line. Bold. Easy to read. 5 stars. Now I am going to see if anyone just says anything different about skin. Not looking for a miracle just something that helps skin. I made one mistake I didn&#x27;t use coupon code thought I put in.  That&#x27;s not like me.</li>
    <li> This product really works! My dermatologist even asked what I was doing different!</li>
    <li> Wow, wow, wow..... That should have said it all.  Where to start? It&#x27;s been only a week since I receive this product and with the first application followed by a few hours of sleep I saw an amazing difference in skin tightness and pore size. I have tried it all, pills, creams, even been under the knife more than a few times.  This product works miracles.  I have been using it for a week, I cannot imagine what my skin will look like in a few weeks...it looks so tight and smooth. I will order a bunch more and give it to my mom, my sister, my mother in law.. I found a weapon against aging.</li>
    <li> I am buying this for the 2nd time.  Believe me, I know the face product stuff...too much, really.  This one actually makes a difference.  I&#x27;ve had a facelift and 3 chemical peels, have used several products, so I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve been around the block with face products!</li>
    <li> The BEST packaging of ALL the anti-aging Vitamin C Serum that I have used as if I was opening a gift, but the serum dried out my face. I used it quite a few times to make sure it was really drying out my face and had the same result each time.  I really wanted to give this serum a 5 star rating for the &amp;#34;over-the-top&amp;#34; packaging it came in but unfortunately the serum did not work for me.  However it should not deter anyone from trying because we all have different skin types.  With all the 5-star reviews it has, apparently it worked well for a lot people.  I will give a 5-star Seller Feedback because the literature and instructions inside the package were great, and the follow-up tips were very helpful. The packaging was impressive and my order came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Both vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid, are my skin needs, the product is good</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum!  I&#x27;ve used more expensive versions of this product and like this one much better. It is thicker in consistency so a little goes a long way. My skin has never looked this good. The added moisture stays with me all day and I notice a reduction in fine lines and plumpness of my skin. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look young and fresh</li>
    <li> I heard about this product. Everything I heard was true. I am enjoying it, and will most likely go for a refill when this is getting to the end.</li>
    <li> Just started using the product, I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid Plus Vitamin C &amp; Tripleptide for about 2 weeks, and I have notice my skin is much softer and my make-up goes on a lot smoother. I would recommend this product and do plan on ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Not sure I would buy it again. Feels good but don&#x27;t see any great differences yet. Been using it morning and night faithfully</li>
    <li> I have not used it enough to see if it will help at all but So far I like it. UPDATE.I am on, I think my 4th bottle which I purchased today. I cannot imagine not using this every day.  I am not young but my skin looks so much smoother. I had a brown spot although not really dark...it is fading and when I apply makeup it can hardly be seen. .</li>
    <li> I see result after one time uses!</li>
    <li> I saw the advertising by Facebook.  I spent thousands of dollars in laser but didn&#x27;t work.  I decided to tried and product is outstanding, the expectation surpass my goals.  I bought for the second time because I&#x27;m crazy about it.  I totally recommend this product.  My face looks smooth and younger and I had less than a month using the Best Anti Aging Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Skin feels soft and it def helping with the absorption of my other products.</li>
    <li> First, I received the item as described and on time. I&#x27;ve been using the product for 6 days now and I really saw some improvements on my face. I&#x27;ve got oily, acne prone and sensitive skin. I also have huge pores at 43. I noticed that my pores got smaller and my face glows when I wake up in the morning.  The thing is, I also use rose hip oil after this serum as moisturizer and I love the effect on my face. On the third day though, I noticed a rash-like thing on my right face. I thought I was allergic to the product but it made me think otherwise coz I should have had it all over my face if I was allergic to it. So, I might have just held on to something and wipe it on my face. But anyway, those rashes are gone now and my face glows, got lighter and soft. I am not sure if it was because of this serum or the rose hip oil. All I know is, the combination of these two works on me and it has just been 6 days. Can&#x27;t wait to see further results after using it for long.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any effect. Nothing good, nothing bad. Likely just another useless cosmetic product being hyped as the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Love love this product. It&#x27;s my second bottle. I&#x27;m 68. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but being a sun worshiper in my younger days I had dark coloration on my skin. This product has lightened them considerably. Also, I received the product within a day or two of ordering and on the day they said I would have it--on SUNDAY.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Still did not see a great diff , I guess it will take longer than expected!!!</li>
    <li> I like it plan to order more products.. I also plan to shop the whole line of skin care!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give you a real  thumbs up.  I do have bags under my eye&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;and  sure hope it works.  I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> Love it,  bought two for my daughters and they are very impressed with it too</li>
    <li> I love this serum! Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This was delivered within two days.  The directions were easy to follow.  After 5 days my skin feels softer and wrinkles appear diminished.</li>
    <li> This product is great!</li>
    <li> I enjoy usiing this product.  I have only used it a few times but I think I feel a difference in my skin. It did leave my skin feeling a little dry so I put on mosturizer right away.  Please do not set me up for a automatic refill, I would like to order as needed.  One time I bougt something for 19.95 and then the next month I received another one but the price was 99.99 and I was unable to return it.  I do recommend this product for older ladies, which I am,</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels on my skin! Seeing results after 1 month.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It does what it says it will do and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> The top was loose, the bottle was only half full.  I kept it anyway because I was anxious to try it.  No results yet</li>
    <li> Definite improvement in diminishing skin discoloration. I am planning on keeping after these darned dark spots and I feel like this product is truly helpful and affordable. worth the price !!!!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement after 2 months of use</li>
    <li> Turns white on my skin and have seen no positive results.</li>
    <li> Just used a couple of weeks so far with results showing.</li>
    <li> Just started using the product a week ago, have not noticed a change yet</li>
    <li> My skin feels great after using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a reorder. This product is great. I have tried endless products to get rid of my dark spots. This actually works. You do need to wait the&lt;br /&gt;8 weeks for the best results. It works on the fine lines and wrinkles as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Started using this product a couple weeks ago, and so far, I really like it.  Economically priced and seems to get the same good results for aging skin as more expensive Vitamin C products.  Thanks for keeping this great skin product affordable!</li>
    <li> I noticed a remarkable difference after 3 weeks use. The lines on my face, didn&#x27;t disappear, but were reduced significantly. I will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Pleased with results so far.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels and my skin looks good</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the results. Would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> purchased this for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;We both definitely saw a difference within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it... Still the improvement shows.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. My skin looks healthier. I would record to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell if this will defy my aged face - but I have high hopes.  It is fragrance free, and can be mixed with other creams, so I do like it.</li>
    <li> It turned white and had a sour smell after I opened it for nine months. It was clear when I first received it, so I dare not to use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  So easy to use. So easy to see results. A friend of mine told me about it, so I ordered it and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;Its not sticky and not greasy.... I felt and saw the results in just one use!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.... Dedree Hoyt</li>
    <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t seen any change yet. So I&#x27;m not sure I will like</li>
    <li> This product delivers what it promises!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a few days. So I can&#x27;t give a good review at this time. I will in a few weeks.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t have the exact ingredients of vitamin C, nor of the hyaluronic acid.  I sincerely hope it works good, If so, then I will continue to purchase it. Would like to know the amount of vitamin C and etc. Thank you</li>
    <li> With this anti&#x3D;aging vitamin C serum, I really noticed the difference with my skin as it looked more youthful.  I like the texture and will definitely continue ordering this marvelous product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My skin is baby soft, looks brighter &amp; i feel that it also tightens my skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  will wait and see ....just started it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It really does nourish your skin!  I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> I have using this product for a couple weeks now and I have notice a big difference in my skin. My face feels softer and firmer. I&#x27;m also looking younger. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 weeks and, while my skin feels soft and smooth I haven&#x27;t really noticed a reduction in wrinkles. I&#x27;ve also been using it on the back of my hands where I have some brown spots beginning. They may be very slightly fainter but not by much. I&#x27;ve decided to buy one more bottle. If there isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference by the end of this one I won&#x27;t continue.</li>
    <li> I notice a significant difference in the tone and texture of my skin. I will reorder and continue using this product.</li>
    <li> easy to use morning and night, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like the thickness of the serum.</li>
    <li> I definitely feel the difference and think I&#x27;m start to g to see a little difference</li>
    <li> I read reviews with mixed feeling. I hope I would be in positive reviews like others were very pleased after using. It appeared that it did not work for me. I am envying of those that were working for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 62 yrs old &amp; look younger than my age due to olive skin with very oily t-tone. my nose pores are large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it on time {Oct 26th} with nice free Yeouth lip balm with pretty color &amp; I liked the theYeouth lip balm very much.&lt;br /&gt;I used the serum 2 times a day for 1 week with one drop. the serum was not watery &amp; used a small drop to fresh washed face right away. Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing noticeable change improvement on my face for more than 1 week+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then I used 2 drops for 2+ weeks in hope it would improve my mature very oily skin. But no, it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;It did not seem to increase oiliness and easy to apply smooth serum which was good.  I continue using it till it is all gone to see if it is really working for me as I am hoping so. Still no improvement. I guess it does not work for me like it did work for others.  NO, I will not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I applied promotion code for $1.00 and it stated that promotion code was not ready like I was what. I got full price instead of $1.00 promotion.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I am 71 years old so you can&#x27;t work wonders but I deffin. see an improvement.</li>
    <li> I AM TOTALLY ENJOYING IT!  and hope to order when I am out of it....thank you for asking!</li>
    <li> I can definitely tell the difference areound my eyes when I use this product.  My skin seems to feel smoother.  I am an 82 year old woman.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Thick enough to spread and light and non sticky when dry. I&#x27;m noticing a difference around eyes, between brows and around lips.</li>
    <li> Works well! Caught it while it is 30% off in a FB ad and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I can see a definite difference after using this product for six weeks ..I specifically use it around the eyes and mouth where the wrinkles are deepest. It has most definitely softened the look of the wrinkles and has seemed to help to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; those areas.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the promised results</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my face feel, but I can&#x27;t really tell a big difference in my appearance.</li>
    <li> Gold in a bottle its all I have to say this stuff is AMAZING!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product and even as a Mary Kay representative, I can say I was impressed.  When I first began, I could feel it going to work on my skin.  Fine lines and crêpe look seemed to disappear.  As a 57 year old woman, you can imagine how happy that made me.  I had friends tell me that I never seem to age.  I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three months. Almost immediately my skin felt smoother. Within the first 1 1/2 months I could see a reduction in fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes. I will definitely continue using this product!!! I have used lots of different high end products and have found the best results here. Try it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Only giving 4 stars, I think I need to use it longer and more often to see the full results. Using it about once a day for three weeks and have noticed a difference in my sun spots being lighter already. I think the wrinkles mighttake a little longer, plus you are suppose to use it twice a day, but I barely have time for once...</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this. Got a deal on a Facebook ad.  Used for two months.  No noticeable changes.  The only positive is is helps dry out oily areas of my face.  As for anti aging....not a chance!  Won&#x27;t  buy again.</li>
    <li> Plumps deep line wrinkles immediately.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product a few days ago. I received it very quickly and not only that I can feel it tightening my skin and feels smooth.  I just received it so in a few weeks I will update. I have a couple light scars that I&#x27;m hoping will fade. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product is sort of a gel, but when you smooth it on it glides on your skin. Two drops for my entire face and neck, a little goes a long way. It is fragrance free and is not harsh on the skin. My face feels refreshed, silky, and smooth. Very excited to have found a product that actually works and is affordable.</li>
    <li> Lovely packaging looks expensive and I love the misting spray.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel really nice. I use this after my toner. I only received the serum a couple days ago, so I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see anti-aging benefits, so time will have to tell on that one.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Wonderful packaging. High end product. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Why do I get the feeling all these reviews are bogus?  Because, most reviewers have only one other review.  Some of the reviewers review dozens of beauty products a day.  This prevents me from even giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Makes me look years younger!!!! I will definitely recommend to anyone that wants younger vibrant looking skin in just days!!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I did not have seen much difference.</li>
    <li> This serum is excellent!  It makes the skin feel soft and smooth beyond description. I have not used it long enough to truthfully say that it reverses aging or that it repairs skin damage, but it definitely makes the skin feel wonderful and is worth trying for yourself!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing a very noticeable improvement with this but I think perhaps slow and steady and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I would use it again but it was the sample price that got me to try it, don&#x27;t know that I could afford to buy it outright. I would really like to give it longer to work but don&#x27;t see myself being about to budget it in.,</li>
    <li> Like most women I am constantly looking for the Fountain of Youth.  Due to many years of sun damage and smoking my skin was&lt;br /&gt;lackluster, wrinkled and sun spotted.  I have tried many products, some costing into the hundreds and none have given me the results I have gotten from Yeouth.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks and the texture and color of my skin is greatly improved.  The sun spots are starting to fade and so are some of the wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
    <li> Product is light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, appears to be helping with skin tone and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! I have been using this product for about a month and can tell a definite difference in fine lines, wrinkles, and texture of my skin. I use almost every night after cleansing. I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Silky smooth and glides on nicely!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Good price!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for 2 weeks now and my skin is softer and less oily. No breakouts either!</li>
    <li> Just a think layer is all you need so this bottle will last you a long time!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the small bottle fool you, a little is all you need to do the job. As soon as I used it I could feel a difference. My skin felt a little tingly when I first applied it, but that went away soon. I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks, and I feel that my skin feels plumper, and looks like I have a glow. I am very pleased with this product and it had become part of my daiy routine.</li>
    <li> Totally LOVE it !!!! Feel very good and make my skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> Great impulse buy for $1.00!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works like a $100 serum it&#x27;s nice on the skin no funny small and it made my skin really soft</li>
    <li> Great item- I have very sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
    <li> This serum fills in tiny fine lines,and leaves my skin slightly smoother and firmer.it is CRUELTY free!which I look for in skincare,also free of parabens and unecessary chemicals?my sun spots seem to be less visible also.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my mom n she love it  I can see the it&#x27;s working on her ..</li>
    <li> I love it. I will order more!</li>
    <li> My skin feels a lot softer.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle.  The skin on my chest hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since I was in my twenties. It also works great on my hands</li>
    <li> This is the 5th brand of Hyuralonic Acid that I have bought.  It is by far my favorite.  It has made my skin smoother and plumper, yet somehow seems to tighten my pores too.  And it works FAST!  I&#x27;m already beginning to see my fine lines disappearing!</li>
    <li> Been using ...don&#x27;t notice much.. I guess with continuous use it may be better in time. Takes a lot for me to really like a product ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week now using it twice daily haven&#x27;t seen no improvement. Will continue to use, it does make skin soft.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the jewerly. Just like in the picture.</li>
    <li> so far I like this product a lot. Waiting to see results on my face.  Thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Very nice product! Great to alone or under a moisturizer or spf! Doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup application and my skin looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It goes on very nice and smooth and does not leave a sticky feeling and soaks quickly into the skin. I didn&#x27;t have age spots before i started using this so i can&#x27;t say if it gets rid of them or not but i can tell you that i feel the youth clinging to my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and absolutely love it so far! My smile wrinkles have decreased, skin is smoother, and pores are noticeably smaller! It feels great going on and makes my skin feel wonderful without being heavy or greasy. I will definitely be purchasing more of this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Yeouth for about 2 weeks and so far I like it.  I think my skin feels a little smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but so far, I really like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day since it arrived.  I took a &amp;#34;before selfie&amp;#34; to be able to measure changes in my skin.  I have one dark spot on my forehead that I am watching.  I like the texture of the product.  I do wish the instructions were more precise.  What is &amp;#34;a small amount?&amp;#34;  That this is made in the US is a plus for me.  Send another email in a month.  I&#x27;ll let you know what changes I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Only my second day using and can already tell immediate differences. I will continue to use this. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. ! I was using a different serum similar but def not as good. ! I will purchase this again no doubt at all !</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I use it twice a day and have seen steady improvement for the 4 weeks or so I&#x27;ve been using it -- and I have ordered another bottle for a friend. It&#x27;s quick, easy and effective!</li>
    <li> Two days and I have definitely noticed my skin was softer!</li>
    <li> After using it, you will see your skin became brighter and smoother! Yeah, you should try it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s different from anything I&#x27;ve used before.  It feels a little funny going on but it really works.</li>
    <li> I only received the serum a few days ago, but I already love it.  Very fast shipment, and a surprise bonus, of two lip balms, included.  I&#x27;ll update the review, after giving it time, to show the effectiveness.</li>
    <li> great for a gift I got this for my mother. She says its very comfortable, some serums can burn and for her this one doesnt</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, this product will last a long time and I&#x27;m so excited to see the results in the long run.</li>
    <li> I do like the product, but I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days so it is too early to tell if it will live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so much better since I began using this.  My tone has evened out and my pores seem smaller.</li>
    <li> Really haven&#x27;t seen or felt any changes in my skin. Won&#x27;t buy it again..</li>
    <li> After three weeks of using the serum twice daily, I have not notice any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using it since it came to my house and I really do not see a difference in the lines around my mouth and the 11 on my fore ead.  How long before I see a difference????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and am really pleased with the results. A little goes a long way, so it is good value for the money.</li>
    <li> My first application burned so bad, I was afraid I was allergic to the product;  I washed my face until it stopped burning. I haven&#x27;t used it again.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, it has improved the surface quality of my skin. But, I will not be buying it again once it is gone. I have found something that works better.</li>
    <li> IF YOU WANT A BRIGHTER COMPLEXION THIS IS YOUR SERUM!! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with delivery &amp; product</li>
    <li> i can see a difference.</li>
    <li> bought it for girlfriend, she loves this!</li>
    <li> It smell, if it smell like friut or flower, will much better.</li>
    <li> This is actually from Kathy Haaland.  This is a wonderful product--much better than hyaluronic acid without any additives.  I put it on my hands and I could see the difference very quickly.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is proprobably one of the better serums that I&#x27;ve tried. The texture initially can feel a little sticky but once you apply to your face, it spspreads pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin def feels more moisturized using this product.</li>
    <li> This product is well packaged comparing with other 2 serums that I received.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this as gift for my mom and hopefully it would work just like others&#x27; review here.</li>
    <li> Better than expected! Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days and already feel that it is working to tighten my skin and smooth out fine lines!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet so will repost when I try it.  I&#x27;m hoping this will work on a dark spot not sure if it will work but I&#x27;m hopeful.  Good price &amp; quick shipment.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a few days, but so far it is doing good. I like the way it just melts into my skin. My skin does seem to look a little better, but going to just give 4 stars for now, will update later.</li>
    <li> I had heard about the combination of this Serum but didn&#x27;t want to signup for an automatic shipment each month from other advertisements!  I am very satisfied with this product so far and the price was very reasonable!  I can order as needed which is important to me!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s  a combination of two of the most highly recommended serums/acids you could be using on your face right now. I am definitely going to order again!  Plan on using a moisturizer with it though, as this soaks right into the skin. I like to use my Derma Roller first, apply this, and after it has soaked in, I end with Organic Coconut Oil as my moisturizer. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> seems to work well, use it @ night....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 and I have small lines around my eyes and upper lip. Ive been using the product for about a month now and have seen no improvements. I am a skeptic and I don&#x27;t think anything exsist that will improve your skin unless you inject or cut.</li>
    <li> Received product in a timely manner and loved the results my skin already looks smoother ,very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> After three days my skin already feels better !</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to have any kind of opinion . I</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month now.  See no change in my skin.  I actually like my Rosehips Serum much better.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to do what is says.  So No.  I would have to give it 1 star if anything.  I don&#x27;t get all these people saying it is wonderful.  They must not have wrinkles in the first place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other Hyaluronic acids and this one is the best one ever!!  It has made my face feel great, hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, and has filled in some of my fine lines.  I love the fullness this product gives my face.  Definitely WILL BE BUYING AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Used for 1.5 month now, totally love it!! easy to open and apply on my face!! i felt my skin became more smooth, and less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Good product with good value</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. The cold weather is generally harsh on my skin, now I feel protected.</li>
    <li> excellent deal! thanks a lot</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel rejuvenated! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Feels great and caused no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to do what it says...serum is a little sticky tho...otherwise pretty happy with it</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough</li>
    <li> Love it！I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> using this product for a week now…I love it…skin looks even tone, and tighter!!!</li>
    <li> I tried to be consistent with this so I would see results but I wasn&#x27;t and saw now change for the week I used it. I am going to pass it on to a friend, Otherwise, its a good size and has an ok smell with gel consistency.</li>
    <li> Received it quickly very pleased</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week now and have noticed the difference. My skin is starting to feel tighter and smoother.  I will try to update after i have been using for 8 weeks. But so far I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months and I like it!</li>
    <li> I think it is doing what is promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is doing what it promises.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It feels very nice when you apply it to your skin, and goes well under your moisturizer and makeup.  As to the effects, not sure I see much difference, but time will tell.  My wrinkles look about the same, but the texture of my skin has improved.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell a whole lot of difference.  May just be me though.</li>
    <li> 36 yr old guy here- It did slightly decrease the color of some spots</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with this product.  I will return it.  When I put my make up on it rolls and peels off my face. Not a pleasant product for my use.</li>
    <li> Only product I have ever tried that actually worked. I have wrinkles under my eyes. I could tell a difference after only one use and now I have used about 75% of the bottle and definitely improved.</li>
    <li> I think everyone should try this fantastic skin improvement serum. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> The serum was just okay, but after a couple weeks of not seeing any noticeable differences, I went back to using a great lotion from Trader Joe&#x27;s that&#x27;s made with vitamin C.  This serum probably works well for others, just not for me.  I will say that it doesn&#x27;t burn or aggravate my skin, which is a definite plus.  Devine&#x27;s cream works better for me, as does the pre-mention lotion from TJ&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I used Best Anti Aging Vitamin C Serum by Yeouth. I applied it as recommended morning and evening. I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s and take good care of my skin. I layered this serum over a rich botanical toner and followed by a turbo anti wrinkle moisturizer. After about a month I decided I liked the results and reordered. I am on my second bottle and notice softer more luminous skin. In the hot humid south I use very little foundation makeup. Using this serum and my other skin care products allows me to feel more confident my skin looks healthy, even without makeup. I don&#x27;t notice a huge change in the lines but I do feel my overall complexion looks more youthful than many women my age.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a complete review.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Works very well! I even did a test by applying it to one hand and not the other.. What a difference!!</li>
    <li> Waiting to see results.  Will update review after I&#x27;ve used for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum! It&#x27;s the only one I have been able to use during the day, under my make-up.  I have very oily skin, and this serum is very light...not tacky feeling at all.  It absorbs all the way.  If anything, I think it helps reduce the oil production.  It definitely helps to make pores seem smaller.  I think it helps my make-up last longer as well.  I like being able to put something so beneficial under my make-up.  I used similar serums prior to getting this one, so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen huge changes in my overall skin appearance.  Again I think it&#x27;s because I already used products with these ingredients.  I will continue to purchase this product when I run out!</li>
    <li> Nothing over the counter can compare to this serum! I started noticing a difference after just a week of using the youth serum! I will stick with this one</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s perfect material. I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Hyaluronic Acid Plus serum for a few days and I&#x27;m already in love. I apply it after washing my face and top it with a moisturizer after it&#x27;s soaked in and my skin stays moisturized and supple all day. I am usually soooo dry and have a hard time keeping my skin from looking dull, and this serum is working wonders!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  I&#x27;ve used it for a several days now.  No notable difference in skin so far but I like the way it goes on. Not greasy and skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful; one of the best products I have used - I am a young &amp;#34;70&amp;#34; and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> just started using and right now I am pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> it is like a sticky paste that peels off under your cream</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> This is good as a moisturizer.  As for the other claims - I havent noticed any anti aging properties at all.  And it hasnt lightened by spots on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;But this is good at keeping moisture in your skin.  Its slippery when you first put it on.  But when it dries, its actually dry.  You can wear your normal makeup over it without any problems.</li>
    <li> After only 3 weeks of twice daily use I love the feel of my skin. Very smooth and silky soft. There was a very slight breakout initially but it subsided after day 5. The lines and creases around my lips and eyes are softer and less defined. This is an improvement over the Vitamin C Serum I was using previously. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Totally impressed. The best I have felt about my face. It has even closed the bad pores. Have already ordered a second bottle in case you run low on product.</li>
    <li> After using this product, I have changed the face of tight....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use with this product and lotions , facial moisturizer becomes more</li>
    <li> This is a great Vitamin C serum.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is one of the best cosmetic products I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried the best that Origins, Estee Lauder, Aveeda and other premium brands have to offer). Although the package insert cautioned me not to expect results before eight weeks, that must have referred to the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles and the shrinking of pores. The skin on my face, neck and decolletage became noticeably smoother within a week. I appreciate that I can use the produce along with my regular cleansing and moisturizing regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the serum on the backs of my hands, I saw my age spots disappear within three days (I&#x27;m 68), so I&#x27;ve started applying a drop or two twice a day to my forearms, too. After a week&#x27;s use, the skin on the backs of my hands seems plumper and more elastic, as well. I hope that the company comes out with a version as a hand cream, which would make it easier to use on hands and arms.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week so cannot really give a true review yet...</li>
    <li> This stuff has worked wonders on my skin.  I love the texture and look of my skin since using it.</li>
    <li> Good service and delivery. Products is brilliant and works for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Vitamin C or hyaluronic acid On my face unless it was done during a facial by a Professional and paying tons of money for it.  This product feels so refreshing. I love how it makes my skin feel.  Have always been a sun bunny,  and had sun damaged skin. The improvement of my skin is amazing...</li>
    <li> I received the Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus for the purpose of this review.  This opinion is mine.&lt;br /&gt;While I have no wrinkles (yet), I do anticipate them and want to do what I can now to prevent them later.  I do have an age spot under my eye that I&#x27;m hoping to reduce the darkness of.  I like that the serum doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like some Vitamin C products do.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover what I consider to be my problem areas, under eyes and forehead.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the product , saw not one little difference in the feel, look or texture of the skin.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This is my 4th purchase.  I normally use a heavy moisturizing cream on the top prior to bed.</li>
    <li> Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus Serum contains only the best ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, Tripeptide 31, and Vitamin C. This trifecta of ingredients works to reduce sun damage, increase collagen synthesis, improve wrinkles, and reduce pore size -- simply put, it makes your skin look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Hyaluronic Acid Plus Serum both morning and night after washing my face. I just put a few drops onto my fingertip and smooth the serum onto my face and neck. A little bit goes a long way... I only need a few drops. The serum really goes on nicely. It is absorbed quickly and leaves my skin moisturized, but not greasy or sticky (like some other products!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If your skin on your chest or the back of your hands is a concern, you can apply Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus Serum to those areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> did not see any difference in my skin, except some of the dark spots lighten.</li>
    <li> If it were possible to give zero stars, then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d do. I have used this product twice. Both times I felt a strange tightness and the most unpleasant sticky/grainy feel to my skin. I suppose these two ingredients are all the rage now, but combined in this formula they make an awful mess. I would return it but it is easier to toss it out than to repackage the stuff.</li>
    <li> I received the product a few days ago and started using it right away. It does make my skin feel smooth as I apply it but can&#x27;t honestly give a rating until I&#x27;ve used it a little longer. So far I like it,</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using it for about one month and the improvement in my skin smoothness and tone is amazing! I would love a body lotion of this product! (Our account is in my husband&#x27;s name but I&#x27;m the wife and I&#x27;m the one using and reviewing this item)</li>
    <li> Have been using this for just a few days.  It absorbs quickly and is non greasy.  Skin feels good and smooth.</li>
    <li> Have seen improvement is skin already. Be sure to apply to slightly damp skin.  I don&#x27;t limit it to my face.  Have only used for about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Great results, the first time I applied it I could feel and see the difference, this product is amazing!! I will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks. I can tell a difference in my fine lines. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Noticeable changes was so fast with in the first week. I really love it. I will continue using Yeouth anti aging vitamin C for a very long time. Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful product that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I love the serum my skin has never felt better.</li>
    <li> I really like the serum with Vit. C.  It seems to firm my face and is easy to use, could tell a difference in a week. thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few days and already I can see an improvement in my skin.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have not used it long enough to know if it works.</li>
    <li> To tell the truth i havent seen any change. maybe it is just me and my skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel very smooth in the morning! I only use it at night though because it doesn&#x27;t do well under makeup.</li>
    <li> Fountain of youth in a bottle!  Within days of using this revolutionary product I started noticing a difference in the texture and look of my skin! My skin is smoother, the fine lines are decreasing and my pore size has diminished! After spending my younger years in search of the darkest tan I am spending my later years looking for the highest quality serum to reverse the damage I caused to my skin. It is non greasy and I apply the serum after cleansing and then apply my moisturizer and foundation. I have noticed that I am needing less foundation because the few age spots are becoming lighter!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this on my skin!  Great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product I have put on my face so far. I have tried everything and this product does exactly what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do. I only used it twice and I see such a big difference in my skin. When I apply my foundation I always look shiny throughout the day and have to use powder to get rid of the shine. I apply this before my foundation and it leaves my skin looking beautiful all day with no shine. My skin feels tight and my pores look smaller after just one application. I will be buying this for now on and getting rid of all my other products I have that promises to work but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! Doesn&#x27;t take much and my face feels so smooth. It also makes my moisturizer go on so much better. Will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and will reorder. It is early yet, but I can see positive changes in the feel and texture of my skin. My skin looks brighter and feels smoother.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this serum.</li>
    <li> Starting see some results with the eye wrinkles -- maybe another month of using it will show more results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month.  It appears to be as effective as my prior, more expensive regimen of Vitamin C &amp; E and a separate hyaluronic acid preparation.</li>
    <li> I love Yeouth...have been using it for the past two months and have seen a significant improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product, goes on smooth and nicely under moistureizer.  Have been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely an amazing product. After just a few weeks of use, my skin is looking fabulous! Can&#x27;t believe the difference. Even my age spots are rapidly fading.  In addition,  Yeouth is a great company.  Fast shipping on product, very nice packaging and free lip gloss samples. Love the lip gloss. Would give this company 5 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> great product! Within two weeks I noticed more even skin tone and healing of some problem areas. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly...and only a drop or two is needed. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. My skin is feeling and looking smoother after a few weeks use.</li>
    <li> My 66 year old skin has responded very quickly to this product! I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it after a month&#x27;s use! Hope you&#x27;ll soon have a bigger bottle so I can use it on my crepey arms as they need more than a daily workout!</li>
    <li> This as such a nice feel on the skin.  I always hate anything that seems slick or slippery.  This is absorbed quickly and leaves a nice soft finish.  I have used it for a few days and already see a difference.  Also, thanks for the extra lip treat that was included with the package - a sweet surprise.  I am looking forward to seeing how continued use will improve the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> love this product.  very light and really works on the skin - wrinkles and pores are less visible.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> When i apply on face, it&#x27;s very soft but i don&#x27;t know if you can apply in the morning. Since when it dry, it will leave a thin white  past looking on you face or maybe i just apply too much. But overall ,it&#x27;s great product and very gentle , you should able to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Really great to smooth my skin and helps with the absorption of my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. it smoothes out wrinkles and leaves skin soft. After using the first bottle, I&#x27;ve ordered four more..  Waiting for delivery. Jina S.</li>
    <li> smoother and softer skin after only 3 days.</li>
    <li> I received an offer to try this for only a dollar.  I have been using vitamin c serums regularly and recently began dermapen treatments at my dermatologist for old acne scarring, large pores and fine lines.  He used hyaluronic acid on my face after my first treatment and I liked the moisturizing effects so I decided to buy some of my own.  I mix a few drops of this with a few drops of my vitamin c serum and apply it to my face every morning and again at bedtime.  I have seen excellent results in the past 4 weeks after adding this to my regime.  My skin tone feels plumped up, moisturized,  and the color is the most uniform it has been in decades.  Texture is very smooth. My scar pits and large pores appear shallow.  I&#x27;m very happy I decided to try this.  I plan to reorder but the price is a little higher than I&#x27;d usually pay so I&#x27;m still on the fence about that.  I eould, however, recommend this to anyone to is interested in making improvements to less than perfect skin.  (I&#x27;m female, 49, sensitive combination skin)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazingly soft and evened out my skin tone after just a few uses! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Remarkably leaves my face feeling smooth. I would recommend this if you have sensitive skin since it didn&#x27;t leave mine feeling dry or irritated.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really doing anything...</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a week now so far i have seen good results :)</li>
    <li> I see a difference in my skin just within the week of using the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> 6So far I am loving this product.  I really do see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, bonus two lip butters, serum good grade.</li>
    <li> I can see the difference.  It is a small bottle but since you use such a small amount it lasts a really long time.  i also like that  it doesn&#x27;t havean odor.  I put a little moisturizer on afterward.</li>
    <li> High quality product with beyond reasonable price.  My skin can be easily irritated if I used some products with acid, but this one has not give me any rash.  My skin looks better.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my grandma and she has yet to see improvements. It hasn&#x27;t made it worse but no results yet but there is still time.</li>
    <li> I have almost used the first bottle of Yeouth Daily Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid plus Vitamin C and Tripeptide-30 Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I use it under my moisturizer and my skin has responded positively-very soft and I notice some lines and spots diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue using.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have tried theYeouth lip balm.  It is creamy without being greasy and leaves your lips smooth.  It also has just the faintest hint of a vanilla scent which is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> the serum is so light and easy to spread; it is just what I am looking for a daily serum and the VitC is a big plus too.</li>
    <li> I love it when serums like this come in glass bottles vs. plastic. This provides greeat moisture to your face, perfect for those who live or visit dry climates. Winter is coming up, this would be a great gift to put in a pampering gift basket! I apply this at night before bed, vs in the morning. It gives my skin time to absorb it before I put make up on. Remember to test out a small patch of skin before you apply all over!</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom and she loves it,works great, makes her skin super soft, can&#x27;t wait to see further results, and will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this company has such a mouthful for a title for this product, and I have never heard of this brand before.  Still, it came at an awesome price, so I had nothing to lose trying it.  I am notorious for buying and trying skincare products, spending over a thousand dollars a year trying new things in the hopes that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;Well, this stuff works!  Using it twice a day reaps faster benefits, but my skin feels smoother and looks younger -- it even softened the deep wrinkles in my forehead.  The serum is a gel-like consistency; a little goes a very long way, and it soaks in very quickly.  I also use it on the tops of my hands, which is pretty much the first place I show my age (34), and my hands are less damaged-looking and brighter!</li>
    <li> My face feels soft. Love it already</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this for my brown spots. Works great!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any improvement in wrinkles.  Please cancel any future orders.</li>
    <li> I love that this doesnt leave your skin feeling greasy or oily. Its light weight and you start feeling rejuvenated as soon asapplying it. Results come quick. Im thrilled with this purchase and definitely see myself using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I bought this product originally for my mother but she didn&#x27;t think it would work so I used it. Immediately after applying you can feel it tightening up your skin. Im also very happy it has no smell, nor does it leave a film on your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice product! I love it.</li>
    <li> great product and quaity! love it! i recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I just love this product and will be using for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;It does all it claims to do and my skin is looking great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference.  I like the fact that you only use a little and it goes on easily. But, I would have liked to see more results by now. One good thing I noticed is applying lipstick is easier since using Yeouth.  I still have the little lines at my lipline, but maybe they are smoother and therefore the lipstick goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> Cant see it helped and I surely thought since it was acidic it would have a little sting so you know its working. I think it is sticky also</li>
    <li> I like it, it moisturized my skin but no oily feeling.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much.My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> been using the product for almost a month.  Haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet. Will try for another month and hopefully have a better review.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle.  Very good product.  Ships quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty old guy and never thought I&#x27;d be using stuff like this. Now I wish I had this years ago. My skin is so dry and damaged from too much sun, wind and age. My wife, bless her, got me to try hers. It felt so good going on that I figured it was OK. Now after just a few weeks I can actually feel and see the difference in my skin. I had a sore red patch next to my nose and now it&#x27;s gone. I got my own bottle now that I have in my travel kit so I don&#x27;t miss it when I&#x27;m on the road. My skin seems to be so much healthier now.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My mom and I use it everyday.  I like that its not oily but it smoothens the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two-weeks and I&#x27;m loving the results.  I apply it daily on my face, neck and upper chest area.  My lines on my face, chest and neck have soften and my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> Great product.....High end results without the high end price tag! Goes on super smooth and feels great, even under make up. I could see improvements in my overall skin complex within days. Definitely a must-have!!</li>
    <li> Have been using for a couple of days. My skin feels a lot better.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this serum.  I have been using it for about two months and have noticed a difference on my neck and chest area. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> love the way it does and makes my face feel</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly, it was nicely packaged and even came with a free full size gift!  You only need a small amount, dries quickly. Left my face feeling soft and toned. It&#x27;s very affordable and makes for a great gift, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and company.</li>
    <li> All is Great, Quick Shipping, Product Seems to be doing what it claims. But only one week in, or less. Very happy. Thank you</li>
    <li> I did not get out of the product what I wanted/expected. I would not recommend or order this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid Plus for about two months, and I am very happy with the results. The fine lines on my face and throat are significantly reduced, and my skin looks very healthy. The product is very easy to apply, and only a drop goes a long way. Although the product will last a long time, I have already purchased another bottle to make sure I do not run out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s really amazing how it helped my skin to glow and smoother.</li>
    <li> Was excited to test out this new produce and planed on giving it a good review, but unfortunately the &#x27;Soothing Facial&#x27; bottle had a defected spray head that squirts out more like a spit than a mist. Because of this, its hard for me to give positive review.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;m so glad that I choose it! Not harsh on the skin or tingling it goes on smooth and dries fast with no peeling after application! ! Will Def get again!</li>
    <li> Just started using but so far so go</li>
    <li> I think I was looking for this to be a miracle product to fix all of my skin problems.  This did not fix all of my problems but it did make for a smoother appearance to my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this company.  They sent me the product that I purchased as well as a free full size product that compliments the one that I bought.  What a great way to please new customers.  This serum is slightly thick so that it is easy to apply.  It has a dropper which you squeeze to dispense the serum.  I apply a drop on each cheek, nose, chin and forehead.  I then gently rub it into my skin.  I allow it to sit for a few minutes and then I apply a moisturizer.  It has made my skin firmer.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Overnight my skin became smoother after just one application. It absorbs into the skin quickly. My skin did feel instantly tightened though not dry. I followed with a moisturizer regardless. You do not need to apply much so this product will last considering its size. I hope to update with long-term results in the future.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product, fast delivery , price and customer service.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for approximately two - three weeks. I used it for a few days but noticed a slight break out on my face. I stopped using it for a week and started again but noticed the same bumps. When you put the serum on you will feel your face tighten a little but that goes away once you put on moisturizier. I have normal to dry skin which may not be great for this product.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. My skin feels more hydrated only after a few days!  Love it!</li>
    <li> What an awesome product at an awesome price!  Quick delivery plus the bonus gift was a nice unexpected surprise!</li>
    <li> Really great quality!</li>
    <li> I had to come on here today and brag about this product!! I have only used it for a short time but I am beyond excited at the results. Just after the first night of using it i felt a change in the way my skin felt, it felt fuller more plump !! In the morning when i woke to wash my face I was shocked how soft my face felt !! At My age I feel if we can help stop the aging lines now ..then we can feel better about  our age!! I want to look the way i feel and I do not feel 45 so why should I look it!! lol  I can not wait to continue my use with this product and see what the long term results will be in a few months!  Thank you for producing and introducing me to this amazing Serum, it&#x27;s given me the results i have been looking for !!</li>
    <li> WOW I love this serum and I am very glad I took a chance I will definantly be buying more. A must have for any women&#x27;s beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was like all the other serums,butafterusinvit fortwoweeks I czn really see a difference! The lines around my eyes andmouthare much less visible!! Defiitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Just started using...no difference in my skin yet.</li>
    <li> It really locks in the moisture on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using your product everyday since I purchased from Amazon.  I have followed the instructions as were written but I must honestly say I can not tell a difference.  Perhaps more time is needed.  I like the way the product feels but have been disappointed in results.</li>
    <li> i have used it for a week..  moisten your skin with pure water..  (spray)  use  pea size.&lt;br /&gt;this company provides great tips.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  Have only used it a few days &amp; seeing results!  I highly recommend.  The fast delivery made me happy also.</li>
    <li> I have not used it long, but it definitely srems to be helping already!</li>
    <li> Fast on time delivery! Great packaging!&lt;br /&gt;Ample amount of product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;The serum is light and soothing, no irritation at all! Works great with or without makeup. Great ingredients to give me new skin!</li>
    <li> Only used for a few days , but so far it&#x27;s very nice. Absorbs quickly , which I like.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines and saggy gowls disappear !</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing....and I have tried it ALL and I do mean ALL.  The face &#x27;graveyard&#x27; under my sink is a sad sad place!  But I&#x27;ve found my &#x27;happy place&#x27; with YEOUTH Tripeptide.  I have been using it for 7 days, just 7 days and I am absolutely amazed at the difference in my skin texture and tone....smooth, glowing (I&#x27;ve never glowed before-glistened yes, but glowed-no!).  I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the newest skin care treatment and I may have landed on one that will stay in my daily regime for a long time to come.  Glad I took advantage of your offer....you&#x27;ve hooked me!  NOW, everyone else reading this review-go forward and BUY/TRY....you won&#x27;t be sorry (No I do not work for the company nor have I been compensated to share my thoughts).</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and product works well</li>
    <li> leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I am lovin&#x27; it.  My face feels so smooth and soft and fine lines are disappearing</li>
    <li> It was a bit dry on my skin, but not a problem after applying some cream on. Overall it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the serum and have seen some minor changes</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I can see the difference already! (Santa Feliciano)</li>
    <li> I like the way this product makes my skin feel and look.  Does what it claims to do.  Great product especially for the price!  I highly recommend it. ( This review was posted by my wife, Patricia.)</li>
    <li> I think is the best products I have used for my face. My face is damaged by the sun , I have very sensitive skin and I am not a makeup person also allergic to the sun, after using this product  like 2 weeks my skin look better the dark spots are diminishing,  I am 45 years</li>
    <li> Going on bottle #3. Everyone wants to know what I use and I immediately tell them about this serum. I&#x27;ve always taken extra good care of my skin. Never leave the house with out sunscreen. Well after I turned 34 I started noticing little lines under and at the corner of my eyes. This bugged me greatly. Well this serum has literally plumped those areas and worked wonders on minimizing my pores. A must try!</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a week. It does seem to make my face smoother and I like that it only takes a drop for your whole face. I will continue to use in hopes I will soon look 20 again!!! LOL</li>
    <li> I just received his product on Friday, that&#x27;s the only reason for the 4 star review.  It&#x27;s a little too soon for true results.  So far I love the way it glides on &amp; makes my skin feel silky smooth.  I have really oil skin and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to increase oiliness which is a huge plus in my opinion.  It&#x27;s a gel like consistency, so remember a little goes a very long way!  I have some hyper pigmentation so I&#x27;m excited to see how it works on it.  I will update the results in a week or so...</li>
    <li> I ordered the product and it really was only $1.00.  I like the way it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s a great product and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. The added gift was a bonus and I love the packaging. Great product!</li>
    <li> I received my product quickly, but can not give a review on results until I use it for at least three weeks I did take before pictures so hopefully I will be able to update my review then.</li>
    <li> Great serum !!!. It penetrates very fast and results can be seen almost immediately, you can feel the moisture entering your skin. After few days I found that it diminished lines, spots, dark circles and wrinkles. I use it every morning and night  along my moisturizer cream. My face looks smooth, fresh and pores were minimized.  Besides the great results, I love the silkiness of this non-oily formula.  It&#x27;s a perfect for use before makeup. One other thing I&#x27;d like to point out is how much I love the product presentation and the booklet of information. For sure I will continue to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Yes!  Finally, something that I look forward to using.  This serum seems to be doing what it claims to do.  Just started using so will update my feedback after using a little longer but for now I can say yes it is working and I would recommend to anyone who wants tighter feeling skin.</li>
    <li> Feels great and it leaves your skin feeling smooth. After applying facial cream it feels soft.</li>
    <li> Giving 5 stars due to comparison of two other brands of same product purchased in past that seemed much inferior to this. Thought at the time they were a good buy, due to cheap price, but they were watered down knock- offs. I could tell right away that this was of much better quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My face feels firmer after using for several days. Also the delivery time was outstanding. I received the product in 2 days. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Feels good going on and seems to tighten skin while its on, did not see change afterwards but after it drys when you put on any makeup or lotion it get gritty. I don&#x27;t like the residue that it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> It only takes a little drop for the whole face and neck, will continue to use to see the result. :)</li>
    <li> I got this at the promotional price. This doesn&#x27;t help moisturized my face but make my face very dry.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with this ptoduct. It dries my skin out.</li>
    <li> There is nothing not to like about this product.  As it happens, I know the manufacturer, but that gives me no bias.  My husband brought my first bottle home from work and I was most impressed.  Now all of my girlfriends use it and love it too.  And did I mention the price one gets if you &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; them on Facebook?</li>
    <li> Love this product, does a great job moisturizing. Within three days I could notice improvements in my skin.</li>
    <li> Order came promptly,  have been using and live it!! I can feel and see difference in my skin..</li>
    <li> So far I like it... although I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days.  I&#x27;ll have to return to give further feedback.  I do have to say buying this item at a low price gives me the opportunity to try it.  Otherwise, i wouldn&#x27;t have risked the money to try it.. Thanks for the special price on it.</li>
    <li> Received product promptly. Offered at a fabulous price. Very impressed with quality.</li>
    <li> Great product. Absorbs quickly. I can see a difference in my skin already! I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The serum was wonderful -- it gave added moisture to my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love it, and the fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! I just started using this, so I can&#x27;t speak on the results yet. It does feel really great on the skin, and a little goes a long way. I love the slight tightening effect it gives also.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Notice a change after 3 day..</li>
    <li> Super Product Love it One of my Favorites!</li>
    <li> Helped improve the overall appearance of my skin. It is now tighter and firmer. Recommended</li>
    <li> I like the serum very much. I have been using it for a week and I can see a difference. My face is brighter and and wrinkles seem less noticeable. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference .. Some light flaking appears later after product dries.  Would not recommend on any count ... Male 55</li>
    <li> I starting using this product only few day and so far I love it, but I need more time for a full reveiw</li>
    <li> Yes, I think that it is helping .  I am 86 years old and have been using it for at least a year or more.  It has diminished a big brown place on my face, in fact it has almost cleared it.  The only place that I have any wrinkles is on my fore head &amp; they are not very noticeable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only three days of using g product...it feels good and looking forward towards visible results</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I can definitely see results. Super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on all the GOOD reviews it received.  And all the reviews were right.  This is an excellent serum.  You only need to use a pea size of serum in the AM and in the PM before your moisturizer and you will see results almost immediately.  My face has cleared up almost entirely (I have been using it for a week).  I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> At He 61, it is all about the slow down in cell renewal. I can tell this product is improving that on my skin. I will be perching your Hyaluronic Acid as well. Sofa, so good, thank you.</li>
    <li> A L E R T!!! Fraud??? . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I review (and try many) products. As well as I am in the commercial media/advertising business. I know how a product and online reviews can be manipulated in numbers/reviews (they pay to put these lame one sentence 5 star reviews on). This product&#x27;s 5 star reviews reek of paid foreigners to make a positive comment (see the lack of proper grammar). Also the negative reviews get no authentic response from the product manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with this one! Reeks of Fraud/Scam!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for three weeks and am a believer!  My very dry skin is hydrated; feels good and looks good.  I have been searching for a product as effective as this one. Very happy that I decided to give it a try.  I recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> A little too soon to notice any major difference (just received 4 days ago).  Consistency is smooth and one drop goes a long way.  Anxious to see results in a couple weeks, but have a feeling this one is a winner 😊</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got to try this. I am very pleased with my results and the way my skin feels.... Amazing</li>
    <li> I love this!! I am halfway through the bottle!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Yeouth on my hands for about two weeks now and already can see an improvement in how my hands look and feel -- skin is smoother, less wrinkled-looking and brown spots are less obvious.  Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on aged, thin skin.  I am anxious to see what the results are in the recommended six to eight weeks of use!</li>
    <li> have only used it for 3 days.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!! Made my skin very soft!!!</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended ... The texture is perfect and I love the fact that it is not oily.. highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a wonder product. within a week the thin lines around the corner of my eyes have diminished. my face is smoother and have soft touch to it. I will try out the entire bottle to see what other changes i will see.  This product was received for the purpose of testing and  review.</li>
    <li> Oh yes. This product helps my skin absorb moisturizer  So soft.</li>
    <li> Well, I have only been using this serum for a few days, but I loe the feel of it and how easily a few drops goes a long way. It just glides on. I was a lay in the sun and bake person, so I will be anxious to see how this does on my sking in  a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. They even enclosed a free gift. I&#x27;ve only been using in the mornings for a few days now, but I do like the way it leaves my skin feeling soft. I will have to use a while more to be able to tell if it is doing anything to my 67 year old lines and dark spots but I will past again. I really appreciate the chance to get in on the special that allowed me to try this product. Even though the 1oz. may seem small, the amount needed per application is so small that this bottle will last a while.</li>
    <li> I gave this five stars because this stuff is amazing!!! I turn 42 in a few months and don&#x27;t really have a lot of wrinkles but I do have large pores and skin discoloration (I refuse to call these age spots yet!!!) plus years of sun damage, I could definitely use some more elasticity and at this point I am not expecting miracles. BUT wow!! After a week of using this, I really saw a dramatic difference in my pores, they were tighter as was my skin but I have more plumpness to it. The few scars I had that I&#x27;ve actually tried to bleach gone, they are almost completely faded. I even had someone ask me if I had a mini face lift or skin resurfacing (is there such a thing??) as if I had the money to afford that. This truly is a face lift in a bottle. I even had my mom try this, she&#x27;s turning 62 here shortly and she isn&#x27;t gung ho on spending a bunch of time or money on products that don&#x27;t work. I assured her this wasn&#x27;t one of them. After 8 days of using this she couldn&#x27;t believe the results, her face was plump, young and smooth looking. Her and I both are seriously impressed. I guess this works best because it has Hyaluronic Acid, plus Vitamin C plus Tripeptide 31 combination. Most others don&#x27;t have all three, just the two or only one. Also, this is Medical Grade Quality and it&#x27;s maximum strength, that makes a big difference. So if your like me, a single mom on a budget but still wanting to take care of your looks, seriously invest in this, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I can tell the fine lines are less noticeable and my skin is firmer</li>
    <li> seems to work really well ,my skins feels smoother after only a few uses,cant wait to see the results after a few weeks</li>
    <li> Was able to get this at a steeply discounted price to try. I like it. It came with a free gift inside the box. I was able to see results but only as long as I used it. If you discontinue use, your skin will go back to normal.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything besides plastic surgery or laser treatments for brown spots on my face and hands.  Not only is it fading these away, but my skin is plumper, more moist and younger looking.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love it so far.  Have not used long enough to see full result.  Feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> I can tell my dark spot is getting fade hopefully will continue to disappear</li>
    <li> Just received so only have used a week. Can&#x27;t tell if any results yet, it&#x27;s too soon. Nothing bad to say though. Hoping for great results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already look great for fifty. Most people are shocked when they hear my age. This product has rehydrated my face from what I can tell after a few weeks of use to the point my eyes display less dramatic lines. And, are lessening a display of lid droop. Meaning the top lid sinks slowly over my lid toward my open eye slit. Also, not that my lines (wrinkles) were substantial, although did show normal I&#x27;m fifty aging wear. I also noticed some lessening of skin blemishes, improvement of overall color consistency, and overall better appearance of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until my late fourties my skin was exceptional in clarity. The past few years I had a few issues. This product seems to have adjusted my appearance enough that I have noticed the past few weeks. I would sometimes wear my glasses to hid my eye lids and fine lines when I smiled because I felt they looked better. Now, I get pictures without glasses again. The first time in several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people notice I look great, but wouldn&#x27;t attribute it to a contribution of this product, but overall lifestyle. I can tell the difference big time. Enough to help boost my confidence personally and perfessionally. I&#x27;m also glad to be able to hydrate my skin using these ingredients since water wasn&#x27;t enough alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful to have discovered this product.</li>
    <li> Love this simple product, and it even makes a difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> The best product I ever use!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Simply love these products!  Just what I have been looking for.  Thank you .</li>
    <li> I saw results in 3 weeks! Dark spots are much lighter and fine wrinkles are no more. I was thrilled that I could use it under my normal facial regiment.</li>
    <li> I use this product with my derma roller. Love this product!</li>
    <li> cannot see a difference</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My bottle is only half gone, ordering more dont want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Everything in package arrived OK.  As far as the product goes, and the results from it, it&#x27;s too soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;I need more time to use it.  I have only used it for 5 days and don&#x27;t really see any results yet.</li>
    <li> Have not used more than 3 weeks but am liking the feel. No break outs and slight fading of dark facial spots</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for less than a week and I already am seeing a difference in my fine lines and in the few sunspots I have on my face.  I have also noticed that the lines on my neck are diminishing which really surprised me.  I have tried a lot of products but this is the first one that actually has worked so quickly and have just ordered another one.  I am excited about this</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product which is a rarity for most &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products that I try.  This serum with simple ingredients is a good moisturizing base for other products and does not irritate my skin in any way.  It is not a miracle worker and it will not erase years of sun damage or bad skin genes, but it gives me much better results than the many other much costlier products that I have tried.  It also does not have that long list of fillers or skin irritants that so many skin care products seem to contain these days.  It is such a small investment in terms of price that there really is no reason not to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like it so much better than the store brands. Less chemicals on my face so I&#x27;m all in on this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference to my skin</li>
    <li> I have only used it for about three weeks so not long enough to notice any results.</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for two weeks.  Notice a slight improvement.  I think this might be worth more investigation,</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I love how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> Great product! nice presentation. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I like the fact it is serum, but there are some hard flaky white substance in the serum that I received and made it rough to apply on skin.</li>
    <li> I love love this product!!  I&#x27;ve tried every thing on the market and this is what I&#x27;m staying with!  I&#x27;m 66 years old and I don&#x27;t expect a miracle but my face looks more radiant and youthful!!</li>
    <li> Noticed fine lines on my forehead deminish and neck and chest seem more youthful looking.</li>
    <li> This is the best hyaluronic/vitamin C combo product I have ever used, and I have tried many.  It seems thicker than any others I have tried but also seems to penetrate quicker.  It does leave my skin with a slight tacky feel, but that is eliminated once I put on sunscreen or moisturizer.  I have been using this product every day for 2 weeks and I do see a visible difference in my skins appearance.  It looks more hydrated and fine lines less visible.  This is the product I am going to stick with.</li>
    <li> After a month of using this both at night and in the morning I can see absolutely no difference. Maybe it is because I have used skin care products since I was 20 both at night and in the morning. I truly was looking for results specifically around the laugh lines and nothing. It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin at all but sit on the surface and maybe tighten like an egg white type mask, but nothing else. If it makes you feel better using this and maybe if you do not regularly use skin products you might see a difference. I will finish out the bottle, but go back to just using my Olay and Cerve products.</li>
    <li> I dont see any difference.</li>
    <li> glides on easily with perfect consistency.I love how it makes my skin feel.good with or without moisturizer over top. a company that is a pleasure to do business with</li>
    <li> I have only used it 4 days so not sure but will continue to monitor my skin. I do like the consistency, it&#x27;s like Vaseline, but melts into your skin so looking forward to great results!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product and company.  They sent me helpful tips on usage.  I have only used one week but I am noticing a difference.  My skin looks better and is firmer.  I use under moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Absorb fast and felt soft , I like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for few days and already see the result.  My pores got minimized!  And my skin looks smoother than before!  But don&#x27;t forget to apply moisturizer coz this serum is little dry on skin.</li>
    <li> Just now starting to see some change in the fine lines around my eyes. Its been a little over 2 weeks and I am loving it.</li>
    <li> This WORKS! Am reordering, tried others, this really gets rid of dark circles!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS......AND RIGHT NOW!!!!!!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> I have yet to purchase this item, but I would love to try it seeing all the excellent reviews it has. I need something good like this to help my face look younger and with sun marks I have I need this product.</li>
    <li> This serum delivers and I mean even after the first use.  My skin feels amazing. I am one of those people who, at age 65, tried them all from the expensive to cheap. This one ranks in the top 5 easily..</li>
    <li> Has not met my expectations as of yet.  My skin does feel softer, but no change in crow&#x27;s feet or mouth area.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> So far I think it is good..It&#x27;s only  been little over 1 week but I see some positive results already.  Based on the results I have had in such a short time I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time in good condition.  Now we will see if it works.</li>
    <li> I just began using this.  Love it so far!</li>
    <li> I do not know how well this product works right now. I have just purchased it.I do know I have tried numerous products including life cell. That product did nothing for me.I am hoping I get better results with this from Yeouth.</li>
    <li> I think  product is great  , I can see a big difference in my 80 yr. old face, however u sent with my order as a special thanks an offer to receive 25% off my next offer , but I can&#x27;t find a code to receive that offer. I tried the www.yeouth1.com/ty25 but that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> After using this product as directed on my hands and arms for the past month, I am thrilled with the results!  Dark &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots have lightened or disappeared and pores are smaller.  The skin looks noticeably moist and younger, so I am now using it on my face also and expect to see wonderful results.</li>
    <li> This serum is definitely worth trying. I&#x27;ve seen the lines start to diminish as well as a tightening sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t started using it yet.  I am sure I will love it as I am finishing up a different product&lt;br /&gt;and will then make my decision for reordering the product.</li>
    <li> I have seen a reduction in the amount of redness in my cheeks and my eye wrinkles are not as outstanding.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum~ does not irritate my sensitive skin, absorbs easily and really saw a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell ANY difference!</li>
    <li> I have only used it for 4 days and I do like it so far, my sister in law whom I let use it also for a couple of days while I was visiting likes it also.  Time will tell  I have used it now since the last week of July, I love it. I have told others about it and they have ordered this product also.   just had some ladies the other day say your skin looks so good, what do you use.  I told them about Yeouth, where to order it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and can not use it at all. My skin gets very dry and flakey sorry maybe some one else can use it.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product a week ago. I do like (so far ) how my skin is responding in this short period of time.  I will see how my skin improves regarding lines and lightening a few dark spots. I received an email from the company with suggestions how to use this product for better results. I appreciate that. I use sun screen every day and a light peel and light therapy once a week. along with good moisturizer and a mask.My diet is healthy and organic which helps support our skin- the largest organ of our body. As a health author, I have studied and learned to weave through the plethora of products out there. Quite mind blowing! if I see improvement, I will continue to use this product in my daily skin routine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am very happy with it after using it for a few weeks, will be ordering more, at 68 it has helped my skin to look fresher and more youthful.</li>
    <li> Have been using for approx 2 weeks... will keep using to see if it makes a big difference in the long run..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. my face looks smoother and brighter.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with how my skin  looks&lt;br /&gt;and feels.</li>
    <li> I have been using Yeouth for about 2 weeks and do NOT see any difference.  My &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; are still there, and really haven&#x27;t diminished at all.  It seems to dry out your skin.  Not worth all the &amp;#34;hoopla&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I having only been using it a week and some of my wrinkles have already faded</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s great thanks for the information I want the best results without wasting any</li>
    <li> I have only been using for three days. My skin does feel great.  Have not seen a dramatic improvement yet.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!  I have kept a personal journal of pictures to see if I could notice a difference - I totally can!  I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
    <li> Anti Aging Vitamin C don&#x27;t work at all, it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for a product before because I have never found one worthy. Haven&#x27;t been using the product long but so far it seems to be working. I have been looking for something like for so long. Have spent so much money. I will write another review in a few more weeks. Can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s going to happen.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works great, my skin&lt;br /&gt;looks and feels great</li>
    <li> I have very wrinkled skin inherited through my Germanic family.  I&#x27;d hoped this would really do some good based on description and ratings.  But, it did not.  My face broke out badly with the first few days of use and there is no noticeable change at all.  Its only been a week so we&#x27;ll see.  But, so far I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> I could see a difference in a week. This stuff is amazing...I will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Anxious to see how it performs.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell if the products works or not....but, so far so good.  I like the way it looks and feels, but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously fantastic.  I&#x27;m 34 and have laugh lines, some wrinkles around my mouth and eyes, and also some on my forehead.  I noticed my skin was smoother immediately after using this.  After a few days, my pores were smaller and my wrinkles less noticeable.  I also have acne-prone skin and my face has been so clear since I started using this.  I love, love, love this stuff.  Three people have told me I look younger since the last time they saw me ( I know that sounds ridiculous but it&#x27;s true!).  My complexion in general is just so much improved.  Also, they included a &amp;#34;Soothing Facial Mist&amp;#34; as a free gift.  You spray it on your face before you use the serum.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like it but since I had it I decided to just use it up.  I ended up loving it!  It&#x27;s so refreshing and really does help the serum go on smoothly.  By the way, just a few drops of the serum is plenty.  A little goes a long way.  I got mine all the way back in November and I still have about a quarter of a bottle left.</li>
    <li> I cant say if its working or not ive been using it only for 3 days</li>
    <li> i have been using the product for two weeks now. So far so good. I can see very fine lines smoothing out. Hoping for.more results in weeks to come</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it on my face and have good results, but I also got a nice surprise.  I have Dyshidrotic Eczema on my fingers and this product has been awesome at helping me keep it under control and keeping the skin from splitting and itching.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a week, my skin does not feel as dry as it usually does!&lt;br /&gt;This this is the &#x27;miracle&#x27; I have been looking for!! Their customer service is the&lt;br /&gt;Best!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Yeouth for a few weeks. I have already noticed smoother, firmer skin. I have been using Retin-A for mild acne and anti-aging purposes for over a year, so I was a little concerned about using the two products together. Using Yeouth in conjunction with Retin-A did not lose the efficacy of the cream and actually worked well with it. Yeouth is non greasy, and very light feeling unlike other serums I have tried.  I would highly recommend this product, and because it does not contain any irritating perfume smells my husband started using it as well!</li>
    <li> After using it for a month or so, I just purchased again;  AND LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried a number of very expensive skin care products and have found the one I will keep using.&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use, feels good going on and I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about a five months and love it. My skin is brighter and my wrinkles are fading.  I am not much for skin care routines and using yeouth regularly is very easy. You only need a little bit  - the vial lasts a long time - and it absorbs right away, which means I can use my moisturizer right away. About five minutes and I am done with morning and evening skin routine. Plus, a geat price!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this and the resulting soft texture of my skin after use. I can see an improvement after a week and anticipate wonderful results as I continue to use!</li>
    <li> Ive only used this product twice and I could see and feel a big difference after the first application. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Loving this product so far. Thank you.</li>
    <li> very impressed and will continue to purchase.  feels great and my skin looks improved!  I love a product that really works!!</li>
    <li> I did not have a chance to use it long enough to see long term results. But for now I can say that it provides good hydration, great to take with you on a flight to protect your skin from that terrible dehydration. You need a moisturizer over it though, otherwise it feels a little sticky and tight. It provides everything you expect from every expensive hyaluronic acid product for a fraction of the price. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why this happens but sometimes my makeup will make little balls on my face.  I am not sure if I am doing something wrong.  Also, do I apply to my lids as well?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of the &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; products. I hear people saying how well products work that they&#x27;ve tried so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Obviously I knew there would not be any noticeable changes inside a day or two. Not to mention my concerns over what ingredients are used in the making of these products. However, when I came across the Hyaluronic Acid Plus, I knew I had to try it. The main ingredient (Hyaluronc Acid) is found naturally in our body; after age 40, the amount we produce decreases significantly. This serum helps to replace what your body is not making enough of anymore while moisturizing your skin at the same time (without making if feel oily like other products have done to me). It helps to reduce the size of your pores, reduce fine lines, and tighten your skin. I have also noticed that it&#x27;s helping reduce the dark circles and puffiness around my eyes. (The age lines around my mouth and eyes have dramatically reduced.) I still cannot believe how well this serum works!! I often find myself looking in the mirror with astonishment!! I can say with certainty that i will continue using this Hyaluronic serum for many years to come. (I received this product at a discount but this review is solely my opinion and the information provided is based on my personal experience.)</li>
    <li> Great fast service. Good product . Still using</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. It&#x27;s not greasy and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Just got the product two days ago don&#x27;t know how it works for sure will keep using it and see</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I have only been using the HA for a matter of days and it certainly seems as if there is improvement in texture and in my lines. They do seem slightly lessened and the skin is smoother and healthier looking. I find it hard to believe but I don&#x27;t think appearances lie. Thank you so much for the product.</li>
    <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure that this was a product I needed to add to my regimen; boy, was I wrong! I very stupidly decided to GENTLY scrub my face with a brand new fine pumice stone. Did I say stupid? This serum has literally saved my face after that even. I has this awful cracked dry places on the corners where my nose meets my cheeks and on my chin from scrubbing. I used this serum twice a day for two days, and the terrible skin that looked like it was going to scab over was healed! I cannot thank Yeouth enough or this incredible product and I am SO thankful that I have this in my cabinet!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to test and evaluate and then submit my honest assessment of. The comments herein are based on my personal observations and experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it worked right away. I noticed efforts of the product the&lt;br /&gt;Next morning.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a different  in my skin.</li>
    <li> this serum it really tighten, soft, smooth , brilliant looks on my skin.</li>
    <li> I will admit that my skin feels good after using this serum but am disappointed in the results, no visible difference in my wrinkles and I am on&lt;br /&gt;my second bottle -- you probably will not print this review.</li>
    <li> Where I applied it on my face red marks have showed up so I am not using it for a few days. Someone asked me if I had a bug bite on my face, it is hard to conceal it.I had to go to the Dr she gave me medication which it cleared it up in three days. I read the directions and did what I was supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This product has a slight fishy unpleasant odor when first applied. That odor does dissipate when a moisturizer is applied after the product dries on the skin. It must be the tripeptides as other products I have used with the hyaluronic acid and vit c were odorless. I like the effects on my skin so just push through the initial unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference really I two weeks,</li>
    <li> Great product!  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> this is working good so far fading my brown spots.</li>
    <li> AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE APPLICATION MY SKIN FEELS SO MUCH BETTER, FIRMER &amp; SMOOTHER IM SURE THE LONGER YOU USE THIS PRODUCT THE BETTER IT GETS, THANK YOU IM REALLY SATISFIED</li>
    <li> What I Love about Yeouth&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Plus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It has a wonderfully thick texture!  Much thicker than other hyaluronic acid serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is highly moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My skin feels firmer and appears more radiant after one week of regular use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This serum is very attractively packaged and comes with helpful informational pamphlets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided the product for the review purposes.</li>
    <li> Great product, crowsfeet softened!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus.  I loved that it was packaged with care and bubble wrapped to prevent any damage during delivery.  I love the way this serum works, the consistency is much richer than others I have tried and feel and smells wonderful. I see immediate results.  I find that my skin quickly drinks up this serum and looks glowing and feels softer.  I rarely wear any makeup and I feel my skin looks so much more tone and my pores appear smaller since using this serum.  I will certainly be buying this product again and compared to all the other high priced skin products on the market this one certainly works .</li>
    <li> This is working beautifully to make my skin appear smoother, younger, and more glowing. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of this when I run out!</li>
    <li> very satisfied.  the feel and texture is great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and  I think is great!  I&#x27;m glad I found it and I plan to continue using it from now on.</li>
    <li> Has not helped with the dark spots....I feel a refund is due for this product....and I want to cancel any more orders!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it makes my skin softer actually the lines disappear, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works and affordable! Dermatologist even impressed with my skin improvement!!</li>
    <li> Finding it very helpful!!  Need to order more!</li>
    <li> It did not make a difference.I would like to return it but I don&#x27;t have the receipt.</li>
    <li> I think it may have helped some, sometimes it felt stiff..</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see to much improvement after few weeks of using twice a day</li>
    <li> Product did not change skin appearance, as it claimed it would.  It is easy to apply, but  it left streaky marks on my skin.  I followed instruction to the letter, with zero results.</li>
    <li> Using it daily for several weeks.. So far my skin looks and feels nicer when I use it with my moisturizer, etc.</li>
    <li> I will not be able to determine its worth until it has been used for as at least a month.</li>
    <li> Only used a couple of days now. I thought it would be more like a moisturizer then it is.  No change on skin as of now.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful I would buy it again.  And I also suggest if you have not tried it to do do.  I get so many compliments on my ageless&lt;br /&gt;skin try this product and so will you!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short time and I can see improvements already.</li>
    <li> This is the second time of the purchase! I am very satisfied with the product. My skin feels soft after using it. Will keep purchasing another definitely!</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s nice. Makes my skin feel more hydrated for sure. Still waiting for the other benefits but so far, I like it.</li>
    <li> This Serum is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous. Can already see the difference.</li>
    <li> I started using this product with Forlan skincare moisturizer, great combination for me!!!  After two days of using these products, what a difference on me!!!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Two words. IIts wonderful,!</li>
    <li> This serum really makes a difference. I got complimented on my youthful appearance, being 60 years old. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;www.yeouth1.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week, so I haven&#x27;t really noticed any change except for my skin feeling more hydrated.  May review again after a month or so if there are any obvious changes.  Item came quickly and was packaged beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and am amazed at the improvement in my skin.  The real proof is my husband, who I&#x27;ve been married to for 31 years,  telling me, &amp;#34; Wow,  your eyes look amazing,  what did you do? &amp;#34;  I&#x27;ll definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this serum.  It&#x27;s easy to use and is effective!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a week and am impressed with the results so far. My skin feels firmer, yet softer. The lines are diminishing overall, the puffiness under my eyes is about half of when I started using it and my neck even is benefiting. I am anxious to see what results I will have after several months. I appreciate the fact that this product seems to be working and is affordable.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smaller pores, smoother skin</li>
    <li> makes my skin look smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference.  On the positive side,it has not caused any adverse effects.</li>
    <li> After 1 month no changes in dark spots or lines.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product and will recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> I ca see  good things happening. And have only bee few short weeks.  I think it just might be a very good coice I made trying this product.  Hope to be able to keep it in my routine products. Thanks for offering it</li>
    <li> Been using it for 2 nights and my skin feels good!&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a few weeks after I have been using it a little while longer.  No smell, but consistentcy is nice!</li>
    <li> I saw a difference within a few weeks.  I will use this product always, true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
    <li> Really effective! In less than a week I could see brighter, smoother skin. I ordered it again and the order was filled very fast. Excellent product and very reliable delivery!</li>
    <li> Definitely like it. Too early to tell how well it will work.  So far I am seeing improvement.</li>
    <li> Experienced positive results within hours of using.  No adverse effects.  A very beneficial product for maintaining optimal facial cell health.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change but I keep hoping. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over 3 weeks, I just love it.. Read the directions, I feel my skin softer, tighter, Lines are softer, and my face is looking lighter! My dark spots are fading!!  So far so good, !!!</li>
    <li> Only been using theses 2 products for about a week. Have seen some change . Anxious to see after longer usage.</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail today. I was so excited! I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid products countless times so I am not unfamiliar with what this stuff can do for your skin. First, I got a freebie in my package. It was a little bottle of mist to apply before the serum. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in how the serum applied but I will continue to use it to see result. It&#x27;s bit earlier to review the actual product for me. But what I wanted to review was the bottle. The neck of the bottle inside the where the cap screws in had a small chip. Not so noticeable but I can definitely feel it when I run my finger across it gently. I&#x27;ve opened it and used it without thinking twice but my sister screamed and said I shouldn&#x27;t use it as the bottle could have been dropped causing possible glass breakage inside. So now I am bit freaking out. Not sure if I should keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! I have been using this product and I am very happy with my results. My face feels so much smoother and some of the spots I was having problems with are fading!!</li>
    <li> After using it for just a coupl days, I love this product, I will keep using.&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use, feels good going on and I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to other products in this line.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever tried. A go to for everyone!!! Highly recommend this. Add it to your beauty regiment!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product from amazon.  This product is amazing!!!  It feels so nice going onto your face.  Does not leave and greasy or &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; feeling to your skin.  Immediately after applying you can start to feel it tightening on your skin.  This company also sent me a surprise gift of two full size lip care products.  Was amazed at the generosity of the company!!  The serum was packages well and shipped quickly.  Would def order this product again and recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Very moisture and easy to be absorbed by the skin</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and a little goes a long way. My skin is normally dull and dry but I noticed a change after a short time using this.</li>
    <li> i go this for my mother and she loves it and she likes how it feels and works... quickly absorbs into your skin... will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hyalyronic serum. It&#x27;s very thick so it&#x27;s easy to spread around. I would have given it 5 stars but I do not like droppers because they are awkward to use (if you&#x27;re holding the bottle with one hand and taking the top off with the other then where do you put the product?) and introduce air and dust with every opening. This would be great with a pump!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the serum and Love the way it makes my skin feel. Would recommend to anyone looking for something to add to their beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> Wow! I applied it at night and the next morning my skin felt so smooth and soft!! I have only been using it for a few days but I love it so far!</li>
    <li> This is very nice on the hands, I use it for that often. The instructions suggest that it is fine to use under makeup but I did not find that to be true. It creates what feels like a plastic barrier so makeup just clumps on the surface.</li>
    <li> The more I use it the more of a difference I see. This has really improved my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> This serum is great and I&#x27;ve been using for a little over a week and I can tell a difference in my facial  texture and my necks skin seems to be tightening. I really enjoy this serum it is thicker then the other ones I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m waiting to see my pores shrink on my nose and chin can&#x27;t wait to see. It came with a bonus gift of a lip butter balm and it makes my lips feel much fuller thank you. I am sold on this serum and sure I will be a returning customer. I would highly recommend this serum to anyone of any age I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and noticed a difference in 10 days. My face feels much smoother and looks much softer than it did and it even feels fuller to me. I&#x27;ve had people ask me if I changed my hair or make-up because I look like I have more color and am more chipper. I have to say thank you for the experience so far and can&#x27;t wait for another week to go by to see the next set of results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days now and I love it.  The price was GREAT!  Only $1 for a trial.  I will certainly buy more at full price.</li>
    <li> Love this! So I have seen my laugh lines going away and some of my &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; are more faded as well. I notice that my blemishes heal much more quickly with it. I&#x27;ve used this about 6 weeks so I will keep looking for positive results.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. I noticed a difference in my skin after two weeks. My skin felt tighter, pores looked smaller and it did not irritate my skin like most serums or creams that I&#x27;ve used. The only issue I had was when putting it on, it would leave white dry spots on your face which I wouldn&#x27;t notice until I was already out the house but other then that a very good product.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth feeling after using it for a while, will definitely get more when discounting</li>
    <li> Love this product. Made skin feel better right away. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results long term.</li>
    <li> keeps my face smooth and soft.  use it everyday</li>
    <li> This serum dries out quickly. I did not get any visible result while using this for a few months.</li>
    <li> already recommended to family and friends</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a week and already notice a difference.  I&#x27;m 57 and admittedly have many skin care products to reduce wrinkles. This is the first one I have noticed a substantial difference even on my worst wrinkle (11 between my eyebrows).  I smooth just one drop in the morning and one in the evening, followed by moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the white flakiness other reviewers have referred to. I love this product and will definitely re-order! Update: This is still my favorite product for diminishing both fine and larger wrinkles.  I use it just after washing my face when there is still some moisture left on (intentionally). This serum pulls the moisture inward.  I use it every night, and have received so many compliments on my skin, even at my 40th high school reunion!  Better than botox in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is really great! And it also came with a full size product as well! This makes my face feel really fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Not seeing a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Continued using after dry skin in hopes it would get better. Used the entire bottle and all I have to report is DRY skin. Don&#x27;t bother, esp at this price point. Even with promotion, it&#x27;s not worth the money. I have 2 dry patches I blame this product for that will not go away. My face is usu oily and still made it too dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I put it on right after I wash my face and before the makeup as well as right before I go to bed. It gives your skin a dewy, fresh glow without feeling greasy and is a great moisturizer. After using a very expensive face cream for a few months with no results, I was very happy to switch to this product as my new daily face care product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and not oily, and smoothes the skin nicely. It evens out skin tone and moisturizes effectively. Excellent, reasonable price. I oten use it instead of cream moisturizers.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Now for the bags under my eyes....will this help them too, or do I need something else?</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin look Dewey and younger. Took a few weeks</li>
    <li> Great Addition to beauty routine works well</li>
    <li> So far I have not seen the big difference that I read about in other reviews.  I have seen no change in my brown spots.</li>
    <li> Too sticky and gummy. It doesn&#x27;t sink in to skin. It sits on top and get flaky when dry.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  I love the anti-aging serum. It makes my skin glow and look youthful.  My friends have given me compliments already!Highly recommend it!</li>
