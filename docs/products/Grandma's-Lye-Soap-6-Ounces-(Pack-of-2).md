<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good soap it is really wonderful soap</li>
    <li> This is wonderful soap for dry skin.  It has also helped with eczema &amp; minor teenage skin issues.  I won&#x27;t use any other soap products.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Our local health store just closed it&#x27;s doors.  I was so thrilled to see that Amazon carries this soap.  It is a little pricer than normal soap, but lasts longer and is SOOO much better for you.  No more film on the skin.</li>
    <li> Good soap, but too expensive for what it is. Not worth buying it again.</li>
    <li> When I hear &amp;#34;lye soap&amp;#34; I think &amp;#34;harsh,&amp;#34; but this soap is anything but.  A friend recommended lye soap for the prevention of a rash from poison oak after exposure, and since I&#x27;m extremely allergic, I purchased this soap. Thankfully, I haven&#x27;t had to use it for that purpose, but for daily use, it&#x27;s been great.  The soap is very mild and creamy with very little scent--what&#x27;s there is pleasant. My skin feels moisturized after a shower. No complaints whatsoever--it&#x27;s a great product for my needs.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used, hands down  I now use it for hand and body soap and for shampoo as well.  In my quest to remove all chemicals and synthetics from my personal care products, Grandma&#x27;s Pure Lye Soap was the product I ended up choosing after trying many natural soaps and cleansers.  Super simple and basic, with only two ingredients in the product by the time you use it (lard and water).  At first I found the idea of &amp;#34;lye&amp;#34; scary.... wasn&#x27;t lye harsh?!? After researching it, it turns out that while lye is used during the soap making process, by the time the process is complete. there is no lye remaining.  So while there are 3 ingredients on the label (lard, water and lye), only two of them end up on your skin. I have had trouble with rashes and dry/oily skin and scalp most of my life.  This simple soap has totally solved all my issues.  There is no scent, as others have mentioned, but in my book that is a plus.  When I want to smell like flowers, I wear perfume, and I don&#x27;t want any of my personal care products to have a scent that competes with my perfume of the day.  Leaves my skin and scalp super clean.  I am hooked, this is my soap for life.</li>
    <li> Great for face AND body. Squeaky clean, no residue, no harshness, no drying out. Feels clean, smells clean, works great! They say the fewer the ingredients the better for you...can&#x27;t get any simpler than this!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding soaps that do not cause itching and dryness. This soap does the job. My skin is clean, clear and soft with no itching and dryness at all.</li>
    <li> I found going back to natural soap feels so much cleaner, rinses off better and less soap scum in the shower&lt;br /&gt;just a great product&#x60;</li>
    <li> With Grandma in the name, you know it is good. It is. Father-in-law loves it.</li>
    <li> This Lye soap is the only soap I have found that does not irritate my Rosacea or dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> lye soap should be the only soap out there it&#x27;s good for so many thing use to make it grownin up Thanks God Bless</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant since it&#x27;s just two bars and the price was more than 6 bars of Dove.  But, not only did each bar last longer (the bar said it would last 1 month, it lasted us 2 months:-) but it was better on the skin than Dove.  So awesome!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product, but does leave skin feeling a little sticky.</li>
    <li> I order this for my brother and his wife and they got it sooner than we though they would and they was very happy with it</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It is so good for your skin. My 85 yr old mother has had a fry skin problem for a year now. Dermatologist has recommended several products but with lack layer results. I have her a bar of this to try and she said it has worked better than anything.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that has NO &amp;#34;chemical perfume&amp;#34; added and it is cleansing. It also retards &amp;#34;itches&amp;#34;. To me it&#x27;s a worthwhile product.</li>
    <li> squeaky clean without residue - great for skin issues - great for the whole family and last a good length of time</li>
    <li> It has really helped my skin to clear over.  It does not leave any soap scum on it and makes it feels really soft.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft.  The only problem I ran into was the lard actually working against me and clogging the pores on my forehead, due to a lack of exfoliation.  Otherwise, I love to use this soap in the shower rather than bodywash.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had poison ivy since i started using this soap, although my hands don&#x27;t seem as clean as with normal soap.</li>
    <li> I developed a skin allergy about 6 months ago.  This caused me to have uncontrollable itching (imagine chicken pox).  So began my search for soap that I could use.  I bought sensitive skin soap, I bought goat milk soap (which relieved the itching, but left me with dry skin and some under arm odor issues).  Anyway, I&#x27;m so glad, you have no idea, that I stumbled upon this and took a chance.  All of my skin issues are now completely under control.  Now I just have to figure out what to do with all of the other soaps in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> I use this as face soap, and quite like it. I haven&#x27;t seen it do any of the miracles that some people on here claim (cure dry skin or acne), but it does feel natural. I have been using the same bar for a month or so, and there&#x27;s still plenty left.</li>
    <li> My 94 year old friend wa telling me about making lye soap when she was younger.  Well I found this at Amazon, where you can find almost anything and bought it for her.  She was just thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy soaping to you!</li>
    <li> I have horribly sensitive skin. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t find a soap that would help me the way it claimed and would be left with the same irritable, itchy, and sensitive skin. However, I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy this soap as it has lived up to its claims. My skin isn&#x27;t irritated or bothered in any way by the soap. The smell/scent might take a little while to adjust to depending on the person as it surprised me at first, but for the great things this soap does, it&#x27;s easily overlooked. I would definitely recommend this soap to pretty much anyone. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I love this soap for pre-treating laundry with my washboard.  So far it has worked on everything I have needed.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It has made my entire body, including my face, soft and beautiful.  I also gave a bar to my 14-yr. old grandson who has the beginnings of acne.  He likes the smell, the suds and how he looks after he has washed.</li>
    <li> works for me,use on chiggers.</li>
    <li> I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a remedy for mosquito bites. I suffer from allergies which causes some of my bug bites to get super big, super fast. I read online that rubbing lye soap in a dry lather over the affected area helps disperse the mosquito toxins. When I get a bite, I&#x27;ll wash the skin and then run a dry lather on for about 10 minutes. It dries to a flat film. Then rinse and repeat if necessary.  I&#x27;ve used it about a half dozen times and it seems to help diminish/prevent excessive swollenness. So long as I don&#x27;t scratch, it has been quite helpful!</li>
    <li> My eczema was out of control. I had resorted to bathing with no soap on my body, because I couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t leave me itching after usage. Well, this one left me feeling clean and itch-free. Thanks Grandma!</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I have weird skin and this stuff never irritates it or leaves it dry. I have been using it for almost a year and cant say enough good about it!</li>
    <li> Bugs love my wife and I.  We both use it after any possible contact with the little creepy crawlies.  It works great to stop the itch and redness.  We keep it at home and the country place.</li>
    <li> I started using this soap about 2 years ago (after a web search) because my skin is so dry.  It make your skin smooth and silky.  I recently gave my brother 2 bars because he has drey skin and he was amazed how it made his skin feel.  He was very happy with the results.  I got rid of all my body washes that promised soft skin.  They don&#x27;t work on my old skin.  Also, I used to get parts on my arms that I would scratch and then make sores.  I have only had about 4 places that I have scratched this summer.  I am really happy about that.</li>
    <li> This is just great, very gently and very effective helping with a heat rash on my legs and skin irritations from bug bites,and others.</li>
    <li> I have liked everything about this soap and my skin is in fact less dry but, it does not feel as moisturized as I was expecting. Overall still a good healthy alternative to many of the soaps out there. I do also like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people are in the same battle as I am, trying to find that perfect soap that moisturizes your skin. But with time I have found out that a good diet is what really does the trick. Even when I went back to the other harsh soaps, just by drinking more water than usual, excising and keeping a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables included, my skin goes back to being healthy.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower and use this on my face to lather up - the bar is a bit larger than a standard bar of soap but very gentle. When you see &#x27;lye&#x27; on the label you think harsh, but the opposite is true - very good general soap, no perfumy smell but leaves you nice and clean. So glad I discovered this!</li>
    <li> Love lye soap. Great for SO many things. I will definitely purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> WOrks so nice on your skin , makes you so soft and I have problem skin and seemed to help my break out prone skin , just one thing , I am very girly and love to smell nice , this has really no scent , so after bathing might have to put lotion and some perfume , gives no scent.</li>
    <li> After all of the great reviews I read I was super excited to try this (what I thought would be miracle) soap. The scent left me thinking &amp; paranoid that I smelled like turkey. This soap has a meat/animal fat smell to it. I was not expecting that. It might be a really great soap but for your skin. But unfortunately I cannot get past the scent. Too bad. I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> This soap makes me feel like my grandma. 10/10 would wash again.</li>
    <li> This soap is good as a wash for poison ivy and oak as well as a good body soap, has no scent which should make it good for hunting situations.</li>
    <li> The soap is great so I give it 5 stars, but this soap is sold here locally for $3.99 each.  Over $7.00 each seems a little exorbitant.</li>
    <li> Kinda smells like lard- does not have the clean smell I expected!</li>
    <li> Good neutral soap, works well for my oily but sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Reminds me of the soap my aunt used to make on the farm.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have eczema and the fragrance in other soaps irritate my skin. This is all I use and I tell everyone I know to switch over to this stuff. Everyone I know that has tried it loves it.</li>
    <li> Amazing soap that gets rid of all my makeup in one shot (and I wear a lot sometimes...ahem...) and makes my skin feel super clean but not dry. I have found my new favorite!</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle soap.  Used for face and body.  Rinses clean.</li>
    <li> would i pay the amount that i did for the lye soap if it was not worth it.  The soap is not cheap, but each of the six bars i bought are worth their weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You should see how my facial skin looks.  It is looks better than it did when i was twenty years old.  people look at me and say, &amp;#34; you are 65 aren&#x27;t you&amp;#34;.  How are you looking younger and prettier than ever.</li>
    <li> The best stain remover on the market!  Gets 99% of our stains out.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy on the skin and a long lasting bar of real simply made soap. No fragrances or other additives</li>
    <li> Best soap for sensitive skin.  Liked it so much I now order for my mom.</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this. This will be the only soap I&#x27;m using from now on!</li>
    <li> The best soap on the market! The stuff works great I have a severe skin sensitivity and this is one of the only soaps I can use. Makes your skin feel incredibly soft!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I live in the high desert so have problems with dry, itchy skin.  I was slathering on all kinds of lotions until I thought the problem might be with the soap.  Well, I was right.  My skin feels wonderful since I have been using this soap and no more itching.</li>
    <li> my grandson has psoriasis, (3 Yrs old) and as long as we use Grandma&#x27;s soap he stays cleared up. I use it for my hands that I have a problem with them being dry and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone with skin problems.  I recommend it to everyone, it makes your skins soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap for skin and for getting spots out of clothing. Apply soap to stain and let it soak for a day.</li>
    <li> great soap I have very sensitive skin this soap is great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be concerned by the lye.  This soap was recommended by my gynecologist because of its gentle purity.  I won&#x27;t use any other soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap. It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love that it is not antibiotic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave my skin feeling weird - most modern soap makes my skin uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Great for allergies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this soap.  No dramatic tales to tell of skin changes but it feels good and my skin feels squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;However my adult daughter cannot us it on her face and upper body ... it causes some sort of rash.  So beware, if you have a problem with lye, you may get a reaction.</li>
    <li> Very good soap,great for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> But it is a great product that cleans chalk paint off my brushes.</li>
    <li> My favorite bar soap. No fragrance is a great way to start the day. Normally we buy it by the case.</li>
    <li> No rash, no itch. Love this soap. Basic, simple, cleansing.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I grate it up with a cheese grater  and use it in everything that requires soap. I make alot of my own products. So I mix this soap with other ingredients to make different products. I use it to wash dishes, in makeup remover wipes, in makeup brush cleaner, in face wash, and in body wash, just to name a few things.  Especially love it in my homemade makeup wipes. It takes off all my makeup using just one of the wipes.  It does sting my eyes when I&#x27;m washing my face but it&#x27;s soap. I like that there are just three ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> I love that it is 100% natural. I would probably use it for that reason alone. Then it completely cured my daughter&#x27;s teen acne in a week. Plus, I used to get 3-4 pimples every month during my period. Since I started using this soap 2 or 3 months ago, I haven&#x27;t had ANY pimples. Well, except last week when I was out of town and I borrowed my mom&#x27;s expensive face cleanser ONE TIME. I got a pimple the next day. I&#x27;m sold on this product. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use it as my everyday soap for face and body and it is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap after reading positive reviews from folks with sensitive skin and KP. I have both, and I can say that this soap worked great for me! It&#x27;s not a miracle elixir, but it didn&#x27;t cause KP flare-ups like some products do for me, and it left me feeling squeaky-clean -- skin wasn&#x27;t dried out and there was no build-up/residue (like moisturizing soaps can leave behind), either. Based on its cleaning power and the way it worked for my sensitive skin, I&#x27;d buy this soap again and again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said... This soap smelled gross.  Maybe it was just my bar, I&#x27;m not sure.  On the first use, I thought it smelled like raw chicken, and for the rest of the bar, I couldn&#x27;t get the thought of raw chicken out of my mind whenever I used it! The smell could also be described as &amp;#34;rancid pork fat.&amp;#34;  My husband (who doesn&#x27;t have skin problems) refused to use this soap due to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on me after the shower. Phew!</li>
    <li> My friend&#x27;s child has serious eczema. A friend with psoriasis recommended this and it works great. It helped my friend&#x27;s daughter a lot!</li>
    <li> Nice natural soap. Just as expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. You actually feel clean when you get out of the shower. And for those of us with skin problems, it works wonders.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful for my skin and leaves it soft. I do not use lotions and moisturizers (just a little almond oil), so I was looking for something that would not dry my skin out. That is how it works for me, it might be different for you. I have bars at all the sinks and in the shower and it seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> This soap is xcellent for dry skin and great if you want plain moisturizing soap that doesn&#x27;t have perfume in it.</li>
    <li> I was looking to get away from all of the other soaps on the market that contain so many chemicals and I was happy to find this brand.  Been using it for a few months now.  I have dry skin but it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> This is very good soap. My wife loves it, but the price is a little bit too high.</li>
    <li> I love the soap. knowing it has no chemicals makes it even better</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Makes my itchy skin feel wonderful again and I love that it&#x27;s not full of chemicals! Thanks G-ma!</li>
    <li> I started using natural lye soap a year ago, and since will not use anything else in the shower. It works great as a shaving soap on my face as well. Never again will I use body wash or any other bar soap. You will feel clean after you use this, but without all the perfumes.. Let your cologne do the talking..lol</li>
    <li> At  my 78 yrs. of age the skin really begins to lose its moisture--I have found this product has made my skin so much softer and not nearly as dry</li>
    <li> My husband gets exceedingly grimy hands from his work, but is sensitive to many soaps. He also distrusts any cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make suds or leaves an oily residue in the name of moisturizing. This soap gets carbon-oil-dirt-whoknowswhat out of his callouses, softens them, it&#x27;s the best. Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;lye&amp;#34; in the name put you off, all soap has some lye-like ingredient, and this is very mild.</li>
