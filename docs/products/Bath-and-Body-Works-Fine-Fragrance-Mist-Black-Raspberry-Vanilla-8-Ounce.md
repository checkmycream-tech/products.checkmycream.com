      <li>- I cannot twist the tops off like the old ones, however, the mist itself is very lovely.  </li>
      <li>Smell doesn&#x27;t last all day but that&#x27;s ok, just spray some more on every now and again if you&#x27;re able to.</li>
      <li>Smells exactly the way you would think that it would, and it isn&#x27;t to strong.</li>
      <li>You can smell the berries from far away :)</li>
      <li>Smells more like alcohol than the old glass bottle used to.</li>
      <li>Came very fast from seller, within 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> i truly enjoy this scent it is my favorite from bath and body works, so i bought five bottles of it, but the thing is, it&#x27;s not very strong, does not last long i have to keep applying it throughout the day, i wish they would come out with a stronger scent of this, it was disappointing</li>
    <li> 4 stars because I do not like the new bottles - I cannot twist the tops off like the old ones, however, the mist itself is very lovely.  This is the one fragrance that never makes me sick to my stomach, and it is not heavy enough to bother other people. You guys should buy it so that BBW knows to keep making it.  Then I will be happy.  So, thank you in advance for purchasing this delightful fragrance.</li>
