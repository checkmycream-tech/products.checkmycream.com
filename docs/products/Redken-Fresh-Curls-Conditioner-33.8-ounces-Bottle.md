      <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
      <li>It smells great and works well at managing natural curls.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it is light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all gooey.</li>
      <li>Catwalk Curls Rock is comparable although again, the original (turquoise) works better than the newer purple.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many products and Fresh Curls does indeed work with curly hair.  </li>

      <li>I have naturally curly hair, and the difference between my hair with/without this is amazing!</li>

      <li>You can still find the original.</li>
      <li>There is a whole line of Fresh Curls, but just the shampoo and conditioner alone make your hair nicely curly if you don&#x27;t like a lot of products in your hair.</li>

      <li>I need a product now that will keep my hair moisturized for the rest of the day and help me keep my hair in curls like the way it looks right after a shower.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine so many curly hair products either leave my hair weighed down and greasy looking or else don&#x27;t really work as advertised.  </li>
      <li>First time growing out my hair.</li>
      <li>They really do a phenomenal job of making products that work with specific problematic hair types and prevent or even repair.</li>
      <li>I also wish it were just slightly more moisturizing, but by using a deep treatment once a week I can get around this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And she absolutely loves it</li>
      <li>My 9 year old brushes her unruly thick curly hair in thr shower while conditioning and comes out with gorgeous curles.</li>
      <li>The prive is too high for the quality.</li>
      <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>This is the same exact formula, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>It tames the frizz and leaves hair soft.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves soft hair.</li>

<li> why minus a star?  </li>
<li> Other times it would feel like a wig.</li>
<li> I have extremely course and frizzy hair.  </li>
<li> All redken products do what they say and the shampoos/ conditioners never leave a waxy build up like some other cheaper lower quality brands do.</li>
<li> Not only do I use it in the usual manner after shampooing, and rinse, but I also was taught by my hair dresser to use just a little on my fingers and draw it through my bangs to help them stay in place.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t stay down though.&lt;br</li>
<li> and it make my hair go down to.</li>
<li> So I needed a product that would keep my hair feeling and looking health and on that would put my afro down in curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Other curly hair conditioners are heavy and weigh my hair down.</li>
<li> My hair is chin length now and it is hair to tame.</li>
<li> No more itching</li>
<li> oh so thick.</li>
<li> A little expensive</li>
<li> It is not good.</li>
<li> As another reviewer mentioned, the smell is not awesome.  </li>
<li> Yes it is too bad</li>
<li> Too bad Redken stopped making it.</li>
<li> but I really hate the smell.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product, it is light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all gooey.I was paying $24 for the 8oz bottle from the salon, but i just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost any longer. This is the same exact formula, at a fraction of the price. YAY!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner for curly hair. It tames the frizz and leaves hair soft. Other curly hair conditioners are heavy and weigh my hair down. This one leaves my curls light and bouncy.</li>
    <li> T&#x27;was absolutely wonderful. Been looking for it for a while. Came perfectly packaged. Great buy. Would repeat the purchase. Crikey how much more do I need to say</li>
    <li> See stars. Husband loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I use all the &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; products from Redken. Great product! A little expensive but I also don&#x27;t need to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner. Too bad Redken stopped making it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely course and frizzy hair.  This product does what it says.  I have tried many, many products and Fresh Curls does indeed work with curly hair.  I get spiral curls.</li>
    <li> Yes it is too bad Redkin stopped making this. They replaced it with Curvacious which doesn&#x27;t permit me to glide a comb through my curly tangles in the shower like this did. Catwalk Curls Rock is comparable although again, the original (turquoise) works better than the newer purple. You can still find the original. Also Bouncy is comparable. But I&#x27;ll miss this Redkin which was the third star in my conditioner rotation!</li>
    <li> Not only do I use it in the usual manner after shampooing, and rinse, but I also was taught by my hair dresser to use just a little on my fingers and draw it through my bangs to help them stay in place. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It is not good. The prive is too high for the quality. After used it for a while, the hair came dry. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It smells great and works well at managing natural curls. I do think my hair dye is getting washed out more quickly.  But it also could be our water.</li>
    <li> First time growing out my hair. Yea I am a guy. My hair is chin length now and it is hair to tame. I want to try different hairstyles but my hair is fragile and oh so thick. At times my head would itch a lot. Other times it would feel like a wig. I don&#x27;t want to damage my hair because baldness runs in the family. So I needed a product that would keep my hair feeling and looking health and on that would put my afro down in curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my hair feel light and nice. No more itching and it make my hair go down to. It doesn&#x27;t stay down though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product moisturizes and cleans my hair leaving a nice lemon after smell. I need a product now that will keep my hair moisturized for the rest of the day and help me keep my hair in curls like the way it looks right after a shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because we couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores in California anymore. And she absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> great product quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair curl! If you have any kind of natural curl, this enhances it nicely. There is a whole line of Fresh Curls, but just the shampoo and conditioner alone make your hair nicely curly if you don&#x27;t like a lot of products in your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have naturally curly hair, and the difference between my hair with/without this is amazing! Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves soft hair.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old brushes her unruly thick curly hair in thr shower while conditioning and comes out with gorgeous curles. The science of all redken products is amazing.

    <li> My hair is very fine so many curly hair products either leave my hair weighed down and greasy looking or else don&#x27;t really work as advertised.  This conditioner is the exception!  I get definition, frizz reduction, and it has a great detangler.

    <li> I have been using Redken Curly shampoo and conditioner for almost two years when suddenly I went into ulta during their litre sale and they said the line was discontinued and now this was the replacement. It does everything it says it does but I really hate the smell.</li>
