    <li> Love this product! But I wish it gives me more for this price.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but this arrived a bit separated and a different color and texture than the one I bought at the salon.  Lots of shaking to get it to mix again helped a bit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using KMS California Moist Repair Revival Crème for a few years. My stylist turned me on to it originally.

    <li> This product is especially great for color treated hair as it moisturizers  and  detangles your hair.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and its the best.</li>
    <li> This cream is clear as opposed to the white cream that I&#x27;m used to.  I thought KMS may have changed the formula but I stopped in a retail store today and found a bottle of the white cream so that wasn&#x27;t it.  I don&#x27;t understand why there is a difference but this one doesn&#x27;t work as well.  In this case, it wasn&#x27;t worth the dollars I saved.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clear and creates flakes when dried in hair. I was looking for the white cream leave in.</li>
    <li> wonderful product, I got introduced to it thru my hair stylist, she used it after she finished blow drying my hair to calm down the fly aways, and it is so light yet so effective you don&#x27;t feel like u put anything on your hair! not greasy. Love this product.</li>

    <li> I love this product! It was recommended to me by my hair stylist who I&#x27;ve been going to for a decade. Absolutely love this stuff!!</li>

    <li> This is a light weight cream not greasy and little fragrance.A huge plus for moisture without the weight.Points for conditioning and shine too.I tried the moist repair leave in conditioner thinking it would be more light weight but it left my hair feeling awful and the scent  was way to obnoxious.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband had difficulty with dandruff while using other products.  Since he started using this about 8 years ago, he has not had any problems since. He uses it with the Moist Repair Shampoo and the Moist Repair Conditioner.  He ran out of the crème a little while back and started using another product which immediately brought his dandruff back.  When he returned to this product, the dandruff went away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Kerastase products fan but my hair stylist uses this brand and suggested I try it. It&#x27;s a good alternative if you want something less expensive. I alternate now.</li>
    <li> Already reordered more...</li>
