      <li>My pro-boxer buddy recommended this product and I am so glad that I listened and bought it.</li>

      <li>I have used it for hygiene purposes and it is absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>Hibiclens is a great topical antibiotic/antiseptic.</li>
      <li>Great daily antibacterial soap for the body.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>

      <li>Nice and big, love the pump action as it seems to foam up the soap as it comes out.</li>
      <li>Well worth the miney</li>

      <li>First time or two, no problem,</li>
      <li>Delivered exactly on time</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>i was just one, but the first time I ordered it I received to bottles like I was suppose to.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a phenomenon that I&#x27;ve unfortunately recently become acquainted with.</li>

      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a problem with sweating, you can really replace your deodorant/antiperspirant too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Its a very convenient dispenser, squirts out a foam into your hand that is easy to contain in your palm and wash with. I took off a star because my wife is has allergy sensitivities to a lot of substances and this stuff irritates her skin. We have used other hibiclens liquids that didn&#x27;t have that effect.</li>
    <li> This method of foaming really helps to conserve the product.  Works great</li>
    <li> Works well.. was delivered quickly and no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used Hibiclens for over a year to eliminate body odor.  The formula is runny, doesn&#x27;t lather, and has the consistency of water. For me, none of this is a con, but just keep this mind before buying. The pump makes it easy to control the runny solution so you don&#x27;t accidently pour too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to Apply&lt;br /&gt;To combat body odor, I use it primarily in two specific areas -- underarms and groin. Both of these areas contain your scent glands (google: apocrine glands). These zones are known for producing the most odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms&lt;br /&gt;I use prescription Drysol antiperspirant for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).  With other cleansers, I would still detect underarm body odor midday or whenever I started sweating.  If I stop using Hibiclens and use regular soap instead, it takes about 48 hours for odor to return. So, I use Hibiclens every other day to maintain its effectiveness. I really have no use for deodorant anymore. If you don&#x27;t have a problem with sweating, you can really replace your deodorant/antiperspirant too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private Areas&lt;br /&gt;Although it is not recommended to use it in the genital area, I do use it on my groin (avoiding contact to more sensitive areas). No irritation! Keeps me very confident in more intimate situations. My partner always comments on how nice I smell. Even after a long, hot day, he says that I smell like water. I&#x27;ll take that compliment anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this will only combat sweaty odors. If you have a fishy or &amp;#34;yeasty&amp;#34; odor, you should really check with your doctor as it could be an infection that could worsen with using Hibiclens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********** 4/28/2015 UPDATE: SECRET ACNE SOLUTION **********&lt;br /&gt;Because of its antiseptic properties, I figured I&#x27;d give Hibiclens a whirl as an acne solution. I battled a breakout for several weeks and my other skincare products weren&#x27;t helping much. I applied Hibiclens and massaged in for approximately one minute before rinsing off. I use it as a spot-treatment only and am very careful to not get any into my eyes, mouth, or nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hibiclens remains active on the skin for up to 24 hours. So, I&#x27;m careful to not apply anything else on the breakout area, as I do not want other products to dilute or otherwise interact with Hibiclens&#x27; effectiveness. After 1 day, my breakouts healed about 50% and were completely gone in about 3 days. Considering the other products didn&#x27;t do anything after weeks, I consider it a success and have continued to use but only when necessary.eyes, mouth, or nose.

    <li> Works well, had to use before surgery, and if you use on your feet, they do not smell!</li>
    <li> I have used it for hygiene purposes and it is absolutely fantastic. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great product but more thought should have been put into dispenser spout.Clogs and will spray contents all over sink or counter.Otherwise this is excellant product.</li>
    <li> cleans the boo boo good!!</li>
    <li> Used when I had my complete knee surgery before and after.</li>
    <li> Just the product I needed.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FOR CLEANING SKIN</li>
    <li> If you have some sort of persistent mystery infection anywhere on your skin but don&#x27;t want to patronize the local crooks— whoops! uh, I mean, &amp;#34;doctors,&amp;#34; ha-ha, wink—then you have GOT to get you some Hibiclens. OTC remedies for such things are not very potent on their own; they become vastly more effective when combined with Hibiclens treatment. Any sort of tinea infection, for example, including those with secondary bacterial infections. Say you treat athlete&#x27;s foot with an OTC -azole product, only to have it laugh in your face. So get your feet wet and lather them up with lots of Hibiclens, working it into every nook and cranny, then let it sit there for a few minutes before rinsing. Do this every day for several days. This will totally destroy the tinea population on your feet; now all the OTC junk has to do is keep it suppressed, which it might actually do. If your shoes are washable (flip-flops or other plastic sandals), washing them with Hibiclens will make them germicidal— but then washing them with bleach will work too, and bleach is cheaper. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) kills germs by destroying their cell walls and cell membranes; this is not a subtle biochemical &amp;#34;monkey wrench,&amp;#34; like an antibiotic. Germs can not develop a defense against this mode of action. Also, CHG binds aggressively to the surface of skin, making your skin germicidal for hours after treatment.</li>
    <li> Hibiclens is a great topical antibiotic/antiseptic. Not necessarily for daily use, it&#x27;s best for wound washing and occasional washing of your feet or armpits, etc when they get beyond human limits of stinkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much better to use this once a week and regular soap the rest of the week, than constant use of &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; soap, with Triclosan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes out nice and foamy, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hibiclens is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, ears, and mouth. If Hibiclens  contacts any of these areas, rinse out promptly and thoroughly with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop using chlorhexidine topical and call your doctor at once if you have: severe burning, itching, or redness, blistering or peeling,swelling or severe skin rash, or any other severe irritation of treated skin.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended this to me to use in the shower to wash my face with daily for acne. It works very well. Non irritating. Just don&#x27;t get it in your mouth.</li>
    <li> We picked this up for my daughter at the recommendation from our family doctor.  It is helping quite a bit with her acne struggles.</li>
    <li> I needed this product to help decrease skin boils. Hibiclens works like magic. The product came as expected no issues. I will do business with them again!</li>
    <li> Hibiclens was prescribed for me when I had a bout with cellulitis a few years ago.  It helps protect from infections of the skin due to cuts and abrasions.  This is especially important to diabetics like me.  After using it for awhile,  I found that cuts and abrasions healed up faster and(to date) I have not had any return bouts with cellulitis  The 16 ounce hand pump dispenser makes it convenient to keep Hibiclens on almost any sink where one washes their skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a condition similar to mine.</li>
    <li> Just what the Doctor Ordered !  cleans all sensitive body ares without burning , No More Germs !&lt;br /&gt;Great for Post wound Care ! safely and gently !&lt;br /&gt;*****  THE BEST PRICE &amp; VALUE  IS RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON.COM&amp;#34;  AND NO WHERE ELSE !</li>
    <li> Great stuff, my skin feel very clean and smells great.  Well worth the miney</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The only bad thing is that it leaks but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended and very happy with the results</li>
    <li> Great daily antibacterial soap for the body.&lt;br /&gt;Keep away from the eyes, too.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for.  Helps clear my heat related rash</li>
    <li> Working for folliculitis</li>
    <li> Very good product at a great price. Delivered exactly on time</li>
    <li> ok product. Using it because it was recommended by the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I see any change in anything. I think she asked me to use for prevention purpose so I could not really tell you if it works or not!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is very foamy.  I discovered that I didn&#x27;t need underarm deodorant when using this regularly.  Be warned, DO NOT use this soap on your face or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a full week before major surgery and didn&#x27;t contract any infections due to my surgically clean skin.  Well, it was either my using this soap or my new practice of putting marshmallows under the tires of my car everyday - I&#x27;ll never know which was more effective.</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars but the foaming cleanser drips from the mouth and runs down the container. Very poor design.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps control sweat odor, also great in its antiseptic properties.  I recommend this multipurpose cleanser to everyone. Keep a bottle in your medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a great deodorant!</li>
    <li> i use it to keep my piercings from getting infected. works so well- just dont get it in your: mouth, eyes, gentials (never have just going by the label) and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
    <li> This is a good price for this size item and the pump makes it very convenient to use as well.</li>
    <li> Foam pump is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather use a drugstore brand antiseptic wash. This product didn&#x27;t give that sudsy factor like the drugstore brand. And cost wise I could have saved on the S &amp; H and purchased this from my local drugstore.</li>
    <li> This is the PINK BOTTLE with the spout and I loved it as its easy to use -- slightly more sudsy than the green bottle, or so it seemed.  If you want something that is medical strength antibacterial, this product does it and every time I run out (use it in the bath as well) my sensitive skin tens to pick up irritation easily as we have well water and not chlorinated water so we use this to keep our bath water sanitized.  If you have a septic system you want to be sure to add bacteria or not put a lot in as it is so effective it will kill or the septic system bacteria.  Been using it for almost 10 years on our farm.</li>
    <li> Foam is thick and makes using this product MUCH better!</li>
    <li> works.  use it once a week to clean area.</li>
    <li> Ordered product before and easily met expectations.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a YouTube review for people who suffer from skin boils.  The product helped me greatly, I use it ad preventive care in the areas where I frequently get the boils.  I also after showering if a small boil has started I put a super small amount directly on the boil every day - and do not wash it off - and in 3 days it is lower to almost gone. This is not a cure ALL item, I still go to the dermatology dept. But it does help.  I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I used Hibiclens Liquid Soap when working as an RN in Surgery for many years. I like the de-greasing qualities of the soap, the pleasant fragrance, and the resulting subjective &#x27;feel&#x27; of my skin after using this soap. It is also the soap of choice for many surgeons who supply patients with a pre-operative skin cleanser that is used in the shower. Hibiclens leaves a residual &#x27;barrier&#x27; of antiseptic on the skin. It cannot be used on mucous membranes (like in the mouth, or ear or eyes). For cleaning the skin after minor cuts and abrasions, it will sting like the dickens and is more irritating than Betadine or a 7.5% povodone iodine scrub. For broken skin, use Betadine, NOT Hibiclens, as you will cause some damage to the wound edges.</li>
    <li> I use hibiclens for a lot of things, it&#x27;s great for serious cuts and infections and also if someone in your house is very sick I wash my hands with this and never catch what they have.</li>
    <li> Nice and big, love the pump action as it seems to foam up the soap as it comes out.</li>
    <li> I have a psoriasis condition on my lower legs... and I use this in a hot water soak pan that comes up to my knees.  With other actions I find that this antiseptic helps my situation.  I will continue to purchase Hibiclens Antiseptic for my use.  I have one bottle on my bathroom tub (this bottle has the extra pump) and a smaller bottle with its own pump on my bathroom sink .  For my needs, I find this antiseptic very helpful.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! Keeps the little infections from the gym from affecting me. I use half to a full swirt into my puff, then add my regular body wash as usual. I am very careful when washing my face, keeping eyes tightly closed as well as my mouth and rinse very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this before I researched for natural way to hand sanitizing.. My mistake.</li>
    <li> Is keeping my hands very clean and I like it in the foam hand pump.  Less of the Hibiclens is wasted.</li>
    <li> great cleanser, works on wounds and skin everywhere.i also love that it comes with the pump.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the hand pump and it works so good.</li>
    <li> Not only is Hibicleans one of the best  Anti microbial  skin cleansers  on the market,  the handy pump on the bottle near your sink is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It really works!!! I use it on my face and on infections and it helps heal the infections, such as bacterial!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for washing hands after being and around infectious people &amp; places.</li>
    <li> Its doing wonders for my son wound care.</li>
    <li> Best product for bacteria.  I wash with it all the time.</li>
    <li> very pleased with my order.  surgery had to be rescheduled so I&#x27;m happy that I had purchased the 16 oz bottle</li>
    <li> Best OTC anti-bacterial cleanser for soaking wounds, diabetic ulcers, etc. First used in O.R. many years ago. Don&#x27;t expect a high foam from this product, just great results when used as directed.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, no more stinky sandals.....</li>
    <li> Good for skin troubled with sores.Daily application  has helped reduced skin  infections. A little but usegoes a long way, use sparingly.</li>
    <li> When I placed this order it showed 2 bottles when I received it i was just one, but the first time I ordered it I received to bottles like I was suppose to. not happy at all</li>
    <li> Good value purchased in combination with the big blue bottle. I was under the impression that the version of Hibiclens in the hand pump was different (it&#x27;s described as a scrub) but it proves to be the same formula as the blue bottle version -just in a hand pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say not to use it on genitals. I made the mistake of assuming that applied only to women. First time or two, no problem, but then it caused my boy bits to get really raw and weepy and tender and.... All of which took a couple of weeks to resolve. Believe those instructions!</li>
    <li> Used this to clear up some acne.  Wow!  I feel sterilized after a wash.  Works good on smelly feet too.  Not sure what this does for the antibiotic conundrum since you are killing so much bacteria but I think doctors use this stuff to wash their hands.  Don&#x27;t care since it works so good!</li>
    <li> I have HS and use this under my arms in the shower. This hasn&#x27;t cured me of my issue, but it really, really helps. A good note though, if you get it on the tub (or other surface) wipe it off. I have some that appears to have stained my tub.</li>
    <li> This soap has helped to treat cycling saddle sores. It&#x27;s a phenomenon that I&#x27;ve unfortunately recently become acquainted with. Anyways the soap clears up the area nicely and help speed up the saddle sore recovery.</li>
    <li> I got this for pre-surgery showers in prep. for a knee replacement.  Since I had no infection, I&#x27;m assuming the soap did OK, and that the pump distributed the soap as intended.  But the soap, including draining soap, left the grout  in my white shower pink.  Why put pink dye in a sterile soap?  Others should beware--protect any stainable surfaces, and rinse well immediately (although since you are hoping to remain sterile, this will be tricky).  Bottle should get me through the 10 showers required for both knees (one down, one to go).</li>
    <li> i had issues with bv &amp; yeast for years that seemed never-ending. though i don&#x27;t believe in over-use of anti-bacterial soaps &amp; such- i was desperate! so both my boyfriend &amp; i have been using this on our sexy parts (&amp; toys) and i think it helps. i&#x27;ve been taking supplements of oregano and chlorophyll too so hard to tell what exactly is helping, but i&#x27;m happy with this soap &amp; will keep as part of my/our regimen.</li>
    <li> Nothing better when dealing with wound care or infections.&lt;br /&gt;The industry standard. Not harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have MRSA and didn&#x27;t know how to treat it for the longest time.  I finally visited a competent dermatologist, who actually tested my condition, and she recommended Hibiclens.  Ever since I have been using this product, I have completely controlled my MRSA flare-ups and can wear shorts again.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended, patient approved.</li>
    <li> Recommended use is prior to surgery but I work in a college environment with all different kinds of people sharing the bathroom and drinking fountains. So I use it periodically. Makes me feel confident I&#x27;m eliminating any wicked bacteria lurking on my skin.</li>
    <li> You receive one bottle with a pump. Have found it very useful in controlling persistent acne. Found out that it works great to wash minor cuts and scrapes on the kids because it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn like other antiseptics.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. I use it in the shower after boxing or fighting on wrestling mats to protect myself from the infections commonly associated with those dirty mats. My pro-boxer buddy recommended this product and I am so glad that I listened and bought it. I really like the pump that came with my product. It makes using this stuff in the shower easier because it turns the liquid into foam. Highly recommended potent stuff.</li>
    <li> Received on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I like the order of Hibiclens because the pump saves me money. It comes out foamy so you use less. We use it everyday so this is a big deal!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected...except without the hand pump that was in the description.</li>
    <li> Great for folliculitis and the pump works great. I now get the chemical stuff from my doctor so I can just cut it with water and refill!</li>
    <li> This item with the hand pump is a great feature to have for use when taking a shower or by a sink.</li>
    <li> Great product, it got rid of my smelly feet and saved my marriage.</li>
    <li> This is a great antibacterial liquid soap .&lt;br /&gt;This is a great size and finding it at Amazon&lt;br /&gt;was a boon. The price is so affordable!!</li>
    <li> Great for wound care.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist Doctor told me to use it on my face Leave it on there for about 2 minutes  Wash it off in the shower It seems to get rid of my Pimples on my face Very little break out if any !</li>
    <li> Great Antiseptic, I Would Advise It&#x27;s Use To Anyone !!!</li>
    <li> Great product and pump makes you use less - so it lasts longer</li>
    <li> I use this product as hand soap. I wear gas perm contact lenses and wash my hands with this product prior to cleaning my lenses.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser and seems to last longer as hand soap than using the big green gallon bottle</li>
    <li> My Dr. wanted me to use another prescription product, but I was allergic to it. She told me to find the Hibiclens product. Make sure you buy a Pump Spray Nozzle for the size bottle you want to use, ex 16 oz. bottle, get 16 oz Pump. I use it every day, kind of a wipe on, wipe off. It leaves a barrier on your skin and fights bacteria from \\&quot;growing\\&quot; on skin surface. I use it for HS, if you know what it stands for, you&#x27;ll want to ask your Dr. if it will work for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent combating MRSA and germs quick pump we keep it near our sink and I use it on all our electric shavers, trimmers etc. to clean them and prevent germs getting in nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> Easy assembly with the hand pump.  Do keep in mind that the bottle comes as full as it can be with the nozzle in.  I tried to put the last bit of my prior bottle into the new one, and it ended up making a mess.</li>
    <li> My son wrestles an this cleanser keeps skin bacteria such as ring worm and impetigo at bay when used consistently and immediately after wrestling.  I highly recommend it.</li>
