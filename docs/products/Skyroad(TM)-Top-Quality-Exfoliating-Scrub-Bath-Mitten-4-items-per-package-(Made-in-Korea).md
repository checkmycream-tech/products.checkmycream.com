      <li>Feels better that way.</li>
      <li>They all love it.</li>
      <li>These really work great at exfoliating skin and I even use it for my face.</li>
      <li>Chemical exfoliation can be somewhat better for face because it does a thorough and even job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Some areas will come off better than others.</li>
      <li>Getting more for sure.</li>
      <li>How does it get so smooth with out being abrasive?</li>
      <li>Perfect for winter to get off all the dead skin and lock in your moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin baby smooth.  </li>
      <li>Lightly lather and rinse before using the product.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>Fair enough, honey :)</li>
      <li>I use it on my face along with a very fine, gently scrub &amp;</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  </li>
      <li>The top old layer of skin comes off easily and leaves your body silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and have fair skin.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best results are achieved after bath or at least 10 minutes of warm/hot</li>
      <li>The shipping more than doubled the price, but I&#x27;m still glad I only purchased two.</li>
      <li>A great little scrub that makes me feel really clean after every use.</li>
      <li>So many people have commented on how soft my skin is now.</li>
      <li>Really makes my skin feels clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Recommend to do it after at least 15 min of being in a hot shower, so it&#x27;ll be more effective.  </li>
      <li>The first time I saw these was at King&#x27;s Spa in Fort Lee, NJ.</li>
      <li>I find hot water stings a lot. &#x3D;</li>
      <li>You take a warm shower and then apply firm (but not painful) pressure to your skin and rub.</li>
      <li>Id say reduced by 70% after the first time.</li>
      <li>It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>they do a good job scrubbing off dead skin, which you can see coming off onto the cloth.</li>
      <li>Awful.....not the right texture to really exfoliate.</li>
      <li>my skin was left very smooth and soft afterward</li>
      <li>It feels like a sandpaper, so one has to be gentle.</li>
      <li>Came a few weeks early, and also came with a free sample sized etude house face conditioning cream, which I love</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get them wet, use them on moist skin and you will see better results than immersing them in water.</li>
      <li>These gloves work really well for exfoliating.</li>
      <li>You can apply soap to body after but you don&#x27;t really need it.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really amazing for such a small and cheap piece of scratchy fabric.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to cut down on the facials because of these cloths.</li>
      <li>I am a 5&#x27;2 female so you can imagine I was concerned about even fitting them over my hands after they shrunk nearly by a third.</li>
      <li>On my face I don&#x27;t add as much pressure and it leaves my skin glowing and really feeling soft.</li>
      <li>they are very fine and can rub the skin raw if used improperly.  </li>
      <li>It did shrink a bit, which made it a little more difficult to use, but my skin feels great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it online here because I don&#x27;t live near King&#x27;s Spa anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Protip - moisturizing lotion on the skin after, to thank it for suffering a little.</li>
      <li>I took this thing home from the spa and used it until it was time to get a new one.</li>
      <li>Small, but great for the face if you don&#x27;t mind a little scraping.  </li>
      <li>the cloth is adequately rough (i was worried it wouldnt be rough enough to exfoliate trouble spots like knees and elbows) and works amazingly on the face if applied with very light pressure.</li>
      <li>But no worries, i stretched it back easily to fit my hand, drastic improvement in area like underside of thighs and arms where I get lots of bumps and blackheads.</li>
      <li>Physical exfoliation on normal, heathy skin should be done gently and about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>Would recommend spending a little extra money for something better</li>
      <li>My three year old didn&#x27;t mind it, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
      <li>Gave 1 to my niece (48 yrs old)</li>
      <li>Im a fan of exfoliating every day using bath poofs that I replace whenever they get too soft</li>
      <li>&amp; she lets her daughter use it too (17 yrs old).</li>
      <li>Too small to use comfortably.  </li>
      <li>exactly as described and as i expected.</li>
      <li>Not happy very cheap made.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
      <li>Tiny and doesn&#x27;t fit even my small hands.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these because I have KP. After a few uses, the bumps are noticeably reduced! My daughters are thrilled too! I even have one to my sister. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I did not like these at all. They shrunk to less than half your hand once wet. Then as you&#x27;re using them to bathe they fall off your hand constantly. Was not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Not happy very cheap made. Shrink up when wet. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> These are amazing exfoliators. Don&#x27;t get them wet, use them on moist skin and you will see better results than immersing them in water. Got a lot of use out of them before they got ragged looking and a little musty.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the way these make my skin feel.  I use it daily and have fair skin.  Makes my skin baby smooth.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> This Italy towel is OP. (over-powered) This is cheaper than I can get at my local G Mart. Performance-wise? IT WORKS! So many people have commented on how soft my skin is now. Tips for use:&lt;br /&gt;1) Use once a week, twice if your skin can handle it&lt;br /&gt;2) Take a warm or hot(better results) shower/ bath for at least 10 minutes (20 is optimal) before scrubbing yourself with the cloth.&lt;br /&gt;3)Scrub HARD. Don&#x27;t be afraid to feel a little pain. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working when you look at your skin and there&#x27;s gray water and rolls of gray/white skin coming off. Some areas will come off better than others. Rinse off the rolls and yuck off in cold water. Feels better that way. I find hot water stings a lot. &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;4) Don&#x27;t apply any bath product to your skin before using the towel. You can apply soap to body after but you don&#x27;t really need it.&lt;br /&gt;5) Apply lotion or whatnot after your bath cause your skin will SOAK. IT. UP and make the results even better!&lt;br /&gt;6) DO NOT USE ON FACE or your privates. I learned this the hard way.</li>
    <li> Perfect skin scrub. Will buy again when this wears out. Really makes my skin feels clean and refreshed. Really top quality.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to get rid of dead skin. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> These work well, just be careful not to press too hard they are very fine and can rub the skin raw if used improperly.  But used lightly produces great results</li>
    <li> A great little scrub that makes me feel really clean after every use.</li>
    <li> Its great! Came a few weeks early, and also came with a free sample sized etude house face conditioning cream, which I love</li>
    <li> The first time I saw these was at King&#x27;s Spa in Fort Lee, NJ. (Korean spa)  they give these out to you with the other stuff like towels when you enter. They&#x27;re really amazing for such a small and cheap piece of scratchy fabric. You take a warm shower and then apply firm (but not painful) pressure to your skin and rub. The top old layer of skin comes off easily and leaves your body silky smooth. I liked it so much I took this thing home from the spa and used it until it was time to get a new one. I&#x27;m glad I found it online here because I don&#x27;t live near King&#x27;s Spa anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Protip - moisturizing lotion on the skin after, to thank it for suffering a little.</li>
    <li> Great scrubber in the shower!  Makes my skin feel 10x cleaner and softer... my mom is Korean and these were always around when I was growing up!!</li>
    <li> These gloves work really well for exfoliating. No soap or exfoliating cream are required. The best results are achieved after bath or at least 10 minutes of warm/hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves shrink but it does not affect the performance, except they cover only about 2/3 of my hands - a bit uncomfortable. Nonetheless I am very happy with these and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Probably the best exfoliating wash cloth I have ever used! Small, but great for the face if you don&#x27;t mind a little scraping.  I can find them for less at a Korean store.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.  Great deal. Dead skin was just coming off with every use. Recommend to do it after at least 15 min of being in a hot shower, so it&#x27;ll be more effective.  Also don&#x27;t use soap with it. Lightly lather and rinse before using the product. You might feel a little tingling in your skin which is normal.</li>
    <li> exactly as described and as i expected. the cloth is adequately rough (i was worried it wouldnt be rough enough to exfoliate trouble spots like knees and elbows) and works amazingly on the face if applied with very light pressure. yes- the cloth does shrink. it will stretch back over your hand though and you dont even need your entire hand in it to scrub. i use one for my face and a separate one for my body- considering this comes in a pack of four i think they will last a long time! they do a good job scrubbing off dead skin, which you can see coming off onto the cloth. my skin was left very smooth and soft afterward</li>
    <li> It did shrink a bit, which made it a little more difficult to use, but my skin feels great. How does it get so smooth with out being abrasive? My three year old didn&#x27;t mind it, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Awful.....not the right texture to really exfoliate. Waste of money</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin. It&#x27;s not so rough it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells. It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use soap with this product however my wife uses it in the traditional way, which is without soap, after which she applies moisturizing lotion.  She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  I tried it and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body is when you&#x27;re done.  I like to use it with soap because I&#x27;m just used my Zest smell, plus I don&#x27;t get the unsightly noodles.  She says I don&#x27;t do it that way I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  Fair enough, honey :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
    <li> just like the ones that you find at a korean sauna</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it! I use it on my face along with a very fine, gently scrub &amp; my pores have never looked this small. Gave 1 to my niece (48 yrs old) &amp; she lets her daughter use it too (17 yrs old). Gave 1 to my friend in NM. They all love it. Getting more for sure.</li>
    <li> Too small to use comfortably.  The shipping more than doubled the price, but I&#x27;m still glad I only purchased two. They&#x27;re going in the give away bag..</li>
    <li> This Bath Mitten has a very harsh surface. It feels like a sandpaper, so one has to be gentle. Even after a day of using it my skin feels very smooth and even to the touch. No other scrub product has done that in the past.</li>
    <li> Tiny and doesn&#x27;t fit even my small hands.  Would recommend spending a little extra money for something better</li>
    <li> These really work great at exfoliating skin and I even use it for my face. On my face I don&#x27;t add as much pressure and it leaves my skin glowing and really feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Physical exfoliation on normal, heathy skin should be done gently and about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Some signs of over-exfoliation are tightness, irritation, dryness and flaking. Please try not to scrub hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub mitten is small. It covers only half of my palm.&lt;br /&gt;After using it, it shrinks to unrecognizable shapes when dried.&lt;br /&gt;If these are things you&#x27;re concerned with, look for other brands/sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not use this on my face. Chemical exfoliation can be somewhat better for face because it does a thorough and even job.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to friends who are looking for small scrub mitten.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Takes off all dead skin without being harsh and leaving scrapes like some brushes do. Machine washable which is amazing. Only complaint they are very small and seem to shrink up a bit in the shower. Perfect for winter to get off all the dead skin and lock in your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely amazing!!!! Cannot say enough- I&#x27;ve told everyone I know about them! My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!!</li>
    <li> Great product!! My skin feels great! I&#x27;ve been able to cut down on the facials because of these cloths.</li>
    <li> These things are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Im a fan of exfoliating every day using bath poofs that I replace whenever they get too soft so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I didn&#x27;t Off tons of dead skin. However I was amazed at the amount that came off in areas where it&#x27;s hard to exfoliate with poof: arms, tops of feet, chest and tummy. Saying it shrinks is an understatement. I am a 5&#x27;2 female so you can imagine I was concerned about even fitting them over my hands after they shrunk nearly by a third. But no worries, i stretched it back easily to fit my hand, drastic improvement in area like underside of thighs and arms where I get lots of bumps and blackheads. Id say reduced by 70% after the first time. Sold sold sold!!!!!!!</li>
