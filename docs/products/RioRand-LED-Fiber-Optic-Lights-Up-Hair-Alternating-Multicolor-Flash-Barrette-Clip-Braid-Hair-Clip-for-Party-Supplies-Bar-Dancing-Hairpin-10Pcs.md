      <li>I thought these would be a cute novelty for some kids.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Wish they didn&#x27;t like up at the top and were easier to hide in your hair.</li>
      <li>These items looks great, and seem to be very well build.</li>
      <li>Most of the clip on lights worked.</li>
      <li>These were  even better than I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re bright and the flashing is fun for the outdoor night time event</li>

      <li>Also, all the girls love them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>grandkids love them, thank you</li>
      <li>I am a hula hooper and I love these.</li>
      <li>As one who purchases many blingy, light-up, flashing favors.....</li>
      <li>The will look great in my horse&#x27;s main when we run our carriage at night.</li>
      <li>All of these are flashing multicolor, and many strands do not have the light going through them.</li>
      <li>These are too cool!</li>
      <li>These things are so cool!</li>

      <li>and they&#x27;re all still going strong.</li>
      <li>Have yet to try them in hair but they look very cool and my daughter is excited to wear them.</li>
      <li>They really care to make certain you are happy with your purchase.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great clip on it to secure in hair&lt;br /&gt;Bendable&lt;</li>
      <li>you can still see them light up even during the daytime.</li>
      <li>Saved me a bunch of money from not having to buy my daughter overpriced Disney light up toys.</li>
      <li>im going to be the most colorful girl at the rave</li>
      <li>These are really cute and my guests loved them but they fell apart and left nylon treads all over the house.  </li>
      <li>These were super fun and easy to wear!  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m excited to use them.</li>
      <li>These will be so much fun!</li>
      <li>Fun to wear at the theme parks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy, my girl&#x27;s love having the lights for there hair.</li>
    <li> Your kids are gonna love them no matter what, but the fiber is not as bright as in the picture.  Perhaps in a completely black room, they&#x27;ll be that &amp;#34;fantastic&amp;#34; looking, but with any ambient light, the fibers get pretty washed out.  The clips themselves ARE actually that bright though.  Kids will rate these 5-stars, but as a consumer, I&#x27;d be more like a 3 due to the poor light transfer in the fiber.  Upgrade to a 4 because we&#x27;ve used these for 5 or 6 different occasions over the last few months and they&#x27;re all still going strong.</li>
    <li> They were a hit at my daughter&#x27;s sweet 16.</li>
    <li> These are fun and cool for concerts or kids. A little bulky but with some dedication, can be hidden pretty well. Great colors that add some life and fun to your hair.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Light is bright and flashy. I received them all in working order. Can&#x27;t wait to use them this weekend in a parade.</li>
    <li> Used for B day party. Girls loved them. All worked great.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item and delivery time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It was a great hit with my niece and the rest of the family as well! And the shipping was pain free and quick. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I wish this clips were smaller, but otherwise amazing and LONG LONG battery life!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was a big hit with these and seh loved them in her long hair.</li>
    <li> They work great! The clips are big and when you first look at it you question if it&#x27;s possible to clip it, but it&#x27;s possible and they are cute!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really a fun thing to have for parties.</li>
    <li> These are too cool! I ordered these for a 50th party I was planning. I only ordered one set. I didn&#x27;t expect all the women at the party to want to use them. All the women from 19-70 wanted one. I felt bad I didn&#x27;t have enough for everyone, but glad they were a hit. They stay lit all night.</li>
    <li> I got these for a coworker who puts a color strand in her hair every so often.  This was a gag gift that I hoped would pay off.  When I got the package, they were all individually wrapped in cellophane.  Not the best way to start off since I was giving them to someone.  Not like I was expecting these to be beautifully packaged, but I was hoping a little better than what I received.&lt;br /&gt;When I turned one on, I was officially disappointed.  If you look at the picture, these are bright!!!!  Not really the case.  I was optimistic because it was still daylight, but even when I took them out in the dark, they failed miserably.  I gave them two stars because they are indeed a gag gift, but if I was someone looking to get a product that is represented in the items description, it would have been just one star.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a color run but I think my niece loved them from the moment I turned it on in the middle of the day and she could see it &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34;. Now for the run I have really short hair so I thought it would stay a minute or two it was one of the few things left at the end of the run.  Mom, sisters and other racers wanted them.</li>
    <li> Great ggranddaughter loves them.  Bought them for her thirteenth birthday, along with makeup, book on application, and facial brush to keep skin clean.  Her mother loved it as she is a tomboy and hoped she would be more girly.  Oh boy mom be careful of what you wish for.</li>
    <li> These were super fun and easy to wear!  Stayed in while running!</li>
    <li> Very cute. Great for a party. Arrived right on time. Inexpensive way to liven up a group.</li>
    <li> received as expected! great!</li>
    <li> These are super fun party accoutrements.  They would be great with a trick-or-treat outfit.</li>
    <li> These things are so cool! They can be braided into the hair or put into the pony tail.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  The battery case/diode assembly is huge and the light is brilliant.  Not sure how it can hide in my hair.  The Alligator clip is intimidating and I fear for my tresses.</li>
    <li> These work great, look great, and stay in the hair without pulling.</li>
    <li> All the girls love them.</li>
    <li> These are great party favors.  But I want to speak about flashing pandas customer service.  They really care to make certain you are happy with your purchase.  Outstanding problem resolution.  As one who purchases many blingy, light-up, flashing favors.....I am a customer for life.  Thank you so much!~</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife and daughter to wear at Disney World. Loved that they were reusable. The flashing part at the top was very bright.  My daughter is 4 and loved that they flashed. My wife was able to hide the flashing part in her hair and weave the other parts through.  The flashing helped a few times easily find my daughter, especially since she wasn&#x27;t wearing the same Disney sold products as everyone else. Saved me a bunch of money from not having to buy my daughter overpriced Disney light up toys. Some of the staff members liked and commented on them as well and asked where i purchased them as they wanted cheaper alternatives to what Disney was peddling at over inflated prices. Also purchased 100 glow Sticks from amazon which my daughter loved.  She looked like a little florescent ball of light running around at night.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be a cute novelty for some kids.  The clips are so big that they aren&#x27;t easily hidden under hair.  So the concept is cute, but they don&#x27;t really work well.</li>
    <li> These sed hair extenders are nice, but not as portrayed.  I thought from the description that each one would emit a certain color.  In fact they change collors and flash.  I can certainly live without the flashing.  The will look great in my horse&#x27;s main when we run our carriage at night.</li>
    <li> Put these on our horse for a lighted christmas parade. They were a great hit and all the children loved them best part is that they have switches so they are easy to turn off and on. Wish you could have heard all the ooohs and ahhs, super fun.</li>
    <li> I am a hula hooper and I love these. They look great with my LED hoop. The top barrette part is a little weird the way that it lights up but that is a minor detail.</li>
    <li> Super bright and flashy with a switch and you&#x27;re able to replace the batteries!!! What more could you want???!!!</li>
    <li> These work fantastic! I wore them to a rave, and my pigtails looked fantastic! The only downside is the battery pack is way brighter than the LED strands. Each one is a different color.</li>
    <li> The clips are sorta hard to clip, and can&#x27;t have much in the clip, but they worked ok. I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in my hair - just kept popping. Out of the 10, on delivery, one did not work. After wearing the other 9 for a couple of hours, 3 stopped working. For the price, I was happy with the use we were able to get out of them for the glow party we attended.</li>
    <li> The end are itchy, need to trim them to see if they get better.</li>
    <li> exactly what we wanted and for a great price. Arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Only six of ten worked, hence a 60% rating</li>
    <li> I would not recommend these for people with dark/black hair! The light is bright at the top (the clip part), but you can&#x27;t see the twinkle in the strands. I was going to wear this to a rave last week but it just looked like there were a bunch of bright lights on my scalp and nothing in the rest of my hair. The bright clips are very difficult to cover up (if you try to pin it under your hair, it just looks like you are not wearing any lights at all).</li>
    <li> These were  even better than I thought they would be. They&#x27;re bright and the flashing is fun for the outdoor night time event I bought them for.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to see how they would look for my little girls rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll party but I never received it.  I even gave it a little longer to allow room for human error but i still have yet to hear from anyone. I tried to send messages to the seller several times and never heard anything back.  It was only $8 and change that i paid but its not like i meant it as a donation to the company.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, well. I can&#x27;t really rate it but this 1 star is definitely for the company&#x27;s lack of customer service skills &amp; not the product.</li>
    <li> Gave this a party gifts at a roller rink birthday party, wow, I was the most awesome mom ever!!!! The girls thought they were rock stars rollerskating. GREAT for a party gift!</li>
    <li> Worked very good.  Kids loved them!</li>
    <li> These are a blast. I thought they lit up rather well. Of course they won&#x27;t last forever and they hook on a bit awkwardly so you have to work at it, but for the price they&#x27;re rather nice.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them all yet, but the ones we have, work and look great.  Last a long time being able to switch them on and off.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Our club-goers loved them!</li>
    <li> Love these and the multipack is a great deal batteries last a long time. SO BRIGHT you will light up the night with rainbow strobe lights. Clip is about the size of two (2) quarters side by side. So positioning is a little difficult.</li>
    <li> We have several walkers when we put a float in the Grand Prix Illuminated Night Parade and the more lights the better. Also, all the girls love them.&lt;br /&gt;Could be a little brighter, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife for a costume.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Great sleepover fun for kids birthday party.  Decent price, &amp; they lasted thru the weekend for more fun.  Pretty color combinations &amp; hand7y pack of 10.</li>
    <li> Nice little accessories. Work well in complete dark.</li>
    <li> grandkids love them, thank you</li>
    <li> So I got this as something to try to spruce up my hair for our wedding but I don&#x27;t think I will be using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great clip on it to secure in hair&lt;br /&gt;Bendable&lt;br /&gt;Really bright!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Changes color very quickly and flashes&lt;br /&gt;The clip part is bigger than expected and does not hide well in hair&lt;br /&gt;The clip part flashes and changes color too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - this is going to be a great stocky stuffer for my friends!</li>
    <li> Several did not work and they are not as bright as the picture.  Girls still had fun with them at slumber party.</li>
    <li> These will be so much fun! Very cute in the hair and I am adding these to a wig.</li>
    <li> Gift item for a 5 year old.  She puts it in her dolls hair and her own.  It is a fun item.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, beautiful colors, even worked well to tie around my hair. Would definitely buy again especially for how many I get and for such a low cost</li>
    <li> I wish that they were solid colors, but all of them worked and the children seem to love them.</li>
    <li> Awesome and fabulous!  the clips with the battery are a bit big - but I have very thick hair and no problem hiding them.  These are festive and fun, and great price!</li>
    <li> Fun to wear at the theme parks!</li>
    <li> these are amazing!!! love them. Yes the clip is big but it isnt anything to not like the product over.</li>
    <li> Have yet to try them in hair but they look very cool and my daughter is excited to wear them.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, great quality. Worked perfect for my sisters glow party!</li>
    <li> These are really neat and show up well at night.  One of the 10 didn&#x27;t work, but otherwise they behaved as advertised.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and just as the picture showed. I&#x27;m excited to use them.</li>
    <li> These are really cute and my guests loved them but they fell apart and left nylon treads all over the house.  I will be cleaning these up for months.</li>
    <li> you can do tons of stuff with these theyre fun and the price is so woth it . buy them trust me</li>
    <li> I wore these and throw some at a night Mardi Gras parade. Lasted all night and looked great to parade goers.</li>
    <li> 3 out of 10 dead on arrival.  really really bad quality</li>
    <li> Tons of compliments on these things for the bachelorette parties I got them for. Pretty durable and birght.</li>
    <li> Most of the clip on lights worked. A few did not which was a little disappointing. Fun though.</li>
    <li> These items looks great, and seem to be very well build. Would get them again!!!!</li>
    <li> These are really really fun, but the clips are ginormous. Wish they didn&#x27;t like up at the top and were easier to hide in your hair.</li>
    <li> They do as advertised but they&#x27;re extremely dim, even in a dark room. I ordered some others off amazon from different manufacturer&#x27;s and they&#x27;re bright enough you can still see them light up even during the daytime. Wouldn&#x27;t get these again even though the price is good.</li>
    <li> Bought these for all the girls for Vegas New Years on the Strip.  They were a hit!.  Yes, the clips are sort of large and hard to hide.  This is less noticeable in thicker hair.  One of the girls with us had very thin hair and hers kept falling and had to be readjusted.  I have thicker hair and it worked great for me - as well as for the other 4 girls with us.  They stayed lit all night and definitely helped to make our outfits more fun!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a concert! Love it</li>
    <li> Came on time and looks great.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Great product</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and works as advertised.  I am a very happy customer.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> These were amazing! I purchased them for my daughter&#x27;s glow in the dark slumber party. They are very well made and survived a house full of 8 year old girls.</li>
    <li> Really cool idea. The only down side is the part that clips to your hair is way brighter than the actual fiber optic strands. Still gonna wear them to Burning Man though :)</li>
    <li> Got them as favors at a roller rink birthday party, the kids loved wearing them!</li>
    <li> They are so Bright and beautiful im going to be the most colorful girl at the rave im gonna wear these to!</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. In the picture each is a different color. All of these are flashing multicolor, and many strands do not have the light going through them. I would not buy these again and I don&#x27;t think they will work for the intended purpose (night time party)</li>
