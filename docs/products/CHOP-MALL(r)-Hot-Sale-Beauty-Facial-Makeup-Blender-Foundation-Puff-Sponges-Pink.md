      <li>Love</li>
      <li>In love with this.</li>
      <li>better than the one i bought at the sephora</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through and tried so many of the knocks offs</li>
      <li>Cheap knock off of a beauty blender and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>But it was super cheap</li>

      <li>Makes make up so much easier I totally love it</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price</li>
      <li>Great product a little harder and washes off great.  </li>
      <li>Very good , wash if its too hard !</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t expect much !</li>

      <li>It does not blend my concealer or foundation well, picks up way too much product and absorbs it before I can apply or picks up way too much off of my face that I just applied.</li>
      <li>I literally had to use twice as much liquid makeup to cover up my imperfections.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend as it does not have a nice finish, easy application, and wastes so much product After getting the sponge wet</li>
      <li>But I love the quality and it&#x27;s so soft after you wet it.</li>
      <li>They are so functional and cheap that I&#x27;m not sure why I haven&#x27;t just order a whole slew of them and stashed them aside! ....</li>
      <li>Ok this product is too hard for application...</li>
      <li>its ok but slow shipping</li>

<ol>
    <li> Makes make up so much easier I totally love it</li>
    <li> Absorbs lots of makeup</li>
    <li> better than the one i bought at the sephora</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took forever to ship. But I love the quality and it&#x27;s so soft after you wet it. Great dupe for the beauty blender and way inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I really disliked this sponge...I&#x27;ve used different ones but this sponge just absorbs the makeup and stays there. I literally had to use twice as much liquid makeup to cover up my imperfections.</li>
    <li> Great product a little harder and washes off great.  Delivery took about two weeks though. Wasn&#x27;t to long of a wait but longer then I&#x27;m use to with amazon.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get it but I absolutely love it !</li>
    <li> This product came in pretty late and when I got it the bag it was in was super dirty with some type of oil or grease and it was open so it got all over it! It works okay and I use it everyday but you have to keep up with it and wash it every 2nd/3rd use.</li>
    <li> Very good , wash if its too hard !&lt;br /&gt;Does soak up alot of foundation , have to keep washing it but blends well . I have two from the seller</li>
    <li> really good product, will be ordering more! totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works! feels like it will last me a while.. Good for zero make up smugdes on face.</li>
    <li> Broke the day I got it.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price</li>
    <li> I bit more dense that actual beauty blender</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, save up and get a real beauty blender. I&#x27;ve gone through and tried so many of the knocks offs and they just don&#x27;t work. It does not blend my concealer or foundation well, picks up way too much product and absorbs it before I can apply or picks up way too much off of my face that I just applied. I do not recommend as it does not have a nice finish, easy application, and wastes so much product After getting the sponge wet it did not take on the water and get softer like blenders should, the sponge is too hard and condensed. Its so hard that it literally makes a &amp;#34;thunk&amp;#34;sound when you tape on skin to apply or blend make up.</li>
    <li> Love this make up blender!</li>
    <li> It takes a lot of time but I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok this product is too hard for application...</li>
    <li> Perfect! Good price, cant beat it, I would order six more sometime soon</li>
    <li> This beauty blender does not expand at all</li>
    <li> I received this item 6 days earlier than expected. It&#x27;s a compact version of the more expensive beauty blenders and works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love it came way before it&#x27;s date</li>
    <li> I like these sponges but I hate the long wait time to get them.</li>
    <li> Love the sponge, very good quality and the price fair enough.</li>
    <li> not good. doesnt serve my purpose</li>
    <li> the best beauty buy ever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these... They are so functional and cheap that I&#x27;m not sure why I haven&#x27;t just order a whole slew of them and stashed them aside! .... In fact, perhaps I will go do that right now! ;)</li>
    <li> In love with this. A cheaper version of what everyone else was using but works equally if not better then the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> its ok but slow shipping</li>
    <li> rubber stamp like lol. i wasted a couple of bucks</li>
    <li> Got em all!! Sooner than expected nice for liquid foundation application.</li>
    <li> Cheap knock off of a beauty blender and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. Very splotchy application and the sponge is rather hard. But it was super cheap so I can&#x27;t expect much !</li>
