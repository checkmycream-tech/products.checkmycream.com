      <li>It is a great product for acne!</li>
      <li>Well, I heard awesome things about the Olay spin brush and decided to combine it with this product.</li>
      <li>Best on the spot treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I did!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be good to go!</li>
      <li>Benzoyl peroxide is great for healing and preventing acne, but all formulas sold in pharmacies are 10%, which burns.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen great results</li>
      <li>It was a great product.  </li>
      <li>So I started doing that with this cream and it works great.</li>

      <li>The product is excellent with amazing results.  </li>
      <li>She happy, I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
      <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s a great service.</li>
      <li>after a couple weeks of using each one once a day, I am pimple free!!!</li>
      <li>I thought neutrogena was supposed to be good for people with allergies.</li>
      <li>This product is relatively good in the sense that it prevents breakouts.</li>
      <li>I used it for a good week.</li>
      <li>This Im still not seeing good results with unlike the oil acne wash.</li>
      <li>Fabulous and wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I thought Neutrogena On-the-Spot would be a good solution because of the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
      <li>However, Amazon refund me, Amzon&#x27;s service is really good.</li>
      <li>Good price also, will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I do have good skin and take care of it exceptionally well.  </li>
      <li>For someone like me who&#x27;s cursed, this probably isn&#x27;t the best answer, but it&#x27;s always worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>For under $6 (at Walmart) you can&#x27;t buy a better product!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with it!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m getting amazing results with both uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t believe that there are so many comments saying how good this product is</li>
      <li>Really good product :)</li>
      <li>Concentration of 2.5% is said to be as effective as 5~10%, but not as intolerable by skin.</li>
      <li>Best real acne cream I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a nice product.</li>
      <li>My wife is so happy with her new looks which, of course, makes me happy too.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it works like magic!</li>
      <li>Great, powerful product.</li>
      <li>no stimulation to the skin, suitable for emergency treatment of the skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a bit stronger but more effective.</li>
      <li>(Aberela is extremely effective and my favorite for sure), this Neutrogena cream is the most effective I&#x27;ve had without having a prescription.</li>
      <li>walked into my local grocery store looking for some kind of acne treatment that would work perfectly.</li>
      <li>The pimple will look so much better by morning.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t make it better either.</li>
      <li>Now I use almond, coconut, or olive oil instead and remain blemish free!</li>
      <li>Make sure you use it after cleaning/washing your face and DO NOT be exposed to the sun (the biggest reason why your skin may get burnt and itchy).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use more if I start noticing a bump since once in</li>
      <li>but overall, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to apply it evenly.</li>
      <li>best acne product that i have stick to for last 7 years.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d save money with this, but Arbonne is better.</li>
      <li>Better one time per day, I suggested.</li>
      <li>My daughter use it twice a day and her face looks better in two weeks.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even remember how many creams, lotions etc.  </li>
      <li>Arbonne&#x27;s cream works better and faster</li>
      <li>I tried so many over the counter products that I was at the point of giving up.</li>
      <li>but oh so lovely kiss from them.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for more than five years.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my relative, she&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
      <li>and now I&#x27;m able to apply it up to 4-5 times a day without experiencing any adverse reactions.</li>
      <li>:) and it doesnt redden the area if used with a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, I eat healthy, drink a gallon of water a day,</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happier :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cheap, easy to use and effective.</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Honestly, the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place.</li>
      <li>I have found amazon to have a better price compared to brick and mortar stores, plus it gets sent to your house for free if you subscribe.</li>
      <li>this stuff is effective and worth the wait for shipping.  </li>
      <li>I think this product may be great for people who are not allergic to benzoyl peroxide, but for people who may be allergic to it, please TEST it first before you start really using it!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve experienced none, also this product has only 2.5% of benzoyl unlike others like acne free etc that has 5% to 10 %.&lt;br</li>
      <li>again, it&#x27;s Johnson &amp; Johnson that owns BOTH Neutrogena and Clean &amp; Clear (the manufacturers of Persa-Gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, both products are great, and they work.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with the Neutrogena 3 in 1 hydrating acne cream ( which is great for moisturizing but isn&#x27;t strong enough to kill pimples by itself )</li>
      <li>despite the claims, there is NO product available which can get rid of existing blemishes.</li>
      <li>My skin is glowing and even and smooth.</li>
      <li>Why is this important you ask?  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who needs some acne help or who wants to maintain great skin.</li>
      <li>I am evidently allergic to the BP in this product, as many others mentioned.</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change on my skin.</li>
      <li>Originally I was worried about allergy.</li>
      <li>This works perfect for my mature skin and also for my teenage son.</li>
      <li>Even though there are several creams that are more effective prescribed by the doctor</li>
      <li>I bought it when it was a free add-on for super saver shipping</li>
      <li>and I read a lot of reviews, most of them are positive.</li>
      <li>Works so good that I bought a second tube.</li>
      <li>Anyway, if Neutrogena&#x27;s good enough for my dermatologist to prescribe me Retin-A Micro, which she has done; then, it&#x27;s good enough for me to trust an over-the-counter, on-the-spot benzoyl peroxide</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to have gotten really better, but then no worse.  </li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>In the morning, I have noticed that my blemishes are much less noticable, though there are better on-the-spot treatments out there that do jsut as good of a job reducing blemishes and aren&#x27;t quite as drying.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face super shiny.  </li>
      <li>I love about THIS particular product (Neutrogena)</li>
      <li>I have to say this treatment may be too mild to me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this stuff is effective and worth the wait for shipping.  LOL</li>
    <li> This product is great. Make sure you use it after cleaning/washing your face and DO NOT be exposed to the sun (the biggest reason why your skin may get burnt and itchy). apply a thin layer twice a day and make sure you do not use any foundation during the treatment.</li>
    <li> This product ruined my nice sheet set by bleaching everywhere my face touched in only 2 nights. I am evidently allergic to the BP in this product, as many others mentioned. My face has been on fire and very red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Very disappointed in this product. I thought neutrogena was supposed to be good for people with allergies.</li>
    <li> I use it since I was a teenager. It helps me a lot. Excellent product. The best I know for acne. I totally recomend it.</li>
    <li> Usually Neutrogena products do miracles on my face. I have severe acne and I have to have a facial regimen in order to keep my breakouts tamed. Once I ran out of Neutrogens&#x27;s Stress Gel I started to use this product. The first day was okay, but the next couple of days my skin got worse. As of today 1/31/2011, my skin has broken out in other spots where I didnt have acne. The areas also turned red and my face itches and burns. I have since stopped using the product. Im just hoping the itching and redness will stop soon. This problem has never occured with any other acne products. If you have sensitive skin or other skin problems..beware of this product.</li>
    <li> I have been an acne sufferer since I was 11 (am now 26). Been to dermatologists numerous times and the only thing that has EVER put a dent in my acne was Accutane. I&#x27;ve taken it twice, and the pimples keep coming back. (FYI-I do not have cystic acne, just stubborn white heads and red bumps on my face, chest, and back.) I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of OTC products, organic stuff, drastically changed my diet, you name it. I used another benzoyl peroxide treatment (because face washes never did a thing for me) and I saw that it helped...but it was nothing to write home about. I heard rave reviews about this one so I tried it. Definite improvement! The redness in my face went down and some of my trouble spots cleared up. I also have a problem with needing to exfloiate my skin. If I don&#x27;t do it everyday it gets very rough. Well, I heard awesome things about the Olay spin brush and decided to combine it with this product. Figured if I got the layer of dead skin off, the medication could penetrate better. Well guess what...after a couple weeks of using each one once a day, I am pimple free!!! It&#x27;s nothing short of a miracle. My skin is glowing and even and smooth. Great, powerful product. I recommend 100%    Update 8/3..........I made the mistake of slacking off with this product for a few weeks, and my face went right back to the way it was. Yuck! I jumped back on the bandwagon and started using it every night, and in the mornings if I remembered, and within a week 97% of my breakouts are gone, ALL of my redness is gone, and my skin is smooth. Yes, it does bleach some fabrics. Listen to the other reviews and use white pillowcases and towels. You&#x27;ll be good to go! This little tube is worth way more than 5 stars in my book!</li>
    <li> Use it last thursday, 2 days later, almost my whole face begin to appear allergy.&lt;br /&gt;So if u do want to try this product, just use a little on your hand to see whether u r sensitive to this product, after about 3 days, there&#x27;s no reaction, just use it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bad experience for me because it&#x27;s my first time to choose product from Neutogena. However, Amazon refund me, Amzon&#x27;s service is really good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 3-4 months now and used it on my acne whenever one appeared. The blemish went off after a couple of days. It did redden and dry the spot a bit. However, recently I learnt that the best way to get rid of acne is to use benzoyl peroxide regularly over the entire problem area. So I started doing that with this cream and it works great. I havent had any acne for a whole week. :) and it doesnt redden the area if used with a moisturizer. It does not go on as smoothly as I would like it to and it does still dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty fast it takes redness and swelling down within hours and the pimple is gone within 3 days no blemish left behind</li>
    <li> I bought it and it says that you start with one application until you reach three. I don&#x27;t have an aggressive acne but sometimes It appears. I only have to use it one time a day, at night in the affected area and the next day the outbreak was totally dry.</li>
    <li> It works, basically dries up the pimple pretty quick. It works!</li>
    <li> Everyone has different skin, but mine tends to dry out and get easily irritated.  I thought Neutrogena On-the-Spot would be a good solution because of the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide.  Unfortunately the product made my skin red and flaky, so much so that it is taking a few days for my skin to get back to normal.  I usually have pretty good luck with Neutrogena products, but I think I&#x27;ll be getting my skin care items elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Best real acne cream I have ever used.  I am over fifty and am prone to picking up &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; from my husband or children with a simple but oh so lovely kiss from them.  Acne is contagious and if not treated can spread on your face and body. In my case it caused some scaring before i realized it was not just a pimple.  There are a lot of causes for different skin irritations, blemishes, white and black heads etc... But a virus causing acne &amp;#34; is not going to go away just by washing. You can pay a lot of money to treat acne and if OnThe Spot doesn&#x27;t work for you then I would recommend going that way. What I found however is that this very inexpensive cream works as well if not better for me in clearing my acne than the best and very expensive treatments I tried from my cosmetologist.  I have been using this cream for four years now and whenever I have an outbreak the acne is gone within days after using OnTheSpot.</li>
    <li> It just plain works! My wife is so happy with her new looks which, of course, makes me happy too. Not easy to think up over 20 words to tell the truth: It Just Plain Works.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Couldn&#x27;t be more happier :)</li>
    <li> I recently started breaking out on my cheeks and jawline which was never a problem area when I was in my teens. This works if you use it just like the directions say: on clean skin, once a day initially then increase to several times daily. On day two I use it like every 2 hours.     It makes the pimple or, in my case, underground monster, less visible and less irritating. It gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop. After day two it completely disappears.     Honestly, the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place. Oh, and I started changing my pillow case every night.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything but it didn&#x27;t get rid of any pimples I had...I guess it depends on the skin types..</li>
    <li> In a few day you can see the difference. It&#x27;s great. My daughter use it twice a day and her face looks better in two weeks.</li>
    <li> Regular use of this fellow kills it like no other. I had been suffering from severe acne problems for close to two-three years (I have left my teenage years well behind) with no solution in sight before I used this cream. Problem solved. Its been more than a year and a half and I haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts. Two thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;Regular use is advised (from my experience), especially in humid weather.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than five years. I have sensitive skin, and am lucky enough to not break out a lot. However, once in a while I&#x27;ll get one or two blemishes on my chin or nose, and if witch hazel does not make them go away, I put this on them. It completely rubs in, so you do not see it at all. However, for me, the product doesn&#x27;t make them disappear, but rather speeds up the process. It quickly brings the blemish to head (within a day or so) so that the gross gunk can be (carefully) removed and can start healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely only for little spot areas, and not to slather all over the face because it is very drying if you continuously use it for many days on the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only blemish cream I use, and it works great for my particular skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s and have been getting worse acne than when I was a teen.  Don&#x27;t really know why.  I have been using this for a couple of weeks now. I noticed that a few pimples, that I could tell wanted to turn into giant monsters, were suppressed.  They still haven&#x27;t gone away completely but they haven&#x27;t gotten real big or irritated.  But then I have another breakout that I&#x27;ve been applying this on, and it drys my skin out so much that my skin peels and the acne opens up, but then it never goes away.  In a few days the breakout is just where it started, only my skin there is ugly and irritated.  My acne can&#x27;t decide if it wants to go away or become big and ugly, so for the most part it just hangs out.  I haven&#x27;t noticed an awesome improvement with this.  For someone who has minor acne, this may work just fine.  For someone like me who&#x27;s cursed, this probably isn&#x27;t the best answer, but it&#x27;s always worth a shot.  Everyone has different skin, hormones, etc. so ya never know.&lt;br /&gt;It gets two stars because it did seem to prevent a few pimples from becoming huge and unsightly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this was any miracle product.  Its a little drying and can stain your pillowcase or towel if not careful.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that keeps me clear. I&#x27;m thirty and I&#x27;ve had acne for twenty years. I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is the only thing that keeps my face clear and pleasant. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Once in a while I still get suckered in to trying something new and always come back to this.</li>
    <li> I used a small amount of this product once on my chin before bed and overnight it was already bothering me.  It left a burning feeling and also dried out my skin badly (almost immediately), it felt as if someone was pulling my skin very tight then it started to itch.  It also left a huge red burn mark where I put it on.  I&#x27;d rather have the acne spot!  It&#x27;s now day four and the problems I explained are finally going away.  Thankfully I only put it on once and only a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is terrible, I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after in was recommend as a disinfectant in the book Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me. I had been becoming extremely frustrated with my oily skin and frequent breakouts, so I was ready to try something new. For the past 1 1/2 months, I have been religiously using this product in the morning and Clear Pore Nighttime Clarifying Gel (a BHA product) prior to bed. While I haven&#x27;t seen miraculous results, I have had a reduction in breakouts, and my skin texture seems to be slowly improving. In addition, I am no longer getting the dry, flaky patches which I was getting with other products. However, my skin is still oily, and I do still experience the occasional breakout. While this product certainly might provide you with some benefits over time, keep in mind that you will not see immediate results:  despite the claims, there is NO product available which can get rid of existing blemishes.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have returned to using it when the drugstore is out of my usual on-the-spot treatment. I use this product only at night - when the cream dries, it does leave a little flaky residue - for this reason, I would recommend using it only at night or other times when you aren&#x27;t going to be out in public. It can dry out your skin a little. In the morning, I have noticed that my blemishes are much less noticable, though there are better on-the-spot treatments out there that do jsut as good of a job reducing blemishes and aren&#x27;t quite as drying.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face super shiny.  However, it makes my face feel thick (it&#x27;s not that bad).  So far my blemishes seem smaller.</li>
    <li> Fabulous and wonderful product. This one has worked for me ever since I was a little girl, and I am so ashamed of myself for *ever* turning away from it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only products that really helps eliminate my acne. At the first sign of a pimple I will apply this before bed and go to sleep. Every pimple is different, but what I found to be great is when I feel a cystic pimple coming on, you know those deep rooted ones that never really come to a head and just cause pain, well I can cut the time in half thanks to this treatment. Best on the spot treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This worked okay but it is expensive and if it was needed often might be difficult for some to afford. I bought it for a specific problem which It worked well on.</li>
    <li> This was for my son and it worked for a few days and then they came back with a vengeance.</li>
    <li> Ive used this from time to time over the past month or so to essentially no avail. The product did not diminish any bump I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne is by no means severe so a simple astringent such as witch hazel with a neutrogena facial cleansing bar is all I use to minimize breakouts. The cream I would use to apply at night on the one or two bumps that occasionally appeared. However, all that would come of my effort was dried-up cream when I awoke in the morning where I had applied over the bump. Not sure if it takes a few days for the bump to disappear or if I should have been applying every night until it reduced, but I did not. I used the product once per pimple. Again, to virtually no difference.</li>
    <li> not only did this not work but there was a chemical paste-like smell to it.  the benzoyl peroxide was 2.5%.  i&#x27;d recommend nature&#x27;s cure acne vanishing cream 5%.  it&#x27;s a bit stronger but more effective.</li>
    <li> I do have good skin and take care of it exceptionally well.  This is a must go-to product for those times when my complexion needs some spot treatment.  Instantly reduces inflammation and redness, allowing the healing process to begin immediately.  Best price found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It helps but because I have a t-zone it doesn&#x27;t really help the oily section.  I keep breaking out.  The acne disappears, but I would need to apply it  several times a day.  It&#x27;s not strong enough but it does control the acne break out.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my relative, she&#x27;s very happy with it. She happy, I&#x27;m happy too. Gonna come back a gain</li>
    <li> I think this is a nice product. In my past experiences, I have come to appreciate Neutrogena products because of the way my skin looks and feels after using them. The Benzoyl Peroxide is this product makes it effective for lessening the red, swollen, and infected skin, but it did not cure my acne. I was not expecting it to completely get rid of it, but I am satisfied with the way my face looks now compared to how it used to look. So if you are looking for something to clean up your face and forever get rid of acne damage, this is not exactly the product for you.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it works like magic! It does take time, it will not work after just a &amp;#34;few tries&amp;#34;, but it DOES work. It also helps clear darks spots as well! This will always be my go to pimple treatment.</li>
    <li> It is really vanishing, but for me didn&#x27;t work much, maybe because I~m an adult, as for my thirteen-year old son worked better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teenager and I read a lot of reviews, most of them are positive. I decided to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work for me and it leaves white residue on my face. It dries out my face a lot too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I find an acne cream that actually works!! I don&#x27;t even remember how many creams, lotions etc.  I tried over the years until now for adult acne. This is the first time I really see some result and I even don&#x27;t use it regularly. If you put it on at night you&#x27;ll see the effect the next morning. Even if the blemishes don&#x27;t completely go away the next day, they reduce down in size. It helps with the redness and the pain. I have a very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. The only minor issue is that I don&#x27;t think it is completely vanishing. Some white residue still stays but it is manageable. Overall very gentle yet powerful cream. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> My face began to clear up after about a week of use. It didn&#x27;t clear up completely but there was an improvement.</li>
    <li> left my skin red and dry, actually made the pimples WORSE. im 15 and have generally clear skin, so whenever i get a pimple its just one or two at a time, this made me break out in the spots around the pimple and left my skin red and severly dry. i now use OXY brand products.</li>
    <li> When I was younger they could not add too much benzoyl peroxide, as far as I was concerned.  Now that I am older and have sensitive skin with rosacea this gentler formulation does the trick on the occasional (non-rosacea) blemish and does not irritate my skin.  It really does vanish.  I bought it when it was a free add-on for super saver shipping and I was thrilled, because the price was right and the local stores often were out.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this works for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best acne treatment, and does not dry my skin out like other brands.  Believe it is 2.5% BP.</li>
    <li> I am so angry at myself for buying this product. Not only that it doesn&#x27;t help it also leaves red marks on my skin. I just couldn&#x27;t believe that there are so many comments saying how good this product is, that&#x27;s why l kept using it. But eventually l just realized that it definitely it&#x27;s not working for me and my skin. I am 23 and my skin type is normal.</li>
    <li> neutrogena products always deliver. this product has helped my frequent break- outs.&lt;br /&gt;thanks again neutrogena!!! lived up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> This Im still not seeing good results with unlike the oil acne wash. I might have to return it to Amazon and get my money back to buy another oil free acne wash!!</li>
    <li> I disappoint  from this treatment, the review and rating for it were encouraged me to use it. But it not effected at all for me.</li>
    <li> This product dries out my pimples but it gave me allergies,  i have a pimple near my lips and put some on it, the next day my lips is swollen and have blisters on it, i tried to think of other causes but this is the only new stuff that im using, put it on again the next day on my pimples, lips start tingling and burning and throat started itching, rinse my face and quit using the product, my throat quit itching and blisters on lips have dried up after few days</li>
    <li> best acne product that i have stick to for last 7 years. not over drying and you can feel it working.</li>
    <li> I bought this acne treatment product because the last kind I tried had run out and I was looking to start a new face cleaning/treatment regimen.  I looked up a lot of advice and recommendations on the web and decided I would try this on-the-spot treatment. It works very well, and my face cleared up drastically overnight. The only thing I do not like is the thickness of the product when applied to the face and the rate at which it dries. I read that it dries quickly, because it is a cream instead of a gel, but I didn&#x27;t think it would really dry that quick-it does. You have to put it on very quickly and purposefully, or else it will dry up and you won&#x27;t be able to apply it evenly. It also leaves my face feeling like I have a mask on, but I am willing to deal with that because of the outcome. I also wish it came in a larger quantity, but it was nice to not have to buy a small quantity for the first time trying it in case it did not work for my face type.  This product has a good dosage of bp, not too much to make your face feel like it is burning off, but enough to clear up blemishes over night.</li>
    <li> I used to have pretty bad acne, but thankfully it cleared up! I do sometimes get the occasional pimple..yippee. Lucky me, I got a big one right in the middle of my cheek right before vacation. I bought this on a whim and thought I&#x27;d try it on my bad timing zit. I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this. After a day, it was gone! It wasn&#x27;t red and puffy anymore, and with a little make-up was nonexistant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you should slather this all over you face though, it does really dry out your skin and leaves it feeling kind of stiff and like you have dry soap on it... but overall, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> First off, I use Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 every once in a while for really demanding blemishes; it seems to dry them out - REALLY dry them out - much quicker.  And I guess this is really the reason I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s just too drying, and I have oily skin.  (I can only imagine what it would do to dry skin.)  Anyway, it does work.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  But you&#x27;ll probably end up peeling and just really, really dry; so, be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about THIS particular product (Neutrogena) is that it essentially packs the punch of Persa-Gel 10 without drying your face out.  And I guess the way it does this is that because it has a lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide, its effectiveness is spread out over a longer period of time; the results are not as immediate.  Persa-Gel on the other hand, is so strong that yes it works faster, but the downside is that it&#x27;ll dry you out.  And recovering from that will take days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, what really sold me on Neutrogena&#x27;s product was that it was in fact made by Neutrogena.  Why is this important you ask?  Well.  Neutorgena also manufactures Retin-A Micro (Tretinoin Gel), which is a godsend for acne sufferers.  It is available by prescription only.  (Imagine that... a Neutrogena product you&#x27;d need a prescription for.)  Anyway, if Neutrogena&#x27;s good enough for my dermatologist to prescribe me Retin-A Micro, which she has done; then, it&#x27;s good enough for me to trust an over-the-counter, on-the-spot benzoyl peroxide treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, it&#x27;s Johnson &amp; Johnson that owns BOTH Neutrogena and Clean &amp; Clear (the manufacturers of Persa-Gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, both products are great, and they work.  Just know that one is going to dry you out more than the other; so, if you&#x27;re looking for a long-term regimen, definitely invest in Neutrogena&#x27;s On-the-Spot Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read about RETIN-A MICRO at:&lt;br /&gt;(...)</li>
    <li> This is the one product I can&#x27;t do without in my nightly routine. It keeps my skin clear and my breakouts under control. I don&#x27;t find this product overly drying but I do have oily skin (unfortunately). It does take a couple days to work initially especially if I&#x27;ve been on a trip and forgot it at home. For the price it is definitely on the pricer side compared to other products. I have found amazon to have a better price compared to brick and mortar stores, plus it gets sent to your house for free if you subscribe. I always find that it takes me a month and half to use a tube so it makes subscribing in months a pain but otherwise it&#x27;s a great service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and have had acne problems for many years. My problem areas are generally along my jawline and on my chest, but I use this every day before I go to bed and it makes a big difference. Like any product with benzoyl peroxide, it does bleach a little bit and will dry you out if you have sensitive skin or have never used a product like it before. I would definitely recommend getting a white pillowcase to avoid splotches from bleaching and using less of the product than you think you need to- a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for anyone with severe acne that can&#x27;t be fixed by other products! I&#x27;m totally in love with it!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena on-the-spot really works.  My son has been washing his face with Cetaphil and afterwards he applies Neutrogena.  At first it is very drying, but as the weeks go by and applying Cetaphil lotion, his face has started to clear up.  You have to use it once a day for a week or two and then increase it to twice daily.  I will be ordering this product from Amazon again!  It is a great product for acne!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after I realized my skin was growing resistant to a once effective prescription topical treatment. It was my first time using one with benzoyl peroxide so I was worried how my sensitive skin would react. As the fine print warns, I experienced minor redness, itching, and peeling and the initial result looked worse than the pimple I was trying to treat. My skin became used to it and now I&#x27;m able to apply it up to 4-5 times a day without experiencing any adverse reactions. However, I only use it on single pimples and not on larger areas. It doesn&#x27;t make them disappear over night, but they definitely don&#x27;t grow as red or large as they would without On-the-Spot and I see them going away faster.</li>
    <li> I had to use a lot of this to get results.  Arbonne&#x27;s cream works better and faster, it&#x27;s just expensive.  Thought I&#x27;d save money with this, but Arbonne is better.</li>
    <li> I use the Neutrogena Complete System on my face and use this for back up or for when I get the occasional zit on the back of my shoulders. Works great you just have to apply it two to three times a day directly onto the zit which can be tedious.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for years. I&#x27;ve learned how to control it, and I ALWAYS keep this product on hand. One tub lasts me for at least 6 months, because I use it sparingly, and also clean out my pores manually with an extractor. But if I do get a pimple, I put this on then cover it with a bandaid. In 2 days, gone. Oh, and this lightens existing dark acne scars. Warning: this will bleach fabrics, so be careful.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice - and I started to get a rash in all the areas I applied the cream.  I stopped using it immediately (3 days ago) - and my rash (in several spots on my face) has gotten MUCH worse!  It is 3 days into this rash.  It is very red, and the skin is swollen and it feels like a burn.  About half my forehead is affected as well as several more large patches on the rest of my face.  I didn&#x27;t apply a heavy coating of this cream at all.  I applied a few drops of this cream.  Wearing makeup at work was a royal pain - and very uncomfortable.  I&#x27;m very concerned about this as it seems to be getting worse.  My skin is not typically this sensitive - if you have sensitive skin, be very careful in trying this product!!  I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other OTC acne treatment.  I would give this product zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now since I got them but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change on my skin. It didn&#x27;t make my breakouts worse but it didn&#x27;t make it better either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using some daily face cleaning products that fights acne that contains salicylic acid, and it seems like my skin is fine with those. Then I was going to try this on-the-spot treatment, because I wanted to see if it could help me get rid off a few particularly big acne. And it turns out I am allergic to it, and using this was a BIG mistake that I made. On the first day, I seemed okay, but then my skin started looking red on the areas that I applied this on the second day. Then the third day, my skin has progressed to very itchy burning rash. I think this product may be great for people who are not allergic to benzoyl peroxide, but for people who may be allergic to it, please TEST it first before you start really using it! I am giving it one star just for my experience and raised red flag for people with sensitive skin like mine. Hope you guys be cautious before using this.</li>
    <li> ehhhhh i didnt expect too much from it..i needed a filler acne treatment before i can get my hands on the acne treatment that i use</li>
    <li> After a few trials and errors, I figured out how get this cream to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, I would develop a red, hot, itchy rash in about two days. Then the area would become rough and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a sensitivity or had this problem before, this is what worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small (I mean small, like a pen tip) of the cream to the pimple with a q-tip and dab. Only to the actual pimple and dont rub it around or get it on any surrounding skin. The pimple will look so much better by morning. Also dont apply moisturizer over the areas which you applied the cream because you&#x27;ll spread the residual cream over the rest of your face and end up with a rash. That happend to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different products to combat my acne and this is the one that worked for me. The key, I believe, is the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide. This has  2.5% concentration compared to many other products which use the 100% concentration. I think the 10% was causing my skin to dry out more and ultimately cause more irritation.</li>
    <li> This product helped dry out my acne the first day I used it. I use a very thin layer and let it sit over night then apply in the morning. A little goes a long way. I even apply makeup over it with no problems. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and I have sensitive skin. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This + salicylic acid for period breakouts, keeps the zits away!</li>
    <li> I hate this stuff! It didn&#x27;t do anything to help my acne. All it did was make my skin so painfully sensitive all over! I wish I could get a refund. I used it for a good week. I have hormonal acne, and this had no impact on it. It was as if I&#x27;d put nothing at all on (aside from the horrible dryness and burning).</li>
    <li> This product caused my face to burn and itch for nearly 24 hours, even though I applied a moisturizer after allowing the ointment to dry.  I have not had this unpleasant experience with Delos 3.5% benzoyl peroxide (slightly higher concentration than that of this Neutrogena product).</li>
    <li> This product is relatively good in the sense that it prevents breakouts. I usually put it on troubled areas every other night, and I&#x27;ve had few breakouts since I started to use this. Even though there are several creams that are more effective prescribed by the doctor (Aberela is extremely effective and my favorite for sure), this Neutrogena cream is the most effective I&#x27;ve had without having a prescription. It does make your skin dry</li>
    <li> This product is horrible ! Do not use it . If there was a way to put NO star I would . This product ledt my skin extremely dry. The spot where I put the cream on my face is now a discolored, read, flakey area. I normally do not have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s been about 5 days and the area is only slightly better . I&#x27;m thinking of seeing a dermatologist about what to do . Do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I am sorry, I am not sure which of the products I bought at that time to use on a yeast Infection that my little poodle mix had gotten on her skin.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have gotten really better, but then no worse.  I am afraid that isn&#x27;t a very satisfactory answer about the product.  The service was completely positive.</li>
    <li> It works well, I was using Zapzyt before this and decided to try this because it said it worked as well but with less irritation. It certainly does. My only complaint about it is that for $6 I wish I got just a little more, at least an ounce, but that&#x27;s not a bad price for 3/4 of an oz. that last me a few weeks anyways.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 years.  It has gotten me through hormone breakouts with pregnancies and nursing, etc.  Any time I feel a blemish coming, I apply it at bedtime and in the morning (in the middle of the day if possible).  The blemish is usually gone before it even gets started.  A day or two.  I hope this product never gets discontinued!</li>
    <li> Once a month my face erupts with god-awful zits. Ladies, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. This is what I use and they go away. The trick is to get it early enough, when it&#x27;s barely a bump. At that stage, the almost-zit just disappears.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good. Good price also, will buy it again. Also use it on my 10 year old daughter who has been breaking out as of lately and it&#x27;s not to strong for her sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It definitely does the job well. Not only does it diminish the pimples, but I do not even remember the last time I popped a pimple. I use the treatment day and night, and when I wake up in the morning, I noticed my pimples are smaller and are going away. What a miracle medication!</li>
    <li> I use this all over my face. It has less benzoyl peroxide in it so my face isn&#x27;t so red. It keeps me from breaking out.</li>
    <li> My g-daughter likes this and it does help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for about three years now. I tried so many over the counter products that I was at the point of giving up. Most were expensive, dried my skin out and didn&#x27;t end up working. I was stuck wearing a pile of makeup on my face, which just made the acne worse but with how bad it was I had no option. As a college student I couldn&#x27;t afford really expensive treatments like proactiv.  Then I saw this on the Walmart shelf, it said dermatologist recommended and I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. I&#x27;m so happy I did! After about two weeks I started seeing my acne decrease, after a month I didn&#x27;t even need the makeup anymore. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it&#x27;s kept my acne away which in turn is helping my acne scars heal. I use it on problem areas once a day or every other day if my skin is being good. I&#x27;ll use more if I start noticing a bump since once in a while I will get small pimples here or there because of heat, stress or hormone changes. But when I notice one coming up I apply the creme in that area two or three times that day and by the next day its healing up already. Never lets it get out of control. It&#x27;s really cheap, easy to use and effective. I use it at night before bed, wash my face with Neutrogena Foaming Scrub Deep Clean (has no acne medication), apply the acne creme to clean dry skin and lastly I pat a small amount of moisturizing lotion to prevent dryness. I would really recommend this to anyone suffering from acne. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll work for everyone but at $5 the bottle at Walmart, it&#x27;s worth a try. Just give it some time to start working, it&#x27;s not instantaneous and if it starts drying your skin use a facial moisturizer or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Bottle lasts over a month (if it&#x27;s used by a single person)&lt;br /&gt;-Works well (gets rid of acne and prevents it)&lt;br /&gt;-Simple to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Can dry out skin (nothing a simple moisturizer can&#x27;tfix though)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I have breakouts whenever I have my period season. I bought this product 2 days ago and applied it only to areas of the pimple, it did dry out my pimples and killed them but it didn&#x27;t dry out my face. It works super fast and my pimples are slowly vanishing only after 2 days of application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive and this is my first time using benzoyl so I was afraid of its side effects and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve experienced none, also this product has only 2.5% of benzoyl unlike others like acne free etc that has 5% to 10 %.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with the Neutrogena 3 in 1 hydrating acne cream ( which is great for moisturizing but isn&#x27;t strong enough to kill pimples by itself ) and I&#x27;m getting amazing results with both uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me and my pimples.</li>
    <li> My friend recomended this to me but nothing seems to change. She said the next day it will be gone but its been over a month, I eat healthy, drink a gallon of water a day, etc etc still nothing improves. If you have sensitive skin do not use...this product made me break out :(</li>
    <li> It gets the job done.....  It&#x27;s a little amount but very effective.  Really good product :)</li>
    <li> I was using another brand but they bumped up their benzoyl peroxide to 10% and that is too drying for my skin and then creates a worse breakout for my skin. This product is only 2.5% which is similar to the product I was using before. I would recommend this to anyone who has been trying something with 10% and it&#x27;s either too drying or creating worse breakouts, sometimes using less % can be beneficial.</li>
    <li> I have tried other acne spot treatments from Clean and Clear, Clearasil and Proactiv and none of them work as well as Neutrogena&#x27;s!  After just two days the redness has completely vanished and what was once a cluster of large, stubborn pimples is barely noticeable.  I will definitely be buying this again and will use it on any future problem breakouts!  For under $6 (at Walmart) you can&#x27;t buy a better product!</li>
    <li> It was a great product.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs some acne help or who wants to maintain great skin.</li>
    <li> Benzoyl peroxide is great for healing and preventing acne, but all formulas sold in pharmacies are 10%, which burns.  This formula is only 2.5%, which is much nicer for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> For the past six months I’ve been having acne problems. I’ve zits and blackheads. I was a bit skeptical to buy a non-natural product, but I decided to try Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment because my natural products were not enough to control my acne. And I’m very happy with my decision!  On my first application, the size of my zits were reduced in about two hours, yes, two hours! (here’s where you start to believe in miracles!!!).This is my 7th day using the On the Spot treatment and my acne has been reduced by 50% (zits are almost gone) and the dark spots are also about 50% lighter. Here’s my routine: I use a cotton swab to apply the cream (tiny bit) on the affected spot. Then I wait for about 30 secs for it to dry, and apply moisturizer. I do this twice per day. The product is excellent with amazing results.  Works so good that I bought a second tube. My acne is almost gone!</li>
    <li> I usually would use Clearasil&#x27;s blemish cream but decided to try this instead as it had really good reviews. I don&#x27;t think it works as well on my skin as Clearasil&#x27;s blemish cream did and I would probably not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> So, I am only giving this product 2 stars. Here is my story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked into my local grocery store looking for some kind of acne treatment that would work perfectly. I came across this cream, which worked instantly and right away! Only problem was, a week after using this product, I began breaking out in a rather itchy rash and had to use hydrocortisone to get rid of it. I purchased this product in hopes of it working, which it did, but it caused a bigger problem and I had to walk around with a red, itchy face until it went away. I was pleased with this product until it decided to fail me. I would recommend this product for everyone wanting to zap their acne instantly, but if you have an allergic reaction to other acne CREAMS, I would suggest staying away from this product.</li>
    <li> Left my entire chin red, itchy, swollen, splotchy, and sore after only two applications. I will never use or recommend yoir products again!</li>
    <li> This works perfect for my mature skin and also for my teenage son. Works better and dries better than any other I have used.</li>
    <li> Originally I was worried about allergy. I have to say this treatment may be too mild to me. It works, not significantly.&lt;br /&gt;Also I found this is NOT transparent gel, but some white cream which does not fully absorbs, and leads to an ugly face white white spots.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Shrinks swelling and gets rid of redness. Put it on at night and the next morning acne is noticeably smaller or even gone. To frequent use or use combined with other products can cause dry skin, itching, and flaking.</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager many many many years a go, I discovered this product after trying this product, and it hasn&#x27;t failed me since. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Never worked even though I&#x27;ve tried it a few different times. My pimples didn&#x27;t come less often, get smaller or ever go away.</li>
    <li> I have moderate-to-severe acne, depending on what direction the wind blows, and have run the gamut of acne medications--everything from the morbidly expensive to the worryingly cheap. I found myself using alcohol-based benzoyl peroxide face pads (of varying strengths) in the morning and 10% benzoyl peroxide cream at night, and blazing through bottles of moisturizer to manage it, because the endless medication did nothing but turn my face red and irritate it into a dry, flaky mess. The legend goes that if you withstand this long enough, it&#x27;ll go away and your face will transform into clear, wonderful skin--and then two years had passed and I realized I wasn&#x27;t ever going to reach that dermatological paradise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go the opposite direction, because I obviously wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere with the nuke-the-zits route, and I wasn&#x27;t about to try prescription methods that (among other things) can seriously damage your liver. I switched to an extremely gentle daily cleanser twice daily (Extra Gentle Cleanser by Neutrogena) and was astonished to see nearly all my surface whiteheads disappear, and my blackheads begin to vanish--but my cystic acne didn&#x27;t decrease, and I still had the occasional breakout. Having learned, however, that my skin far preferred gentle over harsh, I did my due diligence and found that the 2.5% benzoyl peroxide had the same effectiveness as the 10% with half the irritation--perfect, and exactly what I needed, but I went into a bit of a panic over the idea of medicating my skin again and so mixed it half-and-half with my Neutrogena Combination Skin moisturizer and applied a small amount all over my face. It worked like a charm. I was able to slowly up the dosage and even add a little to my morning moisturizer, and I&#x27;m pleased to say that my skin is never over-dry, over-oily, flaky, red, irritated, tight, or otherwise unhappy. Instead of a mass of ugly, I now only have the occasional breakout, to the tune of three or four zits (which, considering where I came from, is a true miracle) and my blackheads have almost completely vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yikes, I sound like a Neutrogena commercial. I arrived at this daily routine through trial-and-error, actually, and it says more about Neutrogena than my taste in brands that I ended up with a whole line of Neutrogena skincare on my counter. It helps, too, to know exactly what your skin needs, something that used to be a foreign concept to me, as I generally thought skin was skin and acne medication worked the same on everybody. Thankfully Neutrogena has a whole slew of products tailored for every skin type, from dry to combination to oily, so while I won&#x27;t promise my routine will work the same for you, you at least stand the chance of finding what works best on your own face. (And keep in mind that some skin types take issue with certain ingredients, so Neutrogena might be the last thing your face wants--like I said, trial-and-error.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely an integral part to my routine, though, and while I&#x27;d advise using it sparingly and gently until you figure out exactly how your face will react, it&#x27;s definitely a good investment if only for the occasional spot treatment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Haven&#x27;t seen great results</li>
    <li> Not bad. But once using it too much would make face too dry. Better one time per day, I suggested.</li>
    <li> For my acne is a little effect, after I have feeling with, no stimulation to the skin, suitable for emergency treatment of the skin</li>
    <li> If your face breaks out, you gotta keep benzoyl peroxide on hand. This concentration is strong enough to dry up a zit, but not so strong it&#x27;ll ruin pillowcases and towels.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Suppress acne development&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin much&lt;br /&gt;3. marks of cream disappear quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t prevent acne breakout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Frankly it isn&#x27;t much different than other acne medicine, because most, if not all, of them use Benzoyl Peroxide to suppress acne. Concentration of 2.5% is said to be as effective as 5~10%, but not as intolerable by skin. If your acne problem is known not to be mitigated by Benzol Peroxide, this is unlikely to help you.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s used when acne appears. In other words, it is more or less a passive counteraction. It does help to cure acne faster and prevent further pimple stage. Nevertheless, it doesn&#x27;t prevent acne reappearing from the same spots over and over.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Target actually. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I don&#x27;t normally get pimples so I thought a spot treatment would be perfect. I applied it to the side of my nose where I felt one growing. It DID stop the pimple from growing. But the next day, my skin became super dry, itchy and BURNING. I even put olay moisturizer to soothe it and it stung so bad just to put it on. So now I have to deal with a huge dry blotch on half my face and it&#x27;s starting to flake. It&#x27;s really embarrassing. And I do not have sensitive skin so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this.</li>
    <li> Apparently, with my very dry and sensitive skin, I shouldn&#x27;t ever use salicylic acid on my face. Now I use almond, coconut, or olive oil instead and remain blemish free!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Recommend!</li>
