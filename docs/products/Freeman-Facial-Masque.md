<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and comes off in one piece when you let it dry. I needed it for oily skin and it does work nicely.</li>
    <li> My 13 y.o daughter loves this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Freeman masks but this one is just not that convenient. I&#x27;m not sure how it fared for others, but it really was not easy to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is that you can peel some of the mask off, but the other parts you have to wash off. This takes much longer due to the extra sticky nature of the mask. After a few times of using it, it just didn&#x27;t&#x27; seem worth the amount of time it took to wash it off.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a facial peel for months.  I was so glad a friend told me about this Freeman Cucumber mask.  I love this product and will definitely be ordering again.  It goes on thick and sticky, but spreads easily.  It looks like it&#x27;s wet, but it dries quickly and feels tight on your face.  I leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then peel it away slowly allowing it to pull off dead cells and clean my pores.  In the beginning I noticed a few break outs, especially on my nose, but I know this is NORMAL for a new beauty routine.  It is cleaning out those pores.  My face felt incredibly soft and smooth after using it from the very first time.  Also, it smells very good... I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers were talking about.  My package also came very securely packaged.  The lid was taped down, it was wrapped in plastic wrap and it came inside another plastic bag inside a box with other products I purchased.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described. I will refer this product and seller to my family and friends. I have been using this product for a month and have noticed a great difference in my pores and skin.</li>
    <li> At this price I didn&#x27;t expect much and that&#x27;s what I got.  This is fun to peel off your face but it didn&#x27;t do much beyond taking most of the oil of my greasy Irish face...</li>
    <li> Background:  I used to have extremely bad acne when I was growing up in high school. My boyfriend (now husband) bought me Proactiv Solution and the results were amazing! My acne was virtually gone and I was so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past 6 months, my acne has started up again. I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s from...getting older, starting prenatal vitamins, or changing my Proactiv Solution to extra strength, I just don&#x27;t know.  I came across this product as a &amp;#34;one time use pouch&amp;#34; at CVS Pharmacy and decided to give it a try. Nothing else I was using (including my Proactiv Solution) was helping, but seemed to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this mask is that you just put it on evenly on your face, let it dry and peel it off. It&#x27;s just that simple! It is clear but looks shiny; it&#x27;s not blue, white, or green like other face masks. After that one time use, the next day (I am NOT exaggerating!) I could see such an improvement in my complexion, my acne had dissipated tremendously! even my co-workers noticed an immediate difference. I was so impressed, I decided to go ahead and buy the 6 ounce tube here, on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it is for people who have sensitive skin, so I decided to order the gentle formula of my Proactiv Solution too. I&#x27;m hoping that using both products will make my acne disappear again!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff! I&#x27;m not sure it actually does anything for my skin, but it feels refreshing, smells good, &amp; scares my boyfriend when I peel it off in front of him. Winning!</li>
    <li> I use my cucumber mask about twice a week and I absolutely love it! I normally do it before I plan to jump in the shower so I can peel it off but if there&#x27;s some I have trouble getting off then I jump in the shower. It makes my face look nice and I plan to purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it is my go-to peel off mask. All of Freeman&#x27;s products are amazing, and this one is no different. It smells just like cucumbers, and it is not difficult to remove at all. It&#x27;s kind of a thicker consistency so its a little hard to spread onto your skin but its not an impossible task. I just removed it from my face about ten minutes ago and it feels fresh and clean. I recommend this to anyone looking for a peel-off mask, and if you&#x27;re just shopping for masks in general, I recommend any of the Freeman products, especially this one, the lemon and mint clay mask, and the anti-stress dead sea minerals mask.</li>
    <li> This product caused a reaction on my skin. It burned and caused severe redness, which makes me terrified to try it again. Money wasted. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It irritated my eyes even though I didn&#x27;t apply around the eyes. I can&#x27;t stop my tears. I also feel a little itchy when it is on my face. But after I washed it out, I did feel my face become cleaner than before. But the cost is too much! My eyes can&#x27;t open when it is on my face.</li>
    <li> This won&#x27;t take off blackheads or renew your skin overnight, but for what you pay for its ok. It does make my skin softer, reduce some redness, and has a calming smell. I mainly use this with my younger sisters when I visit from College. It breaks a bit when you peel unless you are very slow about it. When applying to your face you might want to make sure you have water on the side to start washing your hands off, its very sticky and needs a bit of soap to get off! Imagine applying it then turning the water on, you&#x27;ll get the handle nasty. If that happens just wait to peel it off when it dries, but kinda annoying if you have OCD!</li>
    <li> This product is good overall, but I really don&#x27;t like the artificial smell of it. I think it would have been fine if it were fresh cucumber kind of smell or even unscented. Also, the peeling could get a little annoying at times especially around the eyebrows and also near my hair. Maybe I should just avoid those spots but then I always have blemishes near those spots and I would like to cover them.</li>
    <li> The mask was very refreshing and did not cause any skin irritation as I have experienced with other masks.  After using it twice, I started to get questions about what have I done to my skin? Some people thought I had gotten a professional treatment!</li>
    <li> So I had also been one of the many customers that was sad to see this come off the shelf until i found it on Amazon...yea!!! I did not have the same problem the pervious reviewer did, with the shadow mark. It was a fun face peeler...</li>
    <li> the skin feel clean and new after usage. Smell is nice. It dries smoothly, not cracking very much, so there&#x27;s no terribly feeling of dryness afterward.</li>
    <li> This was the first face mask I&#x27;ve bought, and I love it! It has a nice smell, and is really easy to apply on your face. Make sure that when you apply it though to pull your hair back into a pony tail or use a headband because if it gets stuck in your hair it hurts really bad to try and pull it off! Also, remember to avoid the eyebrow area! :) Overall, I love this face mask and will order it again when my current bottle runs out. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 2-3 times and you only need a dab of it, thin layer, on your face. My dad started using it because he has forehead acne/ breakouts (eczema) and you can really tell the difference it makes. Clears him right up. Love this product, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I. LOVE. THIS. MASK!!! One of the best and most effective peel-off masks I&#x27;ve ever used! It smells great, and is great for people with super sensitive skin (like myself). It also arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Love this mask! I love the smell when I put it all over my face and I love peeling it off my face when it&#x27;s dried! Is that weird?!?!? I use this after I have washed my face with my facial brush and cleanser and my skin feels sooooo soft. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This mask is so fun to use! I love it so much I even bought one for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
    <li> i like this. i will order it again. does just what its supposed to do and no messy clean up like with a mudd mask.</li>
    <li> I love this! It works great!</li>
    <li> I love this peel off mask not only is it fun but its like a liquid form of pore strips. I use this after my mint julep mask because the sebum goes to the surface of the skin and become easy to peel off.</li>
    <li> I use the Freeman Cucumber Facial Mask religiously, once a week, followed by Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep mud mask. After exfoliating I apply this mask for fifteen minutes - it&#x27;s kind of fun marching around the house looking like a burn victim (the mask goes on clear and shiny, and dries clear and shiny) - before peeling it off and applying the mud mask for fifteen minutes. The mud mask is excellent for standing in clear view by your front window as the neighbor mows his lawn or answering the door for the FedEx guy so you can sign for a package. It&#x27;s such a conversation starter.  Anyhow, after moisturizing my skin is good to go for the week, and it&#x27;s consistently clear and fresh thanks to this mask.</li>
    <li> I use this mask about twice per week.  I have never really had skin problems, and I only wear make up once or twice per year, but this mask definitely leaves my face clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I just moved from the west coast to the east coast. When I ran out of it, i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! I&#x27;m so thankful that it was available on Amazon. My pores thank you too.</li>
    <li> there really is not to much i can say about this product its a really good product do not no what else to say but thanks</li>
    <li> It makes my skin  look and feel a bit better after use but it&#x27;s sooo hard to remove. I showed up to work with some still on my face and a little that accidently got in my hair because it is clear so it&#x27;s hard to see it all. Let&#x27;s just say... thats embarassing. I hope my coworkers don&#x27;t have dirty minds.</li>
    <li> I freaking love this stuff. I leave it on way longer than suggested. Just wait until its completely dry to peel it off. Does wonders and keeps me from getting acne if i use 1-2 times a week.</li>
    <li> Took like an hour to dry and when I took it off I saw no difference.</li>
    <li> Another great Freeman product. Check WalMart for trial versions of their various face products.  Will buy this one again soon.</li>
    <li> Very affordable.  and it&#x27;s works so good on my  face....</li>
    <li> It smells heavily of alcohol so it was kind of unpleasant, and the texture is literally like glue, and it dries off like so. I have used cucumber peel off masks before but this one was just not very pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> The only issue I had with it is that sometimes I apply it unevenly and spots dry accordingly. It&#x27;s my fault so I can&#x27;t fault the product.</li>
    <li> It make my skin feel nice and softer, but I dislike the smell of alcohol. The smell of alcohol was way too strong.</li>
    <li> I have some uneven texture and oily spots on my face. The reviews were good so I thought I would give it a try. I put it on thick per recommendation, but it did seem to take FOREVER to dry. Perhaps being in a warmer room would have helped.  I will recommend taking the extra time to let it dry completely because if you try to wash ANY sticky parts off it will be a down hill battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with one use my skin felt soft and was more even. I will continue using this to see if it continues to help my uneven texture.</li>
    <li> I have no concerns about the seller - not sure if I would order the product again...very strong scent and I prefer the DHC peel-off mask (which may have been discontinued).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product a few times - I must admit that it works well, you just have to be okay with a strong scent of cucumber on your face for a while!  If the DHC peel-off mask has been discontinued, I would purchase this product again (upon further consideration).</li>
    <li> I love this facial peel-off mask, it has a refreshing smell and leaves my face super soft!I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! Leaves my skin so soft and it smells nice. I have been buying the one use packs until I saw you could get a whole tube, I&#x27;ll be back :)</li>
    <li> This goes on very thick, and is difficult to spread out into a thin layer.</li>
    <li> Excellent peel-off mask. Big fan of Freeman.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a peel off mask for awhile and this product definitely satisfy my need. I use it for the whole face once a week and one more time for just the T-zone and my chin. After every use, I can see the dead skin and blackheads sticks to the mask. Just make sure you put on a thick enough layer and leave it on for 15-20 mins so the mask is completely dry and easy to peel off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this peel-off face mask. It reminds me of my childhood days of when I put glue on my hand and peel it off when it dried, best feeling ever! It removes dead skin on my face and leaves me feeling soft, fresh, and confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I use Freemans Charcoal Face Scrub/mask and I like using this after as a coolant shall we say.  Face feels clean and refreshing after both.</li>
    <li> I have used this peel since I can remember.  It was the peel my mom used, and the one she let me use since I was younger.  It always leaves my skin feeling baby soft and it smells great--like really sweet cucumbers.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some fragrance used, but it&#x27;s not overpowering and the smell lasts forever afterwards so I love using it before bed, it&#x27;s really soothing.  It has never burned my face or caused acne, so I&#x27;m sure that all depends on your skin type.  I usually pick up my mask at Walmart for a couple of bucks, I find amazons price a bit high, but I think it&#x27;s also worth it.  It takes about 20-30 minutes to dry, but nothing a good movie can&#x27;t help pass the time with.  It is super sticky and goopy when applying, but it is shiny, so you can see if you applied it everywhere quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;Two days ago I got a really bad sunburn on both my forearms and my forehead, today I had just thought about using it to help my sunburn and the feeling was amazing.  It&#x27;s constantly cooling, even after dry when I applied it.  I was scared of it hurting with any alcohol or fragrance in it, but surprisingly didn&#x27;t have any pain at all with it.  Removal from face was easy as pie, though my arms have hair and with any mask, it took a bit to fully remove it.  My sunburned arms are super soft, and hurt much less than they did before, thanks to the cucumber, though I am also going to apply a thick layer of Solarcaine here soon.  My face feels just as nice and fresh as before.  Love this stuff and think it&#x27;s worth trying out if you haven&#x27;t yet!</li>
    <li> very goog product, recommended to my fiend</li>
    <li> I like this mask. I don&#x27;t know how efficient it with pulling off dead skin cells and all, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky enough. I mean it stays and peels, but I think I would like something that I can literally feel that it works.&lt;br /&gt;Skin after use still feels nice, but generally due to the fact that she mask also takes excess oils. Which is nice. I would recommend using it just because it gives you a good clean feeling. But does it work on dead skin cells ? ....</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying this because I have very sensitive skin and I thought it would make me break out. It really helped with my dermatitis and made my skin feel fresher than ever.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I love using this item. My skin really does feel refreshed after using it. Would definitely order this again if ever needed to.</li>
    <li> I have used a similar product in the past but wasn&#x27;t able to find it again once i ran out, so i found this product instead an i like it, it gives me a nice feeling in my skin</li>
    <li> Good but very thick n sticky to use, it says to wait 10-15 mins to dry n peel, but due to its thickness I had to weight 20 mins to peel off without wet sports. But my face felt clean n fresh. I have sensitive skin, and had no problem with it, yes it makes my sensitive combination skin a bit drying after peeling off but a good serum or moisturizer works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the store as it was the only &#x27;peelable&#x27; mask. So I took a risk and bought it, and so far I like my results. It comes out of the tube fast so be ready for that and also do not leave the tube open while pointing straight down, it will leak. It has a nice fresh smell that is mild enough I think, where it is not overbearing or so little that you do not notice it. The reason I took a star away is because it is clear, it made it hard for me to see how much mask was being applied to one area and I had to guess that it was all about even. Since it&#x27;s a mask you want it to be even so it dries at the same rate and is easier to peel. But I do have very sensitive skin so colorless may be an added benefit. As far as results go I did notice that my pores were smaller and my face much smoother (upon peeling if you look closely you may see some debris). I&#x27;m not going to say it was instant or anything like that, and I am certainly not using solely this product for my face routine but I had very enlarged pores along my cheek bones and nose which were reduced some after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use warm water and soap to help rinse off the excess either on hands or face. However, a dampened cloth to help scrub works wonders. Some people suggested applying it thick to get an even/easier pull but that did not work so well for me (as I could not see how much was in one area) and also it will run down your face if its too wet still, causing uneveness. So I applied thin layers at a time (about 2) and was able to pull off most of the mask very easily. Anything that was stuck to my face was because I got it stuck in my hair a little. If your face is completely dry (assuming you did not have a thick application) your face will be tight. I suggest gently washing your face with a mild face wash and warm water for better results.</li>
    <li> This is really good and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I used this mask on weekends when we spoil ourselves with facials and mani/pedi&#x27;s. Your face feels so smooth after it. My daughter thought it was cool that she was able to peel her mask off all in one piece. Kind of looked like the &amp;#34;Scream&amp;#34; mask.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  When you peel off this mask you are peeling off every piece of dead skin and revealing the soft new skin underneath.  It has a nice fragrance as well.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The product described does everything it says it does and more! It smells amazing and is good for removing dead skin. As a word of warning though, do not get in hair, brows, or thick body hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing and feels great</li>
    <li> JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO GET THE MOST OUT THIS PRODUCT. THE VARIETY OF &#x27;FLAVORS&#x27; IS VERY NICE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> My kids have been using this mask. I have 3 teenagers, 2 boys and a girl and they all like the smell and peeling off of their skin. Really cleans up their skin nicely. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The smell is gross and gave me a headache but it does work. Not sure if I would repurchase this one, maybe a different a scent.</li>
    <li> Peel off masks are bad for your skin,I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> Its  good for using but its effect gone shortly</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and also easy to remove , but honestly it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin . Tried it for a couple months and It made my skin soft but that is all . Give it a try though , it might help you</li>
    <li> Super speedy delivery. I found this product at Walmart 2 years ago &amp; liked the results using it once a week. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently so turned to Amazon. Good price &amp; got her quick. I already knew I liked the mask. I can&#x27;t find a peel mask in the stores anymore so I&#x27;m happy I found it!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and works beautifully!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the mask, it actually has a cucumber smell to it. It made my skin more smooth, a blackhead or two may have come up with it too. For the price it&#x27;s worth trying. It does not work as well as their awesome Charcoal and Black Sugar mask. But that is just my opinion. There are products you like and then the ones you rave about. I like this one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this mask and it made my eyes water.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is naturally a calming/cooling mask, with no real scent. It works just like it says and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this peeling mask. I can no longer purchase it at my local drugstore but now i know where it is i am psyched...this product is nice and fun, but one bad thing is i find my face oily after using it but it gets all that dead skin off especially the ones near the nose corner area....different people, different results it is just a hit and miss and something you would not mind missing because it is not too expensive</li>
    <li> Feels pretty good. So far I don&#x27;t see obvious change/improvements, but my face gets clean every time after I used it.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong and sort of unpleasant smell... It takes a bit longer than 10 minutes to dry and i used it to get rid of my black and white heads on my nose. Didn&#x27;t work too well</li>
    <li> Me and my girlfriend love it. We treat ourselves to a facial cleaning every Monday. Easy to apply and even easier to pull off. It&#x27;s real cool letting it harden and feeling it peel off when you move your facial muscles around. I&#x27;ve always been able to remove the whole mask in one piece, which is creepy to some but I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite mask!!! I can&#x27;t find it any where nowadays but I was so glad to see it on here and for a decent price. Love love love!</li>
    <li> This mask is very thick and hard to get out of the tube. Does not spread easily which makes it go on unevenly.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. I&#x27;m a guy and my girl just got me into this facial peel stuff......I don&#x27;t care what anybody says, it feels amazing. Love it</li>
    <li> Worked well. You see all the dirt coming off your face when you peel off the mask. Very refreshing and it made my face glow after using it. It&#x27;s pretty worth it for the price. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I do smell the alcohol so i recommend using it only once a week. Overall i was happy with the results !</li>
    <li> Any time my face is starting to feel a little dirty or it feels like I&#x27;m on the verge of a breakout I use this product and my face is clear as can be the next day.</li>
    <li> I love peel of masks!  This one smells pleasant, but it does take a while to set and dry</li>
    <li> I could not find a good cheap peel off mask at walmat, looked here and I found this one that I love. It has lasted me a while too</li>
    <li> Just as I remember from many years ago.  Peel off mask</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I liked this and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I like using this and have fun peeling it off, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually doing anything for my skin.. Fun though</li>
    <li> I like to start with a facial wash, then I use this mask, and finish off with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I think this has to be my favorite mask so far.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so soft and I love how it&#x27;s a peel mask, it makes the clean up so much easier.</li>
    <li> A cucumber peel is something that I always need to keep on hand and stock up on. As you should already know, cucumber peels are the least messiest facial masks you can do, and it does great things for your skin. Freeman makes a great product. Comparatively, the amazon price beats all other drug store brand prices. The six ounces will last you quite a while. My team mates love coming over to my place because they KNOW that I have this on hand.</li>
    <li> Great just amazing love it get it your face get clean and tight great product .</li>
    <li> I love it. It seems like am peeling a layer of skin lol. I could actually feel the difference as it keeps going</li>
    <li> The peel off didn&#x27;t come off smoothly and what was left required me to roughly rub a wet facial towel on my face. I love the clay masks the best and I think after this, I&#x27;ll stick to those. I ended up giving the tube to a friend because I was so unimpressed.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. You need to put a fairly THICK amount on your face, and it&#x27;s pretty sticky when its on your fingers but I still enjoy it. Let it dry for a little bit longer than the bottle tells you, then when you&#x27;re ready to peel it off, you will need to kind of &amp;#34;stretch your mouth&amp;#34; (open it wide/smile really big, etc) and that will pull the mask from your face a little bit, giving you a place to start peeling the rest. Sounds weird, but it will make sense when you&#x27;re using it. Keep in mind, it goes on clear, not green or opaque.</li>
    <li> Meh ok product made my skin dry and brake out. Might work for some</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. I could not find them at any of the store around here in a full tube. They only sell travel size. So buying this here is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell, loved the clean feeling and hated trying to get it off. It never peeled off . I had to wash it off with water</li>
    <li> I love this product. It feels so good on my face as it dries and even better when I peel it off. My face feels so soft and fresh.</li>
    <li> I bought this off of amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in Walmart or another other supermarkets.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting the same strength of its original formula but this seemed a little weaker and didn&#x27;t seem to pull off a lot of blackheads like it used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and I&#x27;ve got to say, I am extremely impressed. I&#x27;m in the midst of starting a new skincare regimen (let&#x27;s just say that Gunthy Renther&#x27;s \\&quot;X-Out\\&quot; did far more harm than good), and so I was looking for something to soothe my skin and help clear up a nasty breakout. This product has done that and so much more. When I first started using this mask, I had 4 huge pimples and inflamed skin due to a bad reaction to the aforementioned X-Out. After the first use, this mask got rid of the inflammation and within the next two days all my pimples had dried out!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just been using regular bar soap and this product until I can figure out a new cleanser to try, and my skin is once again clear and soft. This is a fantastic product, and a total aside from its effectiveness: it&#x27;s a lot of fun to use, it just peels right off after it dries. Way fun!&lt;br /&gt;Th label says use once or twice a week for optimal results - but I&#x27;ve taken to using it as a spot treatment in addition to that.</li>
    <li> The soaps were interesting. I was surprised that your soaps were so small and expensive. I recently tried one of the tiny squares and was pleased at the quality, the fragance and especially the lather! I just wish it were &#x27;nt so expensive! I would like to find this in a rose bubble bath!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really weird to put on, but after I do, it&#x27;s so cool and my face is so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s really good on my skin (and I have really sensitive skin).</li>
    <li> This is great! I got it on amazon $2 cheaper than at winco.  It was wrapped nicely and was on time.  After using it your skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> this one happens to be my least favorite. it has an extremely pungent alcohol smell to the point that it will have your eyes watering. applying it to the skin is like applying very, very thick honey. on the plus side, it is EXTREMELY cooling and invigorating as it is drying. i also enjoy peeling it off and find that the majority of it does come off in one piece, but some glue-like remnants sometimes get stuck to my eyebrows and that is not fun to scrape off. i most likely will not be buying this product again. i recommend sticking to the clay masks that freeman has to offer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, very refreshing! Great product for a low price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads for me, only small whiteheads on the surface. Like the smell and refreshing feeling after I peel the mask out!</li>
    <li> For anyone that&#x27;s seen and loved American Psycho as much as I have.  You too can now have that experience of peeling away a mask of your entire face regularly (psycho-analysis sold separately).  To get the full &amp;#34;Patrick Bateman&amp;#34;, apply a fairly thick layer to your whole face, and let it dry ALL THE WAY!  Don&#x27;t get impatient - it&#x27;ll be worth it when you peel off the whole thing in one go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All pop culture references aside, I have used this stuff for over 15 years.  I don&#x27;t use it that regularly because I have somewhat sensitive skin, but when I&#x27;m feeling all clogged up and toxic, it is the perfect way to get a fresh start.</li>
    <li> I was given this product and I really just love it. I love the smell and my skin feels cool and moisturized after using.</li>
    <li> Great peel-off mask for the price!  The smell was pleasant &amp; refreshing, it has the typical glue like consistency of other peel-off masks, but I was able to spread this one on a bit easier than some other brands.  I found that it peeled off consistently, which is what I look for in a peel off&amp; my face felt fantastic after the 1st use!.  Overall, one of my favorite peels! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I used to use this in high school and decided to try it after many years. I love this stuff, when you put it on it feels cool and refreshing to your skin.  You have to let it dry completely before peeling it off or it will just be sticky.  After you peel it off your face feels very soft and refreshed. would recommend.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing don&#x27;t leave it on for 10 minutes because it won&#x27;t peel good..I leave it on for 15-20 minutes then it peels off good and apply a thin layer.</li>
    <li> good peel off mask  and pleasant odor</li>
    <li> I love this facial mask. It dries super fast. It does not irritate my sensitive skin. I will be repurchasing this product when I run out. Makes your skin feel baby skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Tried adding this to a 2 oz bottle of a 15% Glycolic Acid Pumpkin mask i bought from Natural Organics on Ebay- also bought an 8 oz jar, and mixed the contents of both together, into the jar, with a plastic knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this just because i had used the pumpkin mask before, and i wanted something to eliminate some of the clumpiness in texture, as well as to counterbalance its tendency to dry out my skin, when used too regularly- I bought the pumpkin mask originally because it&#x27;s supposed to exfoliate/ increase cell turnover rate, and my face has significant scarring, and unevenness in skin tone, from picking at it/popping blemishes, for years, when i didn&#x27;t know how to manage my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently i&#x27;ve taken to experimenting with other products for that- although, besides blackheads, this is also clearing up my skin- but what i wanted to mention it for though, is that i&#x27;ve been using this for the past few days, and i&#x27;m noticing significant reversing of scarring and evening out of rough patches in my skin tone- apparently, cucumber is good for fading scarring and for toning the skin. I feel like with the exfoliation from the pumpkin, it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s acting like a brace for the new skin cells that are coming in, where it&#x27;s lining them up a certain way so that my skin tone evens itself out- which is the effect i&#x27;m noticing, slightly and increasingly, every time that i use the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just, very excited about the results of this so far- felt like sharing this-</li>
    <li> best thing i ever tried. And fun to peel off tbh. the goo does sometimes spill out of the bottle when i open it but thats okay</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very strong mask, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it often and I think that people with sensitive skin should not use it</li>
    <li> One of my must have products for skin care</li>
    <li> This is a fun product to buy and it actually works well. If you are going to use this I would suggest applying the product liberally so that you do not have a thin layer but a nice thick one. I also suggest leaving this product on for longer than 10 minutes, maybe around 15 so that it really gets to dry. Before you apply the product pull back your hair because it can get a little annoying when the product gets stuck to your hair. I would also be mindful not to get any on your eyebrows cause it can get inbetween the little hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you remove the mask you&#x27;ll find that your skin is nice and soft and less oily. It does remove dead skin but do not anticipate removal of blackheads. It also leaves you with a nice soothing/cooling sensation afterwards.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a cucumber mask to refresh your face in the summertime and make you feel and look younger. This product does the trick!</li>
    <li> I like the way this goes on and the cooling sensation. The thing is, it takes WAY too long to dry. Like, almost an hour if not more, depending on how much you put on. I&#x27;d go with something else if you can.</li>
    <li> I thought it&#x27;d be a cream base not like transparent and slimy mask. My skin felt the same even after various weeks. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again. But then again, it&#x27;s my opinion. It might be different for someone else.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel smoother and it evens the skin tone. Be advised. This product is great for mild acne, but it doesn&#x27;t help much with bigger bumps. It is great for taking off dead skin. It is mild enough to use almost every day.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Apply and peel off after it dries.  Skin is nice and smooth.  Wonderful product and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a peeling mask this one is pretty good.  It dries fast and you can get a good peel with it - all in one sheet. It seems to help to control my sons acne a little.&lt;br /&gt; I made the mistake of after the mask, using a blackhead tool and clearing out anything that came to the surface --- well everything came out easily but he was left with a face full of red marks and scabs for like a week, so I felt terrible. It draws everything to the surface and leaves the skin extra soft and sensitive and more easy to tear and damage.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;d recommend just using the mask - and not picking after! I&#x27;ve used it several times without picking and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
    <li> It cleans your face, but doesn&#x27;t pull out hard to reach black heads. Not impressed, but its OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t honestly recommend.</li>
    <li> Its&#x27; a really cool and refreshing feeling! I love peeling it off at the end and seeing all the dead skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got oily, acne prone skin and I&#x27;m constantly fighting clogged pores. This did absolutely nothing for me. Impurities were not removed, oils were not absorbed. It smells horribly like vodka and is very painful to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; (I don&#x27;t have peach fuzz or any noticeable facial hair so I assume this is just from it pulling on my sensitive skin). Not my favorite freeman product.</li>
    <li> It was refreshing to use, but I was mislead by the words &amp;#34;peel-off&amp;#34;.  I had to use much warm water to get it off my face.  The second time I used it I put it on thicker, thinking that would make it easier to peel off after it was firm.  Didn&#x27;t work.  It took longer to get it all off.</li>
    <li> Makes my face super smooth. would totally buy this again except that they sell it at my local grocery store so no need to buy offline.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week, and It works very well. I can notice my skin feel smooth and clean after I apply this mask on my face. I notice I got a little pimple once a while when I use this. Before I use this product, I tend to get 3 to 4 pimples a month, but after using this I get a pimple once every 3 or months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have a combination skin. This product doesn&#x27;t make my face dry.</li>
    <li> After using this product just a couple times, I noticed positive changes in my skin tone. It has become more even and more clear. I&#x27;m satisfied! :) I use it at least once every 3 days. As the directions say, &amp;#34;Apply as often as needed.&amp;#34; For me personally, dead skin cells and roughness build up the longer I don&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of alcohol in this product which probably does more to damage the skin than the other ingredients can do good. The consistency is also really difficult to use and the skin peeling action is uneven. Clay or another exfoliant will do a better and safer job than this product.</li>
    <li> When I received the product I was happy.. 2 minutes after opening, my jaw dropped. The product was not only half empty, but the cap was off and someone had been obviously using it. I had to squeeze out some of the contents to ensure my safety! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.. You&#x27;re better off just purchasing in real life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it two times, but it seems to be helping. The consistency of the mask feels like honey and once it dries, it is easy to peel off. I really enjoyed peeling off the mask. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good peel-off mask.  I was hoping for something to get black heads a little better but this was still very good cleaning the skin.</li>
    <li> The mask is refreshing and fun to peel off but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll do anything for your acne. If you&#x27;re looking to clear out your pores, get a tough charcoal mask, if you&#x27;re looking for something fun, get this.</li>
    <li> I have fond memories of smearing this stuff on my face as a pre-teen with my friends, peeling it off like glue. Many years later however, I just can&#x27;t stomach it. The smell is really strong and made my eyes sting. I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is super toxic and will give me lovely tumors should I continue to use it. When it came time to peel it off, it didn&#x27;t really come off smoothly, but in moist clumps. I had to wash most of it rather than satisfyingly peeling a la glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it was cheap!</li>
    <li> I definitely love it. I have mix skin and I was searching a peel off Mask. This is the ONE I wanted. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works just as it is described. As long as you do not thin the gel as you apply it, the mask will easily come off in 1 piece. The only thing that keeps me from loving it is that it does not do as good of a job as the pore strips of cleaning out my pores. However this product does the job good enough and is less time consuming for me to apply to all of the needed places on my face than the pore strips so I like this product better. As far as claims of it hurting... I did not experience that. This is nothing compared to the pore strips. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This smells great!! It makes my skin feel super soft &amp; rejuvenated afterwards. Wearing it you kinda resemble a plastic doll.</li>
    <li> Works as it says. I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, product is as advertised</li>
    <li> works just like the other brands of this type of product that I&#x27;ve bought in the store but for some reason lately only kind I can find in the store is the creme style face cleaners you have to wash off with warm water but I prefer this type for me when I feel like having a pamper myself evening.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves to do facials at her sleepovers, so I ordered this for her. I have lots of fond memories of using the cucumber peel off masks when I was her age. We used to challenge ourselves to try and peel it off in one piece. You have to wait until it is completely dry to do so. The formula seems pretty gentle and leaves no redness. It has a light, clean scent.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;smells slightly strong but its not a big deal it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Peels off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is defiantly refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothes skin.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> Love this product, makes your face feel great after using it and smells great, too. Cleans your pores great!, Love it</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft, cleans the surface. Don&#x27;t use if expecting deep cleaning (try the pomegranate one for that!). Makes your face feel cool, refreshed (great for summer after you&#x27;ve had a long day outside, or just a long day, period). Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me. However it is fun to use, has a great smell, and leaves your face feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This face mask leaves your skin feeling soft, clean, and \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot;. Its kind of a pain in the butt to peel off though so that is why I gave it a 3 star.</li>
    <li> I have other Freeman masks and love them, but this one left tons of tiny bumps on my skin that took weeks to go away. Maybe it works for others, but it didn&#x27;t do anything positive for my skin. It does smell nice though.</li>
    <li> My mom used to always buy this mask and I remembered it the other day and bought it from Amazon. It pulls all the dead junk off my face and makes my face feel smooth. Of course, the best part though, is when you peel it off you feel like a snake shedding it&#x27;s skin. That is definitely the best part.</li>
    <li> I threw it away after trying it twice. I tried a little and second time I tried more. It doesn&#x27;t peel off as stated. I still had some left on my face even after washing my face.</li>
    <li> this works so beutifully,,,its a nice scented clear gel ,,it dries nicely then leaves the skin so smooth,,,</li>
    <li> Love it and have been using for years, Great stuff</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel great! You only need a small amount to cover your skin or else it won&#x27;t dry and peel correctly, which is great because it will last longer!</li>
    <li> This mask has a ton of questionable ingredients. No wonder it burned my eyes, even though it didn&#x27;t even get inside my eyes. Just applying it around the vicinity of my eye area already caused a burning/tearing sensation. I could tolerate it, but something tells me this isn&#x27;t the best product to be putting on my face. Toxic ingredients for your face include:&lt;br /&gt;- SD Alcohol 40-B&lt;br /&gt;- DMDM HYDANTOIN (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER)&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;- Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;- Lactic Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View detailed breakdown here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use at your own risk, and definitely don&#x27;t expect this mask to do you wonders.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It works as expected and my face feels great after every use.</li>
    <li> I did like the smell but after a couple of uses, i started breaking out again. my face is very acne prone and it has taken me a lot of time, money to get to where it is now so i will not like to go back there. i have stopped using it. the fact that it didnt work out for me does not mean its a bad product. it just means it doesn&#x27;t work well with my skin. it might work for you.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the difference this makes!</li>
    <li> I love it when it&#x27;s on my skin. I let it dry for about 30 minutes &amp; it easily comes off. I do it once/ twice a week &amp; certainly my skin looks visibly different for atleast 1 day after I use it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the product but by the way it was delivered I doubt I will be doing so. I assume it should have arrived with a factory seal (contacted freeman waiting for a reply on this) but instead I got a bottle with about a fourth of it full and the seal was just two pieces of tape along the top to keep it from spilling. Maybe I am wrong about the factory seal but I pretty sure that if the contents of the bottle spilled there would be some remnants in the box of which there is none so somewhere along the way at the very least half the product disappeared. I went along and looked through the reviews and it seems as though this has happened a few times. Regardless of the seal where did the rest for my product go?</li>
    <li> I love this product it works exactly how it was described.  Goes on smoothly and leaves your face feeling silk like.</li>
    <li> Well, peel-off masks are just fun to use. This one is very nice--smells good and leaves the skin feeling very smooth and fresh. Freeman products are priced economically but are of very good quality.</li>
    <li> very good at bringing out your skins color and giving you a healthy glow. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only peel-off mask I use for years. I was very disappointed when it disappeared from my local drug store&#x27;s shelves. I am glad I found it on Amazon! It shrinks pores and if you use it after thorough cleaning, it will reduce break-outs( if you have any). If you use it before applying make up for going out, your face definitely will look younger and more fresh.This mask also calms skin after sunburn without making skin greasy. Greasy after sun creams can cause clogged pores and break out later on(which ruins perfect tan).. Unlike wash-off masks that tend to over dry your skin when you vigorously try to wash them off, peel off masks come off easily and with not leave your skin dry or tender. I think it&#x27;s also good to use after cosmetic face procedures like photo facial, even though doctors don&#x27;t recommend to use anything, I always use this mask to calm the skin.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at cvs for like 4 dollars. I wanted to try this because I wanted a peel off mask. I&#x27;ve only applied it 3 times and every time I peel it off it hurts and I break out. Not a lot but I&#x27;ve noticed I have more than before.</li>
    <li> This was the first peel-off mask that I&#x27;ve ever bought. The mask has a sticky gel-jelly like consistency and is very cooling on the face when I first applied it. I apply it with a brush and I have to say that it is very messy both when you apply it and also when you take it off. When this dries and if you don&#x27;t apply the product evenly, instead of taking it off as a whole face mask, you will have to take time removing patch by patch of this face mask that&#x27;s on your face. When I came back to this product after a few months not using it, this stung my face really badly. I removed this when it wasn&#x27;t dried yet because it was stinging my face; probably because of the alcohol, and it was a pain to remove. This is only good for people who have a lot of patience but NOT me. There are plenty of inexpensive face masks in the drugstore that I like way better than this.</li>
    <li> Got this product at the request of my 15 year old daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> i have used it twice and it all ready has made a big difference..my skin is clearer, softer and my pores are smaller!!!</li>
    <li> ive always had problem skin and most acne medications/treatments just have never really worked.  I keep my face clean with just hot rinse water each day and 2-3 times a week ill throw on the mask and peel off any impurities that may have built up.  this is definitely a staple in my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to peel off if you follow the directions. Make sure you apply a good dab of it. I found it most helpful to apply it to clean, dry skin (wet skin would dilute it and make it harder to peel). Scent is hardly noticeable. Makes skin very soft. It didn&#x27;t really help with acne problems too much, but there are other products for that. I like to use this just to show off a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; glowing layer to the world!</li>
    <li> I am actually wearing the peel as I&#x27;m writing this right now. I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and have not had one complaint. I actually stumbled upon this product by chance at a local CVS. My husband and I were looking for new facial cleansers because nothing in the past has worked for either of us. So after going up and down the aisles I came across this product and decided to give it a shot. I have to say since day 1 after peeling off the mask my skin feels so refreshed. It&#x27;s literally feels like a weighted layer has been lifted. I use this product at night and the next day my skin feels so smooth and clean. No excess oil when I wake up and my skin doesn&#x27;t flake as it normally does on my forehead especially. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product broke me and my mom out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your money on this, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this works perfect.</li>
    <li> Dries REALLY slow and doesn&#x27;t clean ANYTHING!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected. It is very difficult to take off.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> So far so good, takes longer than 10 mins to dry/harden if applied thick...but I like it thick</li>
    <li> very cool mask, makes me think I am peeling off my skin. I don&#x27;t know if its actually doing me anygood by using this product but its cool to peel off the mask.</li>
    <li> Right there in the title. It does its job pretty darn well! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t peel off well....I usually have to scrub it off, which defeats the entire purpose. I wouldn&#x27;t get it again, would prefer other brands I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I alter this with a standard clay mask for skin clearing results. Good overall product and it&#x27;s fun to remove.</li>
    <li> This product is very thick and was difficult to apply - I felt as though I was &amp;#34;pushing&amp;#34; it onto my skin.  After the recommended 10 minutes, it felt like a mask, but would&#x27;t peel off evenly.  I ended up  with a little pile of bits from different parts of my face.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I think the cucumber PEEL-OFF MASK is a wonderful product. You know how when you first get up in the morning your face, well mine, needs a little wake me up call. Well, for me, the Freeman cucumber peel-off mask is just what the doctor ordered. After a gentle morning face wash, applying the Freeman peel-off mask, then around twenty minutes later my face looks and feels totally refreshed and I feel younger. I am glad that I found this product. I would recommend this product for everyone!!!!</li>
    <li> ALL I could&#x27;ve hoped for in a genuine peel-off mask. I&#x27;ve looked for years for another peel-off mask that other beauty lines discontinued. Left my face feeling silky soft and I know this type of peel-mask with have my complexion clear, glowing and mar-free from old scratches &amp; pimple scars from the past by using it once a week. Love it!</li>
    <li> Did not like this mask, could not even peel off.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply &amp; my fave part is taking it off... like in elementary school when I&#x27;d put glue on my fingers just to peel it off. lol It leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; revived! I&#x27;ll buy more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;My friend had a sleep over and made me try this! :D&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s amazing feeling and when you peel it off you can see the results of dead skin!! which is (gross but) amazing!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Freeman products but when I used this I really fell in love. It has a great smell, easy on my sensitive skin and removes the junk that can get in your pores. You do have to be generous with the application so it will be easy to peel off. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars but its only my 3rd day using this. Its great i like the way it tightens my skin nd it smells good nd relaxing! so far i noticed some reduced pimples nd a smoother face. I recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Great product! The only issues I have are that the mask is clear so it&#x27;s hard to see where you&#x27;ve put it on your face and also that if you don&#x27;t put it on thick enough, it&#x27;s hard to peel off. But if you apply it thickly and around your entire face it peels off in one mask quite easily. It acts like a giant pore strip for your entire face which I love since dirt and oil get stuck in my pores. I will definitely buy more of this product!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for me.  The cucumber scent was fresh and clean.  It went on smoothly.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with clumping anywhere.  I think I could have put it on a little thicker as it was a bit hard to just peel off easily.  But, it did make my face feel smooth and soft when I did take it off.  I used a moisturizer after I took it off and my face felt great!  I really like this product; would recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite mask but it seems effective as an alternative to a few others I prefer. Pulls off well but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a long shelf life.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Its done wonders for my skin, plus its fun and relaxing. Definitely reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 17 and love this stuff. Spas are kinda expensive so I say why not give myself a facial mask at home. So I went searching on here and found a whole lot of masks to try, but this interested me the most because of the natural cucumber and what it claimed to do. So I ordered it and when it finally came, I just had to use it that night. And let me tell you! I&#x27;ve been using this mask twice a week for a few months now, and my face looks and feels great. It also helped to reduce some of the puffiness under my eyes. They&#x27;re invisible now! It makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been to a spa. The only reason I gave it one less of a star is because when the mask is left on overtime, it&#x27;s hard to peel off. But if you leave it on for the right amount of time, it peels off easily. Other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it weekly for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of flowers and perfumes and such, but i also love the smell of chemicals so i don&#x27;t know if it smells bad to the general public or not but it smells alright to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination/acne prone skin and if i don&#x27;t exfoliate i get dry flakes and my skin gets this gross buildup of dead cells. This stuff never bothered my skin-it actually feels cool and refreshing to me-which is saying a lot because many face masks make my skin burn like i just slapped Icyhot on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a kid i would spend hours putting glue on my hands and wrists and then peeling it off once it dries. This reminds me of that a lot except it doesn&#x27;t make your hands feel all boogery after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways it makes my skin soft and pulls  a lot of dead skin off that i would have had to abrasively scrub off otherwise. No complaints here. This face peel is the kitty&#x27;s titties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyebrows. That sucks. You have to wash it out with warm water to get it to dissolve. And i&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m not putting enough on or what but i usually end up washing my face afterwards to completely remove any scraggly leftovers.</li>
    <li> Tried one of the sample sizes of this product, and I love it! Easy to apply, and peels off relatively easily (avoid any hair, I suggest wearing a headband. The mask doesn&#x27;t harm hair, but it is difficult to remove product from it). I have sensitive skin, but have yet to have a problem with this product.</li>
    <li> - It peel off nothing. I don&#x27;t have blackhead but just a little dead skin around my chin. And dead skin is even easier to peel off than blackhead, but this thing can&#x27;t even take it out. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well priced mask, for the results. Does a great job revitalising the skin and removes grease and cleanses the face.</li>
    <li> When I used this product for the first time, I was tearing. The smell was really annoying. This mask is feels like glue and apparently has no effect on cleaning pores. Totally waste of money.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face mask. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or cause a break out. Takes longer than the 10 minutes to fully dry, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Great product had been looking for a bigger bottle of this stuff for a long time. Really great not spilled or anything</li>
    <li> just what I wanted, skin feels so clean after using.</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first, great price, face feels so refreshed I use it once a week, twice would be better but still giving it a try. So far so good</li>
    <li> I was in love with this mask, from the first time I used it. It refreshed my skin, made it feel clean and really soft!!! and it really makes your face look different after 2/3 uses.... I will TOTALLY use this peel off mask again!!!! It&#x27;s a good peel off mask for combination skin and I recommend it to anyone thinking about getting a mask. But I do wanna say this.... I got this mask for 3 dollars at Walgreens and this is 7 dollars plus shipping.So it&#x27;s a bit more... No big deal. But Anyways I LOVE this mask..... And I hope everyone that uses it does too!!!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I had in mind when I ordered it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like most mask. I am extremely happy with this.</li>
    <li> dries quickly, very good for skin. its like a biore pore strip for your entire face. i really liked this product and I use it 3 times a week</li>
    <li> It is great for sensitive skin. It makes your skin very clean and soft. It is a great value. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product works wonderful! You have to put on A LOT to be able to peel off but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied! My skin was super soft!</li>
    <li> I received the wrong item but my sister had the correct one and it was amazing. This version spells like straight up rubbing alcohol and it burns. Don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily skin and this is great to help cleanse the pores. I was worried at first that it wasn&#x27;t working but it dried fine and peels off real easily. My skin looks so refreshed afterwards and felt great. The scent is nice too.</li>
    <li> This mask is wondeful for the price!&lt;br /&gt;It applies easily and leaves the skin feeling fresh and renewed!&lt;br /&gt;It deep cleans and leaves your skin tight and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
    <li> this mask leaves your face feeling nice and cool and peels off nicely and whatever is left behind is easily washed off with water...great to help dry skin in the winter or overly dry skin in summer. great pick me up and ncie price...could only find the little packets at store but this is better for more than once time use and better price</li>
    <li> this mask is one of the nicest I&#x27;ve tried.  It is very cool and refreshing and helps with those fine lines and wrinkles.  Makes your face feel very clean.  Be sure to let it dry before you peel it off.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived fast. It doesn&#x27;t hurt like boots strips.I&#x27;m not sure if the price compares to the local Cavs or right aid but I didn&#x27;t hAve to leave the house.</li>
    <li> ...this would be the mask for you. Of course, it&#x27;ll be cheaper to buy Two-Buck Chuck from Trader Joe&#x27;s. This mask has a very strong alcohol smell! The moment I applied this mask, a great cooling sensation kicks in and alcohol vapor starts to mildly burn my eyes. It peels easily once it dries. If you look closely, you can see that the mask has remove some facial detritus, like dead skin flakes and white heads. I guess it worked in that sense. However, the alcohol totally dried out my skin. I threw this tube into the trash after one use.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will buy again from this seller</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! Tonight was my first night trying it, and I must say that my skin (face) feels really soft and clean! I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> You just put clean your face and then this mask on. This mask doesn&#x27;t take long to dry. The mask seemed to do what it said and I am satisfied with it. Next time I might buy other variations of this mask just to see how it compares to this wonderful cucumber mask.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  Peeling off is like other masks and stings some but end result is such smooth skin.  I am so glad I ordered two.</li>
    <li> I can feel and see the difference in my face appearance. It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;smoother and softer. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> this item was awful.  the mask did not want to come out of the tube.  it took forever to get hard enough to peel off.  would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff would be a blast for anyone who loves peeling sunburns or enjoyed peeling Elmer&#x27;s glue off their hand as a child. Other than the obvious fun in peeling the impurities and tiny hairs off your face, this mask is cooling and leaves your face feeling smooth and soft. My boyfriend, who is not one to be adventurous with beauty products of any sort, tried it out and loved it. He couldn&#x27;t get over how much gross stuff was hiding in his seemingly clean face. I&#x27;m thinking about buying some for my mom, I think this is an even better deal than the stuff she used to get from Avon.</li>
    <li> Good but do not wait too long o it is hard to remove.</li>
    <li> i my face feels very clean and light after using this mask, its great to do before bed and it smells very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have dry skin build-up that you wish to get rid of in an inexpensive way.  There are so many products that cost so much more and basically do the same thing.  I would opt for the Freeman Cucumber Facial Peel-Off Mask if you have dry skin that doesn&#x27;t seem to come off during regular face washing as this peel will definitely pull it right off.  I love the feeling when you peel it off.  Your face feels soft and fresh and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product for doing a deep clean</li>
    <li> I like it! You have to put a lot on though in order for it to peel off easily.</li>
    <li> This stuff changed my mind about peel off mask; it made my face crack and peel.  I am very sensitive and most products made for the masses are too strong for me.  I now make my own mask using ripe avocado and a few other natural items.  No eye burning or stinging and it rinses off well.</li>
    <li> Nice mask, although I have to use a lot, a bt messy. the effect is temporary, doesn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary.</li>
    <li> I should start out by saying that this product is not for everyone.  It has a chemical odor and it essentially involves applying a  clear glue-like gel to the face.  I wash my face, blot dry and then apply a thick layer of this stuff to my face.  It washes off my hands easily.  Then the fun begins!  Let the clear gel dry for 10-15 minutes then pull this off your face in one piece if possible.  It feels like pulling dried glue from the face but it mostly comes on one rubbery, stretchy sheer sheet.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin,but if feels like every pore gets unplugged when the product is peeled off.  I use this every two or three days.  WARNING! DO NOT GET THIS INTO YOUR HAIRLINE!  Glue in hair is not a good thing.  Oh and my dogs freak out when they see me appear to pull my face off.  Have fun with this!</li>
    <li> I did not like this mask. While it didn&#x27;t give me any negative after effects, it also didn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth and soft. It left my skin extremely gross and dry. I tried this twice with the same results so I ended up giving it away. I didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my face and wanted to immediately wash it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also do not use if you have open pimples/burns etc. IT WILL STING! And it will hurt when you pull the mask off. Another tip, don&#x27;t use a thin layer because you want the mask to pull off without it stressing and inflaming your face. That happened to me the first time. You have to use a couple of layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather make my own cucumber mask, but sadly don&#x27;t have the time to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t use it again. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to women with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> One thing I liked about this mask was that after it had dried and it was time for me to peel it off it didn&#x27;t feel like ripping a bunch of band-aids off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with the way it treated my skin, though. My skin didn&#x27;t get softer or anything. Keep in mind though that I used just this product and nothing else until it was empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe if you use this with something else it might work a little harder.</li>
    <li> I just brought this product yesterday at Walgreens for $4.29 and I love it. It smells great, it&#x27;s a little sticky but it works. When I opened the top I wasn&#x27;t expecting a clear gel like substance, I was a little hesitant at first but I followed the directions. It will dry fast so smooth it over your face fast and wait about 20 minutes and peel it off and then wash your face. 5-10 minutes is not long enough in my opinion and make sure to not put it on your eyebrows or sideburns because when your peeling it off it will be very hard to get it off your hair. If you do run into this problem do not panic just simply wash it off your face with warm water. Your face will be left feeling smooth and smelling great. The bumps on my face are smaller but not as noticeable but I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The product is good, does as advertised and would get 5 stars if, and it isa BIG if, when I peeled off the product I was looking at a much younger me, say 30 years younger.  Is that too much to ask? ;) it really is a good product, I have gone through 4 tubes and just ordered 4 more.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my skins appearance. And I had whitish dry stuff all through the day because it didnt come all the way off. But I guess it did the job.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it made a noticeable difference or not. The product can be a bit tricky to work with but made my face &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; nice. Not something I see myself using often but perhaps on pampering nights.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of like putting elmer&#x27;s glue on your skin. It creates the same peeling effect and doesn&#x27;t really leave me feeling clean, but slimy feeling. It&#x27;s very drying and made my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I used to use this brand maybe 10 years ago and just recently purchased it again. Seems thicker and stickier than I remember. It sticks together really well and all peels off in one piece however I will say it sticks to your face really well and can be slightly painful when removing- like peeling off a band-aid. I have very sensitive skin and it made my whole face red for awhile from peeling it off but it also made my face really smooth and soft. Not sure I would purchase again due to my sensitive skin but if you aren&#x27;t as sensitive to these types of things it would be great!</li>
    <li> This product is not for sensitive skin. Made me break out all over my face, but it dose smell great and its easy to remove, even if you get a little in your hair.</li>
    <li> I got this product and used it within the week I received it and it SUCKED. It did not spread over my face. It was old and out dated. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is mild but effective.  No redness left on your face, only cleanliness. Peel-offs have been hard for me to find lately so it&#x27;s nice to just click and have this shipped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars cause it was difficult to take off. I mean I got it off. I wish I got it off faster though. It felt amazing :)</li>
    <li> Cucumber cool facial that is just what I wanted. My favorite was discontinued years ago and the Freeman brand isn&#x27;t one I was familiar with until Amazon. Use a thin layer for best results . . . drying time is 10 min. or less. Soothing for sensitive and mature skin. Can be used daily. Product information and description is accurate. It does feel a bit sticky so just rinse your hands and remember that a thin layer accomplishes the desired results. The tube makes it easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider the other peel masks offered by Freeman . . . Pomegranate is another good choice from this line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> This mask works just as good as a mask I&#x27;ve purchase for much more money and it does the job very well. It also lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Another awesome face mask ...peel off this time. It has a cooling effect as soon as you apply it. Feels great on the skin..it&#x27;s perfect after a hot summer day or a day on the beach. Smells like fresh cucumber ...I was surprised how much I loved it !</li>
    <li> I love all Freeman products,&lt;br /&gt;They all work beautifully. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works very nicely with redness on the skin . Just a little tricky with the eye brows because you have to wash that part off and then it gets kinda gel like and annoying. Other then that pretty good.</li>
    <li> really cool product, leaves skin smooth and fresh! And I enjoy all the peel-off mask because the great peeling moment!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love this.  I struggled with putting it on too thin or too thick so that is probably my issue not the product, but I still didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this for my boyfriend hopping it would clear his black heads wich it never did. When i had tried it i noticed it was like putting elmers glue on my hands, letting it dry, and peeling it off when i was done. It was a waste of $5.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. It is refreshing. However it did not peel off in one piece. I had to scrub some off.</li>
    <li> so fun! not entirely sure if it does all that much, but i think my skin looks a bit better after.</li>
    <li> Leave the face looking clean and smooth and bright. I especially like to use after I remove my makeup, just to ensure ALL my makeup is off and it does a great job at removing any makeup that was left behind. I also like to use this if I spent a long day outside because even after I wash my face, my skin still look dull and dead because of all the hours in the sun (even if I use SPF 50 or sometimes even 100) but once I apply this to my face and peel it off my skin looks so much better and feels so much better.</li>
    <li> My biore strips are better than these.</li>
    <li> Use this product regularly &amp; love it.</li>
    <li> refreshing ! as described.</li>
    <li> smells interesting , but reminds me of glue</li>
    <li> used this product years ago and decided to go back to it. Price is good and feels good when applied.</li>
    <li> I have to admit this mask is pretty nice in the way that it makes your skin feel soft and smooth and its cool to peel off! But if you&#x27;re thinking about getting this for blackhead or acne removal then this isn&#x27;t the mask for you. Essentially I think all it does is remove some oils, maybe some dead skin, and make your skin silky soft. Which is great, but it&#x27;s not going to pull out all your blackheads. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does mostly do what it says, hydrates your skin and its a good, easy, reasonably priced peel off mask. But just a little tip to my fellow people with greasy skin the Mint Julep Masque is a terrific mask as well, great for soaking up oils, popping whiteheads, and also leaving your skin incredibly smooth and soft. *Sids note- this mask doesn&#x27;t pull out blackheads either, but still a great mask for oily acne skin*. If you&#x27;re particularly struggling with black heads there is some pore strips for your nose you can also buy on Amazon. *Sorry I don&#x27;t remember the name* But I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It works great but impossible to see the clear gel as you apply it so you cannot tell if you covered your face perfectly or not</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a real peel-off mask. Easy to remove the peel from my face. The only thing is that it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I think. Just fine on hydrating.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and remove! Very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;It dries out relatively fast and leaves your skin smooth, without causing any irritations or itchiness.</li>
    <li> this facial mask I got for Christmas, and im still using it! it is amazing and you don&#x27;t need much. It smells like fresh cucumber, and once you let it dry, your face gets really tight so then you know its time to take it off, I would definitely recommend this to anyone with dry or oily skin... I have dry skin naturally, and it cleans your pores. I would also say to use this after you cleanse your face in the shower, and then dry your face all the way, maybe get dressed, and then put it on your face... do a thin coat though, if you do a thick coat, it takes about 3x as long to dry... love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I freaking love this! it came in today and i was so supprized at how big it is. I love the peal off masks. and if you buy it at Walmart in a small package its like 1 dollar and something. and i bought like 5 of them it didn&#x27;t amount to anything lol but im super excited to use this with my friends. their all so weird-ed out about how it comes off.</li>
    <li> it came  about a week after I ordered it. Yet the package was stapled closed with no reciete inside and the tube of face mask was taped closed missing product and goo around the lid.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find and I like this product. If you do not like clay masks so this is the prefect product</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and how it clears my poors. this is great for a once a week home treatment. i just wish it was stronger on blackheads.</li>
    <li> great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Had a blast using this on a &amp;#34;girl&#x27;s night&amp;#34; with my niece, then I brought it to her house the next weekend and used it on her twin brothers, they loved peeling it off their faces too!</li>
    <li> Works well to pull off dead skin and leaves your skin pretty soft but it hasn&#x27;t really pulled out my blackheads or anything&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna try it again after steaming my face but I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;ll help</li>
    <li> Feels neat but was about as useful as peeling plastic wrap from my face. It also runs, or globs, down your face as it dries.</li>
    <li> Never did facial mask. It was invigorating made my skin feel great.  Item listed was exactly what i was expecting. Would recommend this site to a friend</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff about two weeks ago. I was using the dead sea mask but liked this one better! I use it about a few times a week, but not daily. It does make your skin quite soft afterwords and ive seen a difference in my skin overall. Great product.. ONLY complaint is that i wish they were easier to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> It worked really good it made my skin really soft but! It smelled so bad I wanted to puke it smells like pickles but like 10x stronger!!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great masque but was not really impressed. Have had others that worked better and were easier to peel off.</li>
    <li> my skin in so silky and soft after using. Not to mention it&#x27;s really fun to use peel off masks. My husband laughs that I look like a glazed donut when I use it because it dries so shiny. I have very sensitive skin and have had no reactions, and the tube lasts FOREVER. Love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: enjoy this creepy photo of my second skin.</li>
    <li> The best peeling mask I&#x27;ve used. I wait at least 20 minutes before peeling, and it all comes off at once with no remnants. Soft skin after.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well! Every time I use it my face feel clean and no weird residue! I definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> It goes on cool and thick and come off usaully in one piece. Great for getting rid of dead cells.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. My skin feels so much better after applying this and it&#x27;s also help me relax while the peel-off mask is working its magic. I got it for a great price and it has great quality.</li>
    <li> Okay so if your looking for something to remove pimples and blackheads well this isn&#x27;t going to do that.Still this is a good basic mask to use once or twice a week just to keep your skin healthy and clean.This is for all combination skin so there&#x27;s no worrys. So basically this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker but its good to add to your routine. BUT you can find this for much cheaper any where else ;)</li>
    <li> I really liked it, smells great and so much fun to peel off! My skin looked cleaner and fresher. Even used it on my husband.</li>
    <li> This peel off mask is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;Its absolutely useless, suppose to be good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in Freeman beauty because these masks suck!</li>
    <li> There was no safety seal on this product and it seemed like a good amount of the gel was missing. I am not pleased to have received a product that seems used. Maybe it was just me since no one else seemed to complain about it, but there being no foil or anything doesn&#x27;t bod well with me. I wont go as far as to give it one star since I don&#x27;t know if this has happened before. But I am certainly not happy.</li>
    <li> GREAT Product.  I used it almost immediately after opening and it was a wonderful experience.  Will be ordering again for myself and my daughter!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years with good results. After using this, my skin always felt cleaner than justing soap and water.  Skin felt softer.  Pores seemed less noticable.  The area stores stopped stocking this producted and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I looked when going out of town but never found a store that carried it.  They did stock other flavors of this product but never the peel-off mask.  Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve found this producted so I ordered many tubes.  It last a long time, easy to use and has always been a good product.  Not harsh to the skin as some other products may be.  Easy to apply and easy to take off.  I received free shipping and handling which is always nice and a big plus.</li>
    <li> I had been looking in stores and online and this was the best price, it&#x27;s got a fresh relaxing smell and takes an okay time to dry. It helps you skin get rid of oils and dead skin. I love this stuff and so does my boy friend.</li>
    <li> This product really helped moisturize my skin and clear up acne and minimize acne scars. I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Directions say use a couple of times per week. First use was fine. Kind of like peeling dried Elmer Glue off your face. The second time it damaged my skin so badly it took weeks for my skin to recover. Like it took a layer of skin off.</li>
    <li> It goes on very sticky and it feels  refreshing and cool to your face. It seems to do what it says&lt;br /&gt;Because after one use my face seems to be nice and soft.  I left it on for about 15 minutes instead of 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If I cant find it in the stores I will buy this again. Good Job</li>
    <li> The smell is so strong it burns my eyes. I love Freeman&#x27;s other masks though, I enjoy the clay avocado one a lot and even use the black sugar scrub one to exfoliate. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to improve my skin or make it look any better after using...it&#x27;s fun to peel off though.</li>
    <li> I use this multiple times a week. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love it so far. My face feel really soft and clean afterward. It even make me think that I should buy other flavor too.&lt;br /&gt;But I just check the price, it&#x27;s around 2-3$ cheaper in CVS, but it&#x27;s out of stock right now, but anyway, I might buy it in CVS next time. I still love this product though</li>
    <li> I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I&#x27;ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel scrub makes my face feel taut after use.  I would recommend its use to maximize facial zyzzthetics.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite peel-off masks. A treat for my face. Exfoliates/peels and leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft. It&#x27;s gentle on skin but cleans effectively.  The cucumber mask feels great in the hot summer months for deep cleaning and leaves my face feeling refreshed and renewed.  Dries fairly quickly and peels easily.  I use a cucumber toner after peeling off and my skin feels calmed and soothed. I have better results with moisturizing when I use this peel a couple times per week.</li>
    <li> Came in plastic outer layer and half the product gone</li>
    <li> Smells good and it seems working on blackhead around nose.The texture is too thick, and it is hard to put it evenly on my face.</li>
    <li> I love the simplicity and effectiveness of this mask. The smell is great. It really unclogged my pores and extracted impurities from my skin. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> YES I USED IT. WORKS GREAT. TRY IT FOR YOUSELF TO KNOW IF IT WORKS FOR YOU, EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT :-) HAVE A GREAT DAY. ALSO REMEMEBER NOT TO SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ON ANYONES REVIEWS. I WILL TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY. HAVE A GREAT DAY :-)</li>
    <li> My face looks and feels better after using the peel off mask than when I go to a spa for a facial . Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t peel off. Didn&#x27;t feel good on my skin either. Stick with clay.</li>
    <li> The mask goes on as a thick gel and smells wonderfully cucumber-y and maybe a wee bit floral-y too.  While this isn’t a natural product, it does contain a good many fruit extracts (banana, papaya, raspberry, ginger) as well as aloe and, yes, cucumber. This mask peels off so much better than a lot of peel off masks I have used.  Why is peeling off masks so much fun anyway?  It’s like addictive in a becoming a lizard person sort of way. Most of the mask came off, but I followed up with a rinse to get it all off completely. My face felt amazingly clean and very fresh looking after use. Please read my full review here: http://www.beautyapocalypse.com/2015/03/march-mask-madness-freeman-beauty.html</li>
    <li> Great mask for the price!! Peels off easily after it completely dries and skin feels wonderful!!</li>
    <li> for making products that make my skin look perfect. I am 30 years old but suffer from horrendous acne. I tried everything from clindamyacin saturated lotions to Biore to Peroxide to Salicyclic Acid, then remembered Freeman make these masks. I couldn&#x27;t find it at Walmart, so I ordered it on Amazon. Put it on while my skin was dry, waited about fifteen minutes, peeled it off. And...well, actually it was pretty gross. A lot of stuff from inside my pores and the topmost layer of dried up dead skin came off. It didn&#x27;t hurt; it was just odd feeling. My skin isn&#x27;t sore or red or anything like that. But it is moisturized and looks cleaner, and my acne has almost all gone away. I&#x27;ve actually made it through one entire tube of this and am on the second after 2 months. And I&#x27;ll be buying it again. Probably for forever. Because nothing else seems to work like this stuff.</li>
    <li> A good quality facial for normal to dry skin.  If you have oily skin like me, the Freeman Oily Skin facial will work better.</li>
    <li> product helps my granddaughter keep clear skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Freeman products before, and so I was excited about this one. But let me just say, it fell flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled really nice, not like chemicals or the usual cleansing products. But because it was a gel, it was super messy and i hard time putting an even layer on my face. And it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;peel off\\&quot; at all. I tried using it with dry skin and while in the shower, but neither worked. I spent literally 10 minutes trying to scrape it off my face with a washcloth and cleansing brush and my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very messy, waste of time, and not worth the price. Try the one with the shells on the front instead, that one was great!</li>
    <li> Works great, low maintenance, no mess.</li>
    <li> price, uality and shipping Like we say in french la totale.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD PROFESSIONAL FACIALS IN THE PAST. THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING.  WITH THIS MASK YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF A FACIAL AT HOME, AT A FRCTION OF THE COST OF THE PROFESSIONAL. SAVE THE MONEY AND TRY THIS. FAST DELIVERY AND GREAT SERVICE.</li>
    <li> I always like peel off masks.. I don&#x27;t know if they really do anything but they feel like they do as it dries and tightens. This one is typical and has a nice smell. It&#x27;s a bit cooling, but not too much. I have super sensitive skin, so I am always afraid to try a new one, but this one did not irritate my skin at all.. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I remember using Freeman products as a teen and liking their scents and results. This peel off facial mask is good enough for the price. It feels pretty thick, gooey and gross, but most masks do lol. It dries in a fairly good amount of time and peels off like a nasty sunburn lol. It does have a lovely clean smell.</li>
    <li> Good pricing.it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like other products I&#x27;ve used. I used to pay 2$ every time I used a face peel, and this product has more than paid for itself by now.</li>
    <li> This product Is great. I recently used it last night &amp; it was great. It drys quick, which is great according to me.</li>
    <li> I have tried all Freemans products. This peel is really easy to use and makes your face feel fresh after being removed. Most of Freemans products are great, and I use them on a weekly basis. Let me just say ,6 oz bottles at my grocery store are from $2.50 to $3.50. Needless to say if I bought them from here I would feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> I had used this in the past and I was pleased to see it is just as good now as it was then.  LOVE when a formula that WORKS isn&#x27;t tampered with.....</li>
    <li> So refreshing to put on and so smooth to take off! This product in particular had a nice smell to it. The gel goes on easily to your skin and dries a little longer than stated on the instructions.  Oddly as it sounds, I love checking the amount of dirt that the peel takes off once dried.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. My only beef is with the smell; I&#x27;m not a huge cucumber fan. Thankfully the smell is still refreshing and not overpowering. I love peel masks, and this one is great for the money (better at Freeman&#x27;s website and other online drug stores). As long as you do a thin layer and wait for the whole thing to dry, it peels off very nicely. My face feels refreshed and smooth after peeling it off. My boyfriend has done it with me, but he has a hard time not getting it in his eyebrows and facial hair, though I think his lack of attention to details is to blame. I just bought the pomegranate peel mask, so I&#x27;m excited to try that one out, hoping the results are similar with a better smell.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and loved it. It seems hard to find it in store these days so I ordered it on Amazon. Arrived quickly. Used it right away. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Have used many facial peels before and this ranks high up there because it is easy to use and leaves your face feeling clean and soft. You&#x27;ll be happy with this product and the price is amazing for such a quality product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin(Rosacea) and it worked wonderfully. I have used it a few times and going to reorder. It did not sting, burn or break me out. Great product, shipping was fast and packaged so nothing would damage it.</li>
    <li> my skin becomes very smooth after i use this mask. it really refines your skin very well. and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
    <li> It can effectively clean the face and feel the skin taut. But it make the skin dry after using it.</li>
</ol>
