      <li>And such a good price!</li>
      <li>I received this order very quickly considering it was around the holidays.</li>
      <li>the inside of these are lined for easy cleaning.</li>

      <li>it can easily fit into one of my large purses...</li>
      <li>Although this obviously isn&#x27;t the real product, it is still a good quality replica.</li>

      <li>I can never find make up bags that are the right size, but this one does the trick.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a little too big for my gym bag, but it is perfect size!</li>
      <li>I use this as a pencil case for school and it is great and holds a lot of stuff, i dont really know what to do with the little bottles but their pretty</li>
      <li>This was my first makeup bag</li>
      <li>A lot of people I know are getting ready for spring break and going on Vacation ,</li>
      <li>And the little travel bottles will definitely come in handy for shampoo/lotion/etc!</li>
      <li>When I received this item it was smaller than expected, but the person I gave it to as a present loved it.</li>
      <li>Very pretty cosmetic bag, with a thoughtful design, including two small bottles for liquids, attach to outside of bag.  </li>
      <li>This is such a cute little make-up bag.</li>
      <li>Although, the reusable bottles felt like good hard plastic that would last through multiple uses.</li>
      <li>Upon actually receiving this product the bag had a burlap feeling to it which I personally didn&#x27;t like very much.</li>
      <li>Great small size and big enough for all my small size travel products: 2 bottles for shampoo conditioner, mini face wash bottle, mini bodysoap bottle, razor, toothbrush and toothpaste</li>
      <li>They barely held 3 oz.</li>

    <li> The case is nice quality, better than the photo. I love the printed bottles. It makes travel a pleasure.

    <li> Just ordered it on the 27th and I already got it today! Very pretty design, great size, exactly what I wanted for my purse!
