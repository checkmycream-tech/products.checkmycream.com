<li> I decided to purchase a cane to help me with walking and getting up and down for seating.</li>
<li> I purchased 2 canes to replace one which is showing a little rust.</li>
<li> Holds up well to heavy use and abuse.</li>

    <li> My mother likes the cane so far. But it took a very long time for it to get here.   I probably won&#x27;t order again from this company.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.  Holds up well to heavy use and abuse.</li>
    <li> Quality is poor  -   not a steady support device.  Everyone who tries it, uses words like \\&quot;junky\\&quot; to describe the feel and appearance of this item.  Unstable and wobbly.    Just what you don&#x27;t need when you&#x27;re using a cane to keep from falling.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;quad\\&quot; cane is very sturdy and although the base is a bit large it has no wobble and will assist my husband when he gets up from his chairs.</li>
    <li> The cane is ok but it took ages to get here. Actually the canes is too short. In total, I&#x27;m basically dissatisfied with this product and the retailer.</li>
    <li> great investment my grandfather loves it</li>
    <li> This is for my wife. She likes it allot and it has been a suitable replace for another quad cane she had for 10 years. It&#x27;s not as light as I&#x27;d hoped it to be (says it is aluminum but is chromed; not sure that aluminum can be chromed) but it has held up nicely and should go the long run. And for the price, you could buy several to have around the house and/or in the car.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 canes to replace one which is showing a little rust. I must use 2 at a time for stability.  Blame age and old football injuries I guess.&lt;br /&gt;When they arrived,  it took just moments to  adjust the bolts.&lt;br /&gt;It is unfortunate, like most other items,  they are made in China.</li>
    <li> I needed this cain to help with my walking so fair it has been a really good and well put together  cain</li>
    <li> This is a good product for someone who needs the steadying influence of a cane.  The four prongs are very good for stability.</li>
    <li> while waiting to have hip replacement surgury I needed to make a 30 day trip out of the country. I decided to purchase a cane to help me with walking and getting up and down for seating. I will state that this cane far exceeded all expectations. It is extremly light and strong and made my trip bearable and even possible. I was able to stand longer and even walk further then i have been able to in the months previously when my ego would not let me use any help. A must have item and was at a fair price and quick shipping. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This quad cane was very unstable for my mom who had leg surgery. The physical therapist recommended she send it back to the company (which I did and they happily accepted the return) I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> very study good adjustments</li>
    <li> MY grandmother needed this and now she has it. Perfect condition and perfect delivery. I need this at home in 7 days because i needed to send it to cuba, i received it in 4 with the regular shipping.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I need! Last year I broke my right ankle; and just a few weeks ago, while peddling my bike, a driver ran into me!</li>
