      <li>I have used regular coconut oil to moisturize legs and arms but a little always sits on top of the skin, which adds a nice sheen, but I always felt it there, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t ever put it on my face.</li>
      <li>but you can find many other options in bigger packages and better prices on the market.</li>
      <li>I get a large jar at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $5.89.  </li>

      <li>Nothing more than raw coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I especially appreciate this because my skin tends to get dry easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> RMS products are generally awesome. Coconut oil/cream are very beneficial for skin and hair. I purchased some from a street vendor while in SE Asia and it&#x27;s like liquid gold to me because she and her family made it themselves. I do like this jar though it is expensive for the size (but perhaps normal for US and UK  markets). Great, multiuse product</li>
    <li> Upon first opening I thought i ad been duped into buying regular coconut oil, but as other reviewers have point out this is high quality, creamy and perfect. great gentle eye makeup remover and face cleaner. highly recommended. a little goes a long way. will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I saw it featured as Tamar&#x27;s pick on &amp;#34;Today&amp;#34;, and thought that I would try it. Glad I did.</li>
    <li> It is basically a very good quality coconut oil but you can find many other options in bigger packages and better prices on the market.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is AMAZING!!!!! Love it works wonderful takes all your make up off while leaving your skin amazingly soft and supple:)</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it was recommended and the reviews.  However, I am sure I can find a better maker remover.  Although this product is gentle on your face there was still a lot of makeup left on my face.  I had to use another product to remove the makeup left on my face before I washed my face.  The question maybe why didn&#x27;t you wash your face after using the makeup remover?  I did the first time I used the cream,  When I wiped my face with the wash clothe, makeup residue was on the wash clothe.  When I use this remover I have to use another product to ensure that the makeup has been removed and  I do not wear waterproof makeup.  This is the reason why I gave this product three stars.</li>
    <li> Greasy and skin felt dry the next day</li>
    <li> The jar was half empty when I received it. I was going to return it, but it was too much trouble. It is not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I will admit that calling this &amp;#34;Raw Coconut Cream&amp;#34; is a marketing scheme to make you believe that this is anything other than regular cold pressed coconut oil. Yes, you can buy raw, unrefined, coconut oil from the grocery store for pennies per ounce compared to this stuff. I have a jar of Dr. Bronners unrefined coconut oil that I generally use for getting my eye makeup off with, and it works just fine. So why do I rate this stuff a 5 star even though I&#x27;m telling you that it&#x27;s a rip off? Well, I&#x27;ll explain as best I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This coconut &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; feels smoother than any other coconut oils I&#x27;ve tried (including Trader Joe&#x27;s Virgin Coconut Oil, Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Whole Kernel Virgin Coconut oil), it doesn&#x27;t get that weird Crisco texture that most coconut oils seem to when they are in that barely solidified state. Plus, it smells a little cleaner. Right when you open the jar you get the scent of clean, raw coconut. Some other coconut oils make me think of cooked coconut when I smell them, but this ones scent seems to be very raw. It seems that I can use the smallest amount of RMS coconut cream to get the same effects of a larger quantity of regular coconut oil (such as taking off eye makeup, or moisturizing my face). I just rub my finger around on the solid top to get the barest finger full and it takes the eye makeup clean off. Plus, this seems to sink right into my skin rather than sitting on top of my skin which is something I haven&#x27;t been able to find with other coconut oil. Normally when I put on coconut oil I use it as a mask and wash it off after about an hour. No matter how little I use, regular coconut oil seems to just sit on my skin and doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I recommend this 100%? No, I really can&#x27;t, especially if you&#x27;re on a budget. Is it worth a try if you&#x27;re trying to find an HG coconut oil for your face? Sure, that&#x27;s why I tried it. I have also had issues with regular coconut oil causing me to break out, but so far with all of the coconut based RMS products I haven&#x27;t had those same skin problems, and I hope it stays that way. Is this product an advertising gimmick? Maybe. I hope that this is something special, that they take extra care to package a quality coconut oil just like they say they do. I will probably be able to use this 2.5oz product for the next 3 months, which works out to about $6 a month. Compared to some of the other eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve used, this is a steal.

    <li> the jar  came open  there was another bag over it but i cannot use it  i need to return it</li>
    <li> I give this a low rating because I think the name is somewhat deceiving.  I expected a coconut cream balm.  It is really and truly plain old coconut oil in a very small jar.  $18.00 is way way too much to spend on a tiny jar of coconut oil.  I get a large jar at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $5.89.  I love coconut oil and believe in it&#x27;s health and wellness properties.  I just can&#x27;t believe that I spent this much on a common product that is sold everywhere for affordable prices.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. A bit heavy so I use at night. Very effective!</li>
    <li> the product illuminates all other serums YES I am in my 50&#x27;s it works great 58 to be exact</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil as a makeup remover.  I&#x27;ve always used a product with olive oil in it but decided to try something different.  I love this product, it removes makeup easily including waterproof mascara without tugging.  Afterwards my skin looks wonderful and feels soft. Very little is needed so even though the jar is small it should last for quite a while making it a good choice price wise.  Definitely would recommend to anyone and I know it hasAwe many more uses other than makeup removal so I shall see how they work.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It feels good while applying but stays atop my skin, making it feel heavy all day.</li>
    <li> RMS coconut cream is a product from an organic skincare line that I discovered while reading Allure and In Style (both magazines raved about this product). This unassuming container of coconut cream is used as a makeup remover (as well as many other functions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a night at a friend&#x27;s startup beauty launch party featuring eyes coated with black pencil and waterproof liquid eyeliner, I wanted to put this cream to the test on hard-to-remove makeup. It delivered. Only a couple of swipes and the black eyeliner surrounding my eye was easily wiped off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use a mix of Shu Uemura cleansing oil, Trader Joe&#x27;s face wash, and Lancôme cleansing water depending on what I&#x27;m in the mood for and how much makeup I&#x27;m wearing, but I oftentimes still have to scrub my face raw in order to remove any traces of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup is all natural and safe to use on all skin types.  What appealed to me when opening the package was the clean and delicious coconut scent - much better and more natural-smelling than any of my other makeup removers. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the container&#x27;s classic and modern round white design looks classy and gorgeous enough to sit on my bathroom counter, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply daily as a makeup remover, cleanser, moisturizer, hair treatment, and even deodorant. I know natural oils are good for the skin, and with this product my face feels moisturized and hydrated. I especially appreciate this because my skin tends to get dry easily. It does feel a little greasy once I put it on, so I make sure to rinse my face with water well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t a cult favorite yet; I plan on getting it for all my beauty addict friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> Good quality Coconut cream for removing eye make up and also mixing with dried out face scrub to make a soothing, still effective skin treatment.  Smells heavenly, as well.</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low for a product that will take off very stubborn eyeliner and mascara.  I have probably purchased 10 products (expensive and drug-store) over the past 6 months, and nothing can get this stuff off.  I have very dry skin, and my hunch is that my make-up just sticks like glue to my eyes...Well, I tried this, and am thrilled.  Not greasy, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil. I cook with it and I use it as an all in one moisturiser for my body, hair and face after showering at the gym. And while all the coconut oils claim to be 100% virgin coconut oil, pressed a bazillion times, etc., for some reason RMS is different. It absorbs more readily in my skin compare to other coconut oils I&#x27;ve used. And it looks and feels like I just put on a cream (as the name suggests) rather than an oil. So, unlike other coconut oils, I no longer feel like I&#x27;m walking out of the house looking like a greased hog until the oil absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only desire is they bring out an even smaller tub (like the Dr. Jackson&#x27;s coconut melt) that&#x27;s more purse friendly. This tub isn&#x27;t massive by any means, but I&#x27;m a &#x27;carry everything but the kitchen sink&#x27; type of girl, so I like to downsize whenever/wherever I can.</li>
    <li> This product showed up completely melted I put it into the refrigerator and then it came out too hard and stiff unable to use if you really want this product by it in person. Waste of my money</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is great but the container is terrible. I spill the oil all over when I open it.</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff for eye makeup removal, and it leaves your skin so soft. I also like to use it after being in the sun, and occasionally use it as a cleanser. It also smells very fresh and good</li>
    <li> Simply the best grade of coconut oil around. Easy to use. It  dissolves quickly and evenly and has a light coconut scent that is fresh and.clean. I have dry sensitive skin and this oil is the perfect hydrator. And it soaks in quickly leaving no oily residue. I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS CREAM. NOT SMELLY. REALLY HELPS WITH DRY HANDS.</li>
    <li> Love this product; saw it on the Today show as one of the best beauty finds of 2014 and would have to agree wholeheartedly and have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> It is just ok. You need a lot to actually remove make up so it takes longer than my normal routine. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I have used regular coconut oil to moisturize legs and arms but a little always sits on top of the skin, which adds a nice sheen, but I always felt it there, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t ever put it on my face. After reading the reviews for this one I tried it and yes, it IS a totally different experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s summer and it&#x27;s hot so the consistency is like water in the jar, which can be hard to handle, and normally I would give up on it, but this stuff is so good it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I could keep it in the refrigerator and it would solidify, and I may do that now because it would feel cool and refreshing in this heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this cream/oil sinks into the skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. It feels wonderful and instead of a shiny surface you get a slightly satiny sheen. It soothes and heals the skin and makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking. I take a little and rub my hands together and it it&#x27;s too much I swipe my arms then, starting at the back ends, start tapping then pulling my fingers through my hair, moving up toward the roots, stopping a few inches away. I put it in damp hair and let it dry naturally. I rarely need anything else.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Primarily use it as face wash but it has many other uses. Expensive but you only need a tiny bit (the thought of using my cooking coconut oil on my face weirded me out to be honest but hey, to each their own!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one of those plastic sample spoons you get at the ice cream counter to scoop a bit out. I spread it on my dry face and give it a minute to sink in. Then I use a damp butter muslin cheesecloth to wipe it off. Sometimes I use plain old paper towels too. I don&#x27;t scrub too hard or worry about getting every last bit up but then again I&#x27;m one of those people that thinks less is more with skincare. You could follow up with another face wash but I happen to like how supple my skin feels without doing that. I have a bit of acne now and then so I still use acne.org benzyl peroxide afterwards to spot treat. It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and my skin is brighter and softer. I did have a few red bumps in the first week but they weren&#x27;t bad and would be gone by morning (I only use it at night so far) so I pushed through. Obviously, everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently so just know yours and what you&#x27;re comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall I am in love with it and am happy to be moving away from chemically derived cleansers with parabens...still using cetaphil in the morning until I can find a suitable replacement. But baby steps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/7/14 edit...sooo unfortunately my face really started breaking out. Not sure whether it was due to coconut oil or a new moisturizer I had tried but I decided to stop washing with this oil for now.  I still use it for hair masks and dry spots on my body here and there but probably won&#x27;t be purchasing again :(</li>
    <li> Seems like just coconut oil....purchased after it was featured on the today show but was very disappointed.  Would not buy again, save your money and use coconut oil.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. Buy it, you don&#x27;t use a lot and it lasts a long time. Looks greasy at first, but soaks into my (dry) skin within 2 minutes and keeps it very soft</li>
    <li> Worth the money it&#x27;s organic coconut oil</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t travel with it because it melts since coconut oil has a low melting temperature BUT it is perfect for the random dry spots I get on my face. Smells great!</li>
    <li> This cream makes my face feel silky and smooth but it breaks my face out.</li>
    <li> It really is moisturizing and not a mess, I love it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all. Fragrance was too strong for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed, I can go to the grocery store &amp; purchase organic coconut oil, which is all this is.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. I just wish there was more of it and not this small little container. I use it everywhere and I don&#x27;t find it to be oily or heavy. It is very light and smells delish. I will most likely purchase more and a bigger size. I have had mine since 1/10/15 and it&#x27;s almost gone.</li>
    <li> It is okay, pretty much like my other coconut cream, but much better scent!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. So pure and luxurious at the same time.</li>
    <li> Nothing more than raw coconut oil.</li>
    <li> It looks and smells just like coconut oil.  Not impressed at this point but will keep using it because I have it.</li>
