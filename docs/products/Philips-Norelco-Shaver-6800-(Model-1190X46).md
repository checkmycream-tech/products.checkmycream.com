<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work will when cutting hair same with my face. Also, my hair grows faster when I using this, sucks that it causes my hair to grow fasts.</li>
    <li> Just over 90 days so no longer valid for return.  I put up with a poor shave that has now turned into a useless shave.  I have used Norelco shavers sense 1985. This is the worst example of a Norelco Shaver I have ever owned.  I can plainly see stubble right after shaving.  Tried both Williams Lectric Shave and a canned shaving gel, slightly better but still not acceptable.</li>
    <li> Really nice and gives clean shave. worth to have it</li>
    <li> Quality is very good, has a neatly trimmed beard.</li>
    <li> This is not a great deal. Down the road a way the blades get DULL and you have to replace the shaver head. Cost is about  $140.00  Do the math get a straight razor.</li>
    <li> My wife gave this to me as an early Christmas gift and I loved it! Best electric shaver that I have owned - nice clean shave, easy to handle, and the wet/dry feature makes shaving really convenient.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Under Jae not removing hair properly</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new Norelco. Replaced my old one that I had for 7 years.</li>
    <li> It is a good razor, this is the 2nd one we bought my husband travels and he keeps one at home and keeps the other packed for his travels. Good value.</li>
    <li> a great buy for an all in one shaver and beard/moustache trimmer.  close shaves and even trimming. Love it</li>
    <li> Had Philips all my life and this is  the best yet.</li>
    <li> First bought Philips shaver, I feel very good, thank you ~~~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for 50 years. I&#x27;ve never had a complaint before and have always been pleased with shaving results. This razor is a probable 5 star razor EXCEPT for one feature: It is extraordinarily difficult to remove the head piece for cleaning. The shave head is easily popped off, but getting to the &#x27;guts&#x27; of the blades to get the cut hair out is a pain. A few times the entire clamp flew off across the room with the blades strewn over the floor. Forget about keeping rotary blades together with its corresponding cover. There should be an easier way, am I missing something? I even went to YouTube to see a demo, no luck!</li>
    <li> This razor is loud, does not cut any better then the old razor, has caused ingrown hairs, is inconvenient to use trimmer, and is not as convenient as my old Norelco to charge. This unit has also recently started leaking a white substance around the seams. Might be from lithium battery. Zero improvements over the old razor. In addition, is too old to return to Amazon (1.5 months).</li>
    <li> I have both the old Norelco (without the movable head) and this new model. They both perform very well. The new model gives the extra convenience of the movable head which makes it easier to shave. Good idea!</li>
    <li> My husband says it is just doesn&#x27;t give a close shave as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I had to return it.</li>
    <li> This shaver has changed my life. After being referred to the Norelco Razors from my friends, I researched the costs and efficiency of the razors available. I landed on the Norelco Shaver 6800 and have been overwhelmed by its quality (at such a great price!). I used to have a brand loyalty to the Braun shavers, but after experiencing this Norelco Razor in black, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have had rotary really does make a big difference over foil.. This thing is so smooth I wondered if I was even getting a shave. Definitely handles the contours of your face just like it says.. I have no problem with the with the charger it could be a little sturdier but since you have an hour long charge it will be awhile before the next one so no problem with it..</li>
    <li> This shaver is not worth the money to me.  After using it for several weeks I see no improved shave and the unit heads are hard to release and not so nice to clean.  I would not buy this unit again.  I do like my old Norelco unit and should have just bought new blades for it.&lt;br /&gt;The charge hold time is not so good either.</li>
    <li> It was a present, and the receiver really liked it, and also knows the retail price of the item and was really pleased</li>
    <li> You might be thinking, &amp;#34;ugh, do I really want to spend this much on an electric razor?&amp;#34; Yes. Yes you do. I took it on a two week vacation and shaved every day and ended with still over 50% battery life. Not to mention it gives you a pretty darn close shave. BUY IT. BUY IT NOW.</li>
    <li> Great price and awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she seems to like it OK.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver! works awesome and travels well!</li>
    <li> This thing ran on a single charge from November through April.  I only used it about once a month but still, that&#x27;s a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used razors all my adult life.  I was looking for something that would allow me to use both wet and dry.  This works very well both ways, but I actually prefer using it dry.  I love not having anymore razor burn or getting cut from a razor.  I have a goatee beard so the clipper attachment is great.  I would buy this again at the sale price I paid for it, but it&#x27;s a steep price if you pay full retail.  Battery lasts a long time without getting weak.</li>
    <li> The shaver head follows the skin well and the charge level indicator is a plus</li>
    <li> Clean shave, love the attachments.  Great for any man.</li>
    <li> Poor shave quality&lt;br /&gt;Charger flimsy</li>
    <li> Its packaging looks dirty.&lt;br /&gt;The Production Start Date maybe is 2012.&lt;br /&gt;And its noise is a little high.&lt;br /&gt;Disappoint me!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Shaver and worth the money. I replaced my old Norelo with this model. It does a good job and is easy to use. The only downfall I have discovered is the charging stand. It is a terrible design and will fall over if not propped up.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me the closest shave I probably ever had. I bought this to replace my old electric shaver that was 10 years old and several blade changes. When I got this in I hadn&#x27;t shaved in 3 days, and I was really impressed how smoooth my face felt. I read one poor review of someone who said this razor didn&#x27;t shave close, and would like to know what he used before that. I have always been a dry electric razor shaver, and I have not tried the wet shave with this razor yet, but with how close it is dry I don&#x27;t know if I will.  But if you buy this razor, only buy it for the razor. If the accessories catch your eye, do not purchase it because it comes with extra stuff. The razor is great. The trimmer works okay but I have a great Wahl trimmer that puts my barber&#x27;s to shame. If the travel case wasn&#x27;t a feature it would be no big deal. But seeing it in the photo with the razor made me think it was a case or something to store the razor and accessories in.  It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a paper thin bag. But don&#x27;t let those things take away from the razor, which feels and operates like a quality product</li>
    <li> Shaves perfectly... At first my neck itched but after a couple of times it got use to it just like they said... it&#x27;s easy, fast and smooth. And it last long before you need to charge it, I use it 4 times and still it has more than half a charge in it. And it&#x27;s easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. This is much better than what it replaced.</li>
    <li> excellence shaver, substituted my last Philips Norelco that lasted for 25 years.</li>
    <li> The packaging is intact, which things are relatively complete, because it is a gift, so there is no experience, but it looks very good, praise. Logistics is awesome, from the place an order to sign, 13 days in advance, while the tariff of $10, but it is worth.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco and I am very happy with this model. I only have to charge the unit every couple of weeks and it remains strong throughout the charge cycle. It is very easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I feel it could cut a little closer, otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Good,very good,I like it</li>
    <li> I bought the 1190X to replace a 10 year old corded Philips Norelco &amp;#34;triple head&amp;#34; that burned out in the UK after I stupidly plugged it into 220v. Best mistake I ever made because the 1190X is MUCH better. It shaves so smoothly that I initially thought something was wrong. There is no sensation of blades cutting hair at all, yet it gives me a much closer shave than I ever got from the older one, with zero irritation. It&#x27;s lighter, quieter, and is rechargeable. I was never a fan of rechargeable shavers, but this one charges quickly (one hour from dead to fully charged), and if I forget to charge it, a few minutes will give me more than enough of a charge to shave. I have a trimmed, shaped beard, and I was pleased to find that the trimmer attachment is just as good at what it does as the main cutting head is at what it does. The supplied trimmer works significantly better than the Panasonic stand-alone trimmer I&#x27;d been using previously. Night and day better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s 50% off &amp;#34;one day sale&amp;#34; was the motivation for me to buy a more expensive shaver than I normally would, but after using it for a couple of days, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it at the normal price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only have two &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34;. (1) I wish the battery was replaceable; seems pretty wasteful,  short sighted,  and expensive to have to toss the whole razor when the battery finally gives up the ghost. (2) The included travel pouch is just large enough to hold the shaver, but not large enough to also hold the trimmer (or charging base or wall-wart).</li>
    <li> Have had numerous Norelco razors in the past, this one rocks, very close shave! The trimmer is not as good as the old models unless I am doing something wrong but I still have my old one that the pop up trimmer still works fine on.</li>
    <li> 1st electric razor I have had,works fantastic!</li>
    <li> A gift for my bf, he loves it</li>
    <li> NORELCO Wins&lt;br /&gt;Braun pack up and leave</li>
    <li> Nice shave,  great price, but I still like my Spectra 8865xl better.  I thinks its because the 8865xl has all steel and less plastic.  Steel is a nicer feel to my face!  Shave is about the same</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever owned. No irritation at all!  hold a single 60 minute charge for weeks.</li>
    <li> Product is great. My husband loves this gift.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend likes it</li>
    <li> The shaver works well, but since it was purchased for my husband, who has alzheimers, it does present a couple of problems. The on/off switch is almost invisible, so he always needs help finding it. This means he cannot shave without my assistance, which he could do with his previous Philips Norelco Shaver. Also, he has difficulty replacing it on the charger, which he was able to accomplish on his own with the previous shaver. It does the job, but not as easily as the old one did. Unfortunately, the old one was in use for several years and the shaver heads needed replacing, at a cost above the price of the new shaver. In retrospect, I should have replaced the shaver heads. As of this week, (October 10) the shaver does not cut my husband&#x27;s beard. I purchased the shaver July 14 of this year, so I am really not happy with it. Even after going over his beard several times, the stubble is still there. It was cleaned thoroughly, all hair removed from it, still not cutting his beard.</li>
    <li> What you get what you paid for it.</li>
    <li> Noisy!!&lt;br /&gt;It dose not shave closely!&lt;br /&gt;Even worse than my old $15 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Is Amazon just  like Chinese TAOBAO?</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> Would not remove all the hair under or on my chin</li>
    <li> The gift to my father</li>
    <li> Went from a poor shave to almost useless in just over a months time.</li>
    <li> No wonder it&#x27;s cheaper than China where it was made!</li>
    <li> The razor is I gave a friend a gift, my friend liked him very much.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shaver! Holds a charge for over a month and shaves as advertised. Good choice.</li>
    <li> very comfortable shave and easy to clean</li>
    <li> shaving head does not have enough blades trimmere is for beards</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for many years and this is the smoothest shave yet.  The battery stays charged for weeks and charges quickly when needed.  If rested on a shelf, as opposed to placing it in the cradle, it will try to roll to its side but as long as you expect it then it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> Does a good job shaving,but is a real pain to clean !!!      Can you purchase the liquid cleaner as an accessory ???</li>
    <li> This Norelco gives a fine shave. My only concern is the lack of built in trimmer (you must remobe the head and replace it with a trimmer head which is very large. In addition replacement heads are still costly. Perhaps they will drop in time.</li>
    <li> nice，my father in law love it very much！</li>
    <li> Updated on Dec 7 2015： It makes 2 cuts to my lips in wet shave mode, cannot believe it!!   although RQ111 head is no use for me, I have other two philips hair cutter, and no clean buck is included, it is still a good buy. I use it to shave the hair of my son, keeping his head clean and cool, also looks cool</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut close enough</li>
    <li> lousy build quality, cuts face easily with too much pressure, tricky to clean heads and the blades seem to dull awfully fast</li>
    <li> could not get all the beard shaved at one time, and you may need to get the help of scissors to get a perfect look.</li>
    <li> Razor shaves quite nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave the red bumps shaving with a blade does.</li>
    <li> Nice razor,  quick service</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement for an older Norelco because I like the way they shave. This is a better shaver and works well.  The travel bag that comes with it a little better than nothing.  The stand you have to use to recharge is not one of my favorite items as it is subject to being broken in travel. Have been overseas and back and it is still working but wish Phillips would come up with a direct plug system.</li>
    <li> There is a little noise, but cheap and good</li>
    <li> The Norelco razor charges quickly.  Shaves smoothly and well.  The clipper attachment handles sideburns cleanly.</li>
    <li> What is not to like?  A close shave that is easy on the face and when done shaving it’s easy to clean.  All this and it has a great trimmer attachment too.  What else could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;Why did I ever get away from a Norelco shaver in the first place?  I’m just glad to be back to a Norelco again.</li>
    <li> Putting it simply, it does its job. However, I have used smoother and more effective shavers in the past. $100 is a lot of money, so I would not recommend this shaver if you&#x27;re planning to buy one for a few years. I would look somewhere else and try those out.</li>
    <li> Superb product. Best of all, the beard attachment</li>
    <li> Awesome Shaver! Nice cut!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who normally uses a safety razor. He likes an electric for a &amp;#34;quickie&amp;#34; before going to Home Depot, etc. He still has his old Norelco, but this is much more comfortable. A little pricey, but worth it..</li>
    <li> Love it! It kisses your skin compared to the torture of braun. Previous one was a braun series 5 (crap) really noisey and messy. The trimmer came broken, called Philips (their tel. # is on the shaver back near serial no.) Philip said they would send new and send back broken piece. The part is poor quality and can break easily. Fyi: the trimmers that came attached with the older design were way better. Still love it! Update not good as wet shaver, it misses a lot of fine hair.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this shaver.  Had the previous model and liked that one, but says this one is an improvement.  Esp. the mustache trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shaver I have. Cheap enough and works great. Actually, my last Philips shaver is still working  and have functioned very well for 8 years. Hope this one can perform better!</li>
    <li> Buy it shipped to China from the United States more than ten thousand kilometers, the price is much cheaper than China, although it is made in China. It uses up feeling pretty good, but feel a little pain, I might not as good as you Americans bushy beard, and my original feeling Braun Series 5 compared to par.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.  Easy on my face and leaves it clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a norelco shaver that I have been using for over 7 years and unfortunately my initial impressions are not that great. I like everything about this razorexcept the actual shaving. I will update in a few days to see if anything changes but my suspicion is that I will be returning it soon. After my first shave I actually went back to use my old one to finish a few rough places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem goes further than the actuall blades too. The trimmer blades pale in size compared to the plates they pivot on so there is really no way to do see exactly where you are shaving. This I suspect also causes the issue that other reviewers have had with tight corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end everything here functions but you will either double your shaving time or get a rough cut.</li>
    <li> The attachable trimmer is awesome. The battery life is incredible. The weight and cutting heads are awesome.</li>
    <li> A very disappointing shaver, far from a close cut or any precision. I gave it some time but despite my best efforts, it failed miserably.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many Norelco shavers over the years, but this one is by far the best. It shaves closer and quicker than past designs. The groomer attachment has a nice range of length adjustments, but the shortest setting doesn&#x27;t always trim a sideburn edge as well as the old flip up kind. I&#x27;d certainly buy another if this one was lost.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever owned. It gives me a nice,close shave everytime, weather I use it wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Is it the same as using a razor, no, but it is the next best thing.Fits nicely in your hand, and even cuts those annoying hairs on your throat. I really am glad i bought this product. I would by it again.</li>
    <li> Good product but the beard trimmer isn&#x27;t , 3 months of use and the plastic gear stripped</li>
    <li> The product is perfect</li>
    <li> When my old (15 years?) Norelco rotary told me it could use a break -- and who can blame it? -- I started the search for a suitable replacement. Consumer Reports had reviewed electric razors, and of course there were plenty of reviews on Amazon. I checked them all, and quickly narrowed my possible choices to Braun and Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing how well my previous razor had held up while performing well, I knew I didn&#x27;t have to buy the latest model. I did want a model that was no more than 12 - 18 months old, though, because real advancements are made. I tried to determine what those might be in several cases. My next step was to try to examine candidates in person, because the feel of a razor in your hand is as important as the feel of the razor on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun and Norelco were still within a razor&#x27;s edge of each other. The Braun had some slightly higher reviews, but my face was &amp;#34;used to&amp;#34; a rotary, and I liked the look and feel of the Norelco a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like, or didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like, about the Norelco was that the trimming attachment that was been an integral part of my current razor was no longer a pop-up, it was a pop-off. In other words, I would have to physically remove the rotary heads and replace that part with the trimmer. That would make it almost impossible to trim-a-little shave-a-little, trim-a-little shave-a-little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I decided that this particular model (1190X), which was first released in 2014, met all the critical criteria, including price. If I couldn&#x27;t deal with the trimmer attachment, I&#x27;d kick myself once or twice and then decide what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turned out, exchanging the blades for the trimmer is a simple, easy to master, maneuver and far less of an issue than I thought it might be. Plus the trimmer has a comb attachment that makes it work in areas I where I wouldn&#x27;t have used the exposed blade, which was the only option with my old razor. A fair trade, andit keeps the razor cleaner than the pop-up, which is something I hadn&#x27;t thought of before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Norelco got all the emotional pieces right, too. The razor looks great, so I leave it on the counter all the time in its own convenient little charging stand. The lighting (charge indicators, etc.) is elegant, as is the feel. And the shave is terrific! Even though I had been using a rotary razor, it took my face about three days to get used to this system, but the shave was fast, comfortable and close from the first. It&#x27;s even better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a rotary electric razor at a good price (I&#x27;m figuring that with amortization this one will cost me about $6 a year), good quality, from a company with a solid reputation, you&#x27;ve found it here.</li>
    <li> No Protective Cap，Why？</li>
    <li> Great Gift, My husband loves it !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I HAVE A NORELCO SMART TOUCH XL PROBABLY 7 YEARS OLD.  THEY NEED TO GET IT BACK ON THE MARKET.  THIS FANCY DANDY I BOUGHT IS ALL HAST AND NO CATTLE.  WASTED MONEY.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the recipient uses regularly and compliments the quality and workmanship. Packaged well; would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Some years later, and the recipient still uses for a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> had to send back for a replacement, not sure whom to blame for this but it came in a damaged box and appeared to have a couple parts missing (outline of parts in packaging). The razor also had HAIR ON IT! Disgusting Amazon/Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when they make it right.</li>
    <li> My husband said it met his expectations &amp;#34;close clean shave with ease.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> cant find replacement razor head for this unit.</li>
    <li> I owed one years ago and expected thier technology to have improved the shave. Yet its the same shave as 20 years ago. A little dissapointed about that fact, yet not with the razor itself.</li>
    <li> to large,did not look that size,hard to hold</li>
    <li> Close shave and long battery life. Great deal</li>
    <li> Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> beard powder will fall out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Phillips electric shavers all my life and have been overall very pleased.  All shavers so far have been like the 3100 style, so when the 6800 was on-sale at Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d try an upgrade.  Well, I needn&#x27;t have bothered.  I saw no difference in shave quality with this shaver over my other two Phillips shavers (both costing less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is particularly bad about this shaver is it can only be charged using the stand, which is a bit bulky, so not the sort of thing you want cluttering your sink area, or cluttering your suitcase on vacation.  The stand would be OK if the shaver could be charged without it - directly plugging in the charger to the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a few weeks now and almost love it. Battery has a long life, trimmer is easy to use and has multiple lengths and the shave quality is good. Only Good. I works great (just as well as my previous Norelco), But I have two minor issues. First is the pressure needed to completely flatten heads against skin is a little too much. Second is with a longer hair length the razor tends to miss some spots. If you are shaving frequently then this isn&#x27;t an issue and it works great. But this has different size holes in head to get the longer hairs, at least thats what its suppose to do. So far I haven&#x27;t had success with longer have shaving. I love the travel bag and the compact charger. Still get 4 stars since those are minor issues.</li>
    <li> Gives a  good quick shave without irritation. I like it</li>
    <li> shaver works real smooth with a close shave also a great price</li>
    <li> Great product. The battery seems to be quite durable for frequent usage.</li>
    <li> Hubby didn&#x27;t know he needed this until he got it and he loves it!</li>
    <li> It does a super job on my face. The trimmer is also excellent.</li>
    <li> Worked as good as a $40.00 razor.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Not a close shave at all. My husband didn&#x27;t care for having to shave again with blade razor after using this. So he gave it to our teenage son to use and even he said it wasn&#x27;t a good shave.</li>
    <li> I used before is Philips 1150x, very good, I buy 1190 to my uncle, now, he is very happy, the function is also very power.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but not as good as the last one.</li>
    <li> I started out more disappointed than pleased with this shaver, which was a replacement for a 25 year old Norelco. First of all, I don&#x27;t like that the trimmer is a separate piece, not a pop-up. Secondly, the shaver head is not very easy to clean. You have to pry off the cover, and make sure the cuttings don&#x27;t get everywhere. Then, some cuttings are difficult to dislodge, even with the supplied brush. My old shaver had a flip-up cover which made it much easier to clean. Another issue is that the shaver cannot be recharged without using its stand. Not a problem at home, but another thing to pack, and make sure doesn&#x27;t break, if traveling, and the included soft case won&#x27;t fit all the parts. But, as far as the shaving goes, this Norelco is terrific.</li>
    <li> Really nice shaver.... I am never afraid to tackle any part of my body with this razor.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve owned both Norelco and Remington and this is one great product. At first,  the shave was just ok. But follow the instructions and use it religiously for the 21 days like it says, and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results. I&#x27;m getting shaves just as close as I do with my Gillette Mach series. As for battery life, I&#x27;m about 4 weeks in and I still have about 25% battery life left. and my shaves aren&#x27;t that short.</li>
    <li> I tried it twice. It feels cheap and works like it feels. Then I put it back in the box to send back, which is where it&#x27;s still sitting.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing for a Philips Norelco shaver.  I&#x27;ve used the Norelco shaver for 15 years.  This model is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;I think they made a mistake by going to the new shaver head for wet or dry.  The old head that was used with&lt;br /&gt;Nivea lotion gave a superior shave.  Not so with the 6800 which I have been using for three weeks now.</li>
    <li> Works great for me! Big improvement to my very old Philips one that I actually got used.</li>
    <li> This was an upgrade for me from my other Axe Norelco cross over razor.&lt;br /&gt;I liked my Axe version but lately I wasn&#x27;t getting the same close shave. I figured I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it is much better than my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t as loud and I am getting a close shave again. I like that with the razor I can get all my hair in one passover, unlike my older version.&lt;br /&gt;Granted this was more expensive, but worth the difference in cost.</li>
    <li> I do not intend to keep this shaver.  Opened the box and, of course, the first thing you do is charge the shaver up.  This shaver comes with a charging cradle,  There is NO WAY to charge the unit without the cradle.  For those of us used to being able to charge the the shaver without a big hassle, this is THE WORST DESIGN I EVER SAW !!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. I have been looking for a quality electric razor to change over from the expensive blade shaving. This does an acceptable job on stubble. My big complaint is that it does not take away 4+ days worth of hair on me, at least not without a lot of effort and attention to where I am shaving. It seems to take double the time of a regular shave to ensure that all of my facial hair is gone. I do love the attachment head though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer the blade shave, but this is a well-made electric razor.</li>
    <li> An excellent shaver. My skin does not get irritated when I use this, and it glides over stubble quite easily. The razor / long hair attachment is a real treat! Sharpest and most efficient I have ever used! The battery life is plentiful, and lasted me a few weeks before needing to recharge. One thing I will say: it is not the closest have I have gotten from a shaver of this type. There have been better. But this definitely had provided me with the least irritation I have experienced. I shave dry.</li>
    <li> It gives you a better shaving.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as I  thought It would be but ok.</li>
    <li> A gift for my son...the price made it an obvious choice</li>
    <li> I was hoping to upgrade my 10 year old Norelco with this one...not so much of an upgrade.  This shaver doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than my old one and it requires the stand to charge.  My guess is that I&#x27;m going to date myself, but all I had to do is flip to the backside of my old shaver in order to use the trimmer feature.  On this one, I need to pull the shaver head off and then put on the special trimmer feature.  This is just a pain.  I&#x27;m returning this and going back to my old shaver.</li>
    <li> 特价89刀入手，三刀头，刮的很干净。&lt;br /&gt;Purchase at promo price $82. Very clean and nice.</li>
    <li> Does a reasonably good job shaving off whiskers; is light weight and the head moves freely across my face. True test of overall value will occur when the time comes to replace the heads and I see the cost of the replacement.</li>
    <li> For a nice clean shave, get this razor.  My boyfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> very good！I like it very much！</li>
    <li> My husband likes it very much.</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer attachment is fantastic.  The downside to the razor for me was that there was no way for me to shave with it other than using lube.  It kept chewing my neck and leaving me with a rash for a couple days.  I have friends with the same line of razors and they love them.  I went back to my old Braun 5500 foil electric.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this new razor.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully. Very happy with it!!!&lt;br /&gt; My only problem is that I cannot find the website to register It and get clear information on the proper cleaning method. Can you help me with tthis?</li>
    <li> What a horrible shaver!  If this was given to me for free I&#x27;d still throw it away.  Not only does it not shave close, it also scratched my face.  The design is not good for getting into nooks and crannies like the corner between the nose and upper lip.  A foil shaver is a much better design.  I used to like Braun razors but they seem to have gone downhill in the last 5 years while their price has gone up with gimmicks like self-cleaning.  Since this shaver is horrible and I don&#x27;t trust Braun anymore and Remington is just poor quality, I don&#x27;t know what to buy next.</li>
    <li> It gets most of my facial hair, but I still have to use a regular razor for 1/4 of my face. Don&#x27;t know if a more expensive model would work better or if that&#x27;s an issue with all electric razors of this type.</li>
    <li> Shaves great. Very smooth and the battery holds its charge for a long time. Also, the battery recharges very fast.</li>
    <li> The shaver was a huge $100 mistake. It does not shave close at all. I should have chosen a foil shaver. I still have to use the raver after I use this POS. Makes my shaving time double. Even after reading all the reviews that said this was one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong...Amazon is awesome...but this shaver SUX !</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaver,  one charge last for multiple shaves and does a nice job once your skin adjust to the different type of shaving.</li>
    <li> Pure bliss on the face</li>
    <li> Is very good,my firends is like it,thanks amazon.I am Chinese</li>
    <li> Very good purchasing experiments  in Amazon.com this time, just bought it as light deal price. As top brand of shaver, I always use Philips. It&#x27;s not disappoint  me this time as same as it always does.</li>
    <li> been using a month...replaced an older Norelco...couldn&#x27;t be more pleased</li>
    <li> Was not aware that this was a discontinued item. But it works well and i&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> My husband is 69 and he loves his shaver! No more worries about cutting his skin plus it gives a great shave!</li>
    <li> it has no charging stand,i have to buy one new charging stand to use it</li>
    <li> Husband says it&#x27;s okay.  He was hoping for a closer shave.</li>
    <li> The item suppose to be brand new but was not came in original seal package, therefore I returned the item..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to get some time and a few shaves under my belt with this before writing a review. I&#x27;ll keep it short, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been exactly what I was wanting out of an electric razor. I don&#x27;t shave daily, maybe twice a week, and this is AWESOME. I did shave each day for a week after I got it to make sure of its quality of shave, and was beyond impressed. I came from a Harry&#x27;s razor, which I still use and love, but wanted an electric to cut down on razor burn and to frankly, lazily shave because I don&#x27;t really care for it. I&#x27;m a beard man. Work doesn&#x27;t allow a beard man. Had to compromise. And this razor is GREAT. I got it on a deal of the day, but would pay retail no question. The swappable trimmer head was a plus I didn&#x27;t really require when looking for a razor, but it has come in handy a few times now, so I&#x27;m glad it was part of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are on the fence, and I really hate reading when people say that, it is a great choice. Long battery life, 12-month blade life (and I have pine trees for stubble), and overall really easy to use electric. 5 Thumbs up, or in this case, golden Mario stars.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very good,though the voice is a little high.and the bag is not very well!</li>
    <li> broke while cleaning the head in about 1 month of use.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever used. I&#x27;m 70</li>
    <li> much much better than my previous 1150x</li>
    <li> Was for my husband who said it did not give a good shave.  I returned it for a full refund</li>
    <li> I do not like the package</li>
    <li> For the second time to buy, very good!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shave not as close to what I expected.  I find myself holding the razor heads to get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> My father love it, very good!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, to allow for my face to acclimate to the new shaver.  It hasn&#x27;t improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:  Stylish, good battery life, light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:  Does not shave as closely as its predecessors, even far cheaper models.  Clipper attachment too large/cumbersome for trimming in small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I am usually very disappointed with this purchase. The item purchased was supposed to be &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;, unused, unopened.  What I received was a product that was a return/repackaged.  While I have no issue with purchasing open-box items, that&#x27;s not what I paid for.  Overall, the purchase left me dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I might be a little generous with my rating. While this razor did the job, I do not think it performed any better than my 12 year old Norelco. The removable trimmer cannot replace the pop up trimmer on my old razor. This one cannot be used as a corded razor. the only way to use it is to charge it first in its charger.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my father which would be a upgrade from the Norelco he&#x27;s had for ages. I opened it up to inspect and charge it before giving it to him. The frustration free packaging was indeed as advertised. The shaver itself looks great and is lighter than my Braun 7 series. The charging base is lacking in my opinion, feels cheap and charger doesn&#x27;t feel secured when on it. Upon inspecting the body of the shaver I noticed that the base is required at all times to charge as the cord will not plug into the body. I&#x27;ve owned several electric shavers and they all allowed direct charging without the base for travel so this bothered me. If this base were to break during travel, how would you charge it then?</li>
    <li> Very helpful and well made! My son loves it!</li>
    <li> Son loved his Christmas present - works great for great price</li>
    <li> He loves the new shaver and uses it daily. I appreciate how close of a shave he&#x27;s getting. Wonderful product and quickly delivered! Order one!</li>
    <li> I am getting a closer shave with this shaver than I can get with a blade.  The last time I bought razor blades they cost $21.00 with tax for 4 blades.  The Phillips Norelco Shaver besides giving you a clean shave it will save you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> The convenient tool for processing of the person. It is pleasant to me.</li>
