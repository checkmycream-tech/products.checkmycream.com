<li> Ummmmmm, not sure if I see much difference from foil...</li>
<li> I was worried that this item would take a long time to get here since it was shipped internationally</li>
<li> not green .my understanding was jade is a green stone not worth the price to me...</li>
<li> its super thin and not smooth as I thought it would be.</li>
<li> I got WET glue all over my index finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> used if for just a few minutes and left it out for about 3 hours.</li>
<li> The glue does stay wet longer than putting it on aluminum foil or anything else</li>
<li> , just doesn&#x27;t look like the picture other than it being green and disk shaped.</li>
<li> I like it because it&#x27;s some where to put the glue without making a mess.</li>
<li> Not as green as in the picture but fat delivery</li>
<li> it also wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this was just a piece of jade green colored glass.</li>
<li> I put a few drops on it...</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in getting this.  </li>
<li> and then I put a small Pyrex glass bowl over the stone each time I apply a lash to help the adhesive from drying out even less.  </li>
<li> But it&#x27;s hard to get the glue off the pallet.</li>
<li> I got tired if using paper towel or wax paper</li>
<li> If you wear false lashes, you should get one of these.  </li>
<li> for what it is for, putting on false eyelashes.</li>
<li> When I took it out of the pkg I was afraid it would be cracked or broken, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Sorry I purchased the stone.</li>
<li> N kinda expensive ...</li>
<li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
<li> the glue i use is very expensive.  </li>
<li> i was very disappointed it was a opal color stone</li>

    <li> Not as green as in the picture but fat delivery</li>
    <li> It is a great product to keep the glue from drying out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> This Item is as described... the only thing I will note is that the stone is not polished as the one pictured is... the stone is smooth but appears more like green marble than jade. should work still fine, just doesn&#x27;t look like the picture other than it being green and disk shaped.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  I loved this little product.  Since the lastest craze is indivisual lashes, I wished I had brought more.  I plan to buy more to give as gifts and to have on hand.</li>
    <li> This product is great for super glue drops, easy to clean and great to handle it, must have if you do kits and modeling.</li>
    <li> Does keep glue a bit fresher.  Seems more sanitary.</li>
    <li> keeps the glue from drying out too quick and that&#x27;s what keeps the costs down since the glue i use is very expensive.  I bought two of these.  great product, a must have.</li>
    <li> This comes in so handy.  I got tired if using paper towel or wax paper and it&#x27;s easy clean.  Definitely an essential part of my beauty regimen.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, mines was white not green like the photo but it&#x27;s good to use to prevent the glue from drying too quick.</li>
    <li> Great quality, love it!</li>
    <li> The Jade stone looks cheap its super thin and not smooth as I thought it would be. I don&#x27;t know about this jade stone.</li>
    <li> Nice for my lashes and painting my nails too.</li>
    <li> I got fast delivery but it doesn&#x27;t do what is stated.  I use wax paper instead. Sorry I purchased the stone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to put my glue on it  when I&#x27;m doing lashes but after I&#x27;m done with da glue I can&#x27;t clearn it n reuse it.. N kinda expensive ... It&#x27;s ok not sure if I would buy it again...</li>
    <li> I was worried that this item would take a long time to get here since it was shipped internationally but I got it fairly quickly.  It got to my house about 2 weeks after I ordered and for the cheap price, I would say it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s real jade and exactly what I needed for my eyelash business.  My only regret is not stocking up on more to save on shipping!</li>
    <li> The description says jade, but it&#x27;s not. It feels like plastic. I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this. You will be wasting your money!</li>
    <li> Helps to keep your adhesive from drying out so fast.  I put a drop of adhesive on the stone and then I put a small Pyrex glass bowl over the stone each time I apply a lash to help the adhesive from drying out even less.  I can do both eyes with the one drop and it works great!</li>
    <li> for what it is for, putting on false eyelashes. It works to stop the glue from drying so fast and is noticeably cooler than room temperature. Also works well for applying multiple bindi&#x27;s in different patterns.</li>
    <li> Thank u I reveived it on time and it has a nice material. Useful for my work. For that price it is good enough :)</li>
    <li> the page says that it keeps the glue from drying out so quickly but it dries out just as quick as if it were a piece of plastic. it also wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this was just a piece of jade green colored glass.</li>
    <li> I use this for the glue to my eyelash extensions, when you&#x27;re done the glue comes of easily with no mess.</li>
    <li> This if perfect! Does what it is supposed to do, and it keeps glue off of my table! Easy to clean,</li>
    <li> Ummmmmm, not sure if I see much difference from foil... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s me or not, but I guess for the cheap price,  why not try it out?! Lol!</li>
    <li> Very nice stone, beautiful product and it works very well to prevent the glue from drying too fast.  I like this better than the crystal stones.</li>
    <li> like the color, nice small size,</li>
    <li> The eyelash glue sticks to the stone and you can&#x27;t get it off...</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The glue does stay wet longer than putting it on aluminum foil or anything else I&#x27;ve tried PPutting the glue on.</li>
    <li> Very nice stone. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it&#x27;s very sturdy and worth every penny I paid for it. I plan to use the stone to do my eyelashes this weekend. Thank you for quality merchandise for excellent prices.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this jade stone. It keeps the glue at a cool temperature for hours. I put a few drops on it...used if for just a few minutes and left it out for about 3 hours. When I came back, thinking it would be dry--I flicked it as if to peel it off. I got WET glue all over my index finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought and not green...white color...I don&#x27;t know if it matters</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s some where to put the glue without making a mess. But it&#x27;s hard to get the glue off the pallet.</li>
    <li> It is very smooth and it is actually as advertised.  It is affordable, and although it took a bit longer than I expected to receive, it was worth the wait.  I really recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Great quality just what I needed and will use this for my glue when I do eyelash extensions price was great as well</li>
    <li> This item is a must have for eyelash extensions. I put medical tape over the stone when using glue to keep my stone clean.</li>
    <li> I ignored the 1 star ratings and decided to get the jade stone.  Hoping that when I received it, it would be jade.  Boy was I wrong!  The &amp;#34;jade stone&amp;#34; is NOT jade, but it felt like plastic.  Don&#x27;t waste your money in getting this.  I guess I got what I paid for!</li>
    <li> This does the job, and cleans up nicely! When I took it out of the pkg I was afraid it would be cracked or broken, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this so much. will buy from this company again. The stone keeps glue from drying out just make sure you don&#x27;t have a fan on. LOL</li>
    <li> i was very disappointed it was a opal color stone not green .my understanding was jade is a green stone not worth the price to me...</li>
    <li> If you wear false lashes, you should get one of these.  Easy to use and clean.  I use a toothpick to pick up the glue and apply to the lash.  I also wear both upper and lower lashes.  This is much easier than putting the glue on the back of my hand.</li>
