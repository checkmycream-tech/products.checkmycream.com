### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works perfect!!</li>
      <li>Best product I have ever had in my life.  </li>
      <li>But the product is perfect otherwise.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent product!</li>
      <li>Happy shopping!</li>
      <li>My color is beautiful!!</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find Tressa Watercolors, Crimson Splash has some violet to it to keep the brassiness in check.</li>
      <li>A great product to start using as soon as you have your hair colored.</li>
      <li>Great color depositing shampoo -</li>
      <li>It refreshes the color great.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is a great way to boost your color and keep it fresher longer.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and each time I used it people would ask if I got highlights.</li>
      <li>It made my hair a bright reddish, brown.  </li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s good for the ends</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Lathers well and smells lovely.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it...</li>
      <li>great shampoo that gently pumps up your hair colour .</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The color is probably more &amp;#34;believable&amp;#34; than I was going for.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I use a bleach-based cleanser or a magic eraser sponge.</li>
      <li>i try not to wash my hair more than twice a week</li>
      <li>I have also tried Quantum Riveting Reds shampoo, but I haven&#x27;t had as noticeable results as with the Tressa shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It makes my red hair shiny, sparkly and awesome.  </li>
      <li>Of course, I use a manicure brush and soap after shampooing, and I&#x27;m sure that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect solution and it was exactly what I was looking for -- very affordable and efficient.</li>
      <li>But it is a beautiful red, and it has given my color staying power between salon visits.</li>
      <li>However I do mix it in with a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>I use a sulfate free salon brand shampoo (Alterna)</li>
      <li>If you have red hair and need some way to keep it from fading so fast, this is the best way!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and convenient.  </li>
      <li>That alone is worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast, decent price, and the product does everything it claims to do and more!</li>
      <li>and i always use cool water.</li>
      <li>(Or maybe that was just the color fading, but Riveting Reds shampoo wasn&#x27;t helping as much as the Tressa has.)</li>
      <li>I can not say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>Instead of fading quickly to a pinky color, especially at the ends, my hair has retained its bright hue.</li>
      <li>It is so eye catching and shiny the way your red glistens in the sun after using it.</li>
      <li>It has kept my dyed red hair vibrant and looks almost as bright as it did the day I dyed it.</li>
      <li>It does stain showers and your nails if you don&#x27;t pay 100% attention in cleaning it up right away.</li>
      <li>Holds color very well, but doesn&#x27;t get your hair as clean as you&#x27;d want it.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something bright red, nearly magenta in a color.  </li>
      <li>Watercolors Crimson Splash is absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve found for slowing down the inevitable fading that happens between salon visits.   </li>
      <li>I had a very important event the next day and had to go use Oops Hair Color remover.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really helps keep the right tone in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I have bright red (Rhianna red)</li>
      <li>The amount of color deposited depends upon how long you leave the lather on and how often you shampoo -- so if you want a lot of color, leave it on longer and shampoo more often.</li>
      <li>I sometimes put it on my dry hair and let it sit 15 minites, then rinse it out...which makes my hair even more vibrant!</li>
      <li>I recently dyed my dark brown hair a beautiful cool red.  </li>
      <li>Someone looking for a little boost or just a color tint to play with probably wouldn&#x27;t find the messiness worth it more than a time or two.</li>
      <li>, it is fairly hard to lather--I feel like I have to use a lot to get a good lather.  </li>
      <li>Color-protecting shampoos, even those specifically for redheads, have never made much of a difference when it came to fading.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>I do agree that it really dries my hair out</li>
      <li>I realize that no one cares that much  anymore</li>
      <li>though - it does leave coloring on your scalp, so it&#x27;s important to use just regular shampoo once every 10 days or so.</li>
      <li>It sounds like a lot of maintenance, but it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>for staining mainicures - I have real nails.  </li>
      <li>I have really oily hair</li>
      <li>Does not leave any oily residue, and cleans your hair without stripping it too much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their hair vibrant and fiery!</li>
      <li>Works better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Having recently dyeing my hair bright red after bleaching it, I knew I had to get a red shampoo to help preserve the color.</li>
      <li>I had done red highlights before and noticed that the color faded out super quickly, so I decided to try this shampoo to keep my all over red longer.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not a replacement for regular salon touch ups if, like me, you have a bold line of demarcation.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you don&#x27;t have any allergies.</li>
      <li>Careful for light colored hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up like a normal shampoo.</li>
      <li>I purchased this to keep my newly red hair fresh in between colorings.</li>
      <li>Let it sit on your hair for a few minutes for even more intensity.  </li>
      <li>So, all in all: if you&#x27;re committed to your red, and are willing to jump through hoops to maintain it, then this product is worth the extra care you have to take to use it.</li>
      <li>so you have to watch what you are doing and clean up carefully afterwards.</li>
      <li>I solved this problem by using equal parts Tressa Crimson Red and L&#x27;oreal sulfate free color protectant shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been rocking red hair for about 2 years now and when I first started doing it my hairdresser recommended this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I do feel like this shampoo dries out my hair more than usual, so I&#x27;ve been combining it will additional conditioning.  </li>
      <li>a sheer, visible cherry red if you&#x27;re wearing a clear or light tint.</li>
      <li>When I used it more often than once per week it gave me some small rashes on my scalp.</li>
      <li>The professional beauty supply I buy from use to carry this product which is how I got introduced to it, but has since stop carrying the line completely so now here I am!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use it every day, just when my color is starting to look a little dull and I&#x27;ve been happy with how much color it adds.  </li>
      <li>it  makes your hair feel soft as silk and shines like the sun&lt;br</li>
      <li>so that my hair looks natural.</li>
      <li>The color builds up enough to really notice after 3 or so washes.</li>
      <li>Also, the product label warns that it will stain acrylic nails--it will also tint polished natural nails</li>
      <li>As a hairstylist who has tried everything to maintain my red hair, this Crimson Spash Shampoo really works.  </li>
      <li>but i follow up with a quality conditioner and my hair feels soft after.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really helps keep my dyed red hair from fading.</li>
      <li>It truly helps keep my crimson red streaks vibrant.</li>
      <li>I normally shampoo with a sulfate-free color protecting shampoo (Wella is my current brand)</li>
      <li>Took a week to get my hair back to normal.</li>
      <li>--my natural hair color is pure white (thank you, genetics, I&#x27;m only 40) and the white roots won&#x27;t take even the barest tint.</li>
      <li>It is a little pricey but for anyone with cooler red/brown hair this is worth a try.</li>
      <li>It does not seem to discolor skin or bare nails if you take care to wash your hands thoroughly with bar soap as soon as you&#x27;re done rinsing the lather.  </li>
      <li>so I have access to and only use professional products.</li>
      <li>I have dark brown hair with red highlights and this shampoo definitely keeps the red vibrant longer than other red or color safe shampoos that I have tried.</li>
      <li>I have had vibrant red hair for over a decade, and have tried countless products designed to boost or protect my fragile color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i&#x27;m a natural blonde who just started dying my hair deep violet-red and few months ago. as i&#x27;ve learned, red doesn&#x27;t stick. i try not to wash my hair more than twice a week and i always use cool water. this shampoo has definitely made a noticeable difference in my color retention. now i can just get my roots dyed every 5 weeks and hold off on the all-over color for a lot longer. it does suds up pink but hasn&#x27;t stained me or my white shower tile. it leaves my hair feeling a little dry but i follow up with a quality conditioner and my hair feels soft after. highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair with red highlights and this shampoo definitely keeps the red vibrant longer than other red or color safe shampoos that I have tried. If your hair accidentally stains your close or sheets it washes out.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. Mix with Cocoa for a richer darker auburn and keeps my hair from fading between coloring. When I used it more often than once per week it gave me some small rashes on my scalp. I have very dry skin so beware.</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my dark brown hair a beautiful cool red.  The Tressa has helped maintain the red color and vibrancy.  It is a bit expensive and difficult to lather on it&#x27;s own.  Some have complained that it doesn&#x27;t deposit color evenly, my hunch is that&#x27;s because of it&#x27;s thick texture and lack of lather.  I solved this problem by using equal parts Tressa Crimson Red and L&#x27;oreal sulfate free color protectant shampoo.  I simply blend the two together in my hand and Voila! - I have thick creamy suds covering every strand.  I leave the suds on my head for a few minutes and then condition with Glam Streets Jaw Dropping Red.  I also blend it with equal parts of a deep conditioner before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for staining mainicures - I have real nails.  I use the IBD soak off gel kit at home and it does not stain unless I have a chip at the tip.  My french mani/pedi&#x27;s stay glistening white.  Of course, I use a manicure brush and soap after shampooing, and I&#x27;m sure that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complained about the shampoo staining their bathtubs.  I don&#x27;t have this problem either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while the Tressa is a little drying, the combination of daily conditioning and weekly deep conditioning solves this problem.  It sounds like a lot of maintenance, but it really isn&#x27;t.  Everybody has to shampoo and condition - and I&#x27;ve always used nighttime conditioner or a deep conditioner while couch surfing on the weekend.  It&#x27;s quick, easy and convenient.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is pink! It turned my hair pink! I had a very important event the next day and had to go use Oops Hair Color remover. Awful stuff! Careful for light colored hair.</li>
    <li> Dyed red hair is notoriously difficult to maintain (whether it&#x27;s salon or at-home color). I have had vibrant red hair for over a decade, and have tried countless products designed to boost or protect my fragile color. Color-protecting shampoos, even those specifically for redheads, have never made much of a difference when it came to fading. Watercolors Crimson Splash is absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve found for slowing down the inevitable fading that happens between salon visits.   The pros: product dramatically slows down rate of fade, and helps to maintain a salon-fresh depth of color to everything but my re-growth (see below). That alone is worth the price!  The cons: Crimson Splash stains, badly, so be careful where you spill or drip it. Undiluted product will stain your tub or grout if it sits for very long, and it takes a lot of scrubbing with a bleach-based cleanser to remove it. Also, the product label warns that it will stain acrylic nails--it will also tint polished natural nails a sheer, visible cherry red if you&#x27;re wearing a clear or light tint. It does not seem to discolor skin or bare nails if you take care to wash your hands thoroughly with bar soap as soon as you&#x27;re done rinsing the lather.  My experience with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t touch my re-growth at all--my natural hair color is pure white (thank you, genetics, I&#x27;m only 40) and the white roots won&#x27;t take even the barest tint. So, it&#x27;s good for the ends but it&#x27;s not a replacement for regular salon touch ups if, like me, you have a bold line of demarcation.  So, all in all: if you&#x27;re committed to your red, and are willing to jump through hoops to maintain it, then this product is worth the extra care you have to take to use it. Someone looking for a little boost or just a color tint to play with probably wouldn&#x27;t find the messiness worth it more than a time or two.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helps keep my dyed red hair from fading. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Definitely helped keep the red hue of color between going to the hairstylist.  Works better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product has worked so well for me. It has kept my dyed red hair vibrant and looks almost as bright as it did the day I dyed it. I just add a small amount to my regular shampoo in the palm of my hand everyday when I shampoo and it has worked wonders. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have dark brown hair with deep red in it and this color really helps keep the red from fading. It is so eye catching and shiny the way your red glistens in the sun after using it. It does stain showers and your nails if you don&#x27;t pay 100% attention in cleaning it up right away. Other than that it is a must for keeping up the red in my hair!</li>
    <li> Having recently dyeing my hair bright red after bleaching it, I knew I had to get a red shampoo to help preserve the color. Using this is like getting a touch up every time I was my hair! Instead of fading quickly to a pinky color, especially at the ends, my hair has retained its bright hue. Like some others have stated, this does not produce a foamy lather, but I make it stretch a little farther by mixing it with my regular shampoo. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their hair vibrant and fiery!</li>
    <li> Keeps my red hair from fading!  Best product I have ever had in my life.  Will order always and forever</li>
    <li> Holds color very well, but doesn&#x27;t get your hair as clean as you&#x27;d want it. It doesn&#x27;t lather up like a normal shampoo.</li>
    <li> Loooove this stuff!!! Can&#x27;t have red hair without it!!!! I use after I shampoo and condition I have really oily hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily at all. I let sit on my hair while I bathe or longer if my color has really faded  then rinse off in cold water! Works perfect!!</li>
    <li> A great product to start using as soon as you have your hair colored. The color builds up enough to really notice after 3 or so washes. Be careful if you have allergies though - it does leave coloring on your scalp, so it&#x27;s important to use just regular shampoo once every 10 days or so. But the product is perfect otherwise. Does not leave any oily residue, and cleans your hair without stripping it too much. I highly recommend it if you don&#x27;t have any allergies.</li>
    <li> Works...revitalizes the color between appointments</li>
    <li> Worst color ever...made it looked like I colored my hair with Kool Aid and it stripped all shine from it as well.  Threw it out after using it once.  Took a week to get my hair back to normal.</li>
    <li> I was saddened when L&#x27;Oreal bought Art Tech color shampoos and ruined their formulas especially for reds. I was so happy to find Tressa Watercolors, Crimson Splash has some violet to it to keep the brassiness in check. I use this twice a week to replenish the red.</li>
    <li> great shampoo that gently pumps up your hair colour . it  makes your hair feel soft as silk and shines like the sun&lt;br /&gt; i use several different colours (alternating days) so that my hair looks natural. I realize that no one cares that much  anymore but I do.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this product works! My hair was a faded red/brown and just after one wash, it literally looks like i JUST dyed it! My color is beautiful!! I cannot believe how well my hair grabbed the color! Definitely will buy again! (and it didn&#x27;t stain the tub or skin).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been rocking red hair for about 2 years now and when I first started doing it my hairdresser recommended this shampoo. Now I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it! It keeps my hair from fading and sometimes even gives it an extra boost when I leave it in extra long and shampoo twice. I don&#x27;t notice any sort of &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feel that some shampoos give and no buildup either. If you have red hair and need some way to keep it from fading so fast, this is the best way! Shipping was very fast, decent price, and the product does everything it claims to do and more!</li>
    <li> I have used this product a few times now. The first few times I started using the product on my natural brown hair and using it daily for a couple weeks I had achieved my desired color. This last time, I purchased a temporary red hair color at the store and have been using the shampoo once or twice a week to maintain my desired color. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I haven&#x27;t had issues that others stated about it staining the tub.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my roots or ends bur adds a color punch overall.</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my dark brown hair a dark red (Aveda).  I had done red highlights before and noticed that the color faded out super quickly, so I decided to try this shampoo to keep my all over red longer.  Like other reviewers have said, it is fairly hard to lather--I feel like I have to use a lot to get a good lather.  However, I have noticed that my red is brighter after using it a few times.  I don&#x27;t need to use it every day, just when my color is starting to look a little dull and I&#x27;ve been happy with how much color it adds.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with staining my hands or shower, which I was a little worried about.  I do feel like this shampoo dries out my hair more than usual, so I&#x27;ve been combining it will additional conditioning.  I have also tried Quantum Riveting Reds shampoo, but I haven&#x27;t had as noticeable results as with the Tressa shampoo.  I felt like the Quantum was making my hair look dull and sad.  (Or maybe that was just the color fading, but Riveting Reds shampoo wasn&#x27;t helping as much as the Tressa has.)</li>
    <li> I have brown hair, that was bleached and then had red dye added.  I was looking for something bright red, nearly magenta in a color.  I bought this color based on other reviews, thinking it would be the closest to firey red-magenta I would get without using manic panic.  It made my hair a bright reddish, brown.  The color is probably more &amp;#34;believable&amp;#34; than I was going for.  I wanted something punk rock.  But it is a beautiful red, and it has given my color staying power between salon visits.</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews but this is a product I stand by. I am a licensed cosmotologist so I have access to and only use professional products. This shampoo is a great way to boost your color and keep it fresher longer. The professional beauty supply I buy from use to carry this product which is how I got introduced to it, but has since stop carrying the line completely so now here I am! It is a little pricey but for anyone with cooler red/brown hair this is worth a try. I normally shampoo with a sulfate-free color protecting shampoo (Wella is my current brand) then on my second wash use this shampoo and let it sit a couple minutes. When its time for rinsing I turn the water temp a little cooler as cold water helps to to close down the hair cuticle and maintain color and shine which is especially true when rinsing out conditioner. Hope this helps. Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It truly helps keep my crimson red streaks vibrant. I can go longer between salon visits. I mix 1/2 watercolors and 1/2 my regular shampoo...saves money and I get the lather I want. I sometimes put it on my dry hair and let it sit 15 minites, then rinse it out...which makes my hair even more vibrant! I can not say enough good things about this product. 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as suggested by my hair dresser. It makes my hair look pink when I wash it. I don&#x27;t love it...</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant and each time I used it people would ask if I got highlights. It refreshes the color great. I used it about 1x per week.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing.  I have bright red (Rhianna red) colored hair and use this every other shower.  I use a sulfate free salon brand shampoo (Alterna) then I do a second shampoo with this.  Let it sit on your hair for a few minutes for even more intensity.  I can tell a difference, especially after using it for several months!  It makes my red hair shiny, sparkly and awesome.  I hope they never discontinue this product.  As a hairstylist who has tried everything to maintain my red hair, this Crimson Spash Shampoo really works.  Don&#x27;t count on discount brands (the John Freida color shamp and cond left my hair in knots and felt dirtier than when I went in) to do what this shampoo does!</li>
    <li> This works well as a color refresher, I can go longer between color treatments. However I do mix it in with a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to keep my newly red hair fresh in between colorings. It is an excellent product! I am not a red head at the moment, but I will keep this around for when I go back to it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helps keep the right tone in your hair.  I do agree that it really dries my hair out and I&#x27;ve never had dry hair before but I took the suggestion of another reviewer and today when I applied this I mixed it with my conditioner.  I&#x27;m hoping this helps prevent the dryness.  Otherwise I have no complaints about this shampoo and as long as I remain a redhead I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Great color depositing shampoo - in the dark red shade (rather than an auburn shade). Lathers well and smells lovely. It will stain your hands and shower or bathroom tile so you have to watch what you are doing and clean up carefully afterwards. I use a bleach-based cleanser or a magic eraser sponge. The amount of color deposited depends upon how long you leave the lather on and how often you shampoo -- so if you want a lot of color, leave it on longer and shampoo more often. I tend to leave it on longer but use the shampoo infrequently. It works to keep a little of the red in my dark brown-reddish hair. It&#x27;s the perfect solution and it was exactly what I was looking for -- very affordable and efficient.</li>
