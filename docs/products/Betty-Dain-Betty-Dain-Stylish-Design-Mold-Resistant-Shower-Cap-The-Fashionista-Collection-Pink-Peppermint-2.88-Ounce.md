      <li>Great value for money, solid quality and great colors!</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the kitschy box alone is worth the purchase and is a great nod to a bygone era.</li>
      <li>I have to say I tried them all, but this cap ist by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>

      <li>great product -- really is mold resistant-- I purchased 3!</li>

      <li>most desirable?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheerful and the fit is good and snug so no water gets in.</li>
      <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, cute.  </li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d pay over $3 for a shower cap, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and would buy it again</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>What I like the most is that it is huge!</li>
      <li>That one I bought at a beauty supply store and paid much more than the one I bought through Amazon</li>
      <li>I love the pattern.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>this cover ALL my hair even when I where a tall bun on top of my head.  </li>
      <li>I use it on top of another shower hat for the shower and by itself for washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Elastic holds it&#x27;s shape a pretty good while.</li>
      <li>I needed a new shower cap, and loved the cute retro styling on this.  </li>
      <li>It has kind of a funny inverted cone shape, but maybe you&#x27;re into that.  </li>
      <li>so I can comment on whether or not the mold-resistant design really works, but, for now, I love my peppermint cap!</li>
      <li>but that is to be excepted, but it is generally comfortable.</li>
      <li>Overall it works great and you cant beat the design or the price</li>
      <li>It stays securely in place and keeps all my hair in (and that&#x27;s a lot of work for any shower cap).</li>
      <li>my hair would´t fit</li>
      <li>Very economical, and well made.</li>
      <li>Based on the positive reviews, I was prepared to find the cap perfectly suitable.</li>
      <li>I got this cap to use it for overnight oil treatments, cover my hair first in a disposable plastic bag and then put this on top to sleep on it.</li>
      <li>It is a good quality shower cap but is apparently made for a child&#x27;s&lt;</li>
      <li>The positive reviews were very accurate.</li>
      <li>The material is good so it definitely keeps out water and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I suppose I could clean it with vinegar</li>
      <li>It also dries quickly and does NOT smell so that is obviously a huge selling point.</li>
      <li>Overall good quality.</li>
      <li>thicker than most and seem very well made.  </li>
      <li>so I can angle it however I please depending on if I&#x27;m capping loose hair or a ponytail; it dries quickly with just a flick or two of the wrist; it&#x27;s remarkably comfy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Something that would do the job it&#x27;s supposed to do....and make me look cute at the same time :)</li>
      <li>Especially the close, but nice, fit around my forehead.  </li>
      <li>I used mine to cover my hair overnight for a deep conditioning treatment and it was pretty snug, which is good.  </li>
      <li>These shower caps are large and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>But after dyeing my hair a bright pink, I discovered even tepid water is the enemy of maintaining unnatural color.</li>
      <li>Comfortable, sassy look fashion-wise and high quality!</li>
      <li>Very satisfied overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a shower cap!</li>
      <li>Wide, perfect for long hair.</li>
      <li>This is not just a shower cap, it&#x27;s a very large shower cap.  </li>
      <li>No nasty plastic odor that, yes, would have nostalgically hurled me right back to 1978 bath time...</li>
      <li>i brought this cap in black print version which lasted me a year or so which was pretty good.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>No marks left on my skin, but it keeps the water out for sure.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER it fits a bit funny.</li>
      <li>Every shower cap I got previous was not well constructed or able to fit all my hair in there.</li>
      <li>This shower cap is comfortable (not too tight), durable, mold-resistant, and really cute.</li>
      <li>Large enough to fit !  </li>
      <li>i really like how the cap fits securely and keeps all of my hair dry while still being comfortable without pinching.</li>
      <li>True fit and the Shower Cap keeps your hair dry if you put your hair in a bun.  </li>
      <li>It fits very comfortably and keeps my hair dry.  </li>
      <li>It was now time for my first grownup shower cap to protect my very ungrownup hair...</li>
      <li>Cute, but it won&#x27;t keep your hair dry.</li>
      <li>hot pink stripes are indeed adorable, but it&#x27;s the fact that this works so well that has me sold.</li>
      <li>This looks like it would be a large shower cap.</li>
      <li>But if a person has a large head and lots of hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large enough to hold my mid-back-length hair (which I usually clip on the top of my head before putting on my shower cap), and it does a nice job of keeping water out.  </li>
      <li>Stays firm in place, hair stays dry - so great after blow dries - and it looks cute, so far it looks brand new.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about shower</li>
      <li>This cap is very durable.  </li>
      <li>It really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cap dries fast.</li>
      <li>but it did very well.</li>
      <li>I think this will last for a long time and I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this for my wife. She loves this brand. Very economical, and well made. Elastic holds it&#x27;s shape a pretty good while.</li>
    <li> Sturdier than the throwaway ones and definitely waterproof.  I used mine to cover my hair overnight for a deep conditioning treatment and it was pretty snug, which is good.  It has kind of a funny inverted cone shape, but maybe you&#x27;re into that.  I don&#x27;t know much about shower caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bow on the front is ridiculous and I love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice shower cap. What I like the most is that it is huge! I was afraid my hair would´t fit but it did very well. My only complaint is that the elastic is very tight. I got this cap to use it for overnight oil treatments, cover my hair first in a disposable plastic bag and then put this on top to sleep on it. It was a bit of a mistake because the next morning I had a big red mark on my forehead. I guess that is not what the product is for in the first place, so if you use it for a few minutes during your shower you should be ok. The matrial feels good, there are two plastic layers so it doesn´t feel cheap. Overall good quality.</li>
    <li> I can not use it. My hair gets wet every time I use this shower cap. It has a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; that makes the water to go inside....</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Something that would do the job it&#x27;s supposed to do....and make me look cute at the same time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for days I need to shower without washing my hair. I put this cap on &amp; it truly keeps my hair dry. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Little tight around head..  but it works and does the job!</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d pay over $3 for a shower cap, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  These have held up to everything my kids have thrown at them and still look great!</li>
    <li> i brought this cap in black print version which lasted me a year or so which was pretty good. the elastic eventually stopped holding firmly on my head. I did get another since I did like that the first lasted as long as it did. it&#x27;s plastic and elastic and just can&#x27;t last forever!</li>
    <li> I look like a flapper wearing this shower cap. It&#x27;s cheerful and the fit is good and snug so no water gets in. I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> The 2nd elastic part towards the bottom fits awkwardly and wants to creep down and cover my eyes - I don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s there! I find the edges of my hair still get wet, especially in the back, no matter how low I pull it.</li>
    <li> I love it. Stays firm in place, hair stays dry - so great after blow dries - and it looks cute, so far it looks brand new.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this shower cap.  The first one was awesome but it was time to replace because I&#x27;ve had the same one for awhile.  This time, the cap is super tight and leaves rings around my head after I get out of the shower :(</li>
    <li> Product is well made and roomy.  I use it on top of another shower hat for the shower and by itself for washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I use a shower cap almost every day and this is an excellent one!!!  It fits very comfortably and keeps my hair dry.  I think this will last for a long time and I am very pleased with the purchase.  Especially the close, but nice, fit around my forehead.  No marks left on my skin, but it keeps the water out for sure.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shower cap! Comfortable, sassy look fashion-wise and high quality!</li>
    <li> This looks like it would be a large shower cap. It isn&#x27;t. It is a good quality shower cap but is apparently made for a child&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;head. I would not recommend for an adult woman.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  True fit and the Shower Cap keeps your hair dry if you put your hair in a bun.  The shower cap is snug - the way a shower cap is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Wide, perfect for long hair. Good grip, good quality.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair down past my waist and this is the first cap I&#x27;ve found that comfortably fits all of my hair.  It doesnt slide around.  I have not had the problem of the colors running like some other customers and I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now.</li>
    <li> This cap works great and is very cute.</li>
    <li> great product -- really is mold resistant-- I purchased 3!</li>
    <li> Fits perfect on my head. Plus my hair is long.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and this shower cap does the trick. It holds my hair in and it stays there. It may get a little wet if I&#x27;m not careful enough to put everything in but it&#x27;s just a little. Love this product.</li>
    <li> this cap really is awesome! I hardly ever get my hair wet unless I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t have it on completely</li>
    <li> I wanted a hat that was cute, which this is, but also very effective. It has a large volume cap so if you have long hair that is not an issue. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This cap is very roomy--important for long, thick hair to fit inside it. The band around the head is secure but not overly tight. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, but especially those with lots of hair to tuck up into the cap.</li>
    <li> I color my hair unnatural colors, so I can&#x27;t always wash it because it&#x27;ll fade.  This shower cap is fantastic, fits snugly so water doesn&#x27;t get underneath and is adorable as well! Has a cute little bow in the front that you can&#x27;t really see in the picture.</li>
    <li> Best shower cap I have used to date. Stays on and doesn&#x27;t slide off or onto my eyes. Works like it should.</li>
    <li> the elastic broke after a few weeks</li>
    <li> I needed a new shower cap, and loved the cute retro styling on this.  It&#x27;s large enough to hold my mid-back-length hair (which I usually clip on the top of my head before putting on my shower cap), and it does a nice job of keeping water out.  I&#x27;ll update my review after I&#x27;ve had this longer so I can comment on whether or not the mold-resistant design really works, but, for now, I love my peppermint cap!</li>
    <li> Love it. Is large enough to keep all my hair covered. Does leave an elastic mark but that is to be excepted, but it is generally comfortable.</li>
    <li> The elastic is tight so I don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting it while showering. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Compare to all the millions of shower caps I have purchased this one is the shower cap I have searching for all my life.  You have to try it,</li>
    <li> Not big enough too stretch over my hair when I need room to put all of my hair in it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cap because I needed a quality, sturdy, adult sized shower cap, and I have hair about down to the middle of my back.  This shower cap is comfortable (not too tight), durable, mold-resistant, and really cute.</li>
    <li> These shower caps are large and comfortable.  They&amp;#34;re  thicker than most and seem very well made.  I have had my first one for a very long time.  That one I bought at a beauty supply store and paid much more than the one I bought through Amazon</li>
    <li> Nice product,has a very nice fitting,and it is water resistant&lt;br /&gt;I ll definately purchase again,if I needed another one of this</li>
    <li> I like this, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and would buy it again HOWEVER it fits a bit funny. I have mid-back length hair and put my hair up in a pony tail then put the cap on. It has lots of room for this, but it seems to go down over my forehead and ride up in the back, leaving the very bottom of my hairline to get wet. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if the cap is facing front or any other direction. Overall it works great and you cant beat the design or the price so I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn a shower cap for 30 years, back when my mom would plop one on me to protect my hair from the bubbles and splashing madness of tub time. And as an adult, if the need arose, like any regular person I&#x27;d just raid my collection of hotel freebies.  But after dyeing my hair a bright pink, I discovered even tepid water is the enemy of maintaining unnatural color. It was now time for my first grownup shower cap to protect my very ungrownup hair...and so that I could continue taking the scorching showers my dermatologist advises against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Betty Dain brand was unfamiliar to me but it appeared to be the go-to brand at this price point. Based on the positive reviews, I was prepared to find the cap perfectly suitable. However, I was not expecting to find myself gushing on the Internet about how much I love this thing! It rocks. It really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the kitschy box alone is worth the purchase and is a great nod to a bygone era. Seriously, from the overdone glamour model to the 60s font w/peekaboo window, the Dain design and marketing team need big bonuses. Squeal! Adorable! But beyond wondering what costume I could throw together in order to debut this thing at a party since I feel it demands public consumption, the cap truly fits and functions fantastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It accommodates my thick curly hair with ample room to spare; it fits snugly without binding or leaving marks on my forehead or neck; it stays put so that not even a drop of water seeps through; it&#x27;s very easily adjustable so I can angle it however I please depending on if I&#x27;m capping loose hair or a ponytail; it dries quickly with just a flick or two of the wrist; it&#x27;s remarkably comfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most desirable? It doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;stink\\&quot;! No nasty plastic odor that, yes, would have nostalgically hurled me right back to 1978 bath time...but as we all now know is not the healthiest scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot pink stripes are indeed adorable, but it&#x27;s the fact that this works so well that has me sold.

    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, cute.  Haven&#x27;t had it long so we&#x27;ll see if it molds.  There is a lot of material, it could probably be a little smaller.</li>
    <li> This cap is perfect!  Holds snug to your head, but not too tight.  Easy to care for at a great price</li>
    <li> Is not tight fitting enough</li>
    <li> I have to say I tried them all, but this cap ist by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.  Hefits snug so my hair won&#x27;t get wet, its also the perfect size, the quality is very good.</li>
    <li> Great value for money, solid quality and great colors! Very satisfied overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a shower cap!</li>
    <li> It is too small. It might be a medium.  But if a person has a large head and lots of hair It won&#x27;t  work. I am back using the old one and shopping for a bigger one at  beauty supply  stores.</li>
    <li> I was so tired of the cheap plastic shower caps that sort of kept my hair dry on days I didn&#x27;t wash it. I read different reviews for different shower caps and found many positive reviews for this item. The positive reviews were very accurate. This item is high quality and keeps my hair dry. It stays securely in place and keeps all my hair in (and that&#x27;s a lot of work for any shower cap). The cap is cute which is a nice touch. It also dries quickly and does NOT smell so that is obviously a huge selling point. I highly recommend this product. I will never go back to the plastic drug store or hotel shower caps!</li>
    <li> Makes you look chic while you shower, I was looking for one of these and found it! love the look!</li>
    <li> Large enough to fit !  Loved it!</li>
    <li> ... but there are  people in our family with long  hair.  they  don&#x27;t want to wash it twice a day --and in the summer, we shower  often.  these are plenty big enough and stay put.  and no mold so far.  we should probably give them 5 stars; but like I said, we hate shower  caps!</li>
    <li> Cute, but it won&#x27;t keep your hair dry. I&#x27;ve been dealing with that by wrapping my hair up in a microfiber Buff to keep it dry.  Then it started to smell - a very weird smell.  Cleaning it several times did not work.  I&#x27;m going back to ugly, disposal, cheap shower caps.</li>
    <li> Still using the shower cap everyday since purchase. Well made, hair stays completely dry for my large head.</li>
    <li> This shower cap reeks, I thought it was mold resistant, but apparently it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying this product and recommend not getting it.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I think the free ones from hotels are the best ones. This still smelled moldy even after I threw it in the wash. I suppose I could clean it with vinegar but I can&#x27;t be bothered.</li>
    <li> This is not just a shower cap, it&#x27;s a very large shower cap.  I&#x27;m Puerto Rican and I have long thick hair.  I couldn&#x27;t find a shower cap anywhere to hold my hair.  I was buying extra large caps in beauty supply stores but when I would put them on my head, my hair would stick out all over.  this cover ALL my hair even when I where a tall bun on top of my head.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It really is a good size so all you long haired beauties, go ahead and purchase and smile when you shower because all your hair really will be covered and stay dry.</li>
    <li> Every shower cap I got previous was not well constructed or able to fit all my hair in there. This shower cap fits the bill.  Definitely a great purchase and nicely done.  The material is good so it definitely keeps out water and comfortable.</li>
    <li> BRAVO!  MY DREAM SHOWER CAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ORDERED ANOTHER ONCE BEFORE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DESIGNS RE SO  UPBEAT&lt;br /&gt;THE HEAD HOLD ELASTIC IS FIRM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS WELL PACKAGED IN A OLORFUL BOX&lt;br /&gt;CHEERS FOR THIS VENDOR!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the pattern. The cap dries fast. The ribbon is not color-fast and it&#x27;s color will bleed when wet.</li>
    <li> Too small.  Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> It is definitely great for long thick hair that doesn&#x27;t stay up on other shower caps</li>
    <li> i really like how the cap fits securely and keeps all of my hair dry while still being comfortable without pinching.</li>
    <li> I got tired of the flimsy plastic ones and thought I&#x27;d try this.  It&#x27;s very thick and large but it works!</li>
    <li> REALLY GOOD SHOWER CAP....IS BIG ENOUGH FOR MY MEDIUM LENGTH HAIR &amp; STAYS TIGHT ENOUGH TO KEEP WATER OUT OF MY HAIR &amp; IT IS SO CUTE TOO. I ALWAYS BUY BETTY DAIN SHOWER CAPS.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick hair, and the free shower caps from hotels can&#x27;t fit it all in, plus they don&#x27;t hold up very long. These shower caps are awesome! The material is sturdy and water-proof and large enough to fit a big pile of hair clipped up with a claw-style hair clip. The elastic holds the cap snugly around my face without being constricting. It even stayed in place on my 6-year-old daughter&#x27;s head. I highly recommend these for women who don&#x27;t want to wash their hair every time they take a shower.</li>
    <li> Good quality shower cap. Just as described.</li>
    <li> This cap is very durable.  It fits really snugly so my hair does not get wet at all.  So far so good!</li>
