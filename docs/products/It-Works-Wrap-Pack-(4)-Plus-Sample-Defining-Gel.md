<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its ok works a little. Not like they say it does though. Definitely not a 1 time use result. Need to use at least 3 to see anything.</li>
    <li> It seems like some people got outstanding fesults, i actually didnt see any. I used a wrap every 72hours like directed with defining gel on days i dont use wraps and saw nothing.</li>
    <li> So excited but All I can say is. NO RESULTS!!! what a waste of money..just another scam to add to the list.</li>
    <li> To expensive not much results</li>
    <li> My husband and I order this and It did not work for us. I fallow all the instructions an nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Will not order again. Sorry</li>
    <li> It Works Global, the company that created and markets the Ultimate Body Applicator, SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS distributors from selling their products on Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist as well as other places such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Body Applicator is made with ALL NATURAL ingredients and has a shelf life. When items are ordered through these venues, by sellers who are violating company policies, there is no guarantee as to the purchase or expiration date(s) of the product. In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature. There is no guarantee as to where the seller obtained the items or how they were stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, is that our company is designed to provide ongoing support. We are a team - a FAMILY. When someone purchases through me, I guide them EVERY step of the way. If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself (I&#x27;ve done it on the phone and via text as well). I will explain the ingredients, the way the product is supposed to be applied, the way the product is designed to work, the way the product may affect the body, what to expect from the Ultimate Body Applicator after 1st application (1/4 of a FULL treatment) and what they need to do to have the GREATEST success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR INSTANCE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID YOU KNOW that one wrap (the item being sold here) is actually ¼ of a FULL treatment? A full treatment is a box of FOUR (4) wraps. This seller has either opened the box and is now selling the wraps individually or has bought individual wraps from someone else. Who knows! Also DID YOU KNOW that the list price of $99 shown here is actually the list price for the ENTIRE BOX (4 wraps) and not EACH wrap? DID YOU KNOW that the wrap continues to work for 72 hours after you put it on? DID YOU KNOW that you need to drink LOTS of water while wearing it, (preferably) before wearing the wrap and during the 72 hours it continues to work? Half your body weight in ounces is the right amount. DID YOU KNOW that you are supposed to measure in 3 places before, after and then in 72 hours after applying the wrap to track your results better? DID YOU KNOW it is highly recommended you take BEFORE and AFTER pictures because they help track your progress? DID YOU KNOW that you cannot have any lotions on before wrapping? Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping? ALL these things AND MORE I address with my clients BEFORE, DURING and AFTER wrapping them because I follow the company&#x27;s policies and my clients have tremendous success!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE don&#x27;t let the practices of someone violating company policies STOP you from becoming HEALTHY and having the body of your dreams in the process. PLEASE friend me on FB. I have tons of before and after pictures (some of myself) which I will share with you. There is tons of information on my page which I update daily. I will give you tips. You get my cell phone, email, Facebook (English and Spanish) whatever it takes for me to help you on the road to better HEALTH and a BEAUTIFUL looking you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I rated the Ultimate Body Applicator 5 STARS because IT IS a 5 STAR product regardless of it being sold against company policies :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPANY WEBSITE: wrapspa.myitworks.com&lt;br /&gt;FACEBOOK: facebook.com/wrap.spa&lt;br /&gt;FACEBOOK (Espanol): facebook.com/WrapSpaEspanol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful :Dbody weight in ounces is the right amount.

    <li> Did everything right. I just had a baby and I&#x27;m exercising, dieting, EVERYTHING. This only gets rid of water weight which isn&#x27;t going to last more than a few hours (days if you&#x27;re lucky. Not worth the money you can get these results by putting plastic wrap around your section for an hour!</li>
    <li> It Works wraps really works.  I was impressed with this product.  I have signed up as a loyal customer and will continue to use the wraps on a regular basis until I reach the results that I want.</li>
    <li> I have a few of these, these never worked for me.</li>
    <li> I received everthing I ordered, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I know people that it has worked for, guess it just didn&#x27;t like me or something.. Just watsed dinero! ;)</li>
    <li> If you want to tighten your skin a little for a day then go ahead and spend the money - this product doesn&#x27;t work any more than all the other wraps out there - save your money.</li>
    <li> First off, I am an It Works distributor. Naturally I know the wraps work, have seen results on myself and would not have signed up to sell if I didn&#x27;t think it worked. With that being said, it frustrates me to see people who are getting the wraps poorly packaged, expired, dried up, etc. The wraps DO work but in order to be guaranteed fresh products you must purchase from an It Works distributor. On top of that, I provide detailed instructions to my customers so they can get the most out of their wraps. Also, this wrap/defining gel package is only $59 if you purchase through a distributor at the loyal customer price. If you have any other questions you can email me directly ellzeywraps@gmail.com.</li>
    <li> The smell is hideous and it really doesn&#x27;t work. Perhaps, it may work for other people but it didn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
    <li> Illegal to sell in here! Get ahold if me www.jellybean.myitworks.com that is where you but it without these scams of over priced product.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to a T and it did not work at all.  I did not notice any difference</li>
    <li> It was a waste of money.  I did not see any results at all.  I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about losing inches.  What a joke.</li>
    <li> You all need to know how the product works. How to use for the best results.  Also these products sold here maybe expired if interested contact me. http://sassi12001.myitworks.com</li>
    <li> This product does shrink you waist a bit but then but only temporarily. It has nothing to do with your diet or exercise. The minty tingling only tightens the skin for a day or so but eventually the skin will go back to the original shape. Don&#x27;t buy this product. The same minty tingling formula that&#x27;s in this product is in other products that are used to target cellulite and so far they are temporary fixes. Just eat healthy and get some cardio at least 30 min a day and you&#x27;ll get better results than this over priced product.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again and would recommend it to a friend or relative.  Made me feel wonderful and special.</li>
    <li> Just like different people get different results with supplements or medications (I.E. my dad had to try 4 different blood pressure medications before finding one that worked for him), everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to the botanicals in the wrap. It&#x27;s not a scam at all, and if you study the ingredients they are all proven in the naturopathic community. Some people see amazing results, some people quit before they have a chance to get results. I didn&#x27;t see results with my first wrap either. But I did with my second and continued to see them from there on out, not every wrap, but very gradually. I do believe that some people&#x27;s systems are very resistant, and there isn&#x27;t rhyme or reason as to why, but I also know people who are immune to the effects of different supplements and medications (I even have a friend who got an epidural and it did not work, how often does that happen? There wasn&#x27;t a solid explanation for it, her doctors just told her her body was immune, and she would just have to deal with the pain for her future pregnancies. Weird...). But trying one wrap really isn&#x27;t going to prove anything because it&#x27;s only a partial treatment, and lots of people don&#x27;t keep going if they don&#x27;t see an amazing change with one wrap, but rather assume nothing happened. Anyway, obviously I&#x27;m a rep, not trying to sell you but if you want to know about them, research the ingredients and make your decision based on the ingredients and what they are known for. THAT is what you are putting on your body and what is absorbed by your skin. I looked up every botanical ingredient and made a visual for quick reference on what they are known for, view it and read more information about them at my website [...] or look it up and see the ingredients at [...] People love to say the results are temporary, but I&#x27;ve gone months without wrapping and the changes stick. The skin healing has no reason to reverse itself, but the fat cell shrinkage will slowly return, but not fully until anywhere from 3-6 months (depending on your diet) if you aren&#x27;t wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to order, know that this seller is not authorized to sell these products on Amazon, as it is against company policy. Find an independent distributor (like me!) and order through them so you can have the customer service and instruction that you need.</li>
    <li> Product easy to use but I didn&#x27;t  notice any changes to body.</li>
    <li> I used all of 4 wraps and saw no different. ...I think it was a waste of my money!!!!no more wraps.:&#x27;(</li>
    <li> worked well  Used all the wraps and felt that I looked better.  Did not use the cream yet the wraps had enough on them.</li>
    <li> great product helps tighten tone and firm and makes you loose inches the defining gel helps increase the effects !</li>
    <li> Items arrived as indicated. After using the first wrap I can say I felt the tingling and tightening of the skin, but I did not see much change in inches after completing the use of all four applications. Instead I purchased the Gel which has worked much better and the price is extremely acceptable and much cheaper than four wraps. Otherwise the service and time of shipment was great.</li>
    <li> Crystal,  I am sorry to hear your husband did not see results.  I would say buying off of amazon is not the way to go because you are notgoingto eat the support you would of you bought it from an actual distributor.  There are many things that a distributor would share with you to help you maximize.  It is important to do it every 72 hours as recommended.  It is important to drink plenty of water. Plus the amount of time you wear matters.  Buying off amazon means you will get a great product without any reference point for how to maximize your results.  In fact this is why the company does not want their product sold on sites like Amazon.  If you want to try this I strongly encourage you to buy direct from a distributor.  The wraps work.  Everyone&#x27;s body will respond differently but if you use it as the company intends they will work.</li>
    <li> This does not work...the lotion tingles, but it does nothing...feels like the cold-tingly of bengay muscle cream.&lt;br /&gt;No weight-loss, no tightened skin, this was a HUGE waste of money. NOT recommended....At all.</li>
    <li> Sweet success!  When they say it works they mean what they say. It works!  Recommend wearing a compression garment over wrap to get best results.</li>
    <li> Awesome product best i have ever tried nothing has ever worked like this for me its the best just as someone else had said everyone is differnt something may work great for u and not for another im one of those people i have tried just about everything on the market i dont even bother anymore i have never seen success in any of them at all :( of course i had to try this after seeing results for my self on friends i have done 3 wraps total with 8\\&quot; lost Awesome product best i have ever tried nothing has ever worked like this for me its the best just as someone else had said everyone is differnt something may work great for u and not for another im one of those people i have tried just about everything on the market i dont even bother anymore i have never seen success in any of them at all :( of course i had to try this after seeing results for my self on friends i have done 3 wraps total with 8\\&quot; lost pure body fat cant get enough of these products just wish they didnt cost so much. i have only bought form distributers myself thought i would review product bc i love it best to&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on 2 hrs&lt;br /&gt;Drink ur weight in water&lt;br /&gt;Dont eat suger while detoxing&lt;br /&gt;Give 3 days for finall results&lt;br /&gt;Best to take pics instead of measure at times bc u might not measure eact spots as before thinking u are and if one dont work try at least 1 more before u give up my aunts first warp didnt seem like it did a thing measure said 1\\&quot; lost her second wrap much better could actuall see better results with 3\\&quot; lost that was for 1 under arm she tried</li>
    <li> You can get these for a lot less money if you order through a distributor for it works, and when ordering through a distributor then you also know the product is not expired or tampered with. If you want to know more about the ultimate body applicator feel free to email me rodriguezdavismyitworks@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I have no doubt that It Works products work but it is illegal for these distributors or customers to sell these products on Amazon.com, Ebay, Craigslist, etc - My sister sells these products... Please visit her website at [...] to get these products MUCH cheaper and without supporting illegal practices. God bless everyone but the people who are doing this is just wrong and they know this is not acceptable in any instance as they provide training materials and set specific guidelines for distributors. Either way, my sister will be happy to serve you and do it the right way... The IT WORKS WAY :-)</li>
    <li> I tried this product for over two month period and didn&#x27;t see any progress at all. It took two people to help get it applied.</li>
    <li> did not do anything for me and I left it on all night long and didn&#x27;t notice any change ugg</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.. I have for kids and my skin has Stretched I used all for wraps and took the b4 and after pics. I seen NO results. I even used the defining gel. If you are a plus size woman with skin that has stretched do not wast your money! And on top of all that it BURNS, it hurt also 45min is not long enough I was told at least 3hours! I was so excited to do this but after I was so disappointed . I drank all the water I needed to and ate healty. And still didn&#x27;t work! And the shipping was horrible. They put it in a bag not even a little box. When I got the wraps it was bent, folded just not how you want your package to show up. And also the shipping took forever..... It way work for others but for sure not for stretched or saggy skin. And I did this around my midsection.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I think these type of things would ever work!  Did not expect any drastic changes but I saw nothing happening with this.</li>
    <li> BIG WASTE OF MONEY....DOES NOT WORK.. WHEN I TRY TO CANCEL I WAS TOLD WELL IT DOESN&#x27;T ALWAYS WORK ON CERTAIN BODY TYPES. OKAY WELL MAYBE THAT IS TRUE BUT I KNOW OF FOUR DIFFERANT PEOPLE WHO TRIED IT FOR AT LEAST A MONTH AND IT DOES NOT WORK</li>
    <li> I tried this product, followed directions, and it did not work.  I took pictures and everything.  My advice is go to a cosmetic center and talk to them if you are unhappy.  Micro Needles are avl to help with streach marks, and dr.&#x27;s can suck fat out of you.  I should have known better.  Just like diet pills, there is no easy fix!</li>
    <li> i bought it hoping this would help me threw my diet and exercise i did not see any results PLZ PLZ PLZ do not waste ur money on this product!!! ABSOLUTELY NO RESULTS.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything. It was messy, plastic wrapping myself to hold the thing on was funny though. i do not recommend</li>
    <li> Yes these wraps really work! Make sure you drink half of your body weight in ounces of water the day you wrap(200 lbs.\2 &#x3D; 100 oz water a day or 100oz/16.9oz &#x3D; 6 water bottles a day for example)and three days following for max results. Leave wrap on overnight when you sleep wrapping Saran Wrap over it and around you to keep it on when you sleep up to 8 hrs for max results. Use four wraps(1pack). Buy from independent distributors to ensure no phony products. Visit my It Works! Site WrapsByRe.com to get a box of four wraps for $59 by becoming a loyal customer which entitles you to all of our great naturally-based supplements at loyal customer prices. Read about our other great products on my site. Use Thermofit and Fat Fighters for even more results along with your wraps. Keep wrapping it away and good luck. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product serves no purpose... I should have used vicks on wrapped myself in plastic wrap .. I want a refund plus $100 for waisting my time....</li>
    <li> This wrap and defining gel did not work as stated in the description.  This pack was a waste of money.</li>

    <li> I saw no difference whatsoever,  I did not like this product at all, I could of been doin it wrong , I don&#x27;t know how , but am willing to give benefit of doubt .</li>
    <li> The wraps go on with a warm sensation that leads you to believe it&#x27;s going to work. I tried this product for about a month without any changes. Advice is not to waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love! I used The Greens for a month to cleanse, then Thermofit for a month and then I used wraps for the last month and had Amazing Results! :) my distributor is so caring, involved and works with me for my progress. She will walk you threw your fitness journey. She loves what she does! Checkk her out www.annandamanda.myitworks.com</li>
    <li> I used it and it does not work it&#x27;s just a rip off the best way is to eat a sensible diet and exercise there is not fat fighter pill that will take away all the fat you eat.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Please make sure you take a picture of yourself before you try it. I took a picture in shorts and a workout top and I also measured my self. when I took the wrap off; I notice that I  lost some inches and I look forward o loosing more in the next  several days as well. Make sure you drink a lot of water during and after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen many fascinating testimonies on Instagram and decided to try it.  I did all 4 sessions and haven&#x27;t noticed any results</li>
    <li> After arguing with my girlfriend about not getting this I got it for her and she was so excited. Sadly this bull crap did not work and she realized she&#x27;d have to do things the old fashion way... Don&#x27;t but it, an expensive box of plastic wrap.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Didnt work at all, it dosnt work for everyone and my advice buy 1 1st if it works then buy another. Don&#x27;t do packs without knowing. Didnt work for me on 45 mins or 8hrs long. Waste of money</li>
    <li> This is a good product if is used correctly. You can get it at a lower price directly from a distributor. The page is [...]</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions, drank all the required water, and lost not one inch. I cannot recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> I was told these are being illegally sold on amazon by a certified consultant. No results....waste of money!! Do not recommend!!</li>
    <li> It did not work at all, waste if money, followed to the letter and exercise and duet and saw no change</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product; but honestly it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.... I didn&#x27;t see any change and I left it longer than the directions said.... I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> I lost several inches off of my waist by using IT WORKS. The results weren&#x27;t as dramatic as promised but I definitely saw results, which has made me very happy.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars only because its not even been 24 hrs yet, and they say its actively working for 72 hours. So I will re-update the final results of the first wrap later. BUT, I gave it 3 stars also because i measured before and after, and the biggest measurements in the middle of my belly button shrunk by little over 1 inch and a half, almost 2 inches. Also touching my tummy and the sides, it feels smaller, and more firm. It definitely shrunk, I didnt take photos but for the 2ns wrap I intend to. I&#x27;m happy with the result so far, I will be using the defining gel twice a day like recommended, and I cant wait to do the 2nd wrap. I feel pretty good, I didnt get a rash or anything because I&#x27;m not allergic to the ingredients. People complained about it burning or a rash....well GENIUS that means you are allergic to something IN the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I would like to point out for those who it didnt work for and call it a scam. Its NOT a scam, if you know anything about nutrition and health, then you should know how this works, if not then I will tell you. This is basically a strong body DETOX. You are STUPID for thinking that you can eat greasy foods, and pig out, or eating steaks, and other high fatty foods, or thinks high in cholesterol etc. Eggs are ok,but in moderation. My point is, that in order to PROPERLY detox your body and be healthy, you have to have a healthy diet, healthy eating habits, and some exercise or activity would boost or help the process. Now the wraps claim some people see results after 45 minutes, the reason being is because it may be that the PERSON doing the wraps doesnt have alot of garbage, or toxicity in their body. If it DOESNT work for you at all, then that means your body is very toxic, and unhealthy INSIDE, and you maybe need to chance something in your lifestyle in order for this to really work. Drinking water is important, but you dont need to drink gallons. 45 minutes the first time wearing the wrap to see if your skin can handle it, then after the 1st wrap you can leave the rest of the wraps on longer if you&#x27;re alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps some of you understand, I am not a distributor and selling this. I am just SMART, and most of this is common sense. I exercise, and I dont eat pork at ALL, I only eat beef maybe twice or once a month. I eat chicken like normal, and lots of fish. I eat alot of greens: kale,lettuce,celery,spinach,brussels,broccoli, etc. I eat fruits in the morning as my breakfast,or cerealI drink a glass of water in the morning when I wake up to wake up my bodys organs and get started. Lunch is a chicken cesar salad, or a veggie sandwich with humus. Something light, no side dishes with it, and I drink water or vitamin water. Dinner I eat like normal, fish tacos/shredded chicken tacos/ceviche tostadas/spaghetti(marinara)/rice-veggies and salmon or catfish....etc. Nothing too greasy or heavy, and I  make sure to eat before 8pm. Once a month I will eat pizza, or have some kind of cheat meal. But it doesnt kill me if I dont eat that stuff regularly, I used to eat unhealthy like that,and would eat the greasy food next door to my job (i work in hospitals,and sometimes do ER shifts), it was the easiest to just eat whatever because I was too tired or busy. But it became unhealthy, and I noticed my body was reacting badly after awhile. So for almost a year now I changed my eating, and I exercise more, I run with my dog alot and he has a backpack harness and we go for 2 or 4 mile jogs. He loves it, and its good motivation for me. So bottom line is the wrap worked well for me, there was a change and some tummy shrinkage, but I attribute it to my healthier lifestyle that helped it as well. Good luck to you all!handle it, then after the 1st wrap you can leave the rest of the wraps on longer if you&#x27;re alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps some of you understand, I am not a distributor and selling this.

    <li> This is a very good product! I saw results after the first wrap. I lost 1.5&amp;#34; during the first and second wrap. I haven&#x27;t used the other two wraps yet, but I love my results so far! Drinking lots of water is incredibly important for these wraps to work! I also really like the Defining Gel! I definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> This has been on amazon for over a year. I could only imagine how they are stored or how old they are. If your not getting your wraps either directly from It Works Global or someone like me (distributor) then there is really no telling what your getting. This is the reason It Works has  policy of products not being sold on amazon/ebay/craigslist, etc. Wouldn&#x27;t you rather discuss your needs with a consultant and know you are getting the best product and information? I&#x27;d love to talk with you. Don&#x27;t overpay for OLD product that no longer works. let me guide you to a tightened toned and firmer you... workitphay. myitworks</li>
    <li> i have been using these wraps for a while now and they seem to help with stretch marks and bloat</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all. My husband did it for 2 weeks and don&#x27;t see any results. It&#x27;s a scam!!! Do not waste your money on this product. It&#x27;s not the sellers fault they don&#x27;t know about results.</li>
    <li> This is nothing but a joke and gimmick to get others to buy the product.  I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone.  Save your $$.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever tried. It is one of the biggest scams out there. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!! I spent over $500 on multiple products and nothing helped. These wraps are &amp;#34;temporary&amp;#34; and only tighten your skin for a short period of time. They do not help you lose weight at all. I was lied to and cheated.  There is no magic wrap, or pill or drink that will help you lose weight and inches. As long as you eat right and exercise you will be fine. The people who promote these wraps are scam artists. They trick you into buying the product, but to get the special price you&#x27;re offering you have to be a member for at least 3 months with auto ship. It is a complete waste of money and these products did not help me one bit. I refuse to let anyone I know try these. They are honestly terrible. And I am very upset.</li>

    <li> On the first use I got one inch off my waist but the 2nd, 3rd and 4th application it didn&#x27;t take any inches off.  It was a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> I am a very skeptical person, so hearing about a body wrap made me think that this was probably an unhealthy way to lose weight. However, I still gave it a shot-- bought it for like 25 bucks from a distributor and I lost 10 lbs! I also drank a lot of matcha green tea and worked out like crazy but let me tell you, this stuff works! I think psychologically putting on the wraps served as a reminder to live a healthy, happy life style and I ended up getting my life in check. The same company also sells other wellness products for the skin, food, etc. that said it also depends on the distributor you buy it from,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I heard that distributors cannot sell through third parties as they sometimes get expired, etc.  I bought mine directly from a distributor... skinny4ever.myitworks.com/shop (no endorsement!)  and you can get a discount and the fab wrap is only 7 bucks</li>
    <li> I put on the wrap for about an hour for the first time, measured before and after, and 1 inch was off my belly. The gel that came with it did nothing for me, thus the 4 stars. I will def purchase more and this product is a boost to anyone who is working out and on a healthy diet.&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe that it will make me slim all by itself, but it has won me over by my first one inch loss at my problem area. I highly recommend it and am happy I gave it a try!!</li>

    <li> Great product and opportunity to sign up as a loyal customer or distributor for big discounts at www.coachslaton.myitworks.com</li>
    <li> I followed instructions to the T &amp; It did not work for me....Let me note that I am very fit &amp; exercise 3-4x a week ,along with eating well. I wasn&#x27;t using this to loose weight , I purchased this in hopes to tighten my tummy skin a bit after pregnancy.  My skin was noticeably softer &amp; I may have shed a little water weight but it didn&#x27;t tighten the skin at all.</li>
    <li> ill give it one star because i didnt see no difference my sister said it did work for her but i didnt see no difference ...;(</li>
    <li> Wraps were ok I lost 4 inches on my tummy even tho I didn&#x27;t do what I was supposed to do I still lost defining gel was the best would Def buy again</li>
    <li> The wraps are hard to do yourself so if you have someone else do them for you and seran wrap over the wrap and leave it there 45 mins or all night i have lost a few inches from this and skin feelings amazing. its a great product</li>
    <li> There was no defining gel like it said in the product.  I paid for everything that was listed not just the wraps.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received this with a SAMPLE.5 fl oz of GEL.&lt;br /&gt;That should have been more clear in the title. DON&#x27;T be fooled like I was!&lt;br /&gt;The wraps sell for 59 through the company and 99 retail.</li>
    <li> The product me made me really nauseous. I could hardly drink any water. on top of that i did not lose any inches and felt bloated afterwards. not sure why though i remeasured and seemed to have gained an inch i guess to being bloated (hmmm...not good) anyway even though i paid only $30 for the single wrap it still feels like a waste...</li>
    <li> As a former woman struggling with her weight, I have tried all sorts of body wraps at spas, etc for countless hours and for around $125 per session. Instead, I have started to use the ItWorks body wraps and have done detoxed while on the wraps and it has helped me so so much. I put on a wrap, drink water and detox juice for the entire day and the following two days I eat light meals with a lot of water (3L) and green tea (to boost the metabolism). I also get plenty of rest and sleep while on the body wraps and have worked out with the body wrap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy from skinny4ever.myitworks.com/shop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been so amazing! DIY body wraps and detoxing are the best way to go and show actual results</li>
    <li> Absolutely NO results. Have done 4 wraps, 3 on stomach, 1 cut in half and used on arms. All were worn overnight. There was a tightening of my skin that lasted a few days, but no inch loss what so ever. VERY disappointing. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is just cosmetic does not work....read my blog to learn how to get healthy from the inside out www.plexusdrink.net</li>
    <li> I was very, very hesitant to try these when a girl from my work starting selling them, much less sign up for a \\&quot;loyal customer\\&quot; program! Asking around, this company has actually been in business for over 20+ years. How would they be able to stay in business if it doesn&#x27;t work, right? The first wrap I purchased, I took a shower, put it on, and put a bunch of saran wrap on, drank a Diet Coke then off to bed I went! Yep, NO results! I decided to give it another try because my mom (WHO IS 60!!) said she used to do them and they worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second go around I showered, put it on, and used a lot of saran wrap AGAIN. This time, I drank water and ate pretty decent and BAM I had to pee every 15 minutes! I left it on for 8 hours while I slept as  you can use it for 12 hours and I lost 2 inches! Now granted, you aren&#x27;t going to have results if you continue to drink soda, eat like crap, and don&#x27;t follow the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be a LOYAL customer to ITWORKS! So far for me it&#x27;s been permanent results but Ive also given up soda. Every person is different though..</li>
    <li> Almost impossible to apply by self,and trying to keep wrap in place while putting ceran wrap around was extremely difficult! Did not like the wraps shapes, expected them to be strips like other wraps I tried...and after all that work little results...only thing I noticed was stretch marks that I have on my inner thigh seemed to have disappeared some.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work the fiance and I both tried it and we taped ourselves.  We did what it told us too twice and taped ourselves again and no chance.  This was a waste of $100.</li>
    <li> I bought from this seller thinking I was getting a deal receiving both the wraps and defining gel for the asking price.  It took two weeks for me to recieve the Wraps alone.  I soon came to realize after waiting another two weeks that I have been scammed - paying double the price for one box of wraps alone and NEVER receiving the Defining gel.</li>
    <li> Like I said this isn&#x27;t a miracle product its a detox and the perk is that while getting detoxed 9 out of 10 people loose inches...  I read these comments and laugh because people just don&#x27;t get it so I thought I would enlighten you guys ;-)..  I tried it and I love it, I lost a little more than 3 inches. I wish I would have took pictures, but honestly I doubted the product at first I was just looking to get a good detox and I got both a good detox and lost the little tummy I had.... OVERALL IM A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER ;-)</li>
    <li> Plain and simple.... DIDN&#x27;T WORK! It was a waste of money and my time... I not only drink a lot of water but I exercise as well and after 4 wraps its showed no sign of tightening or improving my stomach. It did help reduce the appearance of my stretch marks but not by a whole lot. I am disappointed with this product!</li>
    <li> Love it works bc it really does work! Immediate results, love the brand shipped quick and I am a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I could feel the burn when applied but I saw no results. Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
    <li> Lost a inch around wait, will use the others to see what results I get, so far so, good.</li>
    <li> Too expensive and I Wasn&#x27;t too impressed  with the results.  It was wet cold and just plastic with cream on it I wasn&#x27;t impressed at  all  did not lose any inches  Not enough in the package and it wasn&#x27;t reusable should be more in the pack for that high price.  I did not see any changes</li>
    <li> I love these. I took a picture before instead of measuring. After using the first 4, I took another one and didn&#x27;t put them side to side because I hadn&#x27;t seen a difference. A few days later I thought, oh what the heck. So I put them side to side and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. They&#x27;re called \\&quot;It Works\\&quot; for a reason. Buying more right now.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the defining gel. It was was a .05 ounce what the hell is anyone supposed to do with that? I had to order a bigger bottle to be fully satisfied. Other than that joke of a bottle this product works but i recommend working out while using this product. I saw results by the second wrap</li>
    <li> These came just as described- I&#x27;ve heard some say they were dried out and these were not. They do shrink the waist, but even with exercise and eating right, the results are not overly long lasting.  But if you are looking for something for today (looking good for a wedding or something), it is a great product.  The gel, on the other hand, is sooo nice.  It works quickly (but like the wraps, the result isn&#x27;t as long lasting as I hoped).</li>
    <li> I lost 2 inches after the first applicator, but didn&#x27;t really see anymore results after that. I did receive the product on time. Would I buy this again? Doubt it, this prices have gone up.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, it worked!  No, it did not take off 3-5&amp;#34; inches or anything crazy.  But that annoying &amp;#34;fat lip&amp;#34; right under my belly button -- it disappeared after TWO wraps.  I used the wraps right before my wedding, to smooth my stomach. And YES, it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give only 3 stars, because its expensive. And 3 months later, my little fat lip is back.  So you have to keep using the wraps to keep the smooth stomach.  And I gave only 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t miraculously make me &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; or take away inches.  It simply smoothed my stomach and made my roll/fat lip go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you have a vacation or big event coming up -- go for it! Use all 4, and it should work great!</li>
    <li> I received the product on time. Two out of the four wraps I got were dry. There was hardly any \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; on the wrap itself. I feel like I got ripped off for what I paid for four of them.</li>
    <li> not that impressed, messy and slippery, not easy to use.  I feel like the slimy consistacy is gross. yuck. not thrilled. much prefer a cream that you can rub on then use your own sliming belt or wrap. better effect that way.</li>
    <li> was absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a rip off product!</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> I felt I could see effects right away, my skin seemed tighter. When you had it on it was very cooling and comfortable. I used the wraps and the defining gel.</li>
    <li> I order It Works Wrap pack that also included defining gel. But the problem i had was that they did not send the Defining Gel.</li>
    <li> i have a friend that sells it works product and she is legit. she told me you guys wasnt supposed to sell this online.. and you should stop it. because u guys selling expired product. so dont buy this online. find a dealer or go to it works website and thats legit one .</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t have any results from it</li>
    <li> i decided to try these to see if they worked.  My friends and I kept seeing these amazing results.  we wondered if they were photoshopped...  So I jumped in and decided that I would try it first.  After my first wrap I bloated...  I was 2 inches bigger then my first measurement...  YIKES!  I did not know what to think.. But I said I would gives these an honest try. So I kept up with it. I Followded the instructions. I tried to eat healthy, and I drank my water! (key!)  Next day, I was DOWN 2 inches from my ORiginal Measurements!!  I was soo happy I stuck with it. I have now finished 4 wraps, and I am down 5 inches above my belly button and 4 inches below.  I like this product so much that I became a distributer. :D HAPPY HAPPY!  My sister just finished her first wrap and she is down 6 INCHES!  Shows how different people can get different results.  I am thrilled.  She is THrilled!!  If you want to try these you should order from a distributer, if you order on amazon you are not guaranteed freshness. You don&#x27;t know how long these have  been sitting around. email me at Olivianjeremie@hotmail.com  or you can go to my web site..[...]</li>
    <li> I have heard so many amazing things and seen pictures of results.  Either someone is really great at photoshop, or this product just doesn&#x27;t like my body.  I noticed no difference at all</li>
    <li> Earlier this month I gave a review on some of these awesome products so here I go again but this time I have copy/paste on my side :-)...I just want to say that I use several products from It Works and really like them especially since they&#x27;re all made from natural ingredients. A key way to use the wraps, that I&#x27;ve learned, which led to me losing 40lbs, tightening and toning my skin, and helping with stretch marks is to take a shower and exfoliate prior to wrapping to open your pores so that it works better. Also, you can leave it on longer than 45mins, even over night while you sleep, but another big tip is to take pictures to really see results and changes. Of course you need to drink water to cleanse your body because the wrap detoxify your fat cells and you need water to flush the toxins out of your system. Stay away from alot of sodium while you do it also because sodium causes your body to absorb the water and not flush the toxins.&lt;br /&gt;The defining gel that enhances the wrap results and diminishes the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite even more. The fat fighter is awesome too. You can just get a package and join their loyal customer program for free and get half of the price. Hope this helps others like it helped me&lt;br /&gt;I found it cheaper and easier to just order it from this website.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;*The loyal customer program is great but you have to start your order and join at checkout to get all the savings for your first order and the savings are great plus you get perk points toward free products</li>
    <li> I Used This Product Exactly As Instructed, And Did Every Thing I Was Suppose To.....And Nothing. Not An Inch Gone. Total Waste Of Money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, did everything supposed to do, followed directions to a tee... Don&#x27;t waste your money on this seems like a scam</li>
    <li> It seems that a lot of the people that have bought the wraps off amazon are complaining that they don&#x27;t work. Probably because they&#x27;re Expired!!! You should not purchase them off any other site besides the IT WORKS website they have the products that are.New and have not been sitting. Ordering from amazon you don&#x27;t where the wraps are coming from or if they&#x27;re expired or not. Ordering from the real distributor website will get you better QUALITY. You will also learn more about the product you&#x27;re purchasing amazon doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the product.</li>
    <li> This pack is one of our BEST SELLING PACKS!  The products do work!! Think twice about ordering off sites like this. It is against It Works policies to sell here so you are most likely buying from an ex-distributor looking to unload old products. The most you should pay for this package is $109 as a loyal customer. To become a loyal customer you make one purchase a month of ANY dollar amount for two months after your initial purchase. After that you can come and go as you please and get wholesale pricing for life (up to 50% off) on ALL of our products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to my website thisreallyworks.myitworks.com&lt;br /&gt;Have questions?

    <li> Item didn&#x27;t work for me. :(&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to buy the product again I think that my $99.00 should be reimnumburst.</li>
    <li> Do not buy these products off eBay or Amazon! Generally the people selling them are distributors who gave up on this Biz or people who did not follow the entire instructions!! For best results you should order directly from an it works rep!! If you have any questions or are interested in trying products that are not out dated!! You can reach me at [...]</li>
    <li> Legit sellers or not, it&#x27;s just a fantasy to believe that a wrap (plus defining gel) are going to do what this product claims.  It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> A few of my friends were talking about the wraps and how awesome they were and the inches they lost within 24 hours, so I was like well heck yeah I want to try this! I am a mother of 2 little ones and I have the stretched out lower belly plus the stretch marks to prove it! I bought the 4 wraps and the defining gel and was super excited when it arrived. I followed the directions as was advised and after 10 hours I remeasured myself and I had already lost an inch! I was really looking forward to what 72 hours was gonna look like! Well at the 36 hour mark the lotion side of the applicator was starting to smell wierd and it did not have anymore lotion on it so I took it off and rubbed the rest of the lotion that was still on my skin in like it says to. About 6 hours later I remeasured myself after I put the defining gel on and I had already GAINED my inch back. To make things worse, before I went to bed last night I had already gained another 1/2 inch. So I call my friends today to see what they did that I did not do, and it turns out they were spending hours at the gym everyday and was on strict diets and an herbal diet supplement. Wow. I should have known better to think that there was this \\&quot;magic wrap\\&quot; that would magically remove my mommy fat! Please take my advice, do not spend your money on this. The only sure fire way to lose weight is diet and exercise, like has been preached about for years and years. This was 80 something dollars I can never get back, so PLEASE do not make the mistake I did.</li>
    <li> The wrap did not work for me I&#x27;m very UN happy and I did everything I was supposed to I&#x27;m truely unsatisfied;(</li>
    <li> Product was old and didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
    <li> I like this product,cause no diet pills and it&#x27;s great for belly fat,arm flabs,chins up,thigh flabs,just keep plenty of saran wrap in stock,wear it doing your housework,watching football..</li>
    <li> This product is a scam, don&#x27;t waste your money on it! I had been looking for a detoxifying wrap and felt absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> The wraps are not large enough. There is not enough cream on the wraps. No real significant changes in inches lost.</li>

    <li> Absolutely amazing results with the body applicators and the defining gel. Although this is a sample size of defining gel.

You save 40% off of retail as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points). They have many great products so it&#x27;s worth it. Shop around first before spending too much.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Never saw any difference like everyone is raving about. Wish it would have worked but I guess it&#x27;s just not for me</li>
    <li> Its an ok product.doesn&#x27;t work nearly as fast as everyone I know is saying. I probably wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product again.</li>
    <li> That by purchasing something in a tube bottle, you would send it over in something hard, not a flimsy package that is going to be thrown around and maybe be under something heavy.&lt;br /&gt;My product came in SOAKED in the defining gel...which has nothing in it by the way. My carton from the Wrap pack were soaked through and sticky from the gel!!! I mean..what the heck?!&lt;br /&gt;Now, im left with NO gel at all.. I&#x27;m still waiting for the seller to reply back to me about a refund or a replacement! I didnt spend this much for just the wraps. I want this settled.</li>
    <li> The applicators really work. It was a litte strange at first, yet once you get in the habit of using them...it becomes second nature. As a member of the military I wanted to try a product that was not a paste or a clay and did not want to wind up in a day spa wrapped like a mummy for an hour in the attempt to lose inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using the applicators (can&#x27;t recall how many) I saw a results with my clothes being loose and lower numbers on the scale. Drinking water and using an applicator every 72 hours brings on very good results. If you can stand being wrapped over night that will also enhances the effectiveness of the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** HOWEVER *** and no dig to the product...yet when you do not keep up with a healthly diet and some exercise the lost inches find their way back :(.</li>
    <li> This is false advertising. Maybe it takes water weight off for a day but nothing major. I&#x27;m not overweight but wanted to try this on tummy fat and wasn&#x27;t impressed ...don&#x27;t waste money on this</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money I asked for a refund after I used the wrap twice and got 1/4 of the amount I paid for it.  I got all over my clothes didn&#x27;t stay on and the smell gave me a headache.</li>
    <li> I received product on schedule, which I was very excited about.  I tried it out the first day.  Took measurements in all the places around my stomach... waited the 45 minutes.  I thought it was working because I felt this cold tingle sensation.  Drank the water like advised, and measured myself again.  NO INCHES LOST, not even half an inch.  Kept on drinking water for the next 72 hours and used the defining gel, measured myself again, and still NO INCHES LOST.  I kept on telling myself, wow I must have a lot of detoxing to do.  So after I used all 4 wraps, each 72 hours from each other, I have not seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other friends said they lost a few inches, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said not for everyone.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE !!!! I have still yet to receive my package and it was due to be here on Friday it&#x27;s Sunday and I have yet to see a ups truck or any one deliver my stuff I very unhappy and feeling ripped off ... Do t order from here I would have been better off ordering off the real site</li>
    <li> I love this product, it  really works!! Lost 2 dress sizes after using 4 wraps. Using defining gel but it&#x27;s still in working process..lol</li>
    <li> Have only had product for two weeks but i have seen a slight difference with both products, more so water weight lost with wraps.</li>
    <li> very excited to receive my wrap, I put it on for 45 mins no change I was very disappointed. Woke up the next morning did my measurements and was surprised to see that I had lost a half inch in the upper abs, 1 inch in the midsection and 1 inch in the lower abs. I think the reason I didn&#x27;t lose a full inch in the upper abs is because I didn&#x27;t have the saran wrap tight enough and it kept sliding down. Very excited.</li>
    <li> I received the product right on time and it came as described; however, it did not work for me I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected. I don&#x27;t recommend paying that price for the product. I really thought it was going to work but it might work for others.</li>
    <li> I rate this product 4 stars...&lt;br /&gt;This product really worked for me although everyone&#x27;s body does not work the same...</li>
    <li> I tried this after seeing alot of before and after pictures from my distributor.&lt;br /&gt;I did all four wraps, 72 hours apart. I drank 90 ounces of water.&lt;br /&gt;I did not lose one inch. When I asked the distributor, she said they don&#x27;t guarantee results and it wasn&#x27;t meant for weight loss, but for toning and firming the skin.&lt;br /&gt;News flash....if it tightens and firms, you would lose an inch.&lt;br /&gt;I lost nothing but money.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it contains BHT, which is banned in most countries.</li>
    <li> I really do recommend this wraps. They do work plus price was awesome. I know that it said that you don&#x27;t have to diet or exercise to see results true, but if you really want to loss weight and your serious  then this product helps even more to reach you goal faster. I notice a lot of results after this box. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I heard of the wrap a little over a year ago and thought I could work. It took my over 6 months to finally purchase to only be disappointed! Not only does it tell you to drink lots of water, but gives you so many restrictions. I took my before and after pics, had my husband measure me just to be sure, and kept the wrap on for 5 hours! I drank more than enough water and by the time I took it off I felt dizzy ( that could be because I kept it for so long). But even after all that I did not get ANY result! I still have 3 wraps left and give them one last try so that money was not wasted, but if I dont see any dramatic result, not only will I not purchase again but advice every one I know interested not to buy!</li>
    <li> It Works products are not supposed to be sold on Amazon Craigslist ETC. If you want fresh products and a distributor who knows how to use them and can sign you up at up to HALF the cost www.CourtneyH,myitworks.com</li>
    <li> the amount of gel was minimal , did not last long&lt;br /&gt;the results was ok but not spectacular&lt;br /&gt;it was easy to use</li>
    <li> Before I used this product I made sure I edcated my self... First of all your supposed to drink lots of water ( half your body weight ) No Caffeine No Alcohol. Depending on your body type.. some people bloat because of all those nasty toxins in your body. Drink more water.. Lots of it. You cant expect on application to work the first time... especially if you eat unhealthy and arent active. This wrap helps tone firm and tighten skin... on top of that loose weight doing a full treatment the correct way... I was a size 16 and now a size 12 within three weeks. Its call dedication and the reality of it is you have to commit. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you ... your not doing something right. And you know it. Quit blaming the product, blame yourself. If you have any questions. Email me: Myriam.perez713@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Myri perez . My it works . Com</li>
    <li> Nope, this thing should be called &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34;. I should have figured it was too good to be true, but hey a girl can dream...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, really no effect whatsoever, a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product along with the fatfighters and I saw amazing results I have been body wrapping for 6 months and I love how my body has transformed! with a healthy diet and proper exercise all I did was boost my results! This product sold for a Loyal customer Price direct from It Works is $69 for 1- box is 1 full treatment and the product is fresh not dried up!

    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me other than offer a tingling sensation.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> OMG! In 10 days of using these wraps, I had lost 5 lbs from 2 wraps!!&lt;br /&gt;This Website showed me How To Wrap for Maximum results!!- Samanthawilliamitw.wix.com/skinnywrap&lt;br /&gt;I bought a membership &amp; got 4 wraps for much cheaper too!</li>
    <li> I followed the EXACT directions. Drank more water than suggested, and nothing. I am now on wrap three, and STILL NOTHING. Dont waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> this is my first review ever. I tend to base my decision on feedback to see if I really want to buy the product or not. Well first off everybody bodies are different. You have to try the product yourself. You don&#x27;t know how others applied it or whether they were consistent with it. And you have to remember with anything it takes time and commitment it doesn&#x27;t happen over night. My experience with this was fun. I applied it like described I left it on for more than 45 mins I took it off and I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference but hey it was only my first wrap. But the next day I woke up I notice my stomach a lot firmer even my husband said they same thing. Tomorrow I am putting the wrap on again and I am so excited. I also use the gel as well and it helps a lot. I had a kid and my belly became loose with stretch marks I see a difference already and it&#x27;s my first wrap. I have 3 more wraps to go. I&#x27;m excited I bought it and will continue until I reach my goal. Also remember you have to eat right and exercise if you want to achieve your goal and most importantly drink plenty of water. I will give more feedback a as the weeks go by.</li>
    <li> great product.  affordable and good to purchase for its use.  works great.  if you would like to order more, i recommend that you please visit to order more real, authenticated brand: bodyrefinings.myitworks.com</li>
    <li> So far I have use three of the wraps and the defining gel. I was disappointed that I see very little difference in my abdominal area. However I did use the last wrap on my double chin and noticed an improvement. I can not say I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product because I have seen it work on others and I will more than likely give it another try.</li>
    <li> I followed directions and saw no difference. I measured myself before and after no difference. It was a waste of a $100 but learned exercise and healthy eating the only true weight loss plan</li>
    <li> I love the wraps!! I lost 3 inches in 45 minutes!!! It kinda tingled alittle but not unbearable! I gave it 4 stars because i didnt recieve the sample gel! I had to order that separate! Witch kinda sucked lol but over all they work GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Did not like this product. It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I did exactly what the direction said didn&#x27;t really see any different. Even took a picture and clearly no different. Totally a waste of money. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> So far I have used two wraps and drank tons of water..watched my eating/drinking habits as I had been advised to and nothing at all happened, except for the slight burning affect I felt while wearing it..not one inch change! I feel I have wasted my time and money on this product! I sure hope it has a money back guarantee...as I feel I over paid, what with shipping and US border charges, I am completely unhappy!!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions...sorry I have to say it did not work for me at all.  I would like my money back.</li>
    <li> Used two wraps no difference I lost 30 lbs my tummy area is flabby wanted to firm it up cost too much for no results will not recommend or buy again sit ups here I come</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in skin quality and my inches around my waist did not change. It was easy to use, but not effective.</li>
    <li> I have tried other similar products but I think that this product provides better results.  I will not switch again.</li>
    <li> works well with stunning results after the firs use of the wrap shocking results after the second use etc etc</li>
    <li> The wraps didn&#x27;t do anything to the areas I wrapped. Zero inches lost!!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Eat healthy and work out!!</li>
    <li> I should know better...........these things never deliver the promises they declare. I would not recommend this product to anyone, not even my enemies.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference!  Smells really bad!</li>
    <li> I received the product a little over a week ago and did my first wrap yesterday. My inches started off 34\\&quot; under breast it went to  33\\&quot; after the 45 minutes and then to 32\\&quot; the next day. Around the belly button it at the beginning i measured 38\\&quot; and went to 36\\&quot; after the 45 mins, I then measured around the hips and went from 39\\&quot; to 38\\&quot; after the 45 mins. so far after 1 wrap I lost 5 inches in all. It does work well so far and have 3 more wraps to do so hopefully it works out well for the other 3 as well.</li>
    <li> You can purchase a box of 4 wraps for $59 through an It Works Distributor. It is against compliance to sell on Amazon, Craigslist, etc.  I have seen so many comments of people receiving expired or damaged products and not to mention, when purchasing through a distributor you could receive a distributors wholesale price without becoming a representative or distributor.  I&#x27;ve you&#x27;d like to learn more about our pricing, feel free to message Stacy at truevitalityitworks.com. This is where you will find current information about It Works products.</li>
    <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!!!! DONT WORK</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and as described. The product however did not work for me</li>
    <li> The ItWorks products are great, but buying on Amazon craigslist and ebay lead to customers receiving old expired products! Only purchase from an independent itworks distributor! All my loyal customers get the REAL deal products for the right price, mamacoco.myitworks.com</li>
