### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>To get the best from this product, use it twice a day; morning under your moisturizer and makeup and at night before bed under your moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I have now achieved a perfect blend to my skin(face).</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>I have vitiligo and this works great to hide the spots</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product!  </li>
      <li>Works surprisingly well.  </li>
      <li>Its a good  thing</li>
      <li>With that said, while I&#x27;ve used this for just about one week, it seems to do a fair job covering my lighter spots on my face.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Currently I am able to use just the chromelin without foundation/coverup...luck!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product, used it at bed time, and woke up to amazing results.</li>
      <li>great job done, thank you very  much.</li>
      <li>Use a Qtip, works much better and gives you much more control.  </li>
      <li>This product is just okay.  </li>
      <li>The one spot that did change was more orange than tan.</li>
      <li>Until there&#x27;s a cure or a more permanent solution, I&#x27;ll continue to use this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not what I wanted</li>
      <li>I covered my lip better with an all-day stay on lipstick.</li>
      <li>I am a light skinned Vitiligo survivor &amp; have found diluting with alcohol</li>
      <li>It does minimize the color difference from the light vitiligo skin to the pigmented skin on my face.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it&#x27;s not bad, so I can add touch ups here</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the only available stain!!  </li>
      <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve found so far for helping to tint the skin on my chin and around my mouth that was completely bleached of all color because of a plastic surgeon going too deep with a chemical peel.</li>
      <li>Not anywhere close to being worth what they are charging.  </li>
      <li>Chromelin is far from perfect, but unfortunately it is the best the industry has to offer other than stage makeup.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying it directly from the company now - and it came with a new applicator option which allows for more precise placement.  </li>
      <li>I can use less cover-up on my spots, which is good.</li>
      <li>So, overall, I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
      <li>One of my spots turned darker, but most of them stayed white.</li>
      <li>When I first used this product it seemed like it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s average at best and certainly not worth the price I paid.  </li>
      <li>This really helped.  </li>
      <li>I have vitiligo on my hands and legs and the hands are what I really try to cover up.  </li>
      <li>It did not work very well.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t blend in very well and in some spots</li>
      <li>The color is not a natural shade, it&#x27;s like a light organish brown.</li>
      <li>The applicator which is attached to the cap lets too much solution on to the skin so that it darkens the normal skin areas around the lighter areas which you are trying to dye.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten the same results with tanning lotion (though not as quickly).  </li>
      <li>Had high hopes for this but just makes your skin orange.</li>
      <li>You have to master the use of the wand/applicator, it is not hard.</li>
      <li>my only advice is to only use the liquid precisely on your spot with either the applicator or Q tip.</li>
      <li>Chromelin Complexion blender is clear so you can&#x27;t see if you put more on one section of your skin which could cause an uneven complexion look.  </li>
      <li>Also, the dye doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the older product which is no longer available called Dye-o-derm.</li>
      <li>The so-called blender goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t tint anything.  </li>
      <li>It is very difficult to get a good match to the normal skin color.</li>
      <li>my white patches are mainly on my face in the back of my neck</li>

<li> my white patches are mainly on my face in the back of my neck</li>
<li> Used a 1/2&amp;#34; flat makeup brush to apply rather than bottle cap applicator.  </li>
<li> Product would be easier to use if the liquid had a slight color rather than clear, so you can tell where it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
<li> It takes  a little getting used to as far as applying it</li>
<li> not near for cover vitiligo.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how it will work for me on a long term basis.  </li>
<li> I have used from high end very expensive make up down to the cheap stuff, and for me it is a very trying experience, especially due to sweating, I still buy the waterproof(HA!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not near the product that DY-O-DERM was!</li>
<li> product because Chromelin is clear &amp; it is difficult to see where &amp; how much you applied.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that during shipping the container leaked and a considerable amount leaked out.  </li>
<li> I  was diagnosed with vitiligo after the birth of my second child,I used steroid creams for many years and they seem to help but a very stressful event in my life,activated my vitiligo terribly.</li>
<li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that this very small bottle of Chromelin Complexion Blender, at such a high price, was not completely full; something that made me very angry, but I need to buy it because I have vitiligo</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> I have no idea for other skin colours/tones.</li>
<li> I have used it once because I still have some of my other product to finish.</li>
<li> I noticed that my skin would darken after a few hours and it would last a few days.  </li>
<li> This product is invisible so it&#x27;s hard to see if you put it on correctly until it develops a while later.  </li>
<li> The product I used for years to mask vitiligo was tinted a greenish color and you used water to weaken it if it was too dark.  </li>
<li> This was a complete game changer for me.</li>
<li> This item gets the job done but with it being clear instead of the (green) color that DY-O-DERM made makes it hard to know what spots you&#x27;ve applied it to!</li>
<li> buy a few</li>
<li> Pls don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> You must put a few coats on to see the colour on your skin, again, be patient.</li>
<li> I look in the mirror and see my eyes now - not the weird configurations of my white spots.</li>
<li> Also it takes a few hours for it to blend, the DY-O-DERM colored as soon as it was applied!</li>
<li> I did think it was a bit pricey for the small bottle.</li>
<li> I chose 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll like it.  </li>
<li> As someone who suffers from vitiligo and have a medium skin tone, I always had the issue of having my skin look bronze or &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; when I used self tanning lotions because of the natural darker color of my skin.  </li>
<li> these are hard areas to cover with makeup.</li>
<li> Try it for at least a month before you say it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> Although the shade is not a perfect match - it makes my spots 80% less noticeable and it doesn&#x27;t wash off or rub onto my clothes or itch or cause a rash!  </li>
<li> I hate powder) and mix up a few very small batches of colour and do test areas.</li>
<li> So sad.</li>
<li> This product has been a game changer for me!  </li>
<li> Too expensive.</li>
<li> Also the costs is outrageous!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It does minimize the color difference from the light vitiligo skin to the pigmented skin on my face. I can use less cover-up on my spots, which is good.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  I  was diagnosed with vitiligo after the birth of my second child,I used steroid creams for many years and they seem to help but a very stressful event in my life,activated my vitiligo terribly. my white patches are mainly on my face in the back of my neck these are hard areas to cover with makeup. I ordered this product, used it at bed time, and woke up to amazing results. my only advice is to only use the liquid precisely on your spot with either the applicator or Q tip.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product it seemed like it didn&#x27;t work. Be patient. It is NOT an immediate reaction to ones skin. I have vitiligo and that&#x27;s why I use it. You have to master the use of the wand/applicator, it is not hard. You must put a few coats on to see the colour on your skin, again, be patient. Its a good  thing it is a bit progressive, that way one doesn&#x27;t OVER colour themselves. I have now achieved a perfect blend to my skin(face). I have not used it anywhere else, just my face. My face vitiligo only bothers me. I have used from high end very expensive make up down to the cheap stuff, and for me it is a very trying experience, especially due to sweating, I still buy the waterproof(HA! yeah right)colour stay stuff. A helpful makeup tip...buy a few colours(I use liquid...I hate powder) and mix up a few very small batches of colour and do test areas. I am Caucasian and tan at the hint of sunlight. I have no idea for other skin colours/tones. Hopes this helps. Currently I am able to use just the chromelin without foundation/coverup...luck!</li>
    <li> Product worked as described.  Lasts longer than self tanner, but a bit more difficult to use and apply evenly.  Used a 1/2&amp;#34; flat makeup brush to apply rather than bottle cap applicator.  Product would be easier to use if the liquid had a slight color rather than clear, so you can tell where it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
    <li> As described. Will order again</li>
    <li> I chose 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll like it.  The product I used for years to mask vitiligo was tinted a greenish color and you used water to weaken it if it was too dark.  It also stayed the color you painted it on.  Chromelin Complexion blender is clear so you can&#x27;t see if you put more on one section of your skin which could cause an uneven complexion look.  Also, they recommend putting it on at night because it takes several hours to develop the finished color.  I don&#x27;t know how it will work for me on a long term basis.  I have used it once because I still have some of my other product to finish.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found so far for helping to tint the skin on my chin and around my mouth that was completely bleached of all color because of a plastic surgeon going too deep with a chemical peel. Suggestion: To get the best from this product, use it twice a day; morning under your moisturizer and makeup and at night before bed under your moisturizer.  Let the Chromelin set a while before applying moisturizer.  Try it for at least a month before you say it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Total garbage. Week. It takes countless coats. Nothing like dy-o-derm.</li>
    <li> great job done, thank you very  much.</li>
    <li> Not anywhere close to being worth what they are charging.  I didn&#x27;t have any streaks, but so what.  It&#x27;s average at best and certainly not worth the price I paid.  Skip this one.</li>
    <li> I have vitiligo and bought this product hoping it would help some of the areas.  It didn&#x27;t blend in very well and in some spots didn&#x27;t cover it all.  This is probably not the fault of the product but just the vitiligo.  I did think it was a bit pricey for the small bottle.</li>
    <li> This product has several problems. It is very difficult to get a good match to the normal skin color. The applicator which is attached to the cap lets too much solution on to the skin so that it darkens the normal skin areas around the lighter areas which you are trying to dye.  This results in a bull&#x27;s-eye appearance. Also, the dye doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the older product which is no longer available called Dye-o-derm.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this but just makes your skin orange. So sad.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well.  As someone who suffers from vitiligo and have a medium skin tone, I always had the issue of having my skin look bronze or &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; when I used self tanning lotions because of the natural darker color of my skin.  This really helped.  I have vitiligo on my hands and legs and the hands are what I really try to cover up.  Fortunately, it&#x27;s not bad, so I can add touch ups here and there and this product helped.  I noticed that my skin would darken after a few hours and it would last a few days.  So, overall, I&#x27;m pleased.  Until there&#x27;s a cure or a more permanent solution, I&#x27;ll continue to use this.</li>
    <li> It did not work very well. One of my spots turned darker, but most of them stayed white. The one spot that did change was more orange than tan. Also, you can not use this around your eyes which is where I have a lot of white areas.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay.  I have gotten the same results with tanning lotion (though not as quickly).  The applicator is a joke.  Use a Qtip, works much better and gives you much more control.  Tanning lotion is a lot cheaper.  Probably won&#x27;t buy this again.  Too expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  It takes  a little getting used to as far as applying it but I am thankful there is something out there to hide the white spots.  The only complaint I have is that during shipping the container leaked and a considerable amount leaked out.  I wrote the seller about this but never even got a response.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from Vitiligo for over 20 years and have tried every coverup product under the sun - including microskin, concealers and instant bronzers. This product has been a game changer for me!  I look in the mirror and see my eyes now - not the weird configurations of my white spots. Although the shade is not a perfect match - it makes my spots 80% less noticeable and it doesn&#x27;t wash off or rub onto my clothes or itch or cause a rash!  This was a complete game changer for me. I&#x27;m buying it directly from the company now - and it came with a new applicator option which allows for more precise placement.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This item gets the job done but with it being clear instead of the (green) color that DY-O-DERM made makes it hard to know what spots you&#x27;ve applied it to! Also it takes a few hours for it to blend, the DY-O-DERM colored as soon as it was applied! Also the costs is outrageous! A 4 fluid oz. bottle of DY-O-DERM did cost anywhere from $19-$27 a bottle! A 1 fluid oz. bottle of the Chromelin is $29-$38. It&#x27;s not near the product that DY-O-DERM was! They need to bring that product back on the market!</li>
    <li> I have vitiligo and this works great to hide the spots</li>
    <li> not near for cover vitiligo.  I am still looking for Dy-O-Derm (Galderm Laboratories item cover up my wife&#x27;s white skin</li>
    <li> but it&#x27;s not dyoderm!! I wish they would bring dyoderm back.  This product is invisible so it&#x27;s hard to see if you put it on correctly until it develops a while later.  The color is not a natural shade, it&#x27;s like a light organish brown. It&#x27;s ok but not what I wanted</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that this very small bottle of Chromelin Complexion Blender, at such a high price, was not completely full; something that made me very angry, but I need to buy it because I have vitiligo and it&#x27;s the only available stain!!  With that said, while I&#x27;ve used this for just about one week, it seems to do a fair job covering my lighter spots on my face.  I hope that with longer use, it will improve the coverage on my face.</li>
    <li> awful,,,,,not what I ordered, I ordered Dy o derm,,,,,,,,,</li>
    <li> Chromelin is not a cure &amp; it takes trial &amp; practice to get it to work for you. I am a light skinned Vitiligo survivor &amp; have found diluting with alcohol gives me a tint which matches my skin tone. I use 3 parts alcohol to 1 part chromelin. I also add a tint from a &amp;#34;fake bake&amp;#34; product because Chromelin is clear &amp; it is difficult to see where &amp; how much you applied. Using an artists paintbrush gives me control over applying to areas you don&#x27;t want it applied to. Once applied... thats it. There is no reversing what it looks like in 24 hours. Chromelin is far from perfect, but unfortunately it is the best the industry has to offer other than stage makeup. It is pricey which is why i bought from here.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! And it actually works</li>
    <li> Pls don&#x27;t waste your money.  The so-called blender goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t tint anything.  I covered my lip better with an all-day stay on lipstick.</li>
