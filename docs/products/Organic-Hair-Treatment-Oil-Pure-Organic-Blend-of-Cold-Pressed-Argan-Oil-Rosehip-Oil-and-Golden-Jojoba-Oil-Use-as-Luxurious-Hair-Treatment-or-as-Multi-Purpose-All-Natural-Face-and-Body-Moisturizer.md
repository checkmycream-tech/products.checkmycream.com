<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Luxurious Hair Treatment Serum by TEDDIE Organics and I cannot believe how wonderfully soft, silky and bouncy my hair is. I love TEDDIE Organics, I have several of their products and they work great, so I knew I would the hair treatment serum. I was fortunate to receive the hair treatment serum at a special price in exchange I would test it out and provide you will my honest feedback. Well, not only can I tell you how wonderful this product is, I can show you. I took some pictures of my hair after it has been treated using the serum and you see for yourself how healthy and shiny my hair looks. This serum is a combination of Pure Argan oil, Rosehip Seed oil and Jojoba oil which to me is the hair trifecta!</li>
    <li> The three main ingredients (jojoba, argan and rosehip seed oil) caught my attention and I just had to get my hands on this bottle while it was on a promotion, so I can share my experience and opinion regarding this product. I have polynesian hair (long, thick and medium coarse) and I need professional hair care products to ensure my hair is healthy. This hair treatment has done wonders on my hair. I put this on while my hair is still damp and let it sit overnight as a leave in conditioner. My hair feels very soft and looks shiny without the greasy look. I love this product and my hair loves it as well. I truly recommend that you add this to your hair regimen :)</li>
    <li> I am letting my hair grow out and have found that the longer it gets, the more prone the ends are to splitting.  When I was given the chance to purchase this at a discount to test for quality, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the packaging as soon as I opened the box.  In addition to the safety seal, the lid is sealed with tape to prevent any leakage during shipping.  More than once I have ordered oils and they have spilled out during transit.  The bottle is nice size, 4 oz., and uses a dropper dispensing system.  This product is a combination of three oils and only takes a few drops each time you use it.  This bottle will last a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the scent is kind of earthy for my liking so I use it as a treatment before washing and conditioning my hair twice a week.  It takes about 8 drops to coat my hair, as it is fairly long.  I massage it through, focusing on the ends and then put my hair up in a warm towel for 20 minutes.  While you wait, you may as well do a facial and have your own spa day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then wash and condition my hair as usual.  I have done this treatment twice a week for two weeks and have found that the ends of my hair are not splitting nearly as bad.  I&#x27;m anxious to see what my stylist says about the quality of my hair during my next visit with her.  I rated this product 4 star vs. 5 star because of the scent.  I may try to add an essential oil to it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used. I am so thankful my hair was brittle, dry, and overly damaged. This product brought life back to my hair, it is soft, shiny but not oily, and most importantly it looks healthy. I purchased this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I am sure I will continue to purchase it because it has given me what it says it is LUXURIOUS HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> I love using argan oil on my hair and I am always looking for good deals on it. I came across this product called Teddie Organics and since it was for a reasonable price, I decided to try it out. Now, I have kept one section of my hair separate to see how it works and come to find out, one of the ingredients of this oil is argan oil. Now, what is different about this oil is it also has rosehip seed and jojoba oil in it as well. These are both very good oils to use on your hair to strengthen it and moisturize it. So, I was very impress with the outcome in only a few days. I can only image what my hair will look like a month from now, even a few months. I think the combination of the three oils enhances the effect on your hair. I plan to continue using this oil.</li>
    <li> This product works great ... love this line of products</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect for my hair.  I live in a very humid state and I have to worry about frizzy hair day in and day out.  I just put a small dab in my hands rub and apply to my hair.  I usually avoid closer to the roots as that is not a problem part of my hair.  This hair treatment works perfect!  No more frizzes.  I also apply before straightening my hair as it does help to protect from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this evaluation are solely my own.</li>
    <li> This Hair Treatment is fantastic.  Love how its organic! Only the best ingredients that will make your hair feel fantastic.  Plus will take away the frizz out of your hair. You only need 2-3 drops. Its a miracle treatment on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;100% USDA Certified Organic Blend of Argan Oil, Rosehip Oil and Golden Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have curly, coarse, thick hair that tends to dry and frizz very fast. I use several products to keep my hair under control. I in in love with this hair treatment from TEDDIE ORGANICS. I have several essential oils from Teddie Organics. This is a wonderful company with great customer service. I have been impressed by the quality of their products. I was already a firm believer in argan oil for my hair; I have been using it for months. This formulation of hair treatment from Teddie Organics adds rose hip oil and jojoba oil; both beneficial for hair. This is a winning combination.  I use several drops in my hair when it is wet and comb it through to distribute evenly. to make sure I get the ends of my hair . I was given the opportunity to test and try this product, and I am pleased with the results. Perfect for curly girls.</li>
    <li> This hair treatment is Amazing. I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times now, and it has made my hair softer and more healthy looking.What I really love about this is that it has so many uses. You can use it as a hair treatment, heat protector, a beard oil and much more. A little bit of oil goes a long way so the product will last you a while. It works by adding 2-3 drops to wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love the blend Argan Oil, Golden Jojoba Oil and Rosehip Seed Oil.  Awesome blend to have that awesome shine that my hair was craving.  I am happy with the end result. I got this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This hair product is just amazing. I never knew such a little bottle could pack such a punch. I have used it every time I have washed my hair instead of using conditioner. I use the recommended amount and rubbed it into my hair which has made my hair softer and beautiful. I love my hair even more now because of this product. If you want a great leave in conditioner, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Such a great addition to my current hair routine. I have naturally curly hair, and I am always looking for ways to assist with keeping the frizz down. That is why I agreed to purchase these at a great price during a promotional phase for testing.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving I immediately put a few drops in the palm of my hand and applied to my hair. My hair looked refreshed, tame - after a days work and healthy and shiny. I also like to use this in my daughters hair after her bath, to assist with detangling! Great product!</li>
    <li> I love products from Teddie Organics. Their hair treatment not only contains Argan oil, it also has Jojoba oil and Rosehip seed oil, all good for hair and skin. I like the fact that it is free of parabens, SLS, colorants, chemicals and fragrances. I have been suffering from thinning hair for a while and have tried many things. I am using medicated shampoo given by my dermatologist and it makes my hair extremely dry and brittle. I started using this Hair Treatment from Teddie Organics. I put a few drops on palm of my hand and rub them together and run my hands through my hair after washing them. After I let them air dry, my hair are no more brittle or dry. It doesn’t leave my hair oily, it gives them a shine. I have also used it as a leave in treatment at night and wash my hair in the morning. Washes out completely and leaves hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my hands and arms as well as a moisturizer, since all three oils are good for skin too. It is very hydrating. It comes with a life time guarantee so you don’t lose anything if you want to give it a try. I was given the opportunity to try this oil for my review and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> I have long blond color damaged hair that breaks easily.  This wonderful mix of oils is so good for your hair and skin.  I smoothed a few drops through my clean damp hair and styled as usual.  It made my hair feel soft and silky.  My frizzy dry staticky hair is gone and in it&#x27;s place I have beautiful, smooth shiny hair.  I also used it to moisturize my face and dry cracked hands.  It absorbs right into you skin and feels great.  This generously sized product should last a good long time.  I received this complimentary product to sample and share my opinion.  I have had the privilege of trying several Teddie Organics beauty products and I am very impressed with the overall quality.  I love all things organic.  I am very sensitive to artificial fragrances and ingredients so I try to avoid them for fear of reaction.  I will continue to be a loyal customer to Teddie Organics.</li>
    <li> I love Teddie Organics products- this the 3rd one I currently have. I fell in love with their rose water and have tried everything else I can find since then. This is big nice size bottle with a high quality dropper inside. I have thinning hair that is going gray far to early. I use this by putting a dropper full on my scalp every night before bed- I massage in and let sit overnight. I then wash and condition like normal- style like normal. No greasy hair afterwards. It definitely helps my hair stay less frizzy (my hair is pretty straight but I have fly aways). It smells like Argan oil- which isn&#x27;t bad but isn&#x27;t the prettiest smell either- I am used to it. This is another great Teddie Organics product so I was really excited to get the opportunity to try it and then do a review for it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I just started using this and I am liking what I am seeing. This product will last me a long time, as my hair never ever wants to grow long. I hope that it will help me against breakage. So far it makes my hair look great. I am expecting greater as I prolong usage.</li>
    <li> I love how soft this has made my hair. I really needed this after this winter, my hair was really dry. This is kind of an all in one product for hair care and will fix almost any problem from frizzy, dry, or weak hair and it also protects it from heat.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair and can be frizzy when air dried.  After washing my hair and combing it I used this oil and let my hair air dry.  After about an hour I immediately noticed a difference.  My hair was drying but it was not frizzy and it felt very soft.  I definitely recommend this product for people who have thick hair, will definitely keep purchasing this!</li>
    <li> With the different types of oils in the Luxurious Hair Treatment, it leaves my hair feeling extremely soft, moisturized, and manageable.  I normally have dry frizzy hair and with just a few drop I&#x27;m able to tame my hair down a bit and style it much easier after using the hair treatment.  I recommend this for anyone struggling with dry frizzy hair, it has brought so much to me in the way of managing and styling my hair, I look forward to continued use of this product;</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much better!. After the first treatment i could tell a huge change. So soft and in control! Great product! .</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and gives beautiful results!! I mix this luxurious hair treatment with coconut oil and leave it on for 1-2 hours with heat and my hair gets so soft and super shiny!!! I will definelty buy more and would love to try and review another Teddie organics products!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love Teddie Organics products, and I can add this Luxurious Hair Treatment to my list!  I was first concerned because of the color of the product, and when I don&#x27;t have color in my hair, it&#x27;s blonde, but you really don&#x27;t need to use much.  I do have color in my hair, and it&#x27;s been a few weeks and is starting to look dull and dry again.  a few treatments of this, and it&#x27;s back to silky, soft and shiny!  I don&#x27;t use a lot, a few drops in my hand, rub together and run through my hair as a leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;m so lucky I was able to get this during a product launch.  It really is a good product, especially if your hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about this product at first because of the smell but once I applied it to my hair and immediately notice the results&lt;br /&gt; And after a while the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong once I applied it to my hair. I&#x27;m assuming that the reason why the smell is so strong is because this product is very potent</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My hair was so damaged from, coloring, sun, blow drying etc... I put a few drops of this in the palm of my hands messaged it into my hair from root to tip and left it in over night, next morning a washed it as normal in the shower, WOW!  My hair is so much healthier! It drank it all in and nourished my dead hair.  that&#x27;s after only one treatment! It says I can use as a leave in treatment too, so I have! I absolutely love this luxurious hair treatment  by Teddy. I love all Teddy products!  Very glad I ordered this for an honest and unbias review.</li>
    <li> The Brand has been good for me. I use few other of this brand. This product is natural, so it does not smell soapy or perfume.  I am not crazy about the scent but I would prefer to use this naturally with the natural scent than pleasant smell but damage the hair.  My scalp is very oily but the my hair it self somewhat dry.  I have no choice but to wash my hair everyday, which is not good, because the scalp is oily.  I use this at night, to help condition it.  I see some improvement, only been using it twice, but I do have faith on this since other product been working out well.</li>
