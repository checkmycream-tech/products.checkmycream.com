      <li>My sleep apnea oral appliance came with one brush which got a bit &amp;#34;grimy&amp;#34; after six months of keeping&lt;br /&gt;the appliance clean.  </li>

      <li>I was originally looking for a deal on a Polident Denture Brush, but the whole box of these was only a little more than one Polident brush (with shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Getting a pack of 12 is great, should last me at least a year.</li>
      <li>these seem to clean my partial very well.  </li>
      <li>The denture brushes are nice but are hard to brush with.</li>

      <li>the bristles are way too soft</li>
      <li>Picture a soft toothbrush</li>
      <li>Brush was to soft to remove denture adhesive.</li>
      <li>These are good for dentures but also cleaning around the house in those difficult area.</li>
      <li>but I was still surprised at how soft they actually are.</li>
      <li>Regular style denture brush - still too soft for my liking.</li>
      <li>It might sound a little crazy for one person to purchase this many denture brushes but there is a method to my madness.</li>
      <li>The pointed end was not long enough</li>

<li> The pointed end was not long enough</li>
<li> I love these for cleaning my dentures, getting into small spaces to clean like the inside rims on tupperware containers, for cleaning grout in small areas and that area between the sole of your shoe and the top that gets all of the nasty stuff from the street.</li>
<li> Bristles way too soft - not as stiff as a regular tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also, bristles short, hardly long enough to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Smaller than expected, bristles are softer than others.</li>
<li> Amazon made it convenient; the box quantity has ended searching for a long time.</li>
<li> These brushes are so soft that it&#x27;s almost impossible to clean with them.</li>
<li> The bristles are too weak to do much of a job cleaning the glue off of a denture, it&#x27;s only slightly stiffer than your average toothbrush.</li>
<li> The bristles are very loose and flimsy.</li>
<li> This item was all that was expected.  </li>
<li> I mean, let&#x27;s face it, they are denture brushes for cryin&#x27; out loud.  </li>
<li> The bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as I&#x27;d like but will definitely suffice.</li>
<li> disappointed, will be throwing these away and finding a better brand.</li>
<li> one grumble is the slick surface of the handle, with the finger bumps on the opposite side of the handle where I would have put them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Should of paid attention to the other reviews.</li>
<li> I was tired of searching the local pharmacies for denture brushes only to discover that they were always &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I have a hard time locating locally, therefore I ordered a quantity on line</li>
<li> They are not too hard as some in stores back home.</li>
<li> Would give them 5 stars if the bristles were just a little stiffer.</li>
<li> These have become a very hard item to find in our local area.</li>
<li> The brushes are not as hard as I expected</li>
<li> The package contained all ONE color - green.  </li>
<li> Not too stiff so they get into all the crevices.  </li>
<li> but I need a denture brush to be hard bristled.</li>
<li> Bought these for my mom and her husband both of whom remarked that denture brushes were hard to find lately.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed , the bristles are way to soft making the brushes useless.</li>
<li> they&#x27;re useless</li>

    <li> These brushes are cheap. The bristles are very loose and flimsy. I don&#x27;t even know what I can use these for. they&#x27;re useless so I threw them away. Quality is very very cheap. I Would check for a better brand.</li>
    <li> It IS a good price for so many items but I need a denture brush to be hard bristled. Live and learn, I now have lots of brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great. Would give them 5 stars if the bristles were just a little stiffer.</li>

    <li> The convenience of having a denture brush available when I need it is the most important thing.  The bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as I&#x27;d like but will definitely suffice.</li>
    <li> These really work very well.  Not too stiff so they get into all the crevices.  And I love the handles.  Easy to hold and don&#x27;t slip from your grasp.  That&#x27;s really important if you have arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> good price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> My sleep apnea oral appliance came with one brush which got a bit &amp;#34;grimy&amp;#34; after six months of keeping&lt;br /&gt;the appliance clean.  Found these on Amazon and recommend them for keeping that oral appliance in&lt;br /&gt;good shape.</li>
    <li> Since moving overseas, it is hard to find these brushes in on the base exchange. I had ordered a box and these are great!! They are not too hard as some in stores back home. So glad I ordered and the delivery was quick!!</li>
    <li> Received the Archtek brushes in a very timely manner, well packed, and at a very competitive price. While I haven&#x27;t used them yet they appear to be more than acceptable for the price I paid. But, here&#x27;s the but, the picture that Amazon shows is a totally different product. Amazon pictures 12 ORAFix brushes of different colors. What I received was as the description stated, 12 Archtek brushes, all the same color, individually wrapped in cellophane. I&#x27;m satisfied with what I got, but Amazon needs to correct the picture shown for the Archtek brushes. At this point I would recommend these to a friend. How will they last? Well, we&#x27;ll just have to see.</li>
    <li> Good product..good price...good deal.</li>
    <li> Four stars. They look like good brushes (and probably are) but they are much softer bristles than what I expected.  Others have said the same but I was still surprised at how soft they actually are. Picture a soft toothbrush and that&#x27;s about what you get here. I hope they work.</li>
    <li> They are nice and sturdy to use</li>
    <li> I buy these denture brushes for my 95-year-old mother.  This is the second pack I have purchased.  A very good brush, individually wrapped - they do the job.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too weak to do much of a job cleaning the glue off of a denture, it&#x27;s only slightly stiffer than your average toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good for the dollars spent.  These brush may not be as stiff as I would like, but they do fine.  They don&#x27;t come carded as shown in the picture.  For the price I figure if each lasts a month, I have a years worth for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning dentures. Getting a pack of 12 is great, should last me at least a year. These brushes seem to be well made. This is a good bang for your buck. I would recommend this a seller.</li>
    <li> These are good for dentures but also cleaning around the house in those difficult area.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, bristles are softer than others. The pointed end was not long enough</li>
    <li> The denture brushes are nice but are hard to brush with.</li>
    <li> these seem to clean my partial very well.  I clean my partial after I soak it in pepsodent.</li>
    <li> Cleans dentures just like they&#x27;re made to do and do so with precision.  The packet precludes having to reorder constantly.</li>
    <li> Bristles way too soft - not as stiff as a regular tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also, bristles short, hardly long enough to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, will be throwing these away and finding a better brand.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many denture brushes over the years. I have a hard time locating locally, therefore I ordered a quantity on line so I would have a supply on hand. These brushes are ok but the bristles are much softer than I am used to using...the result is not as thorough a cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great and happy I found them no store has them anymore</li>
    <li> Great buy.  A fraction of the cost had I bought at department store.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived quickly were at a good price and of excellent quality. I Would order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Regular style denture brush - still too soft for my liking.</li>
    <li> With dentures one needs to clean them often so having a big box of brushes is perfect for quite awhile.  (Taking care of real teeth is SO much easier!)  These work well.  Can&#x27;t beat the price or the amount.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It might sound a little crazy for one person to purchase this many denture brushes but there is a method to my madness. I love these for cleaning my dentures, getting into small spaces to clean like the inside rims on tupperware containers, for cleaning grout in small areas and that area between the sole of your shoe and the top that gets all of the nasty stuff from the street. These are at a great price and I won&#x27;t run out of them anytime soon. I even received a wonderful email from Express Health with all of their contact information and wishes to make me a satisfied customer if I had any problems. I must say I have never received something like that before and it is much appreciated.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft that it&#x27;s almost impossible to clean with them. Never again! It looks like a great deal, but it isn&#x27;t if you have to throw them out!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed , the bristles are way to soft making the brushes useless. The only good thing is different colors. Should of paid attention to the other reviews.</li>
    <li> These have become a very hard item to find in our local area. At this price I will save lots of $$ over the next year or two.Th quality is good and I do not need the retail packaging, makes this an easy to store item until needed.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money. Arrived as promised and performs very well. I am extremely pleased with this product. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> the bristles are way too soft</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom and her husband both of whom remarked that denture brushes were hard to find lately.  Arrived in s timely manner.  The image shows 3 different colors.  The package contained all ONE color - green.  Considering ths purchase is for two people, more than one color would have been appreciated.  Otherwise  no complaints.</li>
    <li> Very good price for this many denture brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Convenient and sturdy brushes that are easy to hold and work well.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The items were exactly what I wanted. Works great for me.</li>
    <li> they were to soft, for dentures you need hard bristles.....not satisfied</li>
    <li> Great convenient brushes</li>
    <li> Brush was to soft to remove denture adhesive. Returned items.</li>
    <li> Great size but the bristles are wimpy.</li>
    <li> Just as described and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great for automotive parts washing for more sensitive items.</li>
