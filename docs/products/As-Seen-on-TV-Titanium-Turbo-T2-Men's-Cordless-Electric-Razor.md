      <li>A wise investment as this may seem to be, this is not.</li>
      <li>If you want to save time in the morning and look good, this will do the trick.  </li>
      <li>me take a moment to say the good things about the T2:  &amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; &lt;br /&gt;Seriously</li>
      <li>This is one of the best electric shavers I have ever used and so cheap.</li>
      <li>and you are good to go.  </li>
      <li>Shaves as good as my 149.00 shaver.</li>
      <li>Seeing this product on the infomercials, I found it very appealing.</li>
      <li>first time I used it, I was impressed at how close the shave was.</li>
      <li>am so glad I purchased it there with a giftcard my employer gave me!</li>
      <li>Nice looking device.</li>
      <li>you want the best, and I mean best electric shave of your life, try this shaver.  </li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s too good to be true,</li>
      <li>and i use the rechargable battery is working fine and nice.</li>
      <li>I bet there is more customers like me that don&#x27;t have time or don&#x27;t care to write about it.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, it is of better design.</li>
      <li>allowing for greater contact with the skin.</li>
      <li>The T2 screen has more perferations than by</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how great this razor really is.</li>
      <li>I was satisfied with the performance of the blades, a nice, smooth shave while it worked.</li>
      <li>I have for the most part always been a razor shaver.</li>
      <li>And of course, the T2 has no effect on neck hair whatsoever, no matter how many hours I put the T2 there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worked great the whole time, I just picked up some rechargeable batteries</li>
      <li>I typically don&#x27;t go more than 2 days.</li>
      <li>but the tweezers that come with it do a better job than the featured product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced that the reviewers who gave it more than three stars are all plants)</li>
      <li>For the first timers this is probably a good razor to start with.</li>
      <li>I figured because of the price it was probably cheap and wouldn&#x27;t work well or break easy!</li>
      <li>the bright side, the free travel kit was worth the price of the razor (unsure if this is available through Amazon)...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this one at CVS and liked the results; Titanium Turbo was my first electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>But keep your Mach 3 handy if you have a hot date or something.  </li>
      <li>It has been incredible and I&#x27;m ready for a new one.  </li>
      <li>, I guess they figured it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
      <li>Over all I think it is a nice electric shaver, not irritating and does not require shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>Seeing how I managed to break the shaving screen after a month of use, I would end up spending $10 A MONTH if I choose to stay with the T2 as my primary shaving device.  </li>
      <li>However, it is cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>My face is smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cheap</li>
      <li>nice and handy for the price under $15.00 and battery last around 3 week</li>
      <li>They are both great shavers, better than my Norelco three blade(circular)except, they seem to break easy at the latch that holds the blade cover down.</li>
      <li>For only $15 it was worth a try, and the damn thing has worked great and that was about a year ago.  </li>
      <li>After about 2 weeks of use, the button that allows you to clean the shaver broke while I was trying to remove the shaver head.  </li>
      <li>Overall however it is a good buy for the money</li>
      <li>Overall really quite a good razor</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not even worth returning.</li>
      <li>It proceeded to shave about as well as I&#x27;d expect (not close as a razor but nice enough) until it died about 30 seconds after I started it.  </li>
      <li>It may not sound like a good deal becuase of the price, but it is surely worth it!</li>
      <li>Right of way I noticed that the on/off switch is not working correct.</li>
      <li>Though the T2 is just like the others in many ways, there is however a major difference:</li>
      <li>Like most of the other critics here have probably stated, the T2 has to go over an area of the face numerous amounts of times to successfully shave it.  </li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what I think it&#x27;s worth -</li>
      <li>It has a nice close shave and it&#x27;s much quicker than using an actual razor.  </li>
      <li>you won&#x27;t have spent much money and it will always make for a good backup.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t get a close shave without going over the same area 10 times or more.</li>
      <li>Never thought anything could be better than my remington, but I tried this over my remington and could tell a big difference.</li>
      <li>I had to force my thumb on the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch, which can leave me with a pretty sore hand after taking an HOUR of average-at-best shaving.</li>
      <li>This would be good for shaving if you have 20 minutes to go back and forth over the same spot</li>
      <li>....... &lt;br /&gt;Not appropriate for long growth.   </li>
      <li>and I will certainly buy another one when needed.</li>
      <li>After seeing this nice little shaver on TV, I decided to purchase it from Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>It is now 7 months old and still shaves like new... with the original foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The whole thing fell apart in 2 days.</li>
      <li>Absolute piece of junk.</li>
      <li>I have never, ever gotten a shave from an electric as close or as fast as I do with this shaver, and no razor burn.  </li>
      <li>There was not one part of my face or neck that really got a close shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The T2 did do one thing very well.</li>
      <li>I bought my first Titanium Turbo, new, at a flea market on a lark.  </li>
      <li>It also caused irritation due to the many times I had to go over areas.</li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviews that you have to go over your neck many times, and it still doesn&#x27;t get everything.</li>
      <li>I actually ordered the Remington duel foil/cutters-titanium travel shaver\\&quot; recently and its a much better product than this.  </li>
      <li>take my word for it, one of these babies costs about the same as a four pack of conventional razor cartridges - give it a go and draw your own conclusions.</li>
      <li>There are no replacement parts for the T2 whatsoever, not even a replacement shaving screen, and the instruction manual pamphlet states that whenever something breaks, you should buy a new T2 altogether.  </li>
      <li>The first one lasted three weeks and the second lasted six weeks.</li>
      <li>Obviously there are no new foils available for this throw-away, so I bought a second one figuring maybe I had a defective foil on the first.  </li>
      <li>This may seem like a foreign concept to me, who just goes over an area once to cleanly shave peach fuzz off a face, but spending an hour shaving as opposed to a third of that time with a non-electric is really pushing it.  </li>
      <li>And the blades stay super sharp for months.</li>
      <li>, this IS the cheapest electric razor on the market, as far as I know.  </li>
      <li>shaver I bought at the flea market developed a crack in the foil after about four weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>It generates too loud noise for anyone to stand it.</li>
      <li>God forbid, however, the you actually grow hair on your neck because this shaver wants nothing to do with that.</li>
      <li>I use an old shave with a trimmer to trim my sideburns, and have two rechargeable batteries that solve that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This razor is complete hype, it refuses to shave anything on your neck and leaves you feeling like</li>
      <li>what more negative can I say about the T2?  </li>
      <li>Mine is finally coming apart, even though I still got a decent shave out of it this morning.</li>
      <li>far - it&#x27;s down right in the wire guage category</li>
      <li>The other brands look more like your average food</li>
      <li>It finally got a hole in the screen, so I&#x27;m buying a new electric(though not this model).</li>
      <li>If this can be fixed, no other shaver is necessary!</li>
      <li>, it BARELY works.  </li>
      <li>I suppose it was due to too much rust or</li>
      <li>I got it out of the box and after figuring out you have to HOLD THE POWER BUTTON DOWN while shaving (not just flick it on), which causes a pretty big inconvienence in it self</li>
      <li>Suggestion; buy more than one because they are becoming hard to find!!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the T2 for about a month now and apart from trying to get used to contorting my face in different ways (I do this anyway with a conventional razor, but with the wadge shape, it&#x27;s a whole different dance routine)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This would be good for shaving if you have 20 minutes to go back and forth over the same spot and you don&#x27;t mind feeling like a pack of feral cats had at your face.  God forbid, however, the you actually grow hair on your neck because this shaver wants nothing to do with that. &lt;br /&gt;It sucks. Don&#x27;t be fooled as I was.</li>
    <li> It actually shaved the chin-cheek area efficiently after going over a few times..but then after four days the foil tore a bit and needless to say, you don&#x27;t want to attempt to shave then or yep,definetly feral cats ravage your face!     Has a tough time shaving the neck area like one of the previous reviewers stated as well.     I actually ordered the Remington duel foil/cutters-titanium travel shaver\\&quot; recently and its a much better product than this.  I recommend giving the remington titanium travel shaver a try instead.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Titanium Turbo, new, at a flea market on a lark.  I have been through all of the name brand shavers, foil and rotary, and have always gone back to a blade.  I have an average beard, not like nails, or peach fuzz, but somewhere between, probably toward the &#x27;nails&#x27; end of the scale.  I have never, ever gotten a shave from an electric as close or as fast as I do with this shaver, and no razor burn.  Others usually cook my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver I bought at the flea market developed a crack in the foil after about four weeks of use.  Obviously there are no new foils available for this throw-away, so I bought a second one figuring maybe I had a defective foil on the first.  The foil on the second one is made of a different material.  It is now 7 months old and still shaves like new... with the original foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are that the shaver has no trimmer, and the batteries (2-AAs) only last about two weeks.  I use an old shave with a trimmer to trim my sideburns, and have two rechargeable batteries that solve that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best, and I mean best electric shave of your life, try this shaver.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for you (everyones beard and skin is different) you won&#x27;t have spent much money and it will always make for a good backup.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how great this razor really is. You&#x27;ll just have to buy one and try it. I have an extremely tough beard and this razor mows down the hair effortlessly. And the blades stay super sharp for months. The only maintenance needed is replace the two AA batteries and you are good to go.  Suggestion; buy more than one because they are becoming hard to find!!!!!</li>
    <li> In my opinion and experience, this thing is a piece of junk. What did I expect for the price - a Braun? Duh! The \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; label should have been the ONLY clue to its quality. But NO! Silly me! I used it for about 2 minutes, and it just stopped working. Tried everything, including replacing the Chinese batteries - nothing! And that&#x27;s exactly what I think it&#x27;s worth - NOTHING! It&#x27;s so cheap it&#x27;s not even worth returning.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Titanium Turbo (\\&quot;T2\\&quot;) from my local Wal-Green&#x27;s not too long ago.  It was my first-ever electric razor as I was looking to transition from using Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s.  It was a poor choice, to say the least. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let me take a moment to say the good things about the T2:  &amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; &lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this IS the cheapest electric razor on the market, as far as I know.  And at the very least, it does get the job done and can actually shave hair.  But that&#x27;s about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite the cheap price, this is by far, one of the worst razors to use.  Like most of the other critics here have probably stated, the T2 has to go over an area of the face numerous amounts of times to successfully shave it.  This may seem like a foreign concept to me, who just goes over an area once to cleanly shave peach fuzz off a face, but spending an hour shaving as opposed to a third of that time with a non-electric is really pushing it.  And of course, the T2 has no effect on neck hair whatsoever, no matter how many hours I put the T2 there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s little irritation, that is, unless you spend about sixty consecutive minutes with the thing, which is, unfortunately, what you would do using it.  Plus it gets worse when the blade screen loosens itself, which it will eventually do, or even worse, when it inevitably breaks after a month of use.  Cheese grater, anyone? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There must have also been something wrong with the on switch, because even with a fresh pair of batteries, I still had trouble turning the thing on AND leaving it on.  I had to force my thumb on the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch, which can leave me with a pretty sore hand after taking an HOUR of average-at-best shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what more negative can I say about the T2?  How about the fact that with no replaceable parts, it is basically a &#x27;disposable electric&#x27;.  There are no replacement parts for the T2 whatsoever, not even a replacement shaving screen, and the instruction manual pamphlet states that whenever something breaks, you should buy a new T2 altogether.  Seeing how I managed to break the shaving screen after a month of use, I would end up spending $10 A MONTH if I choose to stay with the T2 as my primary shaving device.  A wise investment as this may seem to be, this is not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a frustrating hour spent on mediocre shaving, and easily-breakable-yet-irreplaceable parts, I give the Titanium Turbo T2 Electric Razor one star out of five.</li>
    <li> I just used it yesterday. For $10.00 you can&#x27;t go wrong. Shaves as good as my 149.00 shaver. My face is smooth. This is one of the best electric shavers I have ever used and so cheap. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> It generates too loud noise for anyone to stand it. I have decide to return it although I will lose some money.</li>
    <li> I have had two. The first one lasted three weeks and the second lasted six weeks. They are both great shavers, better than my Norelco three blade(circular)except, they seem to break easy at the latch that holds the blade cover down. If this can be fixed, no other shaver is necessary!</li>
    <li> Well I just bought 1 of these pieces of crap after seeing the ad on TV wondering if it would really work.  I was wrong.  I got it out of the box and after figuring out you have to HOLD THE POWER BUTTON DOWN while shaving (not just flick it on), which causes a pretty big inconvienence in it self, it BARELY works.  I was able to shave 1 cheek after pressing as hard as i could against my face and going over it about 15 times, and there was 1 little hair it would NOT shave after i went over it atleast 25 times from every damn angle.  Worst razor ive EVER encountered, disposable bic razors work twice as good.  Save the 10$ and dont bother wit this piece of garbage.  You people who say this piece of crap works great must have little to no experience with shaving or have the smallest amount of facial hair on earth, or be getting paid by the terrible company that produces this atrosity.</li>
    <li> Absolute piece of junk. I wish I could have given it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I&#x27;m a college student, and I&#x27;ve never owned a real expensive electric razor.  I always shaved with a Gillette Mach 3, and it just took so long in the morning, I started looking for something that would get me out the door quicker.  I picked one of these Titanium Turbos up at an \\&quot;As Seen on Tv\\&quot; type store in the mall.  For only $15 it was worth a try, and the damn thing has worked great and that was about a year ago.  It&#x27;s worked great the whole time, I just picked up some rechargeable batteries and I&#x27;ve been happy with it ever since.  It has a nice close shave and it&#x27;s much quicker than using an actual razor.  If you want to save time in the morning and look good, this will do the trick.  But keep your Mach 3 handy if you have a hot date or something.  Also, I was reading the manual and apparently it&#x27;s only designed to be used for 6-8 months, I guess they figured it&#x27;s so cheap you can just buy another one in that time.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect razor for me -- gives great shave.  However, it is cheaply made.  After about 2 weeks of use, the button that allows you to clean the shaver broke while I was trying to remove the shaver head.  I think that I will try the Remington titanium.  Hopefully, it is of better design.</li>
    <li> This is my third Titanium Turbo.  It is an excellent product and has very good longevity for the price.  The only negative is that it is a little noisy.  Overall however it is a good buy for the money and I will certainly buy another one when needed.</li>
    <li> It came on time as promised. Nice looking device. Right of way I noticed that the on/off switch is not working correct. I had to slide back and forth to turn it on and when was finally on the RPM was fluctuating. I was satisfied with the performance of the blades, a nice, smooth shave while it worked. Unfortunately the shaver quit working all together after less then 1 week of once a day use. I changed the batteries, cleaned the blades, nothing. Is this a lemon I got or they all the same?? I bet there is more customers like me that don&#x27;t have time or don&#x27;t care to write about it.</li>
    <li> After seeing this nice little shaver on TV, I decided to purchase it from Amazon.com.  It proceeded to shave about as well as I&#x27;d expect (not close as a razor but nice enough) until it died about 30 seconds after I started it.  It came with a pair of generic AA batteries, so I figured they were at fault.  I replaced them with a new pair of name brand batteries, and the razor was still dead.  I got about one half of a shave out of this product.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this for me, knowing the suspiciously low price might mean that it barely worked... but considering the testimonials on TV, gave it a shot. &lt;br /&gt;Big mistake. Maybe good for pre-pubescent kids wanting to shave off peach fuzz. For me, it did nothing to even a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. &lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, the free travel kit was worth the price of the razor (unsure if this is available through Amazon)... but the tweezers that come with it do a better job than the featured product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(side note: I&#x27;m convinced that the reviewers who gave it more than three stars are all plants)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one for over a year. It finally got a hole in the screen, so I&#x27;m buying a new electric(though not this model). &lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was impressed at how close the shave was. It did miss those annoying hairs that curl back down, though - rather frustrating. &lt;br /&gt;Then again, I don&#x27;t think any foil razor will get those. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you do buy this, rechargeable AA batteries are a must. The batteries should last you 3-5 uses before the shaver starts losing power. &lt;br /&gt;I recommend shaving once a day with this razor. Don&#x27;t use it on hair longer than 1/8th of an inch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes me about 10-20 minutes to shave, depending how long I wait between shaves. I typically don&#x27;t go more than 2 days. If I do, I have to use my hair clippers to trim it short enough.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave with one day growth, but hit and miss with longer growth.  Caution in cleaning as the head is not solidly affixed to the base.  Cleaning requires the head to be supported between your thumb and index finger as you brush the the cutting head.</li>
    <li> Overall really quite a good razor....... &lt;br /&gt;Not appropriate for long growth.   &lt;br /&gt;Wish it had a rechargable battery but that would obviously raise the price.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the item does not work.  I do not have anything to write about this item on since it did not function at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Titanium Turbo T2 cordless razor about 4 years ago at Walmart.  It has been incredible and I&#x27;m ready for a new one.  It has out lived 4 brand name expensive razors and gives me the closest shave of all.  Parts for the brand names are as expensive as a new razor and cutter block and foil need to be purchased every year!</li>
    <li> The whole thing fell apart in 2 days. As far as performance is concerned, it shaved just as well as my other shaver. Although, I should also mention that it sometimes actually hurt - like it was pulling the hair out. Maybe I got a dud, but I think you usually get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Seeing this product on the infomercials, I found it very appealing. Wondering in to my local Walgreens, which sells as seen on TV products, I purchased it for around $10.65.  &lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I purchased it there with a giftcard my employer gave me! I figured because of the price it was probably cheap and wouldn&#x27;t work well or break easy! I was wrong! IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL!   &lt;br /&gt;This is a shotty product, and misleading advertising.</li>
    <li> This razor is complete hype, it refuses to shave anything on your neck and leaves you feeling like you just dry shaved with a dull pocket knife.</li>
    <li> I shave every other day and just hack down the growth with an electric and then shave with a blade.  This is perfect for that.  For what I paid, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  After having it about two years, I&#x27;m going to buy another one.  Mine is finally coming apart, even though I still got a decent shave out of it this morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this one at CVS and liked the results; Titanium Turbo was my first electric shaver.  The shave was close and my skin got less irritated then getting a shave using Schick razors I was used to.  It seems that the mechanism isn&#x27;t entirely waterproof, after rinsing the razor each time after a shave and letting it dry it stopped working on the second set of batteries.  I could not open it up to see what was inside bit I suppose it was due to too much rust or the mechanism got dirty.  Over all I think it is a nice electric shaver, not irritating and does not require shaving cream.  I give it four stars because I think it should have lasted longer, it only served me well for two months.  For the first timers this is probably a good razor to start with.</li>
    <li> You cannot believe everything you see on TV. If it&#x27;s too good to be true, yada yada. I have for the most part always been a razor shaver. Years ago I have tried an electric razor for about a month, but gave it up dissatisfied. Though the T2 is just like the others in many ways, there is however a major difference: The mirco screen! If you ever get a chance to see one in the shops take a close look at the T2 screen next to any other electric razor at random. The T2 screen has more perferations than by far - it&#x27;s down right in the wire guage category allowing for greater contact with the skin. The other brands look more like your average food strainers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the T2 for about a month now and apart from trying to get used to contorting my face in different ways (I do this anyway with a conventional razor, but with the wadge shape, it&#x27;s a whole different dance routine) the T2 does give my a razor close shave - even to the point of razor burn if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take my word for it, one of these babies costs about the same as a four pack of conventional razor cartridges - give it a go and draw your own conclusions. Now it they only made a rechargeable version...</li>
    <li> I tried the Titanium Turbo--it was the single worst shaving experience of my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only did the shaver shave only some of the whiskers, it shaved them to randomly different lengths. There was not one part of my face or neck that really got a close shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The T2 did do one thing very well. It irritated the heck out of my skin, not only on the neck, but even up on my face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you get a chance to use this product...DON&#x27;T.</li>
    <li> nice and handy for the price under $15.00 and battery last around 3 week and i use the rechargable battery is working fine and nice.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews that you have to go over your neck many times, and it still doesn&#x27;t get everything. In all fairness I have never used an electric that can shave my neck well, but this one is really bad. It also caused irritation due to the many times I had to go over areas.</li>
    <li> Ive had this for a couple years, never really used it much just until lately. Never thought anything could be better than my remington, but I tried this over my remington and could tell a big difference. I didnt have any hair, nor stubble left on my face after using it. Ever since then, Ive just preferred using this over anything else. It may not sound like a good deal becuase of the price, but it is surely worth it!</li>
    <li> I like a close shave and I was not really impress with this razor. It works ,but did not shave close as I like it</li>
    <li> Battery was dead and it smelled like mold.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get a close shave without going over the same area 10 times or more. Very disappointed after the adds on TV made it look ao good.</li>
