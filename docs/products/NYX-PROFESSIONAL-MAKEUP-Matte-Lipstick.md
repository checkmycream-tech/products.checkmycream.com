      <li>but i still love it &amp;</li>
      <li>Love it got it on at my family reunion in Orlando Florida right now!</li>
      <li>but I still enjoy it.</li>
      <li>It stays on pretty well, but it could be better.</li>

      <li>I have pretty fair skin and blonde hair, so it can be hard to find a shade on red that looks good on me and doesn&#x27;t make me look washed out.</li>
      <li>Got here really fast  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really stay well and is more orange than expected.</li>
      <li>and I love all of them except the lighter color, it does get a little streaky</li>
      <li>As with many matte lipsticks, I would recommend putting some chap stick on before applying as it does feel a little dry by itself.</li>

    <li> I love to wear red lipstick, and I must say that this is one of my favorite red lipsticks. I have fair skin, so this color pops. I also love that I don&#x27;t have to reapply throughout the day. I think that this color could work with all skin hues.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE This Lipstick. Came Faster Then Expected.</li>
    <li> I love the matte lipstick formula and it has great staying power and great color payoff. Not streaky or drying at all. I own 4 other matte lipsticks in this line and I love all of them except the lighter color, it does get a little streaky but I still enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Color is WAY off then the picture. It is very very RED!!! Will not be using ever.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stay well and is more orange than expected.</li>
    <li> Love it got it on at my family reunion in Orlando Florida right now!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful. I have pretty fair skin and blonde hair, so it can be hard to find a shade on red that looks good on me and doesn&#x27;t make me look washed out.

    <li> Perfect with my brown skin tone</li>
    <li> This lipstick is perfect with my fair skin. I get compliments on it all the time from strangers. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lipstick! Lasts my entire 9-5 day. The color works perfectly with my olive skin. As with many matte lipsticks, I would recommend putting some chap stick on before applying as it does feel a little dry by itself.</li>
    <li> Every thing was great from seller to to lipstick ....it&#x27;s so sexy with every thing I wear 😘😘😘😘</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice lipstick but I thought it would be a darker red color. It&#x27;s a bright red.</li>
    <li> I always loved Nyx matte lipstick. Color is off than pictured. It&#x27;s a bit lighter,  but still a true nude color.</li>
    <li> Nice shade of red...perfect for brown skin tones. Very pigmented as well!</li>
    <li> Its a good lip stick but it looks brighter than the one in the picture. I got Eden I was expecting a darker color.</li>
    <li> Got here really fast  love the color so gorgeous</li>
    <li> I bought &amp;#34;Eden&amp;#34; and i just love this color so much I&#x27;ve had it before. The smoothest, mattest, pigmented beyond belief, not drying at all, perfect lipstick! Just buy it!</li>
    <li> I just wish it dried. I didnt expect it to because I knew what this product would be. I got a NARS red Matte lipstick and this is just as pigmented and lasts just as long. Definitely an affordable dupe. Came promptly:)</li>
    <li> You only need to apply it again if you eat or drink from a straw, but it adheres pretty good.</li>
    <li> i love the lipstick but i thought it was a darker red. i was wrong but i still love it &amp; i am gonna wear it lol.</li>
    <li> My favorite color. Everyone keeps asking where I got it from and I want to be selfish and not say but I always end up saying! Love it!</li>
