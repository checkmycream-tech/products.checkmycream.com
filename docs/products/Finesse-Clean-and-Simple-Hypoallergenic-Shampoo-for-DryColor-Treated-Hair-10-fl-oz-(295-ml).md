      <li>My skin feels better all the way around.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to most shampoo products and soaps.  </li>

      <li>Many, many years ago I was diagnosed by the top dermatologist in Chicago with allergies to soaps and detergents.  </li>

      <li>I would recommend the original finesse line.  </li>
      <li>I have super fine, blond hair</li>
      <li>Since then, one shampooing provides a sufficient amount of lather to clean and moisturize my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>Nice for me since I have allergies to most regular shampoos.  </li>
      <li>It would be cool if a company could do something that lathered well without sulfates, but that has yet to be seen.  </li>
      <li>gray - looks better really, who knew?  </li>
      <li>Tide Free and Gentle laundry detergent works for me after trying everything else out there.</li>
      <li>but once you do the outcome is worth it.</li>
      <li>Expect it to be rough &amp; ratty, so use a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>The first two times I used it I needed to shampoo twice because the first shampoo didn&#x27;t have sufficient lather.</li>
      <li>I am leaving a neutral review in hopes that the next time I use this I will have better results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll only continue to use this brand until I can find something better.</li>

      <li>Finesse had it right before they tried introducing these new products.  </li>

      <li>so much I returned to Finesse.</li>
      <li>I incorrectly assumed that this shampoo would be fragrance free or at least lightly scented.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Expensive but i love this shampoo. It&#x27;s just what I need for my sensitive scalp and color treated hair. Very mild to use everday.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that reacts to ingredients in shampoo. Finesse is one shampoo that I have no problem with on that count, but it leaves my hair feeling like straw. I&#x27;ll only continue to use this brand until I can find something better. (And using the conditioner doesn&#x27;t help.)</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this shampoo (and the matching conditioner).  I don&#x27;t have dry/color treated hair, but have fine, frizzy locks.  This shampoo has plenty of suds and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and scalp.  There is a fragrance, but I find it tolerable and the fragrance hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation issues.  I&#x27;ve also tried another free and clear competition brand and find the Finesse versions to be more economical and even better at leaving my hair and scalp looking and feeling good!</li>
    <li> I incorrectly assumed that this shampoo would be fragrance free or at least lightly scented.  Well it is not.  Not sure why they gave it the name that they gave it.  Otherwise it is an ok shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used so many products on my hair.  My skin is super sensitive.  I get acne on my scalp from many shampoos.  This one not only cleared my scalp problems but my acne on my face, chest and back went away.  My skin feels better all the way around.  I think the run off from other products were irritating my skin.  I am also sensitive to some fragrance and the one in this doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  This doesn&#x27;t lather hardly at all but if you take a little time to work the shampoo in it does just as well as any other shampoo.  I have super fine, blond hair so if it is greasy it shows!  I am over all happy with this product and will be using it again.  Its way cheaper than the salon stuff I was using and it irritates me less. It would be cool if a company could do something that lathered well without sulfates, but that has yet to be seen.  Even the 100% natural ones seem to use a naturally derived form of it that still bothers me.  Well done Finesse!  Thanks a million!</li>
    <li> I am leaving a neutral review in hopes that the next time I use this I will have better results.  I could not get this shampoo to lather, so it obviously wasn&#x27;t going to work for cleaning my hair. I ended up using another shampoo that lathered much better to finish the job - Salon Selectives with Argan Oil for color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it one more try and then return it if the results aren&#x27;t better. I found this shampoo at BigLots for $1.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shampoo-ing!</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t build up.  The shampoo lathers.  It works exceptionally well with the conditoner.  For those with allergies and sensitivies this is a great shampoo.  This is relatively inexpensive which out on the market it&#x27;s hard to find shampoos and conditioners for those of us that do have allergies to the shampoo and conditioners.  This works on my unprocessed hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  It doesn&#x27;t build it up.  Great Great Great.  Just wish that all the mass markets carried it as well as Amazon.  That is the only bad part.  I have to order it all the time instead of picking it up at the grocery.  This shampoo works.</li>
    <li> Have used this once, and it seems like great shampoo.  Hair soft and shiny.  It does have a light scent.  But...I got hives immediately, just as I have with other shampoos.  My search continues.</li>
    <li> Grea hypoallergenic product and I use it with Finesse conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this shampoo</li>
    <li> I have had good luck with this product.  I am allergic to pretty much all hair products.  I hope it continues to work for me.</li>
    <li> Nice for me since I have allergies to most regular shampoos.  Wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> My scalp is dry and sensitive and my hair is dry, short, curly, and color-treated. I&#x27;ve tried many, many shampoos, and this is the first one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp or make make it itch. The first two times I used it I needed to shampoo twice because the first shampoo didn&#x27;t have sufficient lather. Since then, one shampooing provides a sufficient amount of lather to clean and moisturize my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> This product dried my hair out so bad.  The conditioner didn&#x27;t help put the moisture back in.  If you&#x27;re buying this because you have sensitive skin that often breaks out I would recommend the original finesse line.  (which was actually recommended to me by my dermatologist) I use the shampoo plus conditioner and moisturizing conditioner.  My skin is completely clear and my hair feels great.  Finesse had it right before they tried introducing these new products.  I am begging you please don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.  Dermatologists have been recommending finess for 10+ years,  waaaay longer than this product has been around.</li>
    <li> This shampoo will strip every product you&#x27;ve used on your hair since sixth grade. Expect it to be rough &amp; ratty, so use a good conditioner. After the first time I used it my hair curled like crazy! I didn&#x27;t realize how badly product residue had weighed it down. I would not use this every shampoo, but it&#x27;s great to get your hair super clean.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for hypoallergenic shampoo.  I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have found I could use because of allergies.  In the past, I had to wash my hair with Ivory soap and use a water softener to get the residue out of my hair.  This product saved me a lot of money because I cancelled the water softener service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer.  I bought twenty bottles of it for about $2.00 each at the time.  If your allergies are really bad try washing your hair with a drop of Dawn dishwashing liquid. When your head is itching like crazy, you cannot be so picky and have to open yourself up to new ideas.  I moved on to Aveeno Naturals for years but recently my bangs started itching my forehead so much I returned to Finesse. Ivory soap is the only thing I can use to wash my face.  It is also the cheapest soap you will ever find.  Allergies - what a pain.  I also found I can use Rembrandt Intense Stain Removal toothpaste.  It does not have SLS in it.  Maybe some of these ideas will help you as well.  It has been trial and error at a high cost for different products.  Many, many years ago I was diagnosed by the top dermatologist in Chicago with allergies to soaps and detergents.  He said I do not even have to test you.  He simply lifted up my long hair to see the problem.  When I asked what I was supposed to wash with, he replied, water.  When you think about it, standing in the shower washing your hair, the shampoo runs all over your body as well, causing more skin problems and hair dye made my hair fall out so I let it grow out gray - looks better really, who knew?  Tide Free and Gentle laundry detergent works for me after trying everything else out there. Life is solving one problem after another.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most shampoo products and soaps.  I had been searching for a product like this for years but with no luck.  Then I found it on Amazon.  Since my first purchase I have tried to buy it at local drug store chains but Amazon seems to be the only source that has it.  The itching is gone and it works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as lathery as normal shampoos but it does a good job and it&#x27;s gentler on my scalp, so it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> When my scalp is running dryer, the hypoallergenic shampoo and conditioner work.  This brand I really like. Note: its tough getting used to the no lather...but once you do the outcome is worth it.</li>
    <li> Bottle was received half smashed. Shampoo had squeezed out, with bottle And the plastic bag over it, Both covered in shampoo. Got it all over my hands just trying to open the package.</li>
