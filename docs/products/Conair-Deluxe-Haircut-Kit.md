    <li> Not that noisy compare with the others.</li>
    <li> for the price it is good, I have buy two of the same brand and I love Conair, really last 5 yrs. and for all the savings why not</li>
    <li> Overall the Kit is an Excellent product--performed very well ---as well as its attachments.&lt;br /&gt;The hair clipping neck shawl accessory however did little in catching the clippings.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;  Fran R</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, as it is very easy to use with more options and guidelines. This product was delivered much earlier than the schedule. I would recommend this to other people.</li>
    <li> I do my own trims now, both my hair and my beard. This thing is so easy to use and works so well. I am very pleased with how easy it is to change the different attachments.</li>
    <li> I have always cut my hair really close and these clippers just dont do the job. They dont get as close as Im use to and they feel like they are cheap made. When you turn them on they vibrate Alot and have no screw adjuster on the side. I dont like them and DO NOT recomend these. Sorry guys, they s***.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband because he cut his own hair. They cut great and for the price I&#x27;ll order another pair every year!</li>
    <li> Works great and its light</li>
    <li> Very nice to be able to use these clippers without the restraint of a cord, but the cord can be used if desired. Sharp blades, excellent selection of blade attachments and very light in weight. Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> Great clipper with tons of attachments.  #1 thru #8</li>
    <li> I have tried other products, but this one is the best. I like how smooth it glides through your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many of these sets in the past and bought this one mainly to replace the handheld trimmer and the cape as those had broken in my old set.  This unit feels much cheaper than the old ones.  It works ok, but still occasionally snags hair.  The handheld trimmer feels less powerful than I would like, but it does the job.  The attachments are all standard and work fine.  The cape is a joke!  We refer to it as a &amp;#34;trash bag&amp;#34; because that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like.  Honestly, I just threw it away and we now use a towel instead.  The case feels VERY flimsy and I worry every time I use this kit that it&#x27;s going to break.  It&#x27;s hard to open and close and the plastic is so thin that I really wonder what the designers were thinking.  I would rather have a sturdy soft case than this flimsy hard plastic one.  But, it gets the job done and saves us a ton of money on boys&#x27; haircuts.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed when i received the item because i order a conair deluxe hair cut kit and i received a conair boss so i was not please anyway it work perfect</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on these clippers and unfortunately they aren&#x27;t what I expected they are cheap in every way. I have purchased several conair clippers and have returned all of them due to lack of quality. I&#x27;m going for a new brand of clippers bc Conair is making a cheap product now. Don&#x27;t waist your time on these. They are no better than any other ones they make.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair with ease. Surprised at how well it will cut considering how much lighter it is than my last set of clippers.</li>
    <li> Works great and a lot of accessories for a good price</li>
    <li> Its ok, you can see the clippers starting to loosen up after a while and the cuts are&#x27;nt the most precise in the world, but it serves its basic purpose, just ond expect any frills wit this kit.</li>
