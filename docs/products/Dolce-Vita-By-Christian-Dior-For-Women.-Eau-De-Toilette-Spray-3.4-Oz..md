      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get such an Awesome price on it.</li>
      <li>I have been fortunate to have always bought an authentic bottle, but feel that sometimes it takes time for the perfume to settle if it has been posted.</li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite perfume since its inception in 1996 - Christian Dior created one great fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Its strong so you have to be caustious about over doing it.</li>
      <li>A rich and beautiful Italian lady would wear this, it smells of gold and money,but not something to eat like some of my favorites.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent perfume and very classic from Christian Dior!  </li>
      <li>So sweet and clean!</li>
      <li>it is musk-like, floral a heavier scent rather than citrus or light airy fragrances.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you Amazon for keeping it available for me.</li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.</li>
      <li>This cologne has more than doubled in price since I started to wear it, but I love it so much I&#x27;ll pay what it costs.  </li>
      <li>The smell never grows old and it lasts through out the day.a definately good purchase</li>
      <li>It is a quick and easy order and arrives promptly.</li>
      <li>So as many here have stated, the bottle and the packaging don&#x27;t look exactly like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;There is no engraved Dior name on the bottle and the box itself is has</li>
      <li>The bottle has no description like my original does and the coloring is off.</li>
      <li>I wear this is for my special occasions and events</li>
      <li>A must for that special woman in your life.</li>
      <li>It smells like the \\&quot;sweet life\\&quot; for which it is named.</li>
      <li>On me it is light, spicy and freshly floral, and stays with me for hours.  </li>
      <li>I LOVED the price during this one-time only deal.</li>
      <li>It is not a scent that Dior pushes but it is a classic that is very important to their brand.</li>
      <li>The bottle is very pretty</li>
      <li>but this is really a great everyday scent that is not too sweet..more earthy in my untrained opinion....</li>
      <li>Bought this perfume as a Christmas gift for my mom right before Christmas.</li>
      <li>Glad I did not pay for this at full price because I would be pissed going through the hassle of shipping it back.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to pretend to describe the scent other than to say it come out of the bottle a bit overwhelming, but very quickly mellows and leaves a nice scent that I can detect hours later.</li>
      <li>Dolce Vita is a sensuous sent for evening, or hot weather...</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Got this as a surprise gift and my wife loves the floral fragrance that seems to last for most part of the day.</li>
      <li>I love to wear Christian Dior&#x27;s Dolce Vita Eau De Toilette!  </li>
      <li>I first tried it years ago and continue to wear it.</li>
      <li>but i was presently surprised, it was in the original box.</li>
      <li>I really used to LOVE this perfume years ago and it used to last all day.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful fragrance, expensive but worth it.</li>
      <li>Im really greatful they carry it</li>

      <li>Based on the reviews and the notes, I really thought I would like this one.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a well-constructed modern oriental.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Bought this hoping it would be the real deal since it was sold by Amazon itself.</li>
      <li>Perfume is a very personal, individual thing and I am sure it is in our chemistry as to which perfumes are right for us.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite perfume for over ten years and is becoming more difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s a bit too rich in white florals, which I am very sensitive to in large doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Without second thoughts, I placed an order and got my shipment so quickly.</li>
      <li>Golden letters &amp;#34;Dolce Vita, by Christian Dior&amp;#34; are nowhere to be found on the bottle I received.</li>

      <li>She loves the scent and wears it frequently.</li>
      <li>Also, my old bottle had Dolce Vita in Gold printed on the bottle and the Amazon version does not.</li>
      <li>It is a sexy, feminine scent which leaves subtle hints of your presence wherever you go.</li>
      <li>Scent does not stay very long, love this fragrance was my signature fragrance for years however not happy with the new formula just not the same.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so decided to give it a try.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dolce Vita has been my favorite perfume for years. I always receive compliments. It has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.</li>
    <li> A semi sweet fragrance it is extremely delicious, every girl I know who wears it, wears it so well. It is a sexy, feminine scent which leaves subtle hints of your presence wherever you go. Love this fragrance to death, its a must have on hand all the time.</li>
    <li> This cologne has more than doubled in price since I started to wear it, but I love it so much I&#x27;ll pay what it costs.  Lasts all day, and people always say - \\&quot;What is that you are wearing - it smells so good\\&quot;  -</li>
    <li> I believe this is the second time I have ordered this as a present for my wife. We both like it. (She for using it. Me for smelling it)  It is a quick and easy order and arrives promptly.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews and the notes, I really thought I would like this one. I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something a bit irritating to me - cardamon? Also, it&#x27;s a bit too rich in white florals, which I am very sensitive to in large doses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how many would like this - it&#x27;s a well-constructed modern oriental. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite perfume since its inception in 1996 - Christian Dior created one great fragrance.  I get compliments all the time when I&#x27;m wearing Dolce Vita.  Unfortunately, the  department stores in my area do not carry Dolce Vita so I&#x27;m grateful I was able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Purchase this for my wife and she loves it!  It has a very pleasant scent to it and is an attention getter!  A must for that special woman in your life.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It is the only one I will be using from now on.  When I run out of perfume I will  buy another!</li>
    <li> Got this as a surprise gift and my wife loves the floral fragrance that seems to last for most part of the day.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, and bought it for a friend because she loved it also. I was so excited to get such an Awesome price on it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Price was great.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when it comes on sale. :)</li>
    <li> This was mismarked. I got a GREAT deal. It smells delightful. But at the regular price I probably will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> So as many here have stated, the bottle and the packaging don&#x27;t look exactly like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;There is no engraved Dior name on the bottle and the box itself is has many differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be contacting Amazon as they were the seller, this was not purchased thru a third party. It looks like there have been enough complaints that they are reviewing whoever supplied them with this batch.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife when the priced dropped just before the holidays and she has been using it almost daily since.  I&#x27;m not going to pretend to describe the scent other than to say it come out of the bottle a bit overwhelming, but very quickly mellows and leaves a nice scent that I can detect hours later.</li>
    <li> Luv luv luv this scent.....hard to give a review on a scent but this is really a great everyday scent that is not too sweet..more earthy in my untrained opinion....not overwhelming by any means....and as I can no longer find it at the perfume counter I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com.....arrived on time and was as described and I really like this scent...</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I ordered two as a gift awhile back and one of the spray got cracked and the liquid was coming out a little bit.</li>
    <li> Dolce Vita is a sensuous sent for evening, or hot weather...it is musk-like, floral a heavier scent rather than citrus or light airy fragrances. Dior has good day fragrances like Diorissimo or the newer resort fragrances, Dolce Vita is more potent. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love to wear Christian Dior&#x27;s Dolce Vita Eau De Toilette!  This is my favorite perfume. I wish that I could purchase it in stores here in Idaho.  My husband loves the scent also. You can be assured that when the bottle I recently purchased is gone I will be ordering another.</li>
    <li> Bought this hoping it would be the real deal since it was sold by Amazon itself. Got it in the mail and it was a fake and not authentic.There was no label on the bottle whatsoever. The color was off and it just looked CHEAP! Glad I did not pay for this at full price because I would be pissed going through the hassle of shipping it back.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for over 17 years. Absolutely love it!,</li>
    <li> I fear I got duped for 120 dollars. The bottle has no description like my original does and the coloring is off. I will test it with one use and if the scent doesnt last then I know its a fake. I really hope I do not have to go through the trouble of sending it back.</li>
    <li> Bought the perfume for my wife, she knew it was a fake soon as she saw to bottle and the way it smell.</li>
    <li> Dolce Vita is a timeless frangrance. I first tried it years ago and continue to wear it. It&#x27;s is the 1 constant on my Christmas list.</li>
    <li> How do I describe this? A rich and beautiful Italian lady would wear this, it smells of gold and money,but not something to eat like some of my favorites. Floral,but not too overwhelming, a spring/summer fragrance.It smells like the \\&quot;sweet life\\&quot; for which it is named. I wear it once a week or so, end of April- July. A tiny spray is long lasting and can go to the workplace. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Scent does not stay very long, love this fragrance was my signature fragrance for years however not happy with the new formula just not the same.  But was nice of my husband to buy for me.  I would think twice about buying it again.</li>
    <li> I have not had this  perfume in a few years, I am so glad I ordered it. It is wonderful and on me it lasts through out most of the day</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  So sweet and clean!</li>
    <li> I bought a ton of items from Amazon and it is the first time they sent me a fake item. The perfume bottle doesn&#x27;t have any name or brand name on it, and the box doesn&#x27;t look like as image. The scent is weird  and not last. This is a gift for my wife so now what&#x27;s ashamed. I try to return Amazon but cannot because of stupid policy related to hazardous and flammable materials. What I have to do now ???&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Amazon</li>
    <li> Discovered this fragrance over 13 years ago. No longer in stores but can order online. It is a beautiful fragrance, expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> For being just a toilette spray, the fragrance is lasting.  The bottle is very pretty &amp; I love the essence. It&#x27;s a little pricey but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> lost it&#x27;s scent almost immediately</li>
    <li> smells heavenly .. amazing packaging !! I wear this is for my special occasions and events .. looks good in my dresser aswell</li>
    <li> I have always loved this perfume. Its strong so you have to be caustious about over doing it. I always get comments about its smell from clients and they are always favorable! Have used this perfume for about 15 years. Its very difficult to find in high end stores, infact I cant find it so resorted to Amazon. Im really greatful they carry it so I bought as big a bottle as I could afford!! It delivered quicker then they said so I was happy about that, bought it for my Christmas gift to myself!</li>
    <li> Dolce Vita has been my signature scent for many years and I would be lost without it. I get many compliments on it and wear it everyday. The bottle never has a label on it, but has a small sticker on the bottom. It is not a scent that Dior pushes but it is a classic that is very important to their brand. I have been fortunate to have always bought an authentic bottle, but feel that sometimes it takes time for the perfume to settle if it has been posted. Perfume is a very personal, individual thing and I am sure it is in our chemistry as to which perfumes are right for us. Having said that for those who have been disappointed in Dolce Vita please give it a second chance? It is nothing short of sublime!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this perfume in all the stores - Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, Sephora but it was not available.  I was so happy to find out that Amazon has it.  Without second thoughts, I placed an order and got my shipment so quickly. This my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume so I gave it as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for her. She was so overwhelmed and thought I would not find this perfume anymore.  This is an excellent perfume and very classic from Christian Dior!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve always loved this scent..A timeless wonderful perfume.The smell never grows old and it lasts through out the day.a definately good purchase</li>
    <li> my sister loves this sent. i got it for her for Xmas. i thought it would come in a plain box but i was presently surprised, it was in the original box. look like i bought it in the department store. love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume as a Christmas gift for my mom right before Christmas. She loves the scent and wears it frequently. I LOVED the price during this one-time only deal. I paid almost 70% less for  a 3.4oz bottle vs normal retailers. At the price of ~$25 it was no-brainer.</li>
    <li> This was one of the worst experiences of my life it was handled by a third-party with very negative results. Mhg</li>
    <li> I received imitation, not the original. Bottle didn&#x27;t have name and brand name written on it. Fragrance was little odd and didn&#x27;t last. I used to buy this one many years ago in Europe, was very happy ( it was original). This online purchase was a &amp;#34;fraud&amp;#34;, I needed to ship it back. Seller wanted to charge me a restocking fee 15% that was waived after I complained, if I was sent original as expected, I would not have to ship it back... I still had to pick up cost of shipping both ways. I took a pictures of a plain bottle, for a record, if needed. It can be compared to internet images of the fragrance bottle. Golden letters &amp;#34;Dolce Vita, by Christian Dior&amp;#34; are nowhere to be found on the bottle I received.</li>
    <li> I really used to LOVE this perfume years ago and it used to last all day. Unfortunately, this one purchased through Amazon DOES NOT SMELL LONG AT ALL! Very expensive for it not to stay on long. I regret my purchase and do not recommend buying this perfume. Also, my old bottle had Dolce Vita in Gold printed on the bottle and the Amazon version does not. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t get over this brand, I get it for her every year for Christmas</li>
    <li> Very nice perfume  and affordable. Wife loves it and if she is happy, so am I.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for over ten years and is becoming more difficult to find in the stores.  Everyone comments when I wear it and asks me what it is.  On me it is light, spicy and freshly floral, and stays with me for hours.  Still a good price also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for keeping it available for me.</li>
