    <li> This was a gift. Looked good to me so hope she liked it.</li>
    <li> I love this owl purse.  It is large enough to carry coins, bills and most used credit cards.  But not too big for your purse.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Size works well for me as I use it for my garage sale shopping days.  Has a secure closure, opens wide enough to easily remove money yet not so wide that it falls out.  Not so big that I&#x27;ve been able to slip it into jacket pockets securely but big enough not to loose.  It took awhile to receive but I knew that when ordering.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on how cute it is.</li>
    <li> MATCHES THEORY PURSE THAT I HAVE ALREADY.</li>
    <li> Very cute and looks just like the picture</li>

    <li> Very difficult to open and close.  Waste of $$</li>
    <li> Item came on time and packaged nicely.  I got this to put my chapsticks, lipsticks and other make up items that always get lost in my purse.  It&#x27;s cute.  The material seems sturdy and the clasp works nicely.  This will help me keep my stuff some what more organized in my purse.  It will make it easier to find my make-up items!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s an odd fabric. The owls are upside down on the back side. Seems fairly durable, and for what I paid, it&#x27;s just fine. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again tho.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this owl snap makeup bag!! it is exactly what I ordered, shipping did take a little longer than I had wanted (about 4 weeks) but for the price and the product I can&#x27;t complain!! I will definitely be purchasing one in every color!</li>

    <li> Came just as seller said it would.  Beautiful product. Very sturdy.  Used as a large change purse.  Holding up well.  Had it a few mths now.</li>
    <li> It is a nicer little purse for the money and I will probably use it as a gift at some point.</li>

    <li> Cheaply made. So much so I did not even donate them to a thrift store, just threw them away.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter collects owls. I got this for her. She actually keeps make up in it. But it can also be used as a little clutch.</li>

    <li> Cute purse!  I kept one and gave one away!  We love owls and this didn&#x27;t disappoint us. Nice to have a small purse to take along. It&#x27;s a little bigger than I expected but that&#x27;s a good thing; more space to store things! :)</li>
    <li> Good size for purse!  Big enough for cosmetics but can slip into purse.  Cute design of owls and looked just as pictured.  Took about a month to arrive but for that price who cares.  Did not have an odor like some products ordered from afar.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this and may order some more for gifts.</li>
