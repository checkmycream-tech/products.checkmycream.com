      <li>So glad I bought this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this gel.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, I will see more brighteningeffects.</li>
      <li>Also, my acne problem hasn&#x27;t got any better either.</li>
      <li>So far it has worked great.</li>
      <li>I love that it is fragrance free and that it doesn&#x27;t make my face peel or bleach my clothes like peroxide treatments.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ladies - my wife tried it out too and was so delighted with it we now use it twice as fast.</li>
      <li>I apply at night on a clean face, moisturize, and wake up to beautiful soft skin.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a delight to use every day, and smoothed my fine lines.</li>
      <li>I have medium to severe oil production, so I think this product would work better on mild to medium oil producers.</li>
      <li>Been using for a couple months now and not noticing huge results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product overall.  </li>
      <li>the fact that I don&#x27;t feel the need to layer concealer/foundation is great because that could help with preventing breakouts in the future.</li>
      <li>Pores are tightened and overall great exfoliating gel.</li>
      <li>Ive used all kinds of products from proactive to murals to acne free.</li>
      <li>It goes on light ads not sticky.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find the PTR acne gel here for a much lower price than what I pay at the popular beauty product place in the mall.</li>
      <li>It has significantly improved my acne.  </li>
      <li>I used it sparingly at first, then used more.</li>
      <li>I have tried acne medications for years, and this ohe is the most comfortable with decent results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, not greasy, no drying, made my skin feel fresh.</li>
      <li>I love these 2 products and don&#x27;t live without them!</li>
      <li>and so did I and needed one quickly.</li>
      <li>Most importantly - I have clear skin now, which I haven&#x27;t had in ages.</li>
      <li>- The ladies love a guy with a clean face and clear skin.</li>
      <li>my skin hasn&#x27;t been breaking out very much and my skin appears more even and  much smoother.</li>
      <li>This is a good product in that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and does not leave a sticky residue.  </li>
      <li>so much that I haven&#x27;t felt the need to wear much makeup(yes!!!)</li>
      <li>Must be the glycolic acid that shrinks the pores right away.</li>
      <li>this is also the first time I have ever bothered posting a review for any skin product, so that must be saying something.</li>
      <li>It really, really works!</li>
      <li>I put a layer of benzoyl on top of the clearing gel for big cysts around my chin and they disappear in days (compared to months!!,)</li>
      <li>Its really a panacea!</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for over 10 years and it never fails.</li>
      <li>The first 2 weeks made my face look like a zit bomb went off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to be as helpful as possible. :)</li>
      <li>so I think it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Keeps skin looking clean and clear and helps acne problems.</li>
      <li>but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO</li>
      <li>Pores are still large and I&#x27;m still breaking out.</li>
      <li>but you do have to find a balance NOT to dry out your skin too much as that would aggrevate the acne even more.</li>
      <li>, that is really embarassing!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I have used this serum after a 70% Lactic Acid peel and I didn&#x27;t experience much irritation.</li>
      <li>I use it daily &amp; take fish oil to help smooth acne scars.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>It really works to minimize breakouts.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>I have tried many things, and this product is the only one that keeps my skin consistently clear and yet supple.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin, so for it to dry out, and peel my skin, it gives you an idea of how strong this product is.</li>
      <li>This product was originally recommended to me by a local high-end cosmetics store at nearly twice the price.</li>
      <li>I suffer from large pores and monthly breakouts without intervention, but when I use PTR gel, my skin stays clear. :0)</li>
      <li>(Neutrogena willow bark cleanser or Cetaphil), toning (Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel), using this product, and then moisturizing (lately have been trying/loving MoringaConnect&#x27;s moringa oil).</li>
      <li>Even with the lower price, I&#x27;ll need to see if it is worth only having it for a couple of months.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if this would be good for somebody with dry skin as well.</li>
      <li>Consistently clears up the occasional acne I get!</li>
      <li>After applying it to my face, the skin immediately turns red with a hot burning feeling, although it goes away in about 15~20 mins, but i don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have any specific odor (which I like), and dries quickly, and keeps the skin relatively moist</li>
      <li>I bought this in hopes it would clear up what appears to be blocked pores (not from acne) on my forehead.  </li>
      <li>I have adult acne which is aggravated by exercise.  </li>
      <li>I have tried everything for my adult acne.</li>
      <li>This hasn&#x27;t completely taken away my acne, but has reduced it,</li>
      <li>My skin is smoother and brighter, the flakiness and oiliness around my nose has completely disappeared, and I have fewer blackheads.</li>
      <li>and I still get mistaken for a 14 or 15 year old, so I think Glycolic Acid does help with anti-aging.</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but Kojic Acid always manages to irritate me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a full time nursing student and the stress of nursing school ruins my skin.</li>
      <li>The product was very gentle on my skin, and didn&#x27;t dry it out or cause irritation.</li>
      <li>about 12 and no product has really helped in 17 years ( oily t zone with large pores and blackheads-very prone to breakouts, typically around nose/cheek/chin).</li>
      <li>I use this several years ago and went back to it, because it really works.</li>
      <li>Some didn&#x27;t work, some worked, but not great, some worked great but dried out my skin, made me itch, gave me a rash or peeled my skin</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve notice less milia and black heads on my jaw line (where they were the most noticeable)</li>
      <li>the Peter Thomas Roth Acne line is the only thing that has helped keep my face clear.</li>
      <li>The only treatment that keeps my skin clear.</li>
      <li>several years ago I started to have stuborn breakouts again and as an adult</li>
      <li>I only applied this once so far</li>
      <li>I know, it&#x27;s kind of scary of thinking to use an oil when having acne, but this oil has been used by maroccan women for centuries.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have stubborn acne and my skin is prone to scarring big time. Peter Thomas Roth AHA/BHA Acne Clearing Gel keeps my acne under control and improved my skin&#x27;s complexion. I put a layer of benzoyl on top of the clearing gel for big cysts around my chin and they disappear in days (compared to months!!,) so I think it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stop my acne. I tried it for 6 weeks, and my acne didn&#x27;t go away. However it didn&#x27;t get worse, and my pimple size seem to shrink when I used it. I used it twice a day, and upped it to 3 times per day the last 2 weeks. The product was very gentle on my skin, and didn&#x27;t dry it out or cause irritation. I have medium to severe oil production, so I think this product would work better on mild to medium oil producers. I have tried acne medications for years, and this ohe is the most comfortable with decent results. I would suggest people go to Euphoria and get a sample, then buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product in that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and does not leave a sticky residue.  It is not a miracle gel but does help in preventing additional breakouts.</li>
    <li> If you have acne and don&#x27;t want to have it anymore, use this product.  I have tried many things, and this product is the only one that keeps my skin consistently clear and yet supple.  This product doesn&#x27;t have any specific odor (which I like), and dries quickly, and keeps the skin relatively moist (i.e. it&#x27;s definitely not dry, and there is no &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; of the skin).  I am very happy with this product and will keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but a little goes a long way.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have peroxide, so your towels will not get stained.  It&#x27;s a great product overall.  Most importantly - I have clear skin now, which I haven&#x27;t had in ages.</li>
    <li> I use this several years ago and went back to it, because it really works. I apply at night on a clean face, moisturize, and wake up to beautiful soft skin. A little goes a long way, so it lasts forever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a week. I apply it to my face and neck twice a day in the morning and the evening. My skin is smoother and brighter, the flakiness and oiliness around my nose has completely disappeared, and I have fewer blackheads. I also think my pores look a little smaller, just a little. I can&#x27;t speak on this gel&#x27;s ability to stop pimples because I&#x27;m menstruating and I&#x27;ll develop pimples no matter what I use. I haven&#x27;t had any burning or irritation when used after my regular cleanser. I have experienced burning, redness, and peeling on the first day I tried this, but I used it after my Kojic Acid soap so I expected that to happen. My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but Kojic Acid always manages to irritate me. I don&#x27;t have the same issue with Lactic Acid. I have used this serum after a 70% Lactic Acid peel and I didn&#x27;t experience much irritation. The bit of tingling I felt disappeared once I applied my moisturizer. I&#x27;ve stopped using the Kojic Acid soap and the Lactic Acid peel since Glycolic Acid can brighten the skin and even out the skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read on skin care blogs that Glycolic Acid helps to stimulate collagen and elastin production and increases cell turnover. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so I don&#x27;t know if this can help with that, but I&#x27;m 25 and I still get mistaken for a 14 or 15 year old, so I think Glycolic Acid does help with anti-aging. I should mention that I&#x27;ve used weekly at-home Glycolic Acid peels for about two years, but I&#x27;m discontinuing use while I&#x27;m using this product. This gel contains 10% Glycolic Acid and I apply it twice daily so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to use this and weekly peels. I don&#x27;t know how this will react with retinol-containing products because I have never used retinol. I should probably start though since I&#x27;m getting up there in age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again when I run out. I will update this review when I have used this gel for at least a month. Hopefully, I will see more brighteningeffects. I plan to start a 20% Vitamin C serum soon and I will include information on irritation from using these two products together. I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C serums with Salicylic Acid toners and Glycolic Acid peels in the past, but the Vitamin C concentration wasn&#x27;t as high as the serum I plan to purchase. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll experience any irritation though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review. I&#x27;m trying to be as helpful as possible. :)</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product from a friend. So far it has worked great. I have adult acne, so I am frustrated and willing to try anything. I have gone to the Dr, tried acid peels, everything you can think of, I have tried. This hasn&#x27;t completely taken away my acne, but has reduced it, ALOT. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is, that it dried my skin out. I have oily skin, so for it to dry out, and peel my skin, it gives you an idea of how strong this product is. But I found a good moisturizer and, problem gas gone away.  I recommend this product to anyone suffering from Acne.</li>
    <li> Really effective and not drying</li>
    <li> I would have gave  it 5 stars but it makes you break out for a 2 weeks I guess to get all toxins out, but after those two weeks it&#x27;s clears up your skin and minimizes pores alot!</li>
    <li> I only applied this once so far and it shrunk my pores immediately! Must be the glycolic acid that shrinks the pores right away. I used it this morning as base before I put my make up on and my skin looks so much better already! It even gives you a nice glow! No stinging, no smell, no drying and it feels very light! I have very oily skin so I&#x27;m not sure if this would be good for somebody with dry skin as well. So far I&#x27;m really impressed!</li>
    <li> This product was originally recommended to me by a local high-end cosmetics store at nearly twice the price. I have had a pesky blackhead problem on my nose for years and have tried lots of products (nose strips are 100% useless). I started using this product once a day after careful facial cleansing and those pesky blackheads were finally GONE after about one month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys - The ladies love a guy with a clean face and clear skin. Give it a shot if you have this minor problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies - my wife tried it out too and was so delighted with it we now use it twice as fast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other reviews, but this is simply not working for me. After applying it to my face, the skin immediately turns red with a hot burning feeling, although it goes away in about 15~20 mins, but i don&#x27;t like it. Also, my acne problem hasn&#x27;t got any better either.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my adult acne. Some didn&#x27;t work, some worked, but not great, some worked great but dried out my skin, made me itch, gave me a rash or peeled my skin, some made my skin raw, some were too greasy … I can go on and on. This product is the only one that was a miracle. No acne, no dry skin, no oiliness, no scent. It&#x27;s light, not greasy, no drying, made my skin feel fresh. It&#x27;s a delight to use every day, and smoothed my fine lines. What more can you ask? LOVE Peter Thomas Roth products. The BEST!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to find the PTR acne gel here for a much lower price than what I pay at the popular beauty product place in the mall. However, when it arrived, I noticed that it expires only 2 months from now.  My last purchase from the beauty store expired over a year from when I bought it.  Even with the lower price, I&#x27;ll need to see if it is worth only having it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s hard to find an AHA/BHA serum with the acid strenghts this one offers. Great texture, looks great under makeup.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff if you have acne! I love Thomas Roth Products!! It isn&#x27;t over drying either but only if your skin in combination type if skin!</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple months now and not noticing huge results.  Pores are still large and I&#x27;m still breaking out.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference in skin. I bought this in hopes it would clear up what appears to be blocked pores (not from acne) on my forehead.  I was a little concern it would dry out my skin as I am in my 50&#x27;s. It did not dry out my skin nor  did it improve my skin on my forehead. I used it sparingly at first, then used more. It was like putting water on my skin. - No change for the better or worse.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this gel. I ran out of face wash (Peter Thos as well, Beta Hydroxy Acid 2% Acne Wash) and this gel, and my skin started breaking out pretty badly. I got the soap and the gel again, and my skin cleared in 3 days using them in the am and pm. I love these 2 products and don&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks and have noticed that my breakouts are not as bad  as before. No strong odors and no irritation.  doesn&#x27;t over dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used everything Clinique, Murad, ProActive, Philosophy, things for doctors, you name it I&#x27;ve tried it and the Peter Thomas Roth Acne line is the only thing that has helped keep my face clear.</li>
    <li> Ive used all kinds of products from proactive to murals to acne free. None had worked like this. I use it daily &amp; take fish oil to help smooth acne scars. I havent had a breakout since!!! Loving it! Female age 41, dealt with medium acne since age 16.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this PTR product for about 3 years and my acne has substantially reduced to occasional breakouts on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;In my teenage years, I tried several rounds of antibiotics and even accutane, which did help and my acne subsided for several year.&lt;br /&gt;But several years ago I started to have stuborn breakouts again and as an adult, that is really embarassing!&lt;br /&gt;My skin response well to the salicylic acid in this product, but you do have to find a balance NOT to dry out your skin too much as that would aggrevate the acne even more. To balance out, I use the Vitaville argan oil, which has amazing healing and anti-inflammatory properties. I know, it&#x27;s kind of scary of thinking to use an oil when having acne, but this oil has been used by maroccan women for centuries. Beside this PTR product and the argan oil, I also do once a week a fruit peel, which helps to slug off dead skin cell so that all the products really penetrate into the skin rather than sitting on the surface.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne which is aggravated by exercise.  I used this all over my face and neck twice a day after using the Peter Thomas Hydroxy Acid wash.  It has significantly improved my acne.  I love that it is fragrance free and that it doesn&#x27;t make my face peel or bleach my clothes like peroxide treatments.</li>
    <li> The only treatment that keeps my skin clear. I&#x27;m a full time nursing student and the stress of nursing school ruins my skin. This stuff keeps the inflammation (read: acne) that I can&#x27;t control with diet and hydration in check. Thank goodness for this product!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin. But this is a gel so it never makes me break out. It has a good sting. I put it on twice a day. I&#x27;ve noticed that it also lightens my dark spots because of the glycolic acid/peeling agents. Its really a panacea!</li>
    <li> Consistently clears up the occasional acne I get! I shared it with my sister, who was getting hormonal acne pretty badly and it helped her a lot too. I use this in my night time routine of washing with soap (Neutrogena willow bark cleanser or Cetaphil), toning (Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel), using this product, and then moisturizing (lately have been trying/loving MoringaConnect&#x27;s moringa oil).</li>
    <li> I used this product before and Ididn&#x27;t buy it again until now because the store ran out and so did I and needed one quickly. So I waited until I ran out of the other brand and am buying this again because I know it works!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I decided to purchase this product again after trying some others which were more reasonably priced - for my skin this just does the trick like nothing else.  I suffer from large pores and monthly breakouts without intervention, but when I use PTR gel, my skin stays clear. :0)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about 2X a day for the last 2 weeks and have noticed a change in my skin after only a  few days. I have had acne since I was about 12 and no product has really helped in 17 years ( oily t zone with large pores and blackheads-very prone to breakouts, typically around nose/cheek/chin). while this has not fixed my acne 100%, it has helped the overall appearance of my skin(no new breakouts other than a few whiteheads that have gone away in a few hours) so much that I haven&#x27;t felt the need to wear much makeup(yes!!!). my skin hasn&#x27;t been breaking out very much and my skin appears more even and  much smoother. the fact that I don&#x27;t feel the need to layer concealer/foundation is great because that could help with preventing breakouts in the future. maybe perfect skin isn&#x27;t in the cards for me, but this is the first product I have ever used where I saw results and made me feel good about my skin. this is also the first time I have ever bothered posting a review for any skin product, so that must be saying something.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product. It really works to minimize breakouts. It goes on light ads not sticky.</li>
    <li> So I dunno if it&#x27;s hormones or what the heck happened but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO my skin SUCKS. I have acne that would rival any teen boy. I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief. I like that the products have medicated and homeopathic aspects to support them. They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets. I will be a repeat customer - oh and a little goes a long way.....</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 10 years and it never fails. Keeps skin looking clean and clear and helps acne problems. Pores are tightened and overall great exfoliating gel. The PTR line of products works extremely well for men!</li>
    <li> I love this!  I get really bad black heads and milia clogged pores on on my jaw line, on my neck and chin. The first 2 weeks made my face look like a zit bomb went off. Worst acne since highschool! I was very disappointed , and at first i thought I would send it back, but then decided I&#x27;d gave it one more week with the same results.  The 3rd week my skin started clearing up and I&#x27;ve notice less milia and black heads on my jaw line (where they were the most noticeable)</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this product. It really, really works!</li>
    <li> Did not work and was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years this provents pimples and keep skin looking beautiful. I never seen 3.4 oz before but more of this great product.. I always see the 2oz size never this size.. This is a top of the line product at a great price..</li>
