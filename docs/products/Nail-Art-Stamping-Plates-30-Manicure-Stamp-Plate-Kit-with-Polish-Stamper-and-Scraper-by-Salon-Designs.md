<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> cant wait to fill my  book up with my stamps</li>
    <li> Great product just remember to take off the blue protective cover before using.</li>
    <li> I love it! It was such a great deal for a great price. I use it all the time and love the variety.</li>
    <li> The scraper that came with this doesn&#x27;t cleanly remove the polish from the little disks and the residual polish transfers to the design.  I will experiment with other improvised tools to see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use once you get the hang of it. Sally Hansen Insta-dri is some of the best stamping polish</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for everyone! it came in perfect conditions and just how i pictured it! I love it !</li>
    <li> They are really small and not for full nail designs at all. But the designs are very nice for getting artistic with how you apply them so that&#x27;s a plu . Stamper itself seemed to not work well even after priming.</li>
    <li> The nail art stamping  comes in different models, I like it because it is easier to make designs on your nails, even though one should look for a glaze that has strong tone to make it precise design. They come about 3 models repeated stamping nail art. I&#x27;ve already done some designs. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a very bright Ideal i like these when my grand kids come over we play with this and do one anothers nails</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing, it says that there is 30 manicure plate set, but some of the plates are exactly the same as others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d put two stars just in case it&#x27;s user error but I couldn&#x27;t get it to do what it said it would do and I tried several times!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. I ordered the 30-piece set. Despite some negative reviews, the only downfall the product had in my opinion was two plates were duplicated (which was fine, as I gave them to a friend). It&#x27;s very easy to use, having never tried one before. Follow the directions provided, and you&#x27;ll get good results. Lots of cute and even elegant designs. There are about 7 designs per plate. The stamper and scraper are very easy to clean, too. I can&#x27;t wait to try more designs.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great. Just be sure to take off the blue protective wrap first</li>
    <li> So Many images to chose from ! Great to add to anyones nail collection</li>
    <li> So, I bought this a bit concerned because of the comments that I had read. But to be honest it works just fine. You do have to practice to get it just right. Over all a give it +A.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the edges werent sanded down so I sliced a nasty gash along the whole length of my finger...&lt;br /&gt;But, all it took was some sanding and they weren&#x27;t dangerous anymore, and they really are such a great deal that I wouldn&#x27;t let it discourage you from buying.</li>
    <li> Its alright for what its suppose to do.. The designs were great bcoz its varied. The stamper although is tough.. Transfer is a bit difficult.</li>
    <li> These suck!! The grooves arent deep enough. I used 6 different brand polishes and all dried by the time I got to stamping the nail. The grooves are too shallow the polish dries too quickly. You have to go way to fast to beat the polish drying. And even then the image never fully comes out.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves these she uses them on herself and her friends and they enjoy using them all the time.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! There are so many designs to choose from, its perfect.!</li>
    <li> so far so good these arrived in bout 3 days and just as i expected  for the price they r cute i got the 30 plates and i dnt seem to have any duplicates but have lots of flower patterns lol i tried on my daughters nails n it transfers easy but i need more practice ..... like everyone else says u must do it quickly before it dries on the stamper and use an old debit card dnt use the metal one it comes with it WILL scratch your plates i work nights so ill be trying this on myself  later 😊</li>
    <li> The kit doesn&#x27;t work at all ... The polish nail doesn&#x27;t stik to the stamp .... Even one star its a lot to give .... I just list some money ....</li>
    <li> This is a very nice kit and you get a lot of wonderful designs. They are nicely etched and all of the ones I have tried stamp great.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because out of the 30..............5 were all the same plate, then I had one the 3 were the same , another had 4 the same.....................so even though it was still an o k price for 21 designs,  3 of them were Japanese? letters or something?  I doubt I will wear those since I don&#x27;t know what they say. so I guess that leaves a total of 18 usable plates!!!&lt;br /&gt;However the plates that I did get were really nice and stamp wonderfully,  I think I got a few more duplicates than most people, so all and all I do not think it is probably a bad deal,  Just wish I did not get sooooo many I useless ones (12 is quite a lot to have to just give away or discard)</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the images on the these plates. Hard to stamp with a clean image. This was my first set so I was okay to get me started.</li>
    <li> This product was basically what you see is what you get except I had atleast 2 plates repeated which is disappointing since I had other options on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great with starter kit. I appreciated the reviews and recommended products</li>
    <li> I bought this set the plates look wonderful but the stamper was broke into peices it had missing pieces so i couldn&#x27;t glue it back together and the scraper was bent so dont choose ship items together</li>
    <li> The blade was broken when I received it, so the paint doesnt swipe off. The rest is just ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the plates, or my pollish.  I&#x27;ve tried several different types of pollish.  Most of the stamps barely even show up.  They dry very fast on the template, before you can even get them on the stamper.  I am going to continue to practice with these and maybe I&#x27;ll be able to figure it out.  I  have found so far that wet n wild polish seems to work the best with these.</li>
    <li> These are nice designs. The plates did have some scratches and the designs weren&#x27;t engraved deep enough which makes it hard to get a good design on the stamp. It took me a long time to get the results I wanted.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing, great designs and Stamper works perfectly (scraper, not really) But still, five stars 😊</li>
    <li> Fun to use but repeating patterns.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t get the image. After several trys they still didn&#x27;t work. Its like its a metal plate and they just stamped pictures on them. There is no groove to hold the image.... Ugh waste of $12 The package came quickly. One star.</li>
    <li> reached perfectly, which is what I got paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good I will continue purchasing this product has been very good</li>
    <li> Not what was expected</li>
    <li> This s*** doesn&#x27;t work! I watched trials on Youtube and everything. Also I can tell mines had been used then just thrown back in the box and sent to me. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am loving these!! Reason for 4 stars is not all of them work, but most do. They work well with non stamping polish. No issues with the stamper.</li>
    <li> not worth the purchase, they dont work, I have tried with several polish and they dont stick to the plate, the one to clean the excess takes all the polish away,sad with this one</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for the wife.  She only likes a few of the imprints.  There are alot to choose from though, so you may find more of them enjoyable to wear.  She does go through alot more polish as she tries to get the image positioned correctly.  Nothing too terrible as she has gotten better with practice.  If youre one to do youre nail while bored, this kit will definitely give you some new options to try out.</li>
    <li> a lot of the same styled designs. the stamp isn&#x27;t that great and doesn&#x27;t stop accurately, unless im just bad at using it. the plates are really sharp so be careful! wish it came in a more sturdy case or something because the plates just scratch each other if you don&#x27;t find something to put it in. comes exactly like the picture in a clear bag thing...</li>
    <li> you cannot beat this price for so many plates, plus you get a stamper.Dont forget to pick up the&amp;#34; Pueen Nail Stamp Leather Case Holder&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Wish it had better designs.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Love the designs i got. Didnt get any repeats or broken plates.</li>
    <li> I received 30 plates with about 6 designs on each plate. I have been successful at time and at times I haven&#x27;t. I have over 200 bottles of regular polish I have noticed the thicker and richer the color the better the chance you have of getting a design to stamp on your nails. I started with a natural design... Just clear nails with a white stamp... which was Sinful Collection Snow White. I have also used Klean Kolor polish for stamping.. I am awaiting for the Konad polish to come. I takes time and patience. If you don&#x27;t have either of those you won&#x27;t succeed in nail stamping. You need a quality stamping polish made specifically for stamping .</li>
    <li> This stamp design are okay... The only thing that you have to keep practicing into you get it right. Sometimes it could  be frustrated like they say practice makes perfect the stamp that comes with the stamp kit works really good in some reviews they say that the stamp don&#x27;t work very good for me it did work great... dont use the  small scraper use a busnisse card it work very nice and smooth and won&#x27;t scrape or damage your plates design</li>
    <li> I am like my new stamping tool. However I am still learning how to use it. Into which it does not seem very hard to do so. I am just having a hard time to get the color to go on a little brighter. In overall its a got tool</li>
    <li> Some of the stamping plates are not as &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; as the more expensive brands, resulting in some of the images&#x27; details not stamping on to nail as well. For the price it is not bad.  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than kind and you get the same product!</li>
    <li> Some of the designs are not deep enough to use but for the most part they work great it is easy to use and looks great. It doesn&#x27;t have very many holiday designs so don&#x27;t expect those in these. Overall I was very pleased</li>
    <li> Me and my kids live these!  It&#x27;s so much easier than going to a salon and spending extra money.</li>
    <li> My stamper isn&#x27;t even picking up the polish, no matter how gently or firmly that I press or roll it on the plate I either get NO images or at best partial. I clean both the stamper and plates. This was a gift from my boyfriend and it sucks because I I&#x27;ve tried over and over and over and over to make it work to no avail.  I&#x27;ve just gone back to making my own nail wraps with clear polish, colored polish,  and a plastic sheet protector. Once my design dries and I clear coat it on and let it set. Totally a pain considering I asked for the stamp kit to skip all those steps. Is there a better stamp I should use?</li>
    <li> I had used one of these at my nieces house so I knew what I was getting but, I really like it and was pleased with how quick I got it.</li>
    <li> It could be just me but I&#x27;m usually good with nails but I can only get these to work some of the time. I think maybe the discs are too shallow or the stamper isn&#x27;t big enough or maybe I&#x27;m not using the right nail polish (although I tried it with a few different brands)</li>
    <li> love all the different images that you get with this package.</li>
    <li> Does not transfer the stamp...at all.</li>
    <li> I have so much fun with this. Even my daughters are excited when I get the stencils out and use them. However the metal scraper is not that great and I use an old credit card :) doesn&#x27;t wreck the stencil</li>
    <li> Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it. What we wanted. Very good everything I expected. comprenlo - guaranteed.</li>
    <li> i was excited when i got this product. but it really needs a lot of skill to make it work perfectly on your nails. the scraper doesn&#x27;t work well, so i used an old credit card as advised on the internet. the stamper doesn&#x27;t always collect the entire pattern, so got to be care with that. but the designs / patterns on the plates are really cute and suitable for any occasion.</li>
    <li> This is my first stamping kit and I was impressed with the variety of designs. I researched on YouTube on how to properly use them and suggest others to do the same. Another reviewer gave great tips on storing these stamping plates so they won&#x27;t get scratched. I used snack size zip lock bags or you can utilize and old cd holder. If you are afraid of scratching the plates with the metal scraper, use an old credit card.</li>
    <li> This is such a cute idea.  I had never heard of it before.  Then came across it when I was looking for other nail supplies.  It works good with my own nail polish.  Receive several compliments on my nails when I have the stamp designs on them.  Everyone wants to know how I did it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 10yr old daughter for Christmas. Package had been ripped open so I wasn&#x27;t happy about that. There are no instructions so we will have to look online for instructions or something.  Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but looking at it we wonder how in the world it even works.</li>
    <li> This kit is an awesome value!! Konad stamping plates run about 7$ a piece! These plates seem to be about the same quality &amp; same sort of designs for a fraction of the price. Each plate arrived with a blue plastic protective film over the design side, no scratches on the actual designs. I had about 5 dupe plates which I don&#x27;t think is that big of a deal, still a great deal!! I wouldn&#x27;t use the metal scraper that it comes with, it will scratch your plates. It also don&#x27;t come with a plate holder (a piece of plastic that holds the plate still while you use it). I guess you don&#x27;t really need that but I really like the one that came with my Konad kit. I do belive you can get a similar set (stamp holder, stamper, and all plastic scraper) on Amazon for about 5$. Over all think this kit is great, and I highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok,not etched very deep&lt;br /&gt;And I got doubles of almost all of them&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping they&#x27;d all be different&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> These are absolutely amazing for the price. Best deal I have seen for the amount of plates you get. Went looking for stamping kit when I saw the “As seen on Tv” one, received this and I am excited to try out all the different designs. It works good. Receive several compliments on my nails when I have the stamp designs on them. Everyone wants to know how I did it.</li>
    <li> I do not have a basis of comparison for my review but in my opinion it is just ok. The scraper is not straight across and that makes for streaks when I scrape the plate also the plates are not very deep and it is very hard to apply jut enough pressure to make a good impression of the design. I just bought another kit to see if it is just me or if the plates I got here are extra shallow. Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> 30 plates and only 2 duplicates.  I guess that&#x27;s not bad.  But I think NO duplicates would have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected some chinese characters plates, and not able to read chinese myself I knew I would NEVER use them.  But for them to be the duplicates is very disappointing.  And YES, I can&#x27;t read chinese, BUT YES I can also see that the characters are IDENTICAL to the other plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave the duplicates to my husband so he can use them as target practice.  Only took 10 seconds for him to give me back fragments of metal barely recognizable of anything manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the duplicates, the plates have decent images and are very easy to use.  The scraping device is not perfectly level so I use a credit card instead.  Works much better.  Also be sure to get a PUEEN plate case to hold all your plates in so they don&#x27;t get scratched and damaged.</li>
    <li> Images not deeply etched</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all 👎🏻</li>
    <li> I bought this product to start nail tutorials and found that the stamper does not work. It picked up parts of the plate set and refused to print onto my nails. I tried pressing it cleaning the stamper and even trying it out on a piece of paper until i gave up. I even bought konad stamping polish and nail set to try again but no avail. Horrible product!!</li>
    <li> Great price! Loving it too!! Compare for other product it is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it to my friends 😀</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughters, is of excellent quality and is being widely used at this time. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> I tried everything that other reviewers have suggested for making this work and nothing worked for me. I filled the stamper, used an old credit card for the scraper, tried several types of nail polishes and I never got a good stamp. I love the plates so I&#x27;ll keep those and maybe try another stamper that has good reviews. If I do get a stamper to work I&#x27;ll come back and edit my review because I feel like the plates are well worth the price of this product on their own if they work with another stamper.</li>
    <li> As I suspected the plates did not work as well as the Konad plates I have.  For the price I thought why not and now I see why.</li>
    <li> Pretty great if you are just trying out stamping it will come with duplicate plates. the scrapper doesn&#x27;t work well but you can use an old gift card.</li>
    <li> same plate designs on most of them, stamping is not as advertised. would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Out of 30 plates, 2 were duplicates, still a great deal for the price.  Used with regular polish, metallic polishes worked without a problem, dollar store polishes sometimes required thickening (corn starch works for that).</li>
    <li> This is really difficult to use.. and messy!!! It doesn&#x27;t really work well at all. More work than it is worth. I was able to get it sort of... but it didn&#x27;t look very nice.</li>
    <li> They Works rally good if u are a beginner ur gonna have to try and try is a Little hard to use it bit u get use to it i recomend this</li>
    <li> I purchased another (longer, less generic looking) stamper to go with this but I love the selection of designs in this kit. Lots to choose from.</li>
    <li> A lot  of the stamping plates in this set stamps well when used with stamping polish. There are a few (4) that I have not been able to get a clear image from.  I mean for the price this is great.</li>
    <li> The item didn&#x27;t work.  The scraper did not properly remove the nail polish from the plate so you could get a clean transfer.  It also had some plastic on the scraper.</li>
    <li> My kids have a hard time figuring out how to stamp entire design on nail.  But overall I&#x27;m happy because they were cheap!!</li>
    <li> Art does not transfer well. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the stamp or the polish for the art but it really does not work.</li>
    <li> The scraper did not rub off the metal plate well and the stamper did not pick up the polish left in grooves.  I was VERY disappointed.  It did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I expected to get duplicates when you buy in bundles but I only got 3 duplicates which won&#x27;t go to waste because I have a sister and 2 daughters that will love them, all the plates have 7 designs on them with the exception of the alphabet plates that have half the alphabets on each plates, I got 31 plates instead of 30 a great plus, the designs are deep,for a good impression, I got the stamp and scrapper,the price was right and it came in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not particularly skilled or crafty, so when my daughter asked me to order these I foresaw disaster. They&#x27;re actually really easy to use with a nice variety of designs. She now has very cute zebra striped toes and it was fast and easy.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that we would have good luck with this like some of the reviewers, but unfortunately we haven&#x27;t.  We can get some of the designs to work, but not most.  It&#x27;s a lot of work and a lot of trial and error.  Mostly error.</li>
    <li> Saw similar at our local fair is Sept.  at $47.00... No way ! looked on Amazon.com when we got home. Found this for under $15 and that was with shipping!  LOVE IT! its so much fun to play around with, I&#x27;m still having trouble sometimes placing it on my nail and I would recommend find a bigger stamper, the one included is really small its hard to hold. I&#x27;ve used this handy dandy little gadget more in my crafts then on my nails but I&#x27;m still learning.</li>
    <li> This stamping kit works well and is very cheap. It&#x27;s a really easy way to get fancy-looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the 30 plates were repeats, so that was a little sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having trouble, make sure to try different polishes-- some are better than others. Also, it seems like one side of the scraper works better than others. Even if there are some streaks left on the plate, they usually don&#x27;t transfer to my nail.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift, and from what I could tell everything worked as described. The scraper that came with the kit takes off too much of the excess polish, but using an old gift card to scrape it with worked excellent!</li>
    <li> I really like what I got, but I am having problems using it.  I went on youtube to get some pointers on how to use it properly and I am sure with practice I will get it down.  The product itself is great!  It comes with a lot of different designs.  The scraper and stamper are adequate as well.  I am happy with this purchase and will be a stamping master in no time!</li>
    <li> Price was right had a few repeated but overall good buy</li>
    <li> It was horrible. Don&#x27;t buy it it is a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> Got this for my 11 year old girl. She is so happy and it turned out good on her nails.&lt;br /&gt;Way better then getting her a fake nail kit.&lt;br /&gt;now if they had something to clean up the nail polish she spilled would be grate</li>
    <li> The scraper doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> Very few of the designs come out clearly. The plates are not deep enough.&lt;br /&gt;The stamper and scraper are garbage.&lt;br /&gt;The blue film is a nightmare to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> If there was 0 stars to review this product I would give that couldn&#x27;t use one plate and since I have opened the package I can&#x27;t return it ! So $12 bucks is still something. This product is very bad quality and the plates don&#x27;t clean nicely and absolutely don&#x27;t stamp at all . Am surprised that some girls here actually used this cause for me it doesn&#x27;t work! Use your own judgment but be aware that you mite lose your money. With some things cheap  is not way to go , if you want a good stamper this one is No!No! Go!</li>
    <li> these stamps are great for the nail. they make for some very cool nail designs Awesome and easy to use. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I tried many kinds of nail polish so it wouldn&#x27;t dry too fast.  The &amp;#34;nail wrap&amp;#34; kind works the best but it&#x27;s very hard to see where the design is going.  Then it&#x27;s still see through.  I&#x27;ll stick with decals &amp; stickers.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Complete disappointment!  Too bad it was a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I loved this stamping kit. It came with lots on designs. Plates were easy to use and so far none had scratches on them.  I thought they were a great deal from the money.</li>
    <li> I got these because I already got a different kit that had only 7 plates and they worked well, so I figured I would get more so I have more styles for more occasions. Only bad part, but not a big deal, there were two identical plates in the pack. That&#x27;s not bad considering there are 30 in a bag only 2 were the same.</li>
    <li> These didnt work very well. The stamp wasnt dark enough. The blade was bent. :( I would never buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I have used this quite a bit and I just got it recently the make doing nail art so simple and easy! Love them!</li>
    <li> bought it ,,, tried it couple times... gave up, doesn&#x27;t transfer nicely if at all. waste of money. so be smart save the hassles troubles n excitment and save your money</li>
    <li> This is for my GF, she bought it she loved it. It looks like a nice kit, nice for your gfs</li>
    <li> This kit is lots of fun and gives very professional results after a little practice.  Good selection of the plates.</li>
    <li> I love this kit. It&#x27;s a great price considering what I paid for my first kit. I did get some duplicate plates but only two styles. I would liked to have gotten more full nail and french nail plates but for the price I&#x27;m really not going to complain.</li>
    <li> This does not work! I&#x27;ve used stamps in the past, and I lost them. So I figured these were fairly cheap I try them out!  DO NOT BUY THESE!  The stamps are not deep enough and the scraper just takes all the polish off!</li>
    <li> I got at least one double by that&#x27;s fine as you still have lots of options to choose from. Some are not so enough for the Polish to go into. But still lots  of options. I&#x27;m still trying them out</li>
    <li> Love all the designs! &amp; ALL plates are different! Fast shipment! Would reccomend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these work as advertised.  It takes much practice to apply these stamps but is a worthwhile investment for passing the time for a little girl.</li>
    <li> First off be careful with the edges of the plates...konad would have been a better buy because the edges wont cut you....make sure you have the right polish or the design won&#x27;t stick...</li>
    <li> Love the designs, would order again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic set you get so many options! I would definetly buy this again just to have extra plates! Very good shipping time!</li>
    <li> It has many choices but many are the same and it very very hard to get the stamp in the place you want it, and I wasted a lot of my polish trying to get the stamp to work.</li>
    <li> Ok - scraper is harsh, better to use old plastic gift card - other than that, this looks like a lot of fun - my niece and I will enjoy creating designs with this.</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter and she loves it. However some were a double and the scraper is no good. The metal part is rough and will not scrape well but if you use the one from konad&#x27;s, it will work fine. Definitely still recommend and just use a better scraper. Also shipping was fast and arrived early.</li>
    <li> So, After reading all of the reviews I took the plunge and got this set but mostly for the stamping plates.&lt;br /&gt;Because I did read the reviews I was not disappointed and they were exactly as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a review of this item let me first start out saying that as all the other reviews state: The Konad Stamping tool is much more superior. Softer Rubber tip so the polish glides over the nail much smoother, plus both ends of the tool are stamp pads giving you a small and a large stamp to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates themselves:&lt;br /&gt;Of the 30 included:&lt;br /&gt;10 of them were duplicates&lt;br /&gt;5 were chipped on the edges causing cut fingers.&lt;br /&gt;But using an overly rough piece of sand paper I was able to get rid of the sharp parts then coated those edges with clear polish. They don’t look so pretty any more but they still work.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they are what they are supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraping tool:&lt;br /&gt;Chipped and useless&lt;br /&gt;Again, as with other reviews, a debit/credit or gift card works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stamping tool:&lt;br /&gt;One size stamping end&lt;br /&gt;Hard and stiff rubber, makes it hard to press or roll over your nail since there is no give&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the Design Template Plates – Even if 1/3 of them were duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;Making them $0.65 apiece when you take $12.99 / 20 (Less the duplicates)&lt;br /&gt;But if you think about it, the duplicates do make for a nice give away gift to my soon to be 13 year old niece who loves to play with mine when she comes over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stamping tool was useless and it is worth the extra money to buy the Konad Stamping tool.&lt;br /&gt;Just toss the scraping tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, because I did read the reviews I was not overly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others as long as they knew what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;It does get 4 stars because I do like the Design Template Plates (That is what the 4 stars say, 3 is the item is okay but again I do like it)  – Even if 1/3 of them were duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and have fun with your new kit if you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day.&lt;br /&gt;T~e item is okay but again I do like it)  – Even if 1/3 of them were duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and have fun with your new kit if you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day.&lt;br /&gt;T~</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well. My friend has one that I used and it is great. I&#x27;m wondering of the designs aren&#x27;t etched in very deep on the metal because it is hard to get the stamp to get the image on it. Maybe I just need to use a certain type of nail polish, but the kind I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t show up very well. Will keep trying because I love the designs. I also wish there were a few more stamps with holiday designs.</li>
    <li> this makes my nails look so beautiful and professional! Granted there are two or three repeats in the stack, but it is still a better deal than any stamping plate kit you could find on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stamp very well, I suggest another brand name.</li>
    <li> All the plates were delivered, all with very cute designs and I was very surprised that each and every one of them had a rapping for protection. I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> I really like the nail stamping set. But it was a little harder to use than I thought. It is hard to get the design off of the plate onto the rubber stamper. I would still buy it but I just wish it was easier to use.</li>
    <li> Sooooo..... NOT very happy with this, maybe I was expecting too much I&#x27;m not sure but not a fan of this :(&lt;br /&gt;I like doing my own nails besides saving me the $30 every 2 weeks on gel mani it gives me something to do, almost like a hobby for me. I seen this on TV awhile ago and thought that&#x27;s AWESOME for my nails when I seen the bulk package with 30 plates I super excited, however after they arrived not so much :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the plates a few of them are straight repeats, duplicates and not even good duplicates. The plates are very random and generic most of the plates are a flower design of some kind NO holiday plates you would figure snowmen or pumpkins but NO it&#x27;s really basically all flowers. Chinese writing, Flowers, Letters and Flowers is all this set consist of. There are 2 plates that are design for the French tip mani, one plate is solid tip and the other plate has some designs like polka dots and lines through the French tip but nothing fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for working NOT REALLY, I&#x27;m no pro BUT I always get compliments on my nails even when I do decide to treat myself at the salon I always get compliments about the design (I always do on my ring fingers) which always compliments my mani. Anyways this does NOTHING for your nails :( The scrapper is garbage, it barely works I used a cut out piece of cardboard to do the scraping which gives a much more even and clean scrape. As for stamping I have not been able to get a good one on my nails :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good idea and maybe with more practice it will become easier and look nicer but I wouldn&#x27;t expect too much from this.</li>
    <li> Has a lot of designs but its hard to use and also the scraper is very messy , a waste of money</li>
    <li> Does not work for me no matter what kind of nail polish I am using! Sorry but I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! It only works great with dark solid colors but its not a problem considering it was the best prices. Some plates were dduplicatd but still soo much to work on</li>
    <li> piece of junk! the scraper are useless can&#x27;t use at all. The stamper can&#x27;t pick up the nail polish well or either transfer it on nail properly. with the stamper as suck as that i can&#x27;t make the image work out. if the packaging not make by paper and i have to cut off the paper to get the product out i would return it for sure!</li>
    <li> This set is great, I was so excited to receive these stamps. after watching a couple of youtube videos I dove it. These are easy to use, so many fun designs! I would recommend these to my friends. I am not really a artsy or patient person, these are quick and fun to use. after letting the base coat dry and then letting the design dry cover with a top coat and you&#x27;re done! I had no problems using the scraper, I did find that having some Q-tips with nail polish remover at hand helped to clean off the build up on the scraper, Love them well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Requested by and purchased for my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kinda on the fence with this one. Love the idea of being able to stamp a design on my nails but, so far I have not been able to get it to work. The &amp;#34;stamp&amp;#34; does not place the design on the nail. :(</li>
    <li> I was originally going to give this product a 1 But then I saw where someone said to take the blue film off and then it worked :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I got exactly what I wanted. It works perfectly and it is a good quality product. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this purchase there is no instructions on how to use this or on how to care/clean after use the scraper just smeered the polish across the plate I mean is there a certain polish you need to use on these plates I received it on time and my box was very damaged but items was in good shape . I have tried using these for a couple days now and still they just keep disappointing me . And quite a few of the plates are the same so how can you count plates if they&#x27;re the same .</li>
    <li> The stamper Iis great!!!! It arrived before the expected date. The plates are good quality and very varied designs. The stamp is easy to do and clean.</li>
    <li> this is really hard to use, I gave it away</li>
    <li> Just did not work at all when I went to scrape off the polish on the design it came off the design and never transfomed on the product to put on my nail. Piece of trash.</li>
    <li> This product is not a good buy. I was so excited to use this when it came but so pissed when i started to use it....This product does not work good on nails at all the plates are bad and the design does work on your nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Need to use nail art nail polish to get the design to look fabulous on your nail.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made.... We have tried a design off of each disk and  have tried multiple different nail polishes and none of the designs transfer to the nail :(</li>
    <li> Loved it! I owned the konad ones and they were awesome but too expensive and when I saw these I fell in love. &amp;#60;3 they&#x27;re amazeballzzzzz</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Excellent for the people who like stamping their nails. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> The idea to buy a set of 30 pieces is to have diferent designs, but some of the plates was repeated</li>
    <li> Some of the desings wont work. They wont stay in the spongy thing</li>
    <li> Did not get good results plates were not deep enough to hold polish . Disappointed</li>
    <li> My girl loves these! She was super excited to get them for her birthday. She uses them everyday and for $13.00 what a great buy. Purchased a set for her BFF for her birthday and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Not worthy at all... Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> These are the most useless stamping plates I have ever used.  I ordered a set, and returned them because when I scraped the excess polish off, all of the polish came off.  So I reordered a set, the same thing, they are good for nothing.  I am waiting for my refund on the second set.</li>
    <li> When I got it it was all scratched up and when you try to do the disinhibition the nail polish scraper scratches it I recommend not buying it get a better one from the sight and when you try to pick up the design it doesn&#x27;t come on it</li>
    <li> could not stamp a single pattern on my nail.&lt;br /&gt;tried different process but could not make it to work.&lt;br /&gt;designs are good.&lt;br /&gt;will not recommend anyone novice.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates edges are extreme sharp! Be careful! I sliced my thumb open pretty bad when putting the plates in the case I bought.</li>
    <li> It was a total wast of money.if I could give it zero stars i would.</li>
    <li> good price, loads of designs for a cheap price</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She uses this everyday.</li>
    <li> Good plates but the scrapper and stamper do not work</li>
    <li> I love these! I have seen people pay more for the exact same thing and it&#x27;s easy to use. My only complaint is that I wish it did not have so many flowers. They could have done other images in its place.</li>
    <li> This was pretty difficult to use for my nine year old. They could have made it a lot better. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay not that impressed</li>
    <li> I love this product! After reading the other reviews I was a little skeptical but couldn&#x27;t beat the price! I received 30 plates with only 2 being duplicates, so not bad! At first I couldn&#x27;t get the stamp to come out of the plate correctly so I applied a smaller amount of pressure when scraping and viola! It worked! Every time I get a perfect stamp now! Also when you scrape the paint reuse the paint you just scraped over the design by bringing it backwards! It saves you paint and fills the design! I would recommend this product to anyone! The plates are not sharp! I had read a ton of reviews that said that and I never once have been cut and I removed the blue film off everyone of my plates! They are metal so if you hold them tightly and twist them your gonna end up cut same thing with aluminum foil too! This product is amazing! You should get it to at least try it!</li>
    <li> These are so nice and have a great variety.  Don&#x27;t forget to pull off the blue plastic or it won&#x27;t work!  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> These are no good. They are not deep enough to transfer w/the stamp. The scraper is to sharp and scratches the surface. They put the protective blue covering on the wrong side of the plates, so by time they got to me they we&#x27;re already scratched up. Very unhappy. I bought a 5 plate set from the dollar tree and it works better than these.</li>
    <li> quick and easy way to enjoy a manicure.</li>
    <li> Great!!  So many patterns to choose from!!</li>
    <li> Item as described and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Some of the plates were damaged, I saved  most of them. My friend love the gift anyways .</li>
    <li> It came really fast, this is actually the first set I buy, I didn&#x27;t bought Konad because I&#x27;m not a professional nail artist and is more expensive. The cuality is good compare to the Konad that I have seen, you have to be careful in the edges you may get cut, but I already knew that when  I was going to buy it this ones. I love it, it is just like in the picture you get 30 plates the stamper and the scraper. They all had different figures, really nice, just one was repeated but I really don&#x27;t mind. So I really recommend this product, for the price was good. :)</li>
    <li> the stamping art are all good and so many  different so many different to choose from presents to dragon fly&#x27;s</li>
    <li> After extensive research on Amazon I finally chose this set. I am new to nail stamps and had never tried them before. After a few test runs I finally got the hang of it. Once I did it was pretty cool. The plates themselves don&#x27;t have any kind of backing on them so I&#x27;m a little worried if they&#x27;ll get scratched up or not until I can get some kind of storage plan in place. Overall the designs were ok, not as great as some others I&#x27;ve seen that are now in my wishlist but there are definitely plenty to chose from. I only had one duplicate which from of the reviews is better than others so I suppose that&#x27;s good. While I was using the plates I cleaned them using pure acetone (a technique I saw on youtube, not sure if it&#x27;s normal to do or not) but after a few times of cleaning them they became kind of streaked, not really sure how to describe it. It doesn&#x27;t appear to affect whether or not they work but it definitely takes away from the overall look of the plate.&lt;br /&gt;Big picture-definitely a great set for a beginner to the stamping world since you get 30 plates and the stamping tool for such a great price, but if you already own the tool or are not new to stamping I think you&#x27;d probably be better off getting a different set as the images in this one aren&#x27;t anything all that special.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have fun decorating our nails with these, Its easy to use and the images dry really quickly.  Just make sure to put a top coat on or you will loose what you put on them</li>
    <li> need i say more...what mother would not love doing nail art stamping with her daughters!! they love these and cant wait until mom orders more!!</li>
    <li> I had a very hard time using these plates. No matter how hard I tried or how careful I was I couldn&#x27;t get a clear image.</li>
    <li> ITS HORRIBLE!  CAN&#x27;T USE THE PLATES AT ALL AND THEY CAME SO SCRATCHED YOU CAN BARELY SEE SOME OF THE DESIGNS!!! THE DESIGN ISNT DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD ANY NAIL POLISH IN IT. DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I love this product, it came quickly.  It is easy to use. Great transaction!</li>
    <li> The designs are not carved deep enough. I would not recommend this kit.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not work (((</li>
    <li> My daughter was so excited to order it and so disappointed when she could not get it to work. I had to take her to Walmart to buy another similar product, that WORKED as intended. The plates used had etches that was not deep enough to hold the finger nail polish. Every time my daughter squeegeed off the polish, all the would come off and there was nothing left as far as a design to be transferred to the finger nail. My daughter, my wife and I could not get this product to work!</li>
    <li> For the price that you pay this is a steal. I have the Konad set and my niece wanted her own set as well. Wanted to get her something inexpensive since kids tend to destroy their things after a few months. But these are just as good and you get a ton of plates.</li>
    <li> The scraper and/or the plates are defective. The stamper does not pick up any paint. The scraper scratches the plates and does not have a clean, smooth, straight edge.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because i do nails. I was very excited. When I got the item, I had several plates that were the same design. That was the only problem I had. I did get it taken care of with Amazon.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work as well as you&#x27;d think, most of them I could only stamp once and after I couldn&#x27;t but that might just be me doing it wrong</li>
    <li> This set is so much fun.  I&#x27;m only a nail hobbyist and I was able to use this successfully and it is wonderful.  I enjoyed playing around with techniques and colors.  Do yourself a favor and watch some videos on how to use this.  There are little quirks and there&#x27;s a learning curve.  Once you get the hang of it, the results are great!  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments.  I have recommended this product to others.  Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;so nice&lt;br /&gt;great deal&lt;br /&gt;many shapes and designs with the stamper&lt;br /&gt;and relatively very good price&lt;br /&gt;good deal</li>
    <li> This was the set with the most wheels &amp; designs BUT my set had 2 sets that were the EXACT same. I personally read directions.  There were non.  Still, good price compared to others.</li>
    <li> Excelent product, el envio llego a tiempo y en perfectas condiciones y el precio inmejorable, tal cual se detalla en la descripción</li>
    <li> it takes some practice to get use to it but it works like it is suppose to. the edges are sharp I would not let a child hold on to these but they do work so no more paying extra at a nail salon!</li>
    <li> Many thanks to all who bought this before!  Their reviews are a great help!</li>
    <li> Was a little hard to work with in the beginning, but this is the first time ever using the plates instead of stencils. Once I got the hang, they&#x27;re a great buy! I will be purchasing more designs in future!</li>
    <li> i bought it fr my friend and she loves the product. thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Only 2 repetitive plates.  Great selection of stamp choices.  Based on previous reviews of product I bought the Konad Stamper to use with the plates instead of using what comes with it.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to give it a try yet, but I&#x27;m excited and can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> this product is grate easy to use its the best thing i came across  for nails it makes doing your nails at home much easy without the high cost of doing it at a nail salon grate shipping 5 stars</li>
    <li> DO NOT BOTHER USING THIS PRODUCT IT IS A WAIST OF MONEY IT IS NOT WORTH $12.99. I had to get stitches because of this stupid product! 4 of them on my thumb. m gonna say this again DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Great product, it includes a great variety of designs. My girlfriend loved it, the only complain she had is that it works better with certain nail polish brands.</li>
    <li> I am in love, I have tried it with regular polish and the black and red works fine, the scraper is not the best so I just use an old ccard instead and it works fine, I have just ordered two of the stamping polishes as the reviews states that the stamper works best with them so I have even higher hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates I received are okay, although there are some I may never use, e.g. ones with animals, (cats etc), and there is one with the alphabet, I prefer more flowers, butterflies and more mature designs. Otherwise its great.</li>
    <li> Semi acceptable patterns but there&#x27;s so many multiple images that the price was way too high for what I actually got.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and was exactly as advertized.  There are tons of different designs and the plates work really well.</li>
    <li> The design grooves weren&#x27;t deep enough which resulted in very faint designs.</li>
    <li> Plates were all scratched... Tried stamping and polish would not grab onto the image on the plate, the polish would simply glide off completely...tried different polishes, not what i was expecting</li>
    <li> they work good.  one is a duplicate.  i would buy them again.  make sure you don&#x27;t use cheapy polish or the stamps won&#x27;t transfer well, you need a good quality polish like Sally Hansen insta-dry or something equivalent.</li>
    <li> Awesome for beginners, I would def recommend buying a Konad stamper tho, the plates work fine but the stamper does not work very well. Also others have complained about the scraper but I have had no problems with it. Great for the price except it only has 1 full nail design that is zebra print...</li>
    <li> Works awesome! Last a long time. You have to use a stamping polish.</li>
    <li> christmas so hopefully they work</li>
    <li> Very nice kit. So many choices of the 30 plates.</li>
    <li> I like this product, and would definitely recommend to others. Just need a little more experience doing it. Found more than few repetitive, but still like them.</li>
    <li> Have so much fun with these....a little messy but I knew that when I bought it.....the scraper needs to be perfected somehow because it does not clear off surrounding area very well but luckily I had another one.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for Christmas. The product packaging had a big rip in it, so when I opened the undamaged mailing envelope, everything fell out. It was clearly sent that way from the manufacturer. Didn&#x27;t make for the greatest presentation, so I had to box it. The recipient seems to be enjoying it, though.</li>
    <li> I tried several of the plates and they work great the images stamp clear and clean the only negative was four of the plates were the same design. Kit is complete with stamper and scraper.</li>
    <li> A fun way to decorate your own nails.  My two girls and I spent an entire afternoon decorating each other&#x27;s nails.  This product is fairly easy to use.  Only downside is the scraper isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
    <li> Compact and nicely Packed ! my wife loved all the designs</li>
    <li> works great, lots of good designs, no repeats for me!</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s but is better if it was more deep.......some persons said not work but you need to remove the blue plastic on the top....</li>
    <li> Great! They are as posted and my clients love the extra sparkle that these give to their nail designs. Thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> I like that it brings many designs but a lot of the plates were the same designs, i was given at least 3 or 4 plates that were the same design</li>
    <li> I use it for the times I can&#x27;t get to the nail salon but need a professional manicured look.  My teenage grandoughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Fun to add a unique creative flare to nail art and painting. They get scratched easy and film doesn&#x27;t stay on well to keep it protected so recommend buying a book to keep them together and protected. Love the variety and price</li>
    <li> Not bad, takes practice to learn how to use the scraper properly. Once you do you are good to go</li>
    <li> I am glad i ordered the nail art. I love it, had a great time with my grandaughters doing out nails.</li>
    <li> The only thing i did not like about this order was the plates... I mean the designs on the plates that i received with this package wasn&#x27;t great... Other than that a pretty standard scraper and stamp...</li>
    <li> It worked well after you get the hang of it. Overall, it is very good. Feel it was a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and had so much stamp to use it . I had fun with it.. It works has it said on the description</li>
    <li> The kit is aluminium, so it is a softer metal and the imprints are not very deep, and the squeegee has a metal edge so I am always afraid I&#x27;ll scratch the kit, but you get what you pay for and my kids love it</li>
    <li> The stamps are not engraved deep enough to pick up the design. I&#x27;m really disappointed. Not only that, it took a long time to be shipped.</li>
    <li> The stamper and scraper are useless, just go ahead and throw those away. The plates are okay but comes with duplicates sometimes. Not a bad deal for the price.</li>
    <li> So so so amazing and cute&lt;br /&gt;Gonna purchase three more for my friends</li>
    <li> It never showed and it turned into a very long drawn out process.</li>
    <li> Came fast and plates are perfect</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present from my mom. She tried her hardest to buy me something good and when I opened it up i was super excited but when I tried to use it, the stamping plates were all scraped. It looked like they had been used before. I let that go in the beginning but then I tried the real thing with the nail polish, it just didn&#x27;t work at all!  I scraped the image like the directions said, but it scraped too much off so when I tried to stamp, no nail polish got picked up with the stamper.  I tried over and over.  I watched videos on the internet to try to learn, but nothing worked.  This was the most disappointing item I&#x27;ve EVER gotten from Amazon!  This product is really advertised falsely.  Warning -- do not buy this!!  It is very very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter she loves it.</li>
    <li> Plates are not engraved deep enough to hold paint to transfer image..</li>
    <li> The scraper seems to leave big scratches in the surface of the plate.  And the impression wells are not that deep, so the nail polish dries out quickly and makes the transfer not as good.  But there is a Great selection of images to work with if you are willing to try.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I was surprised it came so soon. Ive got all 30 plates; Although 2 or 3 are the same that&#x27;s fine. The&#x27;re a lot of plates and many cute designs! The stamp is perfect hand sized, and the plates are easy to clean with just a wipe of a paper towel that has a bit of remover on it.</li>
    <li> It may just be me, since this is my first time using nail stampers, but I&#x27;m having a really hard time transferring the images to the nail without either missing part of the design, or it drying before I can even stamp it. Maybe once I get the hang of it, it will work better; but for now it&#x27;s not my favorite nail art product.</li>
    <li> There is alot of plates with cute designs! But it doesnt work with all polishes you need special kind of polish</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this product. It does not work.  When I received the product the stamper peeled of and the nail polish would not make designs. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it because its the same as it was advertised...the stamper works really good and the templates are really cute</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as expected and prompt shipping. For those new to stamping, it does take practice so don&#x27;t give up.</li>
    <li> Wish it came with instructions, but it&#x27;s a great kit.</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought two pack. All desings are cute and lovely. The designs are random, but does not matter because all are cute. the stamper and the scraper work perfectly. I recommended</li>
    <li> What a cool product. Very hard to protect the designs though and are very delicate. A scratch can ruin them</li>
    <li> so many designs to choose from, not sure what to do with them first. I especially like the french tip designs.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these it came with three doubles but she didn&#x27;t seem to mind. It came in on the day she expected overall she&#x27;s satisfied</li>
    <li> When we first got the plates, they were very scratched. It did not come with any instructions, so we had to guess how to use it properly. Just remember to TAKE OFF the blue plastic on top of each plate. We originally thought that this was just a coloring on the plates-- not plastic, and we could not get them to work properly (because of the plastic on top). The plates scratch easily. I recommend using an old credit card as a scraper because the one that comes with it does not work well.</li>
    <li> Good products with lots of designs.  But you better get plastic scraper because the metal one that comes with it ruins the plates</li>
    <li> This is terrible. The transfer of the stencil to the nail is horrid.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money and they are fantastic. I love the different stamps. Perfect choices for every occasion. Very impressed</li>
    <li> Bought this product a few months ago. Not happy with the results, the images would not stick to the nail polish. Definitely would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So I haven&#x27;t used it YET... But from the looks of it.. It seems good. The plates it comes with have SO many different designs which is a major plus. I feel like i may have to keep them in an air-tight case or something to prevent them from rusting... {just a thought} but because of this awesome price I had to buy it! I wouldn&#x27;t mind having to invest in a KONAD scrapper &amp; stamper, but from the looks and feel of the one this one came with, I highly doubt I will have to. I&#x27;ll be sure to update this as soon as I use it!</li>
    <li> It is a great product. And it works perfectly. The only problem I had was that it said you would get 30 unique plates and I had a couple that were doubles. It didn&#x27;t bother me because I was splitting this with someone else. It is still a great deal for all the plates you get though. I just wanted to give a heads up that you might get a couple that are the same. I still got about 26 unique plates though...So still good for the price.</li>
    <li> My friends and family enjoying my new designed nails. I am enjoying them also. Compare to the nail salon, cheap as can be.</li>
    <li> It is as it says.  Works good!</li>
    <li> It is such a great product for people like me who want to have good nails but can&#x27;t draw it themselves. Don&#x27;t be stupid like I was, don&#x27;t freak out if it doesn&#x27;t work and take the blue cover off before use.</li>
    <li> love the many designs available. fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how this got such a high rating but anyways this was the worst thing I&#x27;ve honestly ever ordered. Let me just say that my plates seemed as if they were previously used already they were terribly scratched up. The designs on them are just wonderful but when try to paint and scrape it literally takes all the polish off the plates with the scraper! I CAN&#x27;T EVEN USE THE STAMP BECAUSE THE SCRAPER TAKES OFF ALL PAINT!!! I have used every kind of polish I could even think of and still didn&#x27;t work. The plates aren&#x27;t deep enough or something. This product just disappointed me in every possible way!! WARNING DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
    <li> These dots not stamp very well and cut my fingers while handling the plates.</li>
    <li> I am terrible at everything girly and pretty and these worked on my first try. You just have to make sure you remove the blue film first. Wipe the plate and stamp clean between each nail and work fast. I used Sally Hansen polish.</li>
    <li> Good plates, obviously not high dollar, but good for a beginner. I had no problem transferring the designs from the plates. I did get a few duplicates, but for the price  you really cant beat it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, and now she´s saving a lot money doing herself her own desings</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this to work properly. The scraper tool included did not scrape of excess polish. I tried to use my own card (tried multiple cards on multiple image plates) and it also did not fully remove excess polish, just smeared it. I tried the stamper anyway just to see if the transfer would work if I were able to eventually get a clean image to work with. Multiple attempts later, a full image never transferred. There was always a section missing. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Great kit lots of good images..;)</li>
    <li> Good price, came on time.</li>
    <li> The stencil top part gets easily scratched and the stamps do not come out clear. I am very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> So far loving it. It&#x27;s taking practice. Throw out the scraper and use an old gift card. Make sure you peel off the blue film. Other than that I got one repeat and I&#x27;ll probably invest in a better transfer damper once I&#x27;m more confident. Excellent set for beginners!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...doesn&#x27;t transfer at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this assuming i could use this product with any nail polish. (no such luck) I also thought this was a Konad stamper and its not... I&#x27;m a beginner stamper so i didn&#x27;t know i needed stamping polish. I think the plates will work nicely once i get my polish (waiting on my order) however.. The stamper its self sucks ass. (Yes i primed it)I&#x27;m waiting on a new stamper. The plates are nice tho.</li>
    <li> A lot of the plates were pretty scratched up. But the designs I&#x27;ve tested so far all stamp decently.</li>
    <li> Took me a while to figure out that the blue on top of each disk was a stick... once I finally took it off, the stamper worked like a charm. The scrapper was flimsy so I have been using a old credit card.... other than that everything is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it&#x27;s fun, easy and has lots of designs to work with but the down side to this product is the metal plates. They have rough edges to the point it feels like it could cut you.  I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t buff the edges for a smooth feel. On the up side they are easy to clean.  I haven&#x27;t used the scraper that came with it since others have reported that it scratches the plates.  I had an extra pamper chef plastic scraper so I used it and it worked great.</li>
    <li> Initially need some practice, but then works great ...&lt;br /&gt;My wife liked it and now always busy trying new designs on her nails ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Manish Karpe</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and nicely packaged.  It took me awhile to get the hang of &amp;#34;nail stamping&amp;#34;, but I love it now.  The key to anyone who was wondering......paint the design, scrape off the paint with an old credit card and repeat those steps before rolling stamp over the design!!  I don&#x27;t recommend spending extra money on the stamping polish.</li>
    <li> Works good take you time and you&#x27;ll get better at it with time but this is a great set to start out with I don&#x27;t care for the scraper it does scratch a little so I use a old mini credit  card it&#x27;s got full finger stamps and small ones even letters</li>
    <li> Does better then other ones I have gotten.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my wife, she loves them. She stated that the scraper doesn&#x27;t work well and she uses an old plastic card like suggested in other reviews. No duplicates, must remove blue protective film, edges aren&#x27;t smooth but aren&#x27;t dangerous, doesn&#x27;t require special stamping polish.</li>
    <li> Got these for my teenage cousin and she&#x27;s having a ball trying out all the different designs. They&#x27;ve worked perfectly so far.</li>
    <li> The stamper did not make it an easy polish application. Had nice nail plates with many different designs.i got what I payed for I guess.</li>
    <li> Ordered the 30 plate set. Description states 30 unique plates however I only received 26 unique plates and 4 duplicates.</li>
    <li> Not for kids!  My daughter sliced open her thumb while unwrapping these surgical steel plates.  Be careful!  Once open, they are still quite sharp, but they do work!</li>
    <li> This product takes practice to use, but works great!</li>
    <li> It works fine!!! Lots of stamping options :) and great price!! Overall good product</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift, she was very excited to receive this!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking you could use any nail polish, tried it, didn&#x27;t work, did some research and found out u need a special kind of nail polish</li>
    <li> Bought these as a less expensive alternative to the other brands. They seem just as good. I was really bummed that I had several duplicate plates. They had different numbers on them but the same pictures.</li>
    <li> Item was way smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> The scraper came bent! So I use an old credit card and it does ok.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to figure out how to use this ..I realized that an old card (ex. old gift card)  works better than the scraper that comes with this. Ever since I changed that I love it, it gives you so many different patterns. I bought it again as a gift.</li>
    <li> the designs do not come out as expected there were about 3 of the same design plates of each design and the stamp sucked it was not the right texture to be picking up these designs i would not waste my hard earned money on this piece of crap</li>
    <li> There was no instructions that came with it I watched a territorial on you tube still can&#x27;t get it to work also when I got the product it was very scratch up like someone took a nail on it not very happy with the product</li>
    <li> These do not work very well at all. The designs are not deep enough to hold the color and transfer.</li>
    <li> None of the plates are etched deep enough to hold nail polish.  Just comes right off with the scraper. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> These were a xmas gift for 11-year old girl who is obsessed with nail art. She loved them and they work really well. She is storing them with a square of TP between each one so they don&#x27;t scratch. The designs she makes are pretty amazing. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Would have gave it a 5 but the package was open (not the envelope) and there was supposed to be 30 disc and there was only 27. Also several duplicates.</li>
    <li> Bad art don&#x27;t came out at all</li>
    <li> Learning curve on how to use and make it look good</li>
    <li> I was buying this really bad sticker nail decals and they fell off so easily. my friend turned me on to these! and OMG! they are amazing! any nail polish works.  easy to use and clean up. I use the Dolphin one and a flower stamp and it&#x27;s beautiful! so easy to press on and then onto nail! there are 30 different images, all Different ones! the nail&#x27;s dry super quick! and only $20 for 30 different ones! perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece who always admires my Konad stamped nails. She had purchased one of the As Seen On TV nail stamping kits and was frustrated that she couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I am glad I tested this kit out before giving it to her, because I had to make some last minute modifications to make it work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates themselves are great, although there were a few duplicates in the package. I have a few of the same plates in other brands and did a side by side comparison of the designs to see how they matched up. These printed just as clearly as Konad, Bundle Monster and Red Angel plates when using my own KONAD STAMPER. When I tried the designs with the stamper included in this kit, I got mixed results. Small designs mostly worked okay, but did not completely transfer off the stamper. They were visible on the nail, but not crisp and clear like with the Konad stamper, plus I had to clean the stamper between each print since there was always polish still left on it from the previous stamp. Full nail designs did not work well at all. The rubber on the stamper is firmer than the Konad stamper, meaning it did not compress around my finger as well. Full nail designs only transferred partially and never anywhere near my cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up swapping the rubber portion from my Konad stamper and the one in this kit to give it to my niece to make sure her stamps were clear and not frustrating like the last stamp kit she tried. It gave me an excuse to by a double sided Konad stamper for myself which I&#x27;ve wanted for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, the plates alone were probably worth it, so I&#x27;m not too disappointed. For anyone new to stamping, save yourself a little frustration and purchase a Konad brand stamper to go along with this.</li>
