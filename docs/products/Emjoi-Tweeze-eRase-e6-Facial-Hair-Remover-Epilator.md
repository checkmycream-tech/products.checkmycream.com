<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very poor quality. I ordered tow and neither had the batteries that were said to be included. one had the plastic cover broken and did not work at all and the other does not seem to be working. I wrote and they did credit me for one. I did not know the 2nd one was not working at that time or I would have returned that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mary gentle</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I already had one at home that had broken after a couple of years of use.. so I bought another online.  When I got this one however,  it was missing a part of area that is needed for the battery installation to work.  Lucky for me, I had the old one that I was able to take apart and use that piece that was missing.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my mom, she had another one previous to this one which broke because she dropped it. Bought the batteries and BAM! Works amazing. I defitnitely recommend buying one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use if for my chin and under my lip area. As I&#x27;ve gotten older the eye sight is not as sharp and this is so easy to use. I ordered an extra one just in case something happens to my original one.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for a few years and works fine. I bought one for my daughter and hers broke about two months later. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Piece of cheap plastic on back broke right away. It irritated my skin so bad that I had to see Derm.  If you have sensitive skin I would not advise this. It also did not tweeze hair unless they were about an inch long. Who wants to let facial hair grow to an inch before using?</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I do not have to shave anymore. This really works good without hurting me. I could not stand to use my tweezers because it hurt so bad.</li>
    <li> The price was right and it does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do! It is so much easier than plucking!</li>
    <li> I already had the Emjoi Divine. I love it, so I decided to add this narrower epillator. They are both great. This one is perfect for individual hairs and my face especially.</li>
    <li> This one works. The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great product. this is my second one. If this one breaks I will get another.</li>
    <li> I was never sure about using this little gadet but when my mom ordered it and didn&#x27;t like it, I tried it and LOVE it! She didn&#x27;t like the discomfort it caused and didn&#x27;t think it pulled out her really tough hairs very good.  I, on the other hand did my whole chin, neck and most of my cheekbones.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I tried to do the upper lip and OUCH - would rather just lighten those with bleach cream.  The rest of my face is soft and smooth and its been 5 days now. I was worried about stubble but nope, none of that because its tweezing,not shaving.  I highly recommend.  PS, my face was a little red afterward but that went away and they don&#x27;t recommend if you have eczema or rosecea (I have both) but I didn&#x27;t shave in those areas.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi Tweezer works really well for me. It&#x27;s small, handy, quick, and easy. It also costs less than other methods.    Very handy! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After reading all the information I could find about this product I decided it was worth a try.  I&#x27;m still trying...I bought it mostly for the hair on the upper lip but I can only do a very small section at a time because it HURTS LIKE H---!!  I cannot even imagine getting close to a bikini line with this device.  It&#x27;s not returnable either because to return it you have to leave it in that terrible, indestructible, plastic packaging so you can&#x27;t find out how it works until you have destroyed that.  This is the first Amazon product that I have not been satisfied with so I&#x27;m crushed.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one, I wouldn&#x27;t want to do without it.  My only complaint is plastic shield doesn&#x27;t fit tight and keeps coming off while in use.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Emjoi TweeZe at CVS drugstore last year in the as seen on TV aisle. I was amazed that this product actually worked exactly like it was advertised!! I misplaced my first one (I think my daughter \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; it) Anyway I didnt want to go without this amazing device and searched three different area stores- unable to find it I went online to Amazon and ordered a new one right away. This is a really great product for getting rid of those unwanted facial hairs that seem to pop up out of nowhere. I highly recommend this for anyone that wants a quick and virtually painless (it does sting a bit at first) way to rid yourself of those tiny annoying hairs on your face. I am now looking into their epilator product for my legs. If its anywhere near as good as this works, I&#x27;m buying it!!</li>
    <li> All  thing mentioned were gifts for Xmas.</li>
    <li> Does not work and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product works well. It picks up even the small thin fiscal hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Emjoi Tweeze for a couple of years.  It works great for my chin hairs and it gets the ones I can&#x27;t see.  It does smart a bit at first but you get used to it quickly and it is WAY worth the tiny bit of discomfort.  My Mom used my Tweeze recently on a vacation and loved it. I ordered one for her from Amazon.com.  She was so anxious to get it that Dad had to keep calling me to see when it would be delivered.  They have it now and she is a happy tweezer!</li>
    <li> I owned a Tweeze before that worked well and lasted for over a year. The one I purchased on this site did not work nearly as well as the one I had before.  It felt plastic, light and cheap.  It sputtered and died within months.    I went to a \\&quot;Seen on TV\\&quot; store and found one there that seems to be of better quality.    Whatever they are selling here appears to be a Knock-Off.    Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works well. Like having an extra one for the suitcase</li>
    <li> I love this. no more paying for someone to do it. It is GREAT!  I also got one for my sister inlaw for xmas. she saw mine and wanted one....</li>
    <li> I just tried this and can now say I know what it feels like to be a chicken getting plucked for dinner. My face is on fire and I was in tears, and it grabbed and yanked some so hard it drew blood, but every drop was worth it. This worked so well that the ones with more than a single row of tweezers in them seem just a little bit terrifying.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t help the problem</li>
    <li> Terrible quality.... the plastic shield on the top broke off right away.... very cheap quality product.</li>
    <li> If you are smart, you always take commercial claims with a grain of salt, which I did, so I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed to find that the Tweezer doesn&#x27;t really work all that well. I still use it some, but the claims made for it are widely exaggerated.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 3 months and have used is on most parts of my face. Not precise enough to really do details of the eyebrow arch, so I lost a bit of one eyebrow when I got too confident in my skills.   &lt;br /&gt;   This is not a painless process, nor quiet--there is a motor sound. The fresher the batteries, the quicker that hairs are pulled and the less painful it is.  It is far better than hand tweezing if you have much area to cover.  It really does tweeze even very short hairs.  I really like it but I don&#x27;t like waxing or chemical hair removers.  If you prefer tweezing to these, you will probably really like this product.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed with Tweeze - Looked alot better on the commercial.  It does an okay job but it&#x27;s not as fast and easy as they would like you to believe.</li>
    <li> Really like this one!  Does a great job and works rather well, even on dark coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the tweeze at a local drug store, and was initially quite amazed.  I washed my face first, and then began to tweeze.  I removed all my hair on my chin and begining of my neck area.  My skin was finally smooth and hairless, a little sore but great results, or so I thought.  The next morning I woke up with razor bumps like I had shaved, which are even more embarrassing then the hair.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE OF A DARK COMPLEXION, ie African American or have curly/kinky/really wavy hair.  What I thought was a great inexpensive solution turned about to painfull mistake.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t function at all like it was advertised.  My wife was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not quite as effective as I had hoped.It was also quite abrasive on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually buying a second one of these because I lost the first when I moved.  Yea it hurts, you&#x27;re ripping hair out so it&#x27;s like using a tweezer on speed.  It works though.  If you have dark hairs in weird places, it fixes that.  As to the person that was bitching about it not working on their legs, why the hell would you try to use it on your legs?  It has one slot that the hair goes through...that&#x27;s just retarded.  It&#x27;s meant for small areas like your lip, chin, etc...not you&#x27;re fat cow of a leg.  Emjoi has other products used for that.  Do you use a tweezer on your legs? No, you don&#x27;t...so don&#x27;t use something called emjoi TWEEZE for that.</li>
    <li> What was I thinking when I ordered the Tweezee.  It was one of the worst ideas I ever had. The tweezee hurt so much.  They should really ban this item.....</li>
    <li> I can stand a \\&quot;little pain\\&quot;, so after reading the reviews here I decided to buy the Tweeze Tweezer. I gave it a try and ended up throwing it away. It is not just a little pain; in some places (upper lip area) it is very painful and not worth it IMO. I have sensitive skin which could be the problem and when I used it around my chin, my skin was not happy - it looked like I had welts in some areas and my skin was very red and swollen. I followed the directions of using it at a 90 degree angle, but it is just too much for my skin I guess. It was so cheap that I thought it was worth a try. For those with tougher skin that can take the pain, it may work just fine.</li>
    <li> Ok to use on the face, but have to go few time over one spot, there are better one I had.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase and the promptness of my delivery. It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work. Don&#x27;t waste your money :(  Also the brand and model# are NOT indicated on the unit as pictured so I think it is a cheap knock off.  There is 1 single ineffective running tweezer on the head - the unit powers up but does not pull 1 hair out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product mainly to see how epilators worked in the first place.  I tried it out on the top of my hand and then on my upper lip.  IT does rather quickly remove the hairs, but frequently (about half the time) it cuts them instead of plucking from the root.  I think this epilator is good if you are short on time and need some quick damage control before going out.  But if you want flawless results, you need to wax or string.</li>
    <li> I think these are pretty easy to use and not that painful because there is only one &amp;#34;tweezer&amp;#34; in this therefore making it slightly more time consuming to epilate, and doesn&#x27;t clean as well as other epilators. Normally I just use this to generally clean up armpit and legs after shaving/waxing/nair. It&#x27;s pretty nice that it comes with a small brush to clean it.</li>
    <li> i really like this product it came very quickly and proved to durable and helpful to me</li>
    <li> Great prioduct.  I use it ofen and think it&#x27;s terrific.  Best hair removal product I have ever used.  Please continue to carry it.  I give it as gifts as well.,    Helene U.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. I&#x27;ve used it for at least two years, but mostly because I haven&#x27;t found anything better. It hurts like heck, especially in the upper lip area. Tears literally fall out of my eyes when I try to tackle this area, so I shave that part instead. I use this for the hair on my chin and along the jaw line.     Some hair is plucked from the root, while other hair is simply broken off. I have red bumps all over the area where I use it and it&#x27;s a full time job dealing with these breakouts. However, if I don&#x27;t remove the hair, the condition improves, but then I&#x27;m hairy again. As a woman, I found it&#x27;s better to have acne than facial hair. I wish the hair would just go away so that I could leave my face alone and enjoy having nice skin. Until then, I&#x27;ll be using my Emjoi tweezer.</li>
    <li> My sister loved this!</li>
    <li> I have used this tweezer for along time Iorderedit for my sister .She is now a fan.  EVerybody value .Thank you.</li>
    <li> i bought one years ago,  my daughter in law tried  it and loved it so I ordered her one.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my SIL and she just loves it. very sleek and gets the work done perfect.</li>
    <li> My first one was so good. I gave it to my daughter and ordered another for me. It came and did not work at all. I sent it back and have NOT GOTTEN A NEW ONE NOR MY MONEY BACK.. i REALLY WANT A NEW ONE.</li>
    <li> I expected this tweezer to do more.  It \\&quot;tweezes\\&quot; some of the area but certainly does not \\&quot;clear\\&quot; a completely smooth area.  However, it did a good enough job that I did not return it and I take it with me on all of my travels as the airlines will not confiscate it.</li>
    <li> If I could give the Emjoi Tweeze tweezer no stars or a minus star, that&#x27;s what it would get.  After fighting to get the batteries in &amp; the lid back on, the tweezer would not turn on.  I took it apart, moved the batteries &amp; it turned on by itself!! to stay on without being able to be turned off without removing a battery.  Did I mention the oil smell &amp; the fact the it couldn&#x27;t tweeze a hair from my cat&#x27;s behind which is extremely hairy?  I am too disappointed for words.  I own another emjoi that I got as a today&#x27;s special value on QVC.  It works as well on my legs today as it did several years ago when I bought it.  A truly excellent product.  This is a dollar store item that should not be sold by Amazon or any other reputable venue for any price.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this works.  Sort of like a guy shaving.  I would say to do this a few days before you go anywhere because on occasion you can break out a little, as with tweezing by hand.</li>
    <li> It works.  Yes it hurts, but like others said, we don&#x27; really have any painless way of removing hair by the root.  Shaving and depilatory creams don&#x27;t remove from the root, and shaving causes stubble.  The creams can cause burns and the chemicals are probable really bad for you.  Speaking for myself, I can not even find all the little fine hairs on the upper lip with regular tweezers, not to mention I&#x27;d be in front of the mirror all day if I could.  It is also simply not true that it doesn&#x27;t work for the longer individual sparse hairs on the chin.  I think it works best for those.  It can be used without a mirror anywhere you want.  The biggest piece of advice is that the pain goes away as the nerves get numb if you don&#x27;t pull it off after each pluck because you wince in pain.  I recommend just keeping it there to remove the hairs in that area and soon you will not feel it.  This applies most for the upper lip.  Bottom line- it is the best method I have found for ease of use, amount of hair removal, and length of time hair is gone.  There is no stubble afterward and the only problem I ever have is redness, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Everything was great! Arrived in. Timely manner!!!</li>
    <li> My sister had given me one of these a few years ago and it finally wore out. This, to me is less painful, and certainly much much faster than regular tweezing. Use it on my face and my legs. And as everyone knows tweezing regularly means the hair grows in much finer than before, which means less noticeable. Shipping on this item was really super fast, I chose standard shipping and it was here within 4 days.</li>
    <li> I had mine for years and got one for my sister. She loves it too.</li>
    <li> I get so tingly inside when I hear that satisfying thud that means that Tweeze has done it&#x27;s job well and yanked that bad boy out by the root!  I no longer have those undignified witch hairs growing out of my moles, on my chin or neck!  I am going to buy one for every room in the house so that when I feel a hair that needs tweezing, Tweeze is right there with me!  A+++++</li>
    <li> I like it and it does the job. It&#x27;s a bit small but I should have know that. It&#x27;s not as great for bikini line but other wise it&#x27;s quite nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My poor mom had some seriously long chin hairs, and I mean quite a few of the darn things too :) I had purchased one of these for myself and LOVED it, so I bought her one too! Woot....it worked GREAT, no more long chin hairs on my mom. She loves it, and it is so simple for her to use.Lots easier for her to use than tweezers, as she has a bit of arthritis.  You kind of have to get the hang of how to hold it for it to work best. Read the instruction booklet &amp; you should have no problem.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife. This was a replacement for one that bit the dust. She loves the product. Great price on this one.</li>
    <li> This works a little bit, not what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> I have owened the Tweeze for about 3 years now and it is by far the best facial hair remover for the money.  I have extremely coarse black chin hairs (totally embarrassing) and it takes care of them.  The only con I&#x27;ve noticed is that you have to wait until the hair is at least 1/8\\&quot; long in order for it to grab ahold of them.  The hairs grow back finer and lighter each time.  I love this product and recommend it to anyone with annoying facial hair.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the bikini area or underarms.  It may grab ahold of tender skin!</li>
    <li> It does not works. I threw it out</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh I ordered these for myself and my mom, I don&#x27;t ever want to be without them. They are great!!!  I had some chin hairs and they actually pulled out the roots and now my chin is so smooth.  great product!!!</li>
    <li> The product I received was not the real Emjoi... I got a fake one. I have ordered the Emjoi product in the past and what I received wasn&#x27;t comparable. It&#x27;s made out of very cheap plastic material.</li>
    <li> It works very well to remove the hard to get long hairs that grow on the chin and upper lip.  I bought one for my daughter also and she loves it.  It does a great job and the company shipped them out quickly</li>
    <li> This little gadget really gets the job done for removing hairs from the facial area. Ok, I&#x27;ll admit that it does hurt a little, but so does tweezing. I used to dread looking under my chin for facial hairs and pulling out the tweezers. Now, I just pull out my emjoi and in a few minutes or so I am done.  It hurts a little more above the lip area, but tweezing and shaving is even worse. The best part is staying hairless for a week or so.  It doesn&#x27;t make the hair grow in thicker at all. Today, I am purchasing one for each of my sisters.  So if you can handle just a little bit of temporary uncomfort for a few minutes, go for it.  What a time saver, a great product and an excellent price.</li>
    <li> This is best for my upper lip fine hair but useless for sparse, stubby, thick hair that often sprouts on the chin. So don&#x27;t throw your tweezer just yet!</li>
    <li> The gadget is not only effective, but nearly painless, and inexpensive. Great item!</li>
    <li> This thing is kool. It gets those stubborn hairs with very little discomfort, it feels like a lil yank onthe hair and poof its gone.. &lt;br /&gt;it IS very noisy however</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was having to tape the plastic cover to my old one (I had it for years) even though it still worked ok. This one has been trouble right out of the box, it&#x27;s not put together very well and the battery cover doesn&#x27;t fit well making it very difficult to take off and put on, and the switch sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#x27;t. The mechanism doesn&#x27;t turn like it should - it acts like the batteries are dying and barely removes any hair. After reading reviews on this site and another that sells this item, it looks like I have only a 50/50 chamce of getting one that is not defective in some way. I replaced the small swatch of duck tape on my old one and went back to using it - at least it is reliable,</li>
    <li> Great little compact tweezer. Gets those unruly hairs easily. Good price and arrives fast. You can&#x27;t go wrong if you decide to buy</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this little gadget does what it says. No more painful than tweezing. Much less painful than waxing. I used for hairs on face and neck and so far hair has been much slower to grow back. About as loud as electric razor. Great for vanity.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, does everything that its suppose to do and is very affordable. Easy to use and easy to clean. This is a good gift.</li>
    <li> OK, the pain isn&#x27;t exactly excruciating, but it isn&#x27;t mild either. I have to prepare myself for what&#x27;s coming, before I use this little gadget. It is effective, which is what matters most I guess, but I really do not care for items that are advertised as \\&quot;this\\&quot;, and end up being \\&quot;that\\&quot;. This product should not say \\&quot;PAINLESS\\&quot; on the package. That is a lie. No, this isn&#x27;t a matter of opinion, and I am not overly sensitive to pain (I have 9 tattoos). It hurts. Period. It is also VERY LOUD. It sounds like friggin moped.     Out of five, I give it three stars for it&#x27;s ability to do what it says it does... remove hair. Minus 2 for shocking the hell out of my face, and scaring my cats with it&#x27;s obnoxious tone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing it advertised on the television a few times.  I thought well, it isn&#x27;t that expensive and I am sick and tired of tweezing my stray little hairs and can&#x27;t see without my glasses anymore.  You literally just hold this like a mini electric razor, and without cutting the hairs, it plucks them out at the speed of light.  Well, not that fast but you could never tweeze as fast.  You don&#x27;t even need to look in the mirror, just go by feel and cover the area you want covered and feel with you finger to see if there is any that got missed.  In ten minutes I accomplished what 40 mins. of plucking would have not done as well.  This is really great and well worth the money.    I have used Epilady in the past for my legs, it works on the same principle, just different method of removal, but still plucking.  It feels about the same, it probably isn&#x27;t for wimps, but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable either.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this one for my wife. She´s very happy with it. She loves that it&#x27;s small and very portable.    Her only complaint is that the tweezers is only good for face and not for other parts of the body, like legs.</li>
    <li> I have a combination of coarse and fine hair on my chin area and I have been tweezing every day for at least a decade.  I bought this product because I can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal and even with tweezing every day I often feel stray hairs just hours later.  Well, I used the Tweeze for the first time only three days ago -- and my chin area is still almost completely smooth.  The device is not all that tricky to use (although the directions are not much help), I did not find it painful, and it did not cause any redness.  I am not saying this is a miracle product, but so far I am quite satisfied with it.  I think that if it can produce such satisfying results for me, perhaps it can for you, as well.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I am a left-hemi and can only use one arm.  I use this product and only have to use it once a week!</li>
    <li> I cound&#x27;nt live without this tweeze. Im almost 60 yrs. and as we all know the upper lip and chin start getting these ugly hairs that nothing else out there takes away except for the Tweeze. You won&#x27;t waiste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for years to remove my facial hair, and hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked properly. Tweezing takes forever, waxing is painful, irritating and expensive, creams don&#x27;t work. I bought this without high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. It does hurt, but so does waxing and tweezing, and you get used to the feeling after 5 minutes or so. It did a great job a removing almost all of my hairs -- better results than I&#x27;d ever had with waxing or tweezing. Well, well worth the money! And it didn&#x27;t leave my face irritated or blotchy. Finally, my face is smooth and hair free! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants quick, easy results</li>
    <li> It tweezes. Tears the hair out by the roots, and it stays gone for quite some time. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, and I can&#x27;t use a tweezers because of vision and tremor issues. I let the batteries run too low, and it stopped working for a time. I then used an electric razor, and wound up with stubble all the time. I got new batteries for this product, and it&#x27;s back to wonderful results, and virtually no time necessary to achieve said results. I highly recommend this little tweezer.</li>
    <li> Wife hates it.  She will pluck or shave instead.  This was a purchase to try and hope it helped from growing back so fast.  But plucking and shaving is much easier &amp; less painful.  It&#x27;s a good product if you can tolerate the pain.  But the way it pulls is very painful.</li>
    <li> I have an Emjoi Silken Rechargeable Hair Remover and love it for facial hair removal but decided to get the emjoi tweezer for that \\&quot;single hair tweezing\\&quot; on the chin area.....sadly, it is absolutely worthless for those more coarse hairs. Bottom line, keep your tweezers for individual hairs and go for a larger emjoi product for hair removal for the upper lip, etc.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t work for me. I still have to ask someone to pick my ears. Since my hair is thick, the spot bleeds after a pull from that machine. Too much work and stress for nothing.</li>
    <li> It literally picks up NO hair. NONE. It snags and trims a couple, but none are properly tweezed. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Back cover wouldn&#x27;t close right</li>
    <li> It says it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it hurts. It&#x27;s like tweezing hair just faster, and yet slower than waxing... not worth it! If I plan to deal with the pain, I&#x27;d rather do it quickly and wax.</li>
    <li> Junk and did not stand up to what it was to do. Needed for facial hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for a friend out of state when she could not find it in any stores near her. It is the only item she can use that does not irritate her face like bleach or hair removal creams. She had owned and used this before. With time and use it becomes less effective and she has to replace it.</li>
    <li> Had one of these for years. Great product, really works and just love it. Would recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I like it and would buy it again.  It does not get all the hair easily, but for fine hair is much easier than tweezing manually and not messy like wax.  Still have to manually tweeze some, but like the product, cause don&#x27;t need bright light, glasses or magnifying mirror to find all the tiny hairs.  You can feel it when it plucks a hair, but no more than tweezing</li>
    <li> It works great on fine hair, very happy with that. But, not so great with any that are a bit more coarse.</li>
    <li> Bought this as it was single hair epilation... unfortuantely doens&#x27;t work that well for thicker hair. I found it gripping the hair but not really pulling it out in the first go. It eventually gets it but the 2-3 pulls it takes to get it out makes the pain much more... Works fine on the less thick hairs although I&#x27;ve not tried it on my face.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for fine hairs and ok for more coarse hairs.  You do have to tweeze a few hairs, but you can&#x27;t expect miracles from it.  It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as people say it did.  No more than waxing.  For the price, it was worth it to me.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0007CXQUW Emjoi AP-9T Tweeze Tweezer]] Tweeze does not work as suggested in the ads.  I had to run it over an area several times only to have it leave hair behind and break more hairs off just below the skin surface than it ever removed.  These hairs would then become ingrown and or infected, be painful and look far worse as they grew out to a length to be tweezed and healed.  Beyond this, the machine also pinches your skin if you do not hold it at just the right angle.  As for the time you remain hair free, the claim that it is longer than conventional tweezing is absurd, both (were the Tweeze to have worked) remove the hair at the root!  Give me my tweezers and a mirror and keep this piece of garbage, they work better, cost less and I do not end up with broken ingrown hairs. Also, I only gave it a star because I had to, the do not allow remarks without at least one.</li>
    <li> This product is great for fine hairs. This product doesn&#x27;t work on the coarse, thick hairs that some women get on their chin. The buyer should also be careful. I read the package insert first and then used it on my chin.  I lost the top layer of skin on a small patch of my chin. I was trying to get the coarse hairs out. They didn&#x27;t come out, but my skin did.</li>
    <li> It does the job like it states ... although shorter hair or fine hair is hard to pluck with the tweezey.  Overall this is a good product.</li>
    <li> The Tweeze does pull hairs, but it doesn&#x27;t get every one you can feel, like their advertisement says.  If they are very short, it doesn&#x27;t grab them, and going over the same spot too much just irritates the skin.  It does hurt a bit, but no more than tweezers.</li>
    <li> dont buy it ppl its a waste of money and it irritates your skin causing scab looking mark on your face</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m giving the tweeze 2 stars only because it does pull out a lot of the not-noticeable fine hairs, but that&#x27;s really all it&#x27;s got going for it. It hurts, (not intolerable, but still ...) it&#x27;s noisy, (but that not too much of a problem) it&#x27;s really inaccurate, (which makes the whole process way longer than expected) and often leaves the medium-big hairs behind (which is more or less the point).  Also I would suggest prior and post cleansing of the area your using the tweeze on because the last time I used the tweeze my skin broke out like crazy on that specific area. My Mother order one the same time that I did and she expressed to me basically the same opinion. But I guess there are all kinds of hair/skin types in the world and that&#x27;s how I figure this product got so many good reviews. And also since it&#x27;s relatively cheap so it may still be worth the gamble but chances are, the odds are not going to be in your favor.</li>
    <li> I have horriable hair coming under my chin and this device took care of it no problem. It took a while to work it right. I uess u have to hold it like a mans electric shaver and keep the skin tight. I was a bit nervouse about doing my brows so I might skip that. I also might hold off on armpit untill I ge the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I just go this item. I have fine blond hair fuzz on the sides of my face and some on my chin, which was really bothering me. I also have darker hair on my upper lip that i usually remove with a cream, but that leaves my skin red.  This product worked quite well on the fine blond hair on the sides of my face. I was surprised how much hair was coming right off. It was a little addicting! I used it a little bit on my upper lip, but it does hurt/sting. It doesn&#x27;t remove every hair,but it makes a definite noticeable improvement. I am very hard to please, but I like this product. It got rid of the fuzz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews for this product describing pain and how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my opinion I&#x27;d say the level of pain is more of the anticipation people have for the pain. My pain tolerance is very bad and it feels a bit worse than plucking but not horrible. It&#x27;s very bearable pain. The only time it hurts more is when it&#x27;s trying to grab a hair that doesn&#x27;t want to come out. So it continues grabbing that hair and begins to feel uncomfortable. It may make your neck area sore at first but once you get used to it, it doesn&#x27;t bother you as badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as how well it does for plucking. I use this product on my chin and neck area. I&#x27;d say it grabs out about 25%-50% of the hair. So the rest I can pluck out. It saves a whole lot of time compared to normal plucking. Especially for people who have a lot of hair in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 stars is because I feel the smell from this product is a bit odd and it could do a bit better at grabbing hairs than what it does. But I would recommend this product to people who want to try something like this without having to pay a fortune. And if you choose to go to a better product you will be able to find out this way. Good luck buyers!</li>
    <li> this is the best product for the senior citizen whose eye sight has deminished. This really does pull those hard to see hairs on the face and ears.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this thing, I thought it was awesome! Obviously when hair is pulled from the root it will hurt, so I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the pain. BUT it worked really well for a little while and then it was like something slipped and got less effective. I thought the batteries may be bad so I put brand new batteries in it, but it still hasn&#x27;t worked as well as when I first turned it on. One more thing, I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin at all, but it gave me a pretty bad rash that lasted for like a week. I might have gone over the same spot too many times or something, but none of my other electric tweezers have ever given me a rash.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this device. It does not remove hair from my facial areas as it claimed it would.  I even tried it on my legs, and it didn&#x27;t do anything there either.  The only thing this device has managed to do, was knick up my face.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your quick service.  Item was exactly what I ordered and was received in good shape.  I know I will get quick quality service and items when I order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t remove any of the hairs on my face or my mom&#x27;s face and it hurt like crazy. It certainly wasn&#x27;t painless.</li>
    <li> This was the cheapest product I&#x27;ve ever found on Amazon.  I took it out of the package and the sides were already coming apart. Once the batteries were put in it the cover would not stay on either. I usually don&#x27;t return things but this went right back!</li>
    <li> I just got this, I have been getting electrology for yrs, this is going to save me alot of money. Easy to use, somewhat painful, does a great job, portable. I have used it on my upper lip and chin area, haven&#x27;t tried it on my underarms yet.I couldn&#x27;t imagine using it alone on my legs as it would take forever but great for the odd stray hair.Sorry I didn&#x27;t find this yrs ago !!</li>
    <li> Love it! So much easier than waxing!</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove facial hair over sideburns.  I was getting  them waxed every 2 weeks  and  then decided to give the Emjoi Tweezer a try.  The first time I used it, it was painful ( not over the top painful but it hurts some cause it pulls one hair at a time).  I had not gotten  waxed in over three weeks so area was overgrown. It took a few tries to get it all nice and clean. .  Emjoi left  my face really smooth,  There was redness( like in waxing)  but only the first time and it went away in a few hours.  Now I leave the Emjoi  tweezer on my counter and just go over my face every week.  No pain and no hair no redness, no driving to  salon appointment  and  have a smooth happy face.  Am so very glad I got it and recommend it 100 % for women who have some facial hair  and get waxed every 2 weeks.  I also notice that hair comes in slower  tweezing them this way.  I love a smooth face!!  Am delighted with the product!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and Tweeze is perfect. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even give this product 1 star.  I would if it sold it saying it gets some and not others.  A 1.00 pair of tweezers that don&#x27;t require batteries is the best way to go.  The easy tweeze commercials are lies!!!!</li>
    <li> This made my sensitive skin break out where the hair pulled out and did not remove all the hairs</li>
    <li> A little bigger than the older model I had, and less durable, too.  Does the job satisfactorily.</li>
    <li> The product did not arrive, but the vendor sent out another one immediately. Great service &amp; I would definitely do business with this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tweeze for more than 3 years and I still love it. I use it for those annoying chin hairs and above the lip hairs. I tried everything, the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; tweezer units, waxing, and just plain plucking and I wouldn&#x27;t go back to any of them after my wonderful Tweeze. I Tweeze while I&#x27;m watching TV. A few seconds every few days and presto, a clean chin and lip.</li>
    <li> Wonderful little appliance for taking unwanted hair off of upper lip or chin, quickly. Easy to use. Easy to take care of. Works very well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using Emjoi Tweez&#x27;e for three years.  I am 65 years old and have those awful hag hairs that grow on the chins of we senior women. Before Tweez&#x27;e, it was tweezers and 20 minutes plucking the chin hairs every other days.  Now I spend about two minutes a week to dipilate those haggy hairs.      I am a big fan of Tweez&#x27;e.  Especially fond of the fact that I bought it three years ago, paid $20 for it at Bed Bath and Beyond and it still works as if it were brand new.  Because that product has been so reliable and effective, I&#x27;m getting ready to drop the bucks on an Emjoe dipilatator for my legs now that I have figured out that Emjoi is the company that makes Tweez&#x27;e.</li>
    <li> Have used tons of tweezers,  the regrowth upsets me with weird hair so glad I found emjoi and it lasts for days and so easy to operate...</li>
    <li> i think it does a great job. i have told a lot of people about it.</li>
    <li> Never having tried an epilator before, spending lots of my &amp;#34;aging woman&amp;#34;&#x60;s fixed income on facial waxing, I thought I&#x60;d try this. It had good reviews every where I read, though I still had a bit of fear about its process. When I finally received mine and tried it, I found it to be SO easy, painless, (it tickles a bit), and successful to use, I was delighted with the fun of it all!!!  Cleans very easily with the little brush in the package. All the reviews are on target with it being an excellent little product, which it&#x60;s also noteworthy to write feels very good and sturdy in the hand, not as little as one might think. Not coming with a case, I&#x60;ve put mine in an extra eyeglass case to protect it in between use. AND it&#x60;s saving me $20-30 needed dollars a month now. (Note: I have medium light hair, yet still enough to be bothersome after 50, in case that matters.)  Now, it&#x60;s very important to me to comment on the wonderful company that sold this to me: they couldn&#x60;t have better, more responsible, responsible customer service. I ordered this hoping for fast service, but was very disappointed to see Amazon&#x60;s delivery projection after ordering was almost TWO MONTHS, yikes! I immediately emailed the company with my concerns, and heard back from them in only a couple of hours. They were apologetic and understanding, but promised that it usually only took a couple of weeks to come. They sincerely asked me to contact them with any other concerns, but give them a chance to see. and sure enough, they were right...almost: it actually came in LESS than that two weeks!!! They were extremely kind, and extremely excellent...PLEASE feel confident about buying from them. Oh yes: the price of $8 and something is not only fantastic, but when buying from this Third Party Vendor with Amazon, there is no shipping required, and you don&#x60;t have to worry about any &amp;#34;over $25&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; status to wait on if you&#x60;re carefully budgeting. How much better can you get. FINALLY, I plan to order more for friends.</li>
    <li> Hurts a lot more than I thought it would. Not good for hair on the upper lip because it is so painful. Only good for the few wild hairs here and there</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  If you have chin hairs and always get in the car to go somewhere and then notice you didn&#x27;t pluck them all....and spent an hour trying to nab all the dirty bast...you will love this product. Ya, it stings when it gets ahold of a good one but I don&#x27;t care...it is so much faster than when I do it one at a time and what tweezer doesn&#x27;t hurt?      This thing is fast and easy to use.  You slide it down your throat and one at a time at a high rate of speed comes out.  Maintaining the now cleaned face will be easy.  I can do it anywhere.  I do a little at a time when I have a large area to do especially on the face.  Its wonderful and if you don&#x27;t like to use harmful chemicals on your face then this is the way to go.  Sissies should use the one at a time method.    The rest of us that want a clean, thorough job quickly; buy this.</li>
    <li> This thing worked for the first 3 months. It got all the hairs after going past once or twice but it only works in one direction ie. going left to right. Anyways one day it just stopped. I tried new batteries and everything. What a waste! Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Okay, just for the record, this thing is not painless.  The product description above says it&#x27;s painless, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  It feels like fire ants are biting your face.  The instructions suggest trying it out on the hairs on the back of your hand before using it on your face.  That is a good suggestion.  I tried it out and am glad I did, that way I could brace myself for the pain when I used it on my face.  That said, it does get rid of the hairs on your chinny chin chin.  Just run it very lightly over the skin in a circular motion, making sure you&#x27;re pulling your skin taut, and it will rip the hairs right out.  Just be prepared for some pain.</li>
    <li> I HAVE PURCHASED ITEMS FROM AMAZON BEFORE AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPOINTED. UNTIL NOW.  WHEN MY PRODUCT ARRIVED I WAS SO EXCITED TO TRY IT TO REMOVE SOME UNWANTED FACIAL HAIR.  IT WAS HORRIBLE!  I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING ZAPPED WITH A LASER GUN.  I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING I WAS DOING WRONG, BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE TO NOT DO RIGHT.  I ASKED ONE OF MY CHILDREN TO TRY IT AND THEY MADE ME LAUGH.  THEY SAID \\&quot;WHAT IS THIS, A WEED WACKER?  NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS NOW RECYCLABLE MATERIAL AS I DON&#x27;T WISH TO EXPERIENCE THE FEELING OF ELECTRIC SHOCK!  MY RATING ON THIS PRODUCT? 1 OF 10, A BIG FAT \\&quot;0\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I think this is gr8 and wish I had found it before....Easy to use, practically painfree and so much easier than using a tweezer and a magnifying glass!!!!</li>
    <li> It is horrible and painful!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Just go get waxed, it hurts less and hair re-growth is much slower!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I works well and does everything it claims. It&#x27;s not really all that painful and sure beats tweezing every single day! It is a little on the noisy side, however.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, after reading some of the negative reviews.  But there were enough good reviews to make me want to try it anyway, given Amazon&#x27;s good refund policy. The Tweeze works, although you do have to take your time. Some reviews told of facial skin irritation, or the product not plucking coarse hairs. I found out I had to lightly dab at my problem areas, with the Tweeze upright. If you rake it across your face like a razor, yes, you will get irritation.  This may seem like too  much trouble for some of you, but for someone of advancing age, who has to look through bifocals, it was getting almost impossible to stand at a mirror with a tweezer and see the individual chin hairs well enough to get the tweezer in the right place.  With the Tweeze, I just have to dab around the areas. I can feel when it plucks. I sometimes have to go back afterward to pull out a particularly stubborn hair, but that&#x27;s easy, since it&#x27;s the only one left standing.  For me, the Tweeze is great.  I finally feel fuzz free.</li>
    <li> I use it to remove hair on my chin and neck.  I had one before and lost it in a move.  I got a Wizzit.  It pulled on the hairs but did not remove them.</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it works well. It does what it said it would do. I liked it so much, I bought my daughter and sister one. It saves us money. Waxing is expensive and it hurts.</li>
    <li> Item&#x27;s good for the price it is. Great for fine \\&quot;chin hairs\\&quot; but not so good for those \\&quot;over 60\\&quot; little stubborn white hairs.</li>
    <li> Im so happy I bought this little gem! It works great and doesnt hurt as much as I thought it would. Yes when I first used it  on my upper lip it did make my eyes water lol but Ive been using it a few times a week and its not to bad. I just wish I bought one sooner!  I love it so much Im getting a bigger one to do my legs! So worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that this product worked for some people. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have thick black hairs from having PCOS, and hoped that this would aid in my every day battle with facial hair growth.  Nope.  -It&#x27;s painful to use, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It is TWEEZING after all. Though if you compare the commercial, to how it actually feels to use this product..you&#x27;d think that it had been forged by satan himself.  -Didn&#x27;t pluck hairs any better than just using a cheap pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> For several years I suffered the shame of being &amp;#34;the bearded lady&amp;#34;!  Truthfully, it was awful.  I tried everything, and the problem only grew worse.  Pun intended.  Luckily a friend who had the same condition clued me in to this product which plucks those unsightly hairs out; and, after a few weeks, they are not so fast to grow back.  I recommend this inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> I mailed this for my mom. She did not like it. It might have been broken.</li>
    <li> The product works pretty well, although there is a bit of a learning surve to it. It is a bit owie though, especially on the upper lip.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a few months ago after seeing it advertised and thought it looked great. I have difficulty in removing the hairs and it&#x27;s even more painful than waxing.  Maybe it&#x27;s not for my hair type, I don&#x27;t know.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was very disappointed with this product. It will remove peach fuzz type of hair just fine, but not the coarse hair most people want removed. I still have to tweeze! - isn&#x27;t there a product out there that works?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  Unlike some other commenters, I think it is VERY easy to clean.  Pop off the plastic protector top and either give it a good hard \\&quot;blow\\&quot;, or use the little brush that comes with it.      I don&#x27;t think the word \\&quot;hurt\\&quot; is appropriate.  The only place I find painful is above the lips, but I put up with it because hand-tweezing is even more painful. The feeling is a little \\&quot;Oh!\\&quot; at first, but it happens so fast that you kind of get to the point where you say \\&quot;Woo! another one - Gotcha!\\&quot;  It gets hairs I can&#x27;t even see, including those really fine hairs on the cheek.    The first time I used it, I had LOTS of hair and wasn&#x27;t used to the feeling, so take it slow and easy the first time or two until you get used to it.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months it only \\&quot;gets\\&quot; a few hairs.  I use it a few times a week just because I like that smooth as silk feeling. It does the job very quickly!    The first one I bought worked great until I went to change the batteries and I think I did something to the little springs in the battery department because it wouldn&#x27;t work.  I returned it and now have a new one and I am more careful when I change the batteries.     I have only used it on my face so can&#x27;t speak for the legs.  I would think it would take a long time on the legs because the head is very small.  Don&#x27;t yet understand how it works to pull those suckers out by the roots, but it does and that&#x27;s all I care about!</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezer last year at Walgreens for $20. I got it for hair on my chin and sideburns mainly, and it works fairly well. I recommend the hairs grow out a little (so they are suitable for even regular tweezers), and it will work well. I think the problem many people have when the tweezer doesnt work is that they don&#x27;t follow the  directions in the manual. You have to work the Tweeze in a circular motion. Even if you have a dark long hair, and it doesn&#x27;t come out right away, if you continue this motion it WILL get it. I guess it takes some practice at first to use it right, too. I tried it on my upper lip, but it&#x27;s not comfortable for me, so I use other methods to get rid of that hair. Don&#x27;t use it on your eyebrows! I tried to remove some hair on my body/upper chest and it turned red and made bumps- So I don&#x27;t recommend using it anywhere else on your body besides the lower part of your face. I&#x27;m sure you can give it a try and find out the results- trial and error- every product has different results since everyone&#x27;s body is different! Overall this is a time-saver and not a bad price. You will get your moneys worth of this product!    Note about the pain: If you wax, it definitely is not painful. If you tweeze often, it won&#x27;t hurt too much. Just imagine having hair tweezed out very quickly.. that&#x27;s all it is! This product isn&#x27;t meant to get rid of tons of hair (leg hair, beards, etc)- For that use a different product.</li>
    <li> Thank you... It is a great product to have on hand. Does not take up much space especially when traveling.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it immediately and it worked quickly to remove hair.  I used this on my upper lip and it wasn&#x27;t painful - maybe because I have waxed all these years.  We will see if the hair takes longer to grow in, that will be the real test.  Much faster than tweezing also.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to note the price was too good to be true for this instrument. Oh well it really was true it did none of the things it claims. Removing two prominent hairs on my chin as a woman required that I use this machine continuously and got a scar but the hair stuck to my chin. This was basically what happened evertime I used. I would request people to double think when buying this. The $10 stuff at drug stores does a marvelous job compared to this one that was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Zum</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my upper lip hair all my life.  I used to bleach it, then I tried 8 laser treatments, and they never went away (because the hair is so fine).  This epilator is a good option for getting rid of unwanted facial hair.  It is not painless though!</li>
    <li> Great concept, works ok. You have to get them at the right angle and you cannot apply to much pressure or it gets your skin and you get razor bumps. Doesnt hurt though feels like tweezers. Misses hairs sometimes and you have to go slow. The hairs have to be kinda long also, wish their was a better permanent option for dark completion skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and would be interested in purchasing a replacement. does a good job with little pain</li>
    <li> I just received my Emoji Tweezer and it is NOT new, it came sealed in a bag not the original packaging and it came without the guard on it. I had one of these I had bought at walmart and lost it so I was looking to replace it. I guess I will go scour Walmart for another one since this was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I had one and gave it away to a guest who fell in love with the product! Needless to say I ordered myself another!!!</li>
    <li> I will be returning this it&#x27;s a waste of time.  This just breaks off the hair so then you end up with stubble.</li>
    <li> I bought this little automatic tweezer from Amazon through my boyfriend&#x27;s account because he usually buys several things to get shipping deals.  I chose this one because I am so pleased with the Emjoi AP99 Optima that I&#x27;ve had for a year or so.  So far I like the smaller version because of the size and weight, and it&#x27;s made for facial hair removal.  My only problem with the unit is, I have facial hair growing from the end of my eyebrows down to my upper cheeks that is hard to remove with regular tweezers.  I don&#x27;t want to use chemical removers because they can be very irritating, and I don&#x27;t want to use too many chemical based cosmetics.  I refuse to use wax, because it can cause the skin to break down.  So I bought this to remove the facial hair on my upper cheeks, and my upper lip.  It works great on my upper lip, but the area from the end of my brows to my upper cheek it didn&#x27;t do much.  Because of this, I got overzealous and irritated the skin by trying to make it work.  I think the guard is a nice feature, but it seems to get in the way of areas like the cheek area I described.  I would NEVER try to use it to tweeze my brows though. The skin is too thin in that area; I think I&#x27;m pushing my luck with the lower brow/upper cheek area as it is, (it&#x27;s really the sides of the face).  I also noticed a faint smell when using it for a few minutes, I stopped it so that it wouldn&#x27;t damage the motor, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with that yet.  If I was able to get it to work in the area on the sides of my face that I described, I would have given it 5 stars.  If I find a way to have success in this area, I will add to this review to be fair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several times to make this item work as advertised. It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs and is only strong enough to pull downy, soft hairs out. If it worked, it might be worth the pain. It doesn&#x27;t, so it isn&#x27;t. Save your money and use a good mirror, light &amp; tweezers.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these - one for myself and one for my husband.  I thought he could use it on his ears and around his mustache and I wanted it for my chin, since we both work on these areas with tweezers.  Unfortunately, it fails to deliver.  It does not pick up the little hairs and if you wait until they are big enough, it is too late - you can already see them, so need to groom before they will work with the device.  Longer hairs have to be trimmed to be picked up, so now you have two steps involved.  I should have returned, but it is too much of a hassle and too expensive.  Back to my tweezers, they work lots better and are much cheaper - and no batteries required!</li>
    <li> Tweeze working great for facial hair on you upper lip, a little bit more challenging for under your chin. Overall I love it,  it isn&#x27;t anymore painful then tweezers and does a much better, faster job</li>
    <li> It works on fine facial hair but not short stubby hairs.  For the price I took the risk.  It&#x27;s just \\&quot;okay\\&quot;, not what you hope for when you see it on TV.</li>
    <li> Noisy, painful, and does not produce results promised.  Another item for the trash bin.</li>
    <li> I use this little gem for pesky facial hair.  I like it so well, I ordered the second one for my sister.</li>
    <li> Works good.  Nice to have for a quick touch up on those nasty chin hairs.</li>
    <li> They are guaranteeing no scratching. But my face is sore and full of bumps after using it. Completely a waste of money and I hate it. It is not at all pulling out hair but ya one thing it is absolutely doing, making my face ugly by leaving sore, red and inflamed skin.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement of another I lost. It is great for facial hair.  It takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I have old fashioned tweezers and I was trying to &#x27;modernize&#x27; my arsenal. I could easily get an &#x27;Anthony Davis&#x27; (Kentucky) type unibrow if I don&#x27;t tame the beast bi-monthly. Which I do by going to a waxing place and having them clean up the brows. However, sometimes I just need to do it myself and the tweezers are time consuming. Gave this a try... not worth my time. Not consistent and didn&#x27;t give me the results I needed. Usually give pretty good reviews on most products but this one stood out as a bad one unfortunately.</li>
    <li> It didnot work since it came. Want to return it</li>
    <li> Not any easier or less painfull to use than standard tweezers.  Directions not very helpfull.</li>
    <li> Item works very well, particularly if you cannot always \\&quot;see\\&quot; everything in your mirror. As a babyboomer I am glad to have found this item.</li>
    <li> This product is good for removing fine facial hairs.  I still use tweezers for a few of the thicker hairs.  The Tweeze is not quick and it is not pain-free but it is preferable to using a razor which leaves stubble or using the larger Emjoi products designed for legs which can \\&quot;beat up on\\&quot; your face.  It takes a little practice to get the right angle at which to apply the Tweeze.  Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This Emjoi Tweeze is a great product.  My sister bought one and I tried hers.  It is so nice to tweeze those unwanted chin hairs and those on the upper lip.  It is small enough that it packs easily for traveling as well.  I bought one for my Mom and for my daughter.  We are all happy tweezers!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the tweezer actually pulls hair right out. They do grow back in a couple of days, I was hoping it would be longer than that. I do like it and would reccommend to anyone.  Marlene Mueller</li>
    <li> Unfortunatly this product did not meet up to my standards. Open the package carefully so that it will be easier to return. Better yet, invest 5 bucks in a good pair of tweezers unless you enjoy a red chin or hair maybe or maybe not being pulled after fifteen minutes of trying.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the Tweeze Tweezer.  It does not take off the hair very well and does pull when it is used.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Creams were no longer working (and causing incredible irritation) on my upper lip so I decided to try the tweezer.  It&#x27;s great.  After the first few uses there is no pain or redness so I can use it anytime and the results last for weeks.  I had my sisters try it and they each bought one to use on upper lip and chin and they both love it too!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Tweeze and it works just as seen on TV.  It is a good value for the price and I would recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> works ok, batteries are not so short-last....  but it doesn´t eliminates all the hairs.... only most of them... but it´s usefull if you have to travel or doesn´t have a lot of time to remove the hairs</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! As a semi-proud member of the metrosexual generation who also has unruly ear/eyebrow hair, I was really glad to see this tweezer works! Ear hair is just gross and trying to not look like an old man with ear hair has become a DAILY chore.     A few swipes with this gizmo and my ears are silky smooth.     Yes, it&#x27;s loud, but man, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Do it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for some hairs on my face. thought it would be good for a touch up or quickie thing. but it didn&#x27;t pull a thing, not even break a hair. I have the Braun Epilady. I have dropped it, it&#x27;s old and it still works like a charm.     Good luck</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t used this thing yet. i bought it years ago at bed, bath and beyond. when i took it out the package to use it, the shear sound of it made me cringe. then when i took a closer look at the part that grabs the hair, i said NO WAY. i would feel more comfortable using my tweezers, they&#x27;re painful but it&#x27;s bearable, won&#x27;t tear things off my face. it&#x27;s still in the bottom of my closet.</li>
    <li> My mom just purchased this item and I think that she will definitely be using it on a regular basis. My mom has the tendency to go a little long without tweezing her upper lip or eyebrows mainly because it&#x27;s a bit time consuming.     We tried this out last night and it worked well. I wish it had more tweezers because there comes a point where there are a lot of little strays and you really have to have your eye on a strand of hair and line up the tweezer with the hair in order to get it. However, it only took about 5 minutes to do my mom&#x27;s upper lip and eyebrow and it got the majority of the hair. It does miss some hair but it really cuts the time to tweeze by more than 75%. I would definitely recommend buying this instead of going to wax. But you should have a family member or friend do it, it makes it super easy!</li>
    <li> I have used these hair removers for many years &amp; am on only my third one.  Removes hair so quickly that you barely feel the slight sting &amp; it&#x27;s easy to get used to that.  Obviously I&#x27;m satisfied since I&#x27;m a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Absolute best money I ever spent!!!  Being an Italian I am prone to hairy chin and mustache. As I got older it was more like beard and mustache. I used to use hot wax. Never again. This has truly been the easiest and most efficient way to remove facial hair. I highly recomend it. Is it painful? A little but no where near as painful as hot wax. Try it youll love it.</li>
    <li> Need a replacement. The one I rec&#x27;vd is not working properly</li>
    <li> I used to use a shaver or wax, until I found this wonderful product. I only have a few hairs on my chin, and upper lip, and using the Emjoi is almost painless. And it lasts much longer as well. I even bought one for a friend that has a much worse problem than I do. She loves it and swears by it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!!  Great for the face.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is awesome!  It is well worth the money.  It works great on getting those nasty chin hairs and moustache hairs, us women hate!  Sure it stings a little, but so does a tweezer. This is much faster and the pain gets less the more you use it.  The pain was worst on my sensitive upper lip and I barely feel it, now, after using it for a couple months. I don&#x27;t understand the people that complain about hairs growing back fast.  It pulls them by the root and they are going to grow back, just as fast, if you use a tweezer.  If you don&#x27;t want the hairs to grow back, pay up the money for a specialist.  Also, this is not made for eyebrows.  My husband loves this, too.  I use it on the hairs on his ears and nose, before I give him a haircut.  The only downside is that it does go through batteries fairly fast.  But, it is worth it and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> this  item  does  what  it   was  bought  for I have fine  blond hair  could not see it but felt it enough to be a  nuisance now  my  face and neck  feel  smooth.</li>
    <li> To be honest, haven&#x27;t used this much.  Why??  It hurts!!!  It shocks the heck out of you to have a hair ripped from your body.  The noise it makes doesn&#x27;t help.  On the other hand, the hairs did come out.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for this again, since I tried the Epilady years ago and returned it, and this is the same thing, only smaller. I can rub it all over my chin for five minutes, and it won&#x27;t pull out any coarse black hairs, so what&#x27;s the point? Every so often I feel a sharp sting, so it must get a fine hair that&#x27;s just the right length at times. So, in the end, I still have to tweeze every day. Seems kind of pointless.</li>
    <li> One of the best facial tweezer&#x27;s that you can buy for the money. Works exactly as it states. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> The seller was fine. The product doesn&#x27;t work.  I have yet to have a SINGLE hair pulled out of the follicle. Thinking of requesting a refund! Don&#x27;t buy this model.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had once already owned this product but when it had first came out in Wal-Mart stores as one of the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; products and I love how it done exactly what it said it would do but for years I could never find it again after the one I had came up missing. Thanks to Amazon after so many years of searching I now own another one and at a g</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful alternative to tweezers. I had looked for it for awhile and was happy to get it. I love it and so does the friend who received one as a gift.</li>
    <li> WOW! This thing really works great!!! I had an epilady years ago, and have been looking for a small compact epi product.  This one is great, and I store it in my make-up bag for easy access.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;m a convert now.  It DOES work!  And it&#x27;s not really painful.  No worse than a little \\&quot;pull\\&quot; feeling.    It&#x27;s certainly easier than tweezing those upper-lip hairs, depilatories are messy and smelly, waxing - OUCH!     It&#x27;s hard to get into some spots like next to your nose but it works as advertised and I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> I had the Emjoi with the lighted tweezer for years and loved it. I accidentally got a necklace stuck in it (make sure you take off your jewelry when using these things) and needed a new one. When I went to replace it I decided on this model, since I rarely used the tweezers. BIG MISTAKE! This model is so cheaply made, and it didn&#x27;t work! I don&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t tweeze, I mean it didn&#x27;t work AT ALL. First of all, it was supposed to have batteries - it did not. No big deal. I&#x27;m not going to complain that I didn&#x27;t get some no-name batteries that would have only lasted a couple weeks anyway. I put brand new batteries in it.It didn&#x27;t turn on. I don&#x27;t know if the on/off switch doesn&#x27;t work, or what, but it&#x27;s worthless. Back it goes, and I&#x27;ve NEVER returned anything before that I bought on Amazon. I thought I&#x27;d save some $$ by going with a cheaper model, but I guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all. It couldn&#x27;t even pick up a single hair on my face or arms. I have coarse and light hair and it didn&#x27;t do a thing. Do not waste your money on this. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a product like this ...i must say that it does a pretty good job of pulling hairs out from its roots...it doesn&#x27;t hurt just a little prick at times but nothing to make your eyes water...I liked this product after use your skin feels really smooth .</li>
    <li> I love this product! So easy to use and very effective. I wore my first one out and was so glad that I could still find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Tweeze. The light isn&#x27;t all that great in my bathroom and I used to worry that I would miss a stray facial hair. I don&#x27;t worry now. It doesn&#x27;t hurt either .</li>
    <li> THESE WORK OK, BUT AT TIMES CAN BE A LITTLE PAINFUL, I USE THEM MORE FOR THE FUZZIER STUFF ON MY FACE AND TWEEZERS FOR THE OTHERE</li>
    <li> this is the worse product i ever purchased,do not waste your money and amazon should not sell this product at all.</li>
    <li> This makes facial hair removal so fast and painless that anyone anyage can use this.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Tweeze to everyone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t review because I could get the right model. After two tries I gave up</li>
    <li> This little gadget is a miracle.  It works fast and is much less painful than tweezing.  No more unibrow thanks to this guy!</li>
    <li> Cannot believe how very well this product works.  My &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; friends, with facial hair challenges will be receiving one for birthday or Christmas (which ever comes first.)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive and terrific way to remove those pesky chin and mustache hairs ladies, this is it!</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s a lot less painful than my larger one, but this one is perfect for the face. No more waxing....and my husband will love that I&#x27;m saving money!!</li>
    <li> got it for a parent, and it does exact what it says it does. cheaper than any other as seen on tv sites</li>
    <li> I brought this for my chin, unfortunately after the first use the batteries were already runned down.  it is a little painful at first (they are tweezers afterall) but you get used to it.  5 days later, still no stubble so definetly worth it.</li>
    <li> Well this definitely removes hair, but it hurts/pinches and the hair doesn&#x27;t stay gone very long.  Also makes little bumps appear where the hair is removed.  Not a good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, easy to clean, and efficient. I still have to use tweezers for the really stiff hairs, but they are now easier to find.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this tweezer I don&#x27;t have to worry any more about any embarrassing \\&quot;stray hairs\\&quot;. I use it about once a month, and my skin has never been smoother or lovelier. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to keep clean. I don&#x27;t what know what I did for so many years without it!</li>
    <li> Does not work as advertised.  You would be better off using a good pair of regular tweezers.    I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a cool little device.  It works great and is so much faster than tweezing!  I&#x27;ve read where some people complain about the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; -- It&#x27;s exactly the same as the pain felt with tweezing, but the job is done about 30x faster!</li>
    <li> To use this product, one has to accept that most methods of hair removal are painful. No, the Emjoi Tweeze is not painless, but if you want to rip your hair out by the roots - whether by tweezing or waxing - don&#x27;t be shocked if it ends up hurting!    Why do I like this product so much? Other reviewers have said that a regular tweezer works just as well. That might be true, but if you want to remove more than a few hairs, regular tweezing is time-consuming and frustrating. Also, it is hard to get pefectly hairless skin with a regular tweezer.     Waxing and tweezing are not options for me because a hormonal problem causes the hair to grow back very quickly. I can&#x27;t wax or tweeze often enough. Also, I have very sensitive skin that reacts adversely to those methods of hair-removal.     Using the Emjoi Tweeze has been a lifesaver for me. I use the Tweeze once a week for about 10 minutes. I use it on my upper lip and chin and a little bit on the sides of my face. Because my skin is also prone to breakouts, I clean my skin well and then apply hydrogen peroxide with a cotton ball. I do this both before and after hair-removal. I use an oil-free moisturizer a little later on to prevent the peroxide from drying out my skin.    This kind of hair removal can sometimes cause an ingrown hair problem, and I do have that problem when I use an epilator on my legs, but I do not have any ingrown hairs on my face at all from using the Tweeze. For those who do have ingrown hairs, there are lotions that claim to solve that.     About the pain:  This does hurt, especially on the upper lip (which would hurt just as much if waxing, for example). However, the key to using this device is being consistent. I can&#x27;t stress this enough. If you use an epilator once in a while when you&#x27;re in the mood for smooth skin, it will hurt a lot. But if you use it consistently - say once a week - after the third week or so, the pain will be greatly diminished. Use it even if only a few hairs grew back. Don&#x27;twait until it&#x27;s \\&quot;worth it\\&quot; for you to take out the epilator, because by the time you wait for that to happen, you&#x27;ll be at the point where it will hurt a lot.    I have found that using the Tweeze consistently accomplishes three things:  1. It becomes less painful with time.  2. Hairs grow back more slowly.  3. Hairs are easier to remove. The process is much, much quicker.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a couple of months of deliberation. I knew it would hurt a bit and I wanted to use it on my upper lip. I do not have dark hairs and they are not thick but I wanted them gone none the less. On the description it said painless. That is not the word I would use. It brought tears to my eyes. I am uncertain about my like for this product. I gave it a 4 because it does what it is meant to do. I reserved the last star because it hurts. The only other options in my opinion are to wax or do the tweeze and on waxing it hurts but is over and done in a second and this takes longer but I only had to pay once. Oh the dilemma.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought from another company  and it worked so well I brought another for travel......well the emoji tweezer  I brought did not work AT ALL! New batteries  and it still did not turn on AT ALL! I was confused because  it came in original  packaging  that had not been opened.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Tweeze for my 95 year old mother who has some minor vision issues.  She says the Tweeze works very well and she is confident that it removes all of the unwanted facial hair.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the Tweeze hair removal system I was desperate.  I have a hormonal disorder called polycystic ovarian disease and among other things it causes abnormal hair growth on the face.  I had embarressing upper lip hair and wirey, dark hairs on my chin and neck.  I have tried all types of hair removal except for expensive laser treatments.  Plucking was time consuming and painful but seemed to be the only route to keeping my problem under control.  Tweeze is a God send!!  The first few times I used it there was a little sting, like a small electric shock when the hair was being pulled but I really didn&#x27;t find it painful.  Now, I feel no pain at all and cheer to myself when using Tweeze.  I would encourage any woman to try this, especially those who have had the same type experience I have.  I honestly think you&#x27;ll love Tweeze and want to share it with everyone you know.  Roberta-Baltimore, MD</li>
    <li> The description of this product is pretty right on. It isn&#x27;t as loud as some of the reviewers claim it is. It makes a slight buzzing noise...about as loud as a nose/ear hair trimmer. And it does not hurt, especially if you are accustomed to tweezing your stray hairs, this product causes no discomfort at all. It also pretty much drives itself forward across your skin.   Just as it says in the instructions that come with the tweeze, hairs have to be at least 5mm for the product to grasp and pull it.   Tweeze works great and does what it says it does</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for about 25 years and was really getting tired of it.  I bought this and it does take the hassel of waxing away.  I can use this anytime and anywhere.  I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Tweeze really does work well.  I use it on my chin and neck and am very happy with the results.  The only negative thing is that my lip area is too sensitive for it.  Still, the product does the job!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Tweeze.  It works like an electric razor but, because it is pulling out the hairs rather than cutting them,  there is never any stubble.  Never!  None!  I love it!  I have already given two Tweezes as gifts and have heard nothing but positive feedback.  I am so happy to have found the Tweeze.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t read reviews saying it&#x27;s very painful. It is not. Good quality and it works with very thin hair. No more Hastle with the tweezers!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected. Pulled my hair on the sides of my face. Gave it away, maybe they will like it.</li>
    <li> You truly get what you pay for with this product.  With that in mind this product is \\&quot; O K \\&quot; .  I used it primarily on my face.  It&#x27;s not very effective on fine peach fuzz type facial hair.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works. That&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
    <li> Thie tweezer is just like the Emjoy hair remover it bites me. I think I will stick with wax it hurts much less</li>
    <li> The first one of these I bought worked for 7 yrs before it quit.  This is my second Emjoi Tweeze and it works as well as the first.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be using this again.  Instead of having facial hair I had scabs from the abrasions after using this one time.  I felt that I was cautious using it and followed directions but was surprised the next morning when my face had irritation where I had used it.  In the trash it will go&amp;#34;!!</li>
    <li> This works well to catch small hairs, too. You get use to the tugs (it&#x27;s really kind of barbaric, huh? Ripping our hair out:). I only use it for chin hairs. Good price.</li>
    <li> The hair takes forever to be plucked and the emoji gets heated up during the process. It leaves bumps on your face after that make your skin look like a reptile. Not a good product, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, especially if you have stubborn facial hair.</li>
    <li> i was shock when i put in the batteries and follow the insructions but nothing happened the device did not start at all.....</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to a friend because I had one for myself and loved it! Now she loves it, too! It&#x27;s a great little tool to be able to make you face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s you know what! :-)&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered quickly and works perfectly. Thanks! I&#x27;d buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> This was a piece of plastic junk. I feel like I just purchase a plastic vibrating toy.  I wish it worked bit unfortunately it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t tweeze as well as they say it will, but it does better than a \\&quot;hand\\&quot; tweezer.  I use it, but I also still use a regular tweezer.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my sister and it&#x27;s wonderful! I could not keep up with my \\&quot;moustache\\&quot; - clipping, tweezing. The Emjoi AP-9T is everything they said it would be. Yes, there is a bit of discomfort until one gets accustomed to using it on the upper lip, around the nose, but lessens each time you use it. The hairs grow back so much more slowly now! I highly recommend it - and the price was great!!</li>
    <li> Having owned one in the past, which worked wonderfully (unfortunately dropped and broke), I find that the motor on this one is not at all powerful.  It drags and gives the impression that the batteries are old.  I am really not satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Works well for the job.  Wish it had multiple tweezers on the end than just one.  However, I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent for one of the cheapest epilators. It gets all the hair and leaves your skin smooth. Only negative I have is is loud. And whatever you do, don&#x27;t drop it. It can&#x27;t handle being dropped. It will shatter and break. Overall, I will always go for this brand over the the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works exactly as advertised. It is reliable. It is inexpensive. The batteries last a long, long time. I had mine for years before my daughter tried it and broke the plastic cover (she is seven and can break anything just by looking at it). I&#x27;m not even going to look to see if there are any other comparable products - I&#x27;m just getting a new one. Love it!</li>
    <li> I had this same one but it stopped working. I bought a different one but it only had one battery and with any pressure on skin it would slow down. This one does not do this with the two batteries. Would be nice if it had two wheels to work on face.</li>
    <li> When I ordered it I thought this was the one but I was wrong because it don&#x27;t pull where it suppose to even when the hair is right there to be removed, you have to constantly use it in the same spot and it also dies your two AAA Duracell batteries quickly. I am disappointed with it and it too late for me to return it. So I will not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yes I am happy with my tweezer and told my sister buy one.  She ordered the very day I showed her mine. She plucks her excess hair  by a regular tweezer. I know this will be much easier. But hers was cheaper :( the same as mine</li>
    <li> This has been a great money saver and does a very thorough job.  I loved it so much I purchased two additional for my daughters.  Great item.</li>
    <li> After needing to tweeze facial hair everywhere for years, this was an absolute pleasant surprise. This is the second one I have purchased because I wanted an extra for my travel bag.  Since I have owned this, I have even been able to stop waxing all facial hair, and I LOVE IT.  This is a great little gadget !! It gets 5 stars from this consumer !!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mothers chin whiskers, and she reports that it does the job, although it does pull a little at times.</li>
    <li> It does what I hoped it would; removes chin hair quickly and with no pain. You can feel it. but, it is so fast you barely feel it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  No breakouts after using it.  Great for someone w/very fine (peach fuzz)</li>
    <li> This might be useful if you never ever plucked hair from your face before. The only hair it removed for me were a few fine ones that no one could see anyway. Any visible hairs- the kind it claims to pull-were still there, no matter what direction I ran the product in.   Amazon was great in processing a full refund.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It is saving me LOTS of money and trips to the salon for a lip/chin wax!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product since the tweezer.  Being menopausal has brought on various problems, not the least being excess facial hair.  This product get the hairs my eyes cannot see if I&#x27;m not outside in the bright sunlight.  I have much more confidence in my appearance since purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I can tell you that this Emjoi didn&#x27;t pull a single hair out of me.   My girlfriend have a different one... I guess I&#x27;ll have to borrow it again.  This emjoi AP-9T is the worse thing I ever bought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My first one wore out after 2 years..really missed it.  Less painful and more efficient than tweezing... much smoother and longer lasting than shaving the area.</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of money. It would be less painful to burn your facial hair off with a candle than use this. I&#x27;ve given it several go&#x27;s and the results are terrible and the pain is almost off the chart! My eyes water like crazy &amp; I can only do a little bit at a time. It says it pulls the hair out by the roots, but from the looks of the results, I think it scrapes them off at skin level. A horrible product! Get an epicare instead.</li>
    <li> This is buy far one of the best purchases i&#x27;ve made in awhile! It hurts a little but it&#x27;s totally worth the results and plus you get used to it. After you use for awhile it&#x27;s not so bad. I love it!</li>
    <li> Only pulls out 1 or 2 hairs at a time. Thats good for the face. I have very fine &amp; blond hairs on my upper lip. I only have a few darker noticable hairs that I like to pull out. Even after cleaning tweezer to get off any residue machine oil off- ***it still makes my skin break out something terrible.*** I figured if it worked for me I&#x27;d get one for my mom- nah. It takes entirely to long to do legs- And maybe because my hair is fine....it just breaks a lot of the hairs instead of pulling them out.    I only have patches of hair on my legs- not much. It still takes to long &amp; the batteries run dry very quickly. You&#x27;ll have to buy yourself the Big battery pack!   I&#x27;m thinking of giving it to my best friend, who by the way is Italian and has more of a upper lip problem- maybe she&#x27;ll like.</li>
    <li> Plastic was cheep, product over heated &amp; didn&#x27;t work.  Have had several before with no problems.  This one looked like a knock off. Will not reorder.</li>
    <li> OK...this product does remove unsightly facial hair...but one hair at a time. It is extrememly painful. I have to really talk myself into using this as after I am done, I am sore and red for a couple hours. Is it worth buying? I don&#x27;t know. Depends on if you are good at tolerating pain. And like I said in the beginning, it only takes out one hair at a time. That makes it seem like the process takes forever. I do use it but not as often as I should.</li>
    <li> Tweeze is quick and easy to use. I have been using one for about 5 years, and bought a back up to travel with. Its not as painful as tweezing or waxing, because it works so fast, and I can use it every couple days. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I love this. Removes chin and lip hair quickly. Very little pain. And no redness. It is portable and fast !</li>
    <li> This inexpensive little instrument gets high marks for the efficient job it does.  My only complaint is that it can be difficult for the older, arthritic hand to operate.  Persistent effort is well-rewarded.  Electric tweezers at three times the price are available; but this does the job just as well, once it decides to cooperate.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it pulls the hairs out doesn&#x27;t shave them off.  It hurts a bit at first, but if you use it regularly, there is not much pain</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these, they work great. The price is amazing. I would buy something better for lots of hair. I just use this on my lip area and chin.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good for fine hair removal. Quick and virtually painless although it does take a little bit of getting used to.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when they first came out - this is a horrible version of what was a great product.  It didn&#x27;t work at all and no matter how tightly I pulled the skin taught, it pinched bits of skin and left me with welts and raw spots.</li>
    <li> This is a decent item for the price but it is definately not some super hair-remover.&lt;br /&gt;It does not pick up coarse in-grown hairs and I think it may even cause some of them. I have sensitive skin and a very high pain tolerance so take those two things into account when I say it causes pores to slightly enlarge but it does not hurt in the least bit. I can&#x27;t use hair-removal creams because of my sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t wish to spend a fortune on the latest hair-removal gadgets that may or may not work so this was still a good buy for me that I don&#x27;t regret. For the most part, this works but don&#x27;t throw out your regular tweezers because they will still be needed and keep some witchhazel handy as a cleanser before and after use to help with any skin irritation from sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, another thing to consider with this review is my skin is not acne prone. I have very good skin, just sensitive and I scar very easily so I can not attest to how this item will work with any other skin type, but for the price it&#x27;s a good buy to at least try the product out and see if it works well for you.</li>
    <li> Love the product !  Works great. Have owned one before and wore it out!  Every one should have one .</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing invented for women, it is a little expensive, but worth it.  It is a great product, last a long time, and I love it.  This one is for my sister, I would recommend this to all women.m</li>
    <li> I used to wax my facial hair and that was always a headache because it has to grow out a certain lenght and I dont like walking around with a mustache, so I started shaving it with a eyebrow razor well that leaves ugly stubbles so I heard from a friend about the tweeze and thought what do I have to loose, I tried it right away it took a little longer since I had stubble but then it was great I do suggest pulling skin tout when do upper lip  it stings a bit but not like waxing so if your undecided on this product let me tell you go ahead and give it a try I am going to order a few more for my daughter and a friends Mom. sincerly Facial Hair Free in Texas!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was spending too much time plucking stray hairs from my lady body. I found it to be fairly painless compared to using regular tweezers or waxing. Also, the hairs I plucked have come back significantly thinner and lighter. The battery life seems to be more than adequate seeing as I&#x27;ve only had to use one pair of AAA in the last month, and I use it quite often. I was worried about the motor a couple times when I caught a stray string from my socks but it seemed to cause no damage to the product and was removed easily. Clean-up is simple as the clear part easily detaches and reattaches. It does take some time to use on larger areas as it can only pull one hair at a time, but it&#x27;s worth it because it keeps the pain to a minimal. Overall, great product, would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great for removing those unwanted stray hairs, and they stay gone much longer than with shaving. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I read the other posts and people made it sound like the pain was tolerable, so I tried it. This thing hurts like hell on your upper lip but tolerable in other places. I don&#x27;t know how often I will continue to use this. It is also time consuming.</li>
    <li> This hardly pulled out any hair but tugged on everything to the point where my skin was raw and hurting.  The mechanism to pull out hair is harsh and I would much rather use wax, tweezer, ANYTHING BUT THIS product.</li>
    <li> Already have one. and did not want to be without one.  Do not know why everyone does not have one!!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money! This item is junk!! It will leave marks on your skin and does not do what it says!!</li>
    <li> This is a product that really works. I had one before but the motor burned out. I immediately ordered another one.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older Tweeze, which was substantial feeling and worked so well.  Unfortunately I broke it.  So, bought this to replace it.  The quality went WAY down between the first and second.  Cheap.  Loud.  The company must&#x27;ve sent this item to another manufacturing company who mangled it.  Don&#x27;t try it.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be quite uncomfortable, I did not like I one bit! I rather use a Manuel tweezers it get it over with. Buy at your on risk. Thanks but no thanks!</li>
    <li> This product easily removes tiny hairs on the chin and jaw area with ease.  It tweezes them, so there is the same feeling as if you were using a tweezer, but it is much more rapid.</li>
    <li> I have had my Tweeze tweezers about a month now and I truly love it. I use it all the time. I have these crazy hairs that grow from my chin and I was going to get waxed every week , but now I just tweeze them out two minutes and I am done. So far I have made my money back five times over because I can also do my eye brows and in between my eyes with it.  Yes it does hurt but no more than waxing. I don&#x27;t use it on my legs I am not that tough. But if you have stray hairs and want a way to get rid of them fast this product is for you. Hope this helps. Oh I almost forgot  to tell you about my husbands ears. He has some hairs that are starting to grow out of them. I can&#x27;t stand it so I talked him into letting me tweeze them. He wane a little but his ears look so much better.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and it really worked quite well, so I tried to replace it locally but couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere. You can find almost anything you need on this web site --- only place to shop!</li>
    <li> Not working properly, stop working after 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit I use this.  I can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore; and it works great.  I am petite and fair skinned with dark hair and eyebrows.  I hate any light or dark facial hair.  I use this for my face which is sensitive; and it works great.  The battery life is never what I hope for, but it does the job:)</li>
    <li> it does work, it gets the hair but i hate the greasiness of the product they use for the gears. I took off the guard which your not suppose to i guess to get a closer hair removal. It works when you do that but I am looking for something less cheap for my face with more tweezers on it so it can get the job done. This you have to rotate rapidly. Not bad though as this review seems but I just want to see if there is something better out there.</li>
    <li> my old one broke so ordered this one, Does not pick up the hairs and remove them. Ended up ordering another maker</li>
    <li> love my Tweezer... I wish I could find a larger one..</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think with all the pain you feel it&#x27;d be worth it... this thing is terrible. Doesn&#x27;t even pull out the hairs, just yanks on it and causes bleeding. And you may get your skin pinched!!! Buyer beware</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I do not have  much facial hair.  Despite that, I do have some pesky chin hairs that pop up.  This little wonder grabs them in no time.  No need to find the glasses, and stand in front of a magnified mirror.  This is my second one.  The first one lasted for years.  I don&#x27;t know how it would work with people that would have to pluck daily, but have bought one for a friend that has that issue.  She has not yet used it.</li>
    <li> I like the Tweeze Tweezer because it works. It removes unwanted facial hair quickly and easily. The only problem I have with this product is that the on-off switch wears out after a few months and you have to replace the whole thing. However, because they are inexpensive, this hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
    <li> I had one a long time ago but it stopped working, so I wanted to buy another one.  I love it!  Works faster than using a tweezers.</li>
    <li> My 96 yr. old mother LOVES this tweezer.  She feels so comfortable using it.  Safe and helpful.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my Emjoi tweezer! I don&#x27;t know how I used to have time to sit at the mirror and pluck each individual hair! This saves me a lot of time and is so much easier.</li>
    <li> I wore out one I had for several years--it was great.  This new one does not do the job--disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> My first one lasted about eight years or longer.  I was so glad to buy one on EBAY for $4.95.  I originally paid $25 from HSN.</li>
    <li> giving it a five rating was delivered in 2 days.  also same as picture . To me the noise wasn&#x27;t really loud,tried it out a bit and once you get the hang of it it is not bad with pain, you can have worse pain when you bust a pimple..little red spot but hey it is better than what is out there for different chemicals, price, no no wants about $400.00 to burn the hair off..no thanks nono..I will definitely enjoy this product it.</li>
    <li> Have had an old tweeze for years and have always loved it mom wanted one too and so did my daughter and they both love them!</li>
    <li> a lot faster than plucking.. great for people that don&#x27;t have a lot of time or don&#x27;t see very well.</li>
    <li> This is quite a tweezer. It is amazing how it works. It grips the tiny  hairs above your upper lip and on the the chin. It wisks them away quickly  and gently.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Works awesome,save money on waxing , the drive to Beauty Salon and I recommend it 100%. So get your Tweeze!!</li>
    <li> Both stopped working already, so you understand I was not so pleased, especially I cannot find them in the store anymore.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do but it hurts.  I keep an aloe based cooling moisturizer to use afterward.</li>
    <li> I use it every night. So much faster than single plucking and not very painful.</li>
    <li> I THINK THESE ARE JUNK</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything except hurt! Pulls out a few random hairs and frankly looks worse than before using it. Would not reccomend</li>
    <li> I own this model and like it very much.  I sent it as a gift.  It was liked by the recipient.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife.  She had one previously and it broke and she really wanted another since it did a good job.  She was very pleased with the replacement</li>
    <li> Have owned on of these since they first came out a few years ago.  Have never been disappointed in the product and buying it on Amazon save me a lot of money</li>
    <li> Great value, works great and received it within 10 days, though it said a month&#x27;s time by ground. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This idem works very good and I would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;This idem works very good and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It always works great.  The first time I used it on my chin it was slightly uncomfortable but now I don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
    <li> My old one was very, very old and I wanted a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!!  It is very effective.  More so than any other hair remover I have tried.</li>
    <li> I  bought my first Tweeze when it initially came out, at a retail store, over 8 years ago.  It just died last year and I have been looking for a replacement ever since.  Unable to find Tweeze, I tried a different brand that looked like the Tweeze.  It was seriously a waste of money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> My mother is vision impaired, and for us, this device is a gem. Before the Tweeze, I used to spend an hour of every visit together tweezing, trimming, waxing, etc. Now, she uses her Tweeze a few times a week and our visits are much less &#x27;hairy&#x27;.     Of course, it hurts for a microsecond when hairs are ripped out of your face, but to me it&#x27;s a satisfying little jolt. I admit to giving this as a gift to friends and relatives!     Bottomline: it works best on strong, dark hair vs. fine peach fuzz. An added bonus? It exfoliates and removes dry skin skin wherever you use it.</li>
    <li> I am in the military and was figuring out ways to get out of shaving everday to conform to military standards.    I was looking at waxing options and bought this instead.    For thicker hairs like I have, this sometimes comes in and pulls on the hair, causes the pain, but leaves it safely intact still on my face.    It just doesn&#x27;t do the job in my case haha.</li>
    <li> I really thought that this would be perfect for my facial hair to use, however mine is much too coarse to try to use on my skin and it&#x27;s too sensitive. If you have coarse hair and sensitive skin do not buy this. It&#x27;s very painful and it leaves a million bumps after the effect.</li>
    <li> I started noticing  hair on my face ( as a female) about 8 yrs ago. I was soon after diagnosed with poly cystic over syndrome. Facial hair is a side effect of this disease &amp; I was overwhelmed by the rapid hair growth &amp; 5 o&#x27;clock shadow that developed quickly! Shaving only stimulated hair growth &amp; irritated my skin... Tweeting each individual hair was not working fast enough &amp; in the mean time my self esteem as a sexy female was declining. After countless visits to the dermatologist &amp; laser center I had given up hope. After seeing an infomercial for tweezey I reluctantly tried it!! It changed my life!!! It removes the hair quick &amp; painless, and the best part is ... It&#x27;s inexpensive &amp; portable. Thank you so much for a must have product ( very durable ) &amp; a great value!!! Please don&#x27;t EVER stop making this product!</li>
    <li> Product performance as prizes.</li>
    <li> works great. Im pleased with them.</li>
    <li> this one has a funky odor to it when I use it., other then that its ok</li>
    <li> It hurts some to use, but not as bad as others I&#x27;ve tried.. Takes some getting used to. Needs a better way to clean.</li>
    <li> It did not work.  Sent it back per instructions, but did not receive a new one nor my money returned, plus I spent money to ship it.  I would not give it any stars, but it will not let me do otherwise.</li>
    <li> When it arrived I looked at it and I said I needed it.So I used it , I was so surprised it really works. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product and at the price I paid...wow! I actually enjoyed doing it today for my first time and I must say this is the first time I cleaned ALL the hair from my chin. It&#x27;s so embarrassing being so beautiful with a stubbly chin :(  My worry is ingrown hairs; I hope they don&#x27;t come. I shall see. I know I am definitely purchasing 3 more to keep all to myself for back up. Lol!</li>
    <li> Wow, this works so much better than I thought it would.  Was looking for a cheap epilator to try and see if they even worked for me and then was planning on buying a more expensive brand, but I am not actually going to need to.  I bought it to take care of some of the hair that grows on my chin area and for in-between my eyebrows and it takes care of both areas nicely.  I love not having to pull out the tweezers and having to get inches from a mirror with a bright light to try and get every little hair.  Now, in about a minute every morning I&#x27;m done and don&#x27;t have to worry about if I missed anything.  In my opinion it hurts less than traditional tweezing, and does not leave any redness or irritation.  Leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I so much wanted this to work. I purchased it in hopes of quickly tweezing my upper lip. It seems powerful enough and I followed the instructions carefully, but it does not do the job. I will say that the vendor very promptly replaced the first one I received that didn&#x27;t turn on properly. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other electric tweezer, but after using this one, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to.  It fits very easily in the palm and glides over the skin, even the chin and upper lip.  It removed the hair that grows low on the back of my neck and didn&#x27;t leave any ingrown hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than a waxing strip, and I can use it in the convenience of my own home.  It is also easy to clean.  I just wish I could use it to shape my eyebrows as well, but other than that, it&#x27;s light weight, very reasonably priced and effective.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Better than anything else that I have found. Doesn&#x27;t really cause pain, just need a steady hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that powerful, I still have to use my tweezer. It pulls hair every now then. A waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a lost epilator. It works if you go over the same spot about ten times. Go with an epilator with the three spinning tweezer things instead of this one which only has one.</li>
    <li> This is a great and very effective little product! It exceeds my expectations and I&#x27;m really happy to have it!</li>
    <li> this is trash, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law, and she hasn&#x27;t said anything about it, so I&#x27;m not sure how good it really is.</li>
    <li> Love it, 3rd one for me</li>
    <li> I am one of those unfortunate females that have an amazing amount of hair growth everywhere (thanks, dad). I use a Braun epilator on my legs. It was costly but well worth it. I am constantly having to tweeze hairs on my face. I bought this just to help with that. I knew going in this is a cheap $9 epilator. I mean really...don&#x27;t expect miracles. It works as stated but if you are like me, you will still have to tweeze, just not as much. This is best for side burns. It is a quick fix. Even after using it I have to tweeze a few hairs. I won&#x27;t wax due to the redness and irritation afterwards (plus to get it done right...it&#x27;s expensive!). So this works for me. It is however a cheaply made plastic and I don&#x27;t expect it to last long. My Braun has lasted 5 years so far. It works best if you clean your face well first, use a warm cloth on the area you will be tweezing to open pores then gently pull skin tight and tweeze. Use a cold cloth afterwards to reduce redness and close pores. DON&#x27;T RUB. I use a dab of sesame oil on places that I have removed hair to help reduce irritation and/or bumps. Other oils may work as well. Just research organic, anti bacterial oils that do not clog pores (non-comedogenic). DON&#x27;T add make up or anything after using an epilator for at least an hour. P.S. use without the clear guard for better results.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one I lost; i liked the first one very much but this one isn&#x27;t quite as accurate.  Eventually it gets the   hairs but it takes some doing.  I am still pleased with the ultimate  result.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product for plucking facial hairs around the mouth and chin on women.  A friend of mine showed it to me, I bought one for myself and now this purchase is for my (grown) granddaughter for part of her Christmas present.</li>
    <li> I love it..saves me so much time than having to use the tweezers..and removes the hair I can&#x27;t see..thanks so much</li>
    <li> I had a  battery tweezer similar to this one but it seemed to be more precise. I have to go back a forth many of times for the hair to remove.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t like to get the thick hairs but over all I&#x27;m happy. It does hurt like the dickens but just be sure to warm the area before you start so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt so badly.</li>
    <li> would not recommend this facial tweezer. very poor item. nothing like the origimal one that I had.  cheap casing and it did not work</li>
    <li> It does not work as expected. The only thing it does is rub on the skin. No hair was removed. I was extremely upset.</li>
    <li> You may as well just shave your face...this tool randomly selected the longer hairs to yank out.  While the discomfort is mild...the hair removal is almost non-existent.</li>
    <li> I should have sprung the 20-30 for the real epilator.. this thing just does not cut it! You feel it pull maybe one or two hairs but when you look at the area you&#x27;ve just done the prominent hairs are still there. not great for coarse or stubborn hair, but may work for someone with fine blondish hair.. al;though if you have fine blondish hair why do you need an epilator? haha</li>
    <li> I just ordered this a day or so ago (already have one but it&#x27;s old). I just received word that it will take about 6 weeks! It is literally on a &amp;#34;slow boat from China&amp;#34;! I am trying to cancel the order through the vendor. I know...good luck. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> that one still works,so ordered 2 on computer,one works great,other not so good,what do you  expect made  in buy gooks in china,pay more and still cheap quality stuff,start making stuff in America,might pay more,but you will get good quality stuff,that last?</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT  THIS IS BETTER THAN USING HAIR REMOVER CREME,  I RATHER BE USING THIS PRODUCT OVER ANY OTHER HAIR REMOVER , JUST WHEN USING ,WASH YOU FACE IN HOT TO WARM WATER TO OPEN UP YOUR POURS ,THEN IT WILL BE EASY FOR COMFORT IN USING</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this Tweeze to give to my daughter who had one that broke.  I was delighted to see this one new and in good condiition and I will give it to her for her birthday in late January.  I know she will be happy to have a new one after having to get along with her fuzzy face for a couple months..</li>
    <li> As far as hair removal goes, the Tweeze Tweezer is okay.  It&#x27;s good for the money but is just as painful as removing hair with tweezers.  The difference is that your tweezing more hair at a time than individual plucking.  Not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad.  Was aware that it would be somewhat painful but the loud sound of such a compact item kinda made me uneasy before I even started hair removal.  Didn&#x27;t seem to remove all hair but it may have been my technique -sound plus pain made me hesitant to touch the Tweeze to my skin (upper lip only area I tried).  Worth a try, but as much as I hate tweezing and lotion depilatories, I will probably stick with either (or both) of those.</li>
    <li> It might be me. I don&#x27;t have particularly coarse hair, but this product is brilliant in concept but poor in actuality. It&#x27;s very hard to &amp;#34;aim&amp;#34; the tweezing mechanism, though when you get it right, the plucking is quite quick and relatively painless.</li>
    <li> I have to pluck my chin and the sides of my face every day (I have PCOS) and I bought this to keep in my van for touch ups. I didn&#x27;t have my regular tweezers and tried to use this. As long as the hairs were long and I kept going in circles over the same spot until it pulled the hair, then I guess I could say it worked, but only on my stomach and underside of my forearm (other places I have thick dark hair). It did little for my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I was hoping for too much because I knew it only had one row of tweezers and wouldn&#x27;t be able to grab as much. In order for it to grab my hair I ad to take off the safety shield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still keep it in my car. Better than having nothing handy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money on this but still, it has one tweezer in the middle and didn&#x27;t get any hairs....sorry sucks, be warned</li>
    <li> &amp; great price too!  I never had an epilator, but have used this for fine facial hair around the lip and chin area and it works very good!</li>
    <li> Same as my old 1 that I ordered on TV.  Had not heard ad on TV or saw in stores so ordered for use in the future.</li>
    <li> I love it! Small fast and easy. Yeay!!</li>
    <li> I use this and I&#x27;m happy with it.  It works well.  Of course it stings to have it pull out the hair, but it&#x27;s preferable to having someone else do it for you at the salon.  Also, it&#x27;s affordable and easy to use.  I bought one for my mom too.</li>
    <li> I am writing this to retract my original review......I received the product as promised, however it did not work....I tried everything but still not working.....given the modest price, it would have cost me more to return it than it was worth....I wrote a review and the seller responded immediately and offered me a refund or replacement.....Since i had a tweeze before, i asked for a replacement....this was sent without hesitation and no charge to me and i did not have to pay to ship the original back to her.....I must say that i am most pleased with the response from this seller....The new tweeze works great and i am thrilled.....All products can fail, but if a seller is willing to go above and beyond to make the customer happy, then that is a seller that i would like to deal with again....thank you again for your prompt service and dedication to Amazon&#x27;s tradition of satisfied customers.......</li>
    <li> Easy and painless works just like it says</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used too, at first it is a little pinch to use over the lip.  Will never pay $15 to wax my lip again!  Very effective!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, and she says it still hurts to pull out chin hairs....upper lip hair removal very painful....JimMc</li>
    <li> Love this mini epillator. I use it to remove hair from upper lip and chin area. No irritation, easy to use and a real money saver.</li>
    <li> The Tweeze Tweezer has helped me several so much time wasted in going to a salon to remove hair from my upper lip and chin every two weeks. Since waxing has done some damage to my very sensitive skin, Tweeze Tweezer has very efficienty managed to pluck tiny hair growing on my face. It produces little or no pain compared to waxing or threading of facial hair. Its quick and easy as compared to driving all the way to a salon every two weeks especially if you are someone who&#x27;s has rapid growth of facial hair like me. The battery life is long and occasional cleaning is required.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use on my upper lip hair. The hair on my upper lip is not coarse or too short/long but this epilator didn&#x27;t do anything. I tried it on the back of my hand and random parts of my arm to see if it could grab longer hair more easily but it still didn&#x27;t work. Sometimes it would break hair off but it didn&#x27;t really pull much out, if at all. I&#x27;ll invest in a good wax instead.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial hair remover I have found in my 50 years of life. Stings a little when you first use it but then you get used to it and hardly notice it. It is great for me as I have poor eye sight and so I just go over the mustache and beard areas to make sure they are hairless. Before trying to tweeze by hand I would alway miss some because I couldnt see them.</li>
    <li> This works as described.  It is an inexpensive way to get rid of annoying chin and over the lip hairs.  It does require making sure your skin has no oil/cream on it and that the device is used at the correct angle for each hair, and the latter is why I gave it 4 instead of 5, but I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and very easy to use and maintain.  I think it works great, and would highly recommend it. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used a Tweeze for removal of unwanted facial hair for several years. My old [[ASIN:B0007CXQUW Emjoi AP-9T Tweeze Tweezer]]Tweeze finally gave out and I ordered a new one. I highly recommend Tweeze. It works great!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best hair removal product I have personally tried. I&#x27;ve struggled with facial chin hair. I am an African American woman and the hair tended to be coarse. I&#x27;ve used tweezers, creams, buffers, pulling it out - everything I could think of. I don&#x27;t have $ for expensive laser treatments and quite frankly I didn&#x27;t want to go see if some laser worked on my face. So, I read reviews of this product, tried it out and I Love it! I&#x27;ve used it maybe 2-3 times since I got it in August and it works. My chin is so smooth right now and it&#x27;s been that way for days. I can&#x27;t say it really hurts (like some reviews said) that&#x27;s not the word for it - rather it&#x27;s like the hair is catching in&lt;br /&gt;the tweezers and you feel a slight pull, that&#x27;s it. I love it and the price was just right!</li>
    <li> Yes I did receive them and they them and they are beyond they are beyond my expectations!!</li>
    <li> This is far better than using a tweezer. The price is worth it: not like those new expensive &#x27;magic&amp;#34; things that have hair coming back just as fast as this one.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Can I get my money back?</li>
    <li> Works excellent, easy to handle once you get the trick of it!</li>
    <li> Great product great price great service</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the last 2 of these I purchased.  First now was about 3 years ago and it was MUCH better.  Not enough power anymore.  Tried the emoji epi slim epilator which is about $20 and it was MUCH MUCH better...uses AA batteries rather than AAA.</li>
    <li> this is my second one. Love this product. I left mine behind when I went on vacation and couldn&#x27;t live without it! Item arrived as promised ahead of schedule, great seller.</li>
    <li> It does work but doesn&#x27;t get every piece of hair.</li>
    <li> Not a good buy for me. It hurts when you use it.Mike</li>
    <li> Bought two of these---one for home and one for travel kit. Wouldn&#x27;t be without a Tweeze.</li>
    <li> Great little item for removing pesky chin hairs. Can be used daily to ensure no hairs grow out un noticed. They don&#x27;t last a long time but thats ok for me since the price is very low.  I Always pack one when I travel. Better then tweezing and the hairs don&#x27;t come back fast. It gets the little soft hairs i would not usually tweeze too.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. I have had the first one for several years and when it stopped working, I replaced the batteries; duh the batteries were old and, needless to say the old one didn&#x27;t work. Ordered a new one and then tried putting different batteries in the old one.........yeah it worked.  Now I have a backup to keep in my travel bag. I love this product. It does have a tiny pinch as it pulls out the hair, but so do regular tweezers; just telling you it is working.  Hair seems to grow back finer.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Button to start is a little stiff</li>
    <li> I love the Tweeze and own 3 of them.  I hope they never go out of stock.  I tell all my friends how easy it is to remove facial hair and it&#x27;s so cheap compared to the NO NO!!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and works great.  I absolutely love it and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I also have a review on the Emjoi Divine Hair Remover, tho that model is not the one I have. The one I have came with the Tweeze included. So this review is for the Tweeze. This is a very effective tool, too, and I really love it. Tho I found it to work better with the clear guide/protector thingy removed. It does not get close enough otherwise and what girl wants to let that mustache grow long enough for the protected tweeze rollers to grab them. Not me. So I took that off. Also, the battery compartment is extremely tight. So my battery cover is off, too. I can&#x27;t beat that thing back on. But battery life is really strong in the Tweeze and so it does not need a cord. I use rechargables and it has lasted for many months without a recharge of the batteries and it is still strong.</li>
    <li> had one of these for years, loved it was so happy with my replacement,, but the Tweezee is better</li>
    <li> Never had such  smooth skin. This device really works!  Just be sure you&#x27;re holding it right---with the on/off switch facing away from you. Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t pluck at all. I&#x27;ve got several friends using it now. Try it!  You&#x27;ll probably love it!  No more hair where you don&#x27;t want it!</li>
    <li> I rate this with a big fat 0!!  What a waste of money!  Did not do as it said.  It wouldn&#x27;t cut the fine hairs on my chin.  Would have sent it back but I would have spent more money in shipping and would only get like a $5 credit!  I even let my daughter in law try it and she gave it back!</li>
    <li> Replacement item for one left behind traveling.  If you replace something, it certainly must be worth the cost and does the job.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, except for really fine hairs. I still use it even though it does not necessarily work great on fine hairs but it beats using a tweezer for everything. Need tweezer still for fine hairs. I use it on lip.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before a few years ago. The quality was better. I keep thinking that this is some kind of counterfeit copy. It is definitely not of the same quality of my first one which I purchased in a store. The plastic is cheap and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> This little machine is the first invention that has really helped me to control a prickly hair problem on my chin and upper lip with no residues (like wax to clogs pores) and just a bit of discomfort (pulling the hair gives a little pinch).  The cost is minimal, the design is very comfortable in your hand, and each day I touch my chin to find it as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It really is quite a problem solver for just a minute or two every few days.  Head and shoulders above tweezing.  Emjoi is a fine company selling equipment that does what it claims to do. You will not go wrong with this machine.</li>
    <li> First off, once the batteries were put in, the cover no longer fit. Secondly, the thing is louder than a jet engine. Thirdly, it doesnt work effectively and it hurts. There is no way that the woman in the commercial has it on when she puts it up to her face. It left blotches of hair along with red bumps on my skin.</li>
    <li> No complaints, does the job as advertised. Less painful than manual tweezing and much faster.</li>
    <li> Not as good as advertised. Make too much noise that all will know you are shaving! Hair still grows fast as usual.Smooth for serveral weeks?! NO WAY!</li>
    <li> After years of waxing and plucking I think this is great! There was NO pain and it gets most hair. I had to pluck 2 after using this item but it was way better then plucking for half an hour then missing tons....The trick is to pull skin tight then go for it.....I can&#x27;t believe all the people saying it hurts so bad....they must not wax or pluck one at a time. LOL  I think it is great and would say it is a GREAT buy!</li>
    <li> I bought the tweeze yesterday.  Put the batteries in and cannot get the cover back on.  It started up when I was trying to get the cover on.  I was suprised at how loud it is.  It does hurt and I am afraid of ripping skin.  Waste of money like most hair removers.  Somebody needs to come up with a great one.</li>
    <li> The tweezer works really well in the above-lip area.  However, in other facial areas it does not work very well.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;every hair you can feel\\&quot; like it says.  Does a fabulous job on the moustache, but those menopause bristles on the chin remain untouched.  Also doesn&#x27;t work on fine hair on the knees.  I keep it in the car and do a daily touch up.  Definitely worth $20.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how  efficient the Tweeze is.  However, both I and my mother are a bit put off by the small, sharp pains.  On the first use, we both checked repeatedly to see that it was not actually cutting our skin.  It is important to keep skin taut also.  I had some skin irritation on  my upper lip after first use.  I must add that using it frequently keeps the hair short and sparse and there is less pain - more like a vibration.</li>
    <li> The Emjoi Tweeze worked passably the first two times, although it is quite painful.  I carefully followed the directions again the 3rd time, and it yanked out a particularly thick hair, leaving a bloody hole, and skinned an irregular area around the hole.  Right now it&#x27;s a huge skinned red area, and I worry about scarring.</li>
    <li> Single row device, its okay for facial hair removal.</li>
    <li> The thicker hairs that grow on my chinny chin chin drive me absolutely insane! Plucking had become a real issue; was even damaging the skin. I bought this little baby and how great it is! Beware, first of all, that it is deadly on the upper lip, deadly! Tried that once and learned that lesson quickly. My Tweeze gets all those hairs that I&#x27;ve been in mirrors picking at for a few years now. Once in a while there will be a thicker one which is too short for the \\&quot;grab\\&quot; but the next day or so that one would be gone. If you drive yourself nuts in the mirror plucking, this could be for you! Besides the upper lip, some tender areas might also hurt so I&#x27;d definitely stay away from the pits, shown being used here on the TV commercial, and bikini line unless you are very brave or have a very high tollerance to pain. See my other reviews for what I use on my upper lip.</li>
    <li> Me too, as you would guess. It got rid of some nasty bumps she was getting by tweezing hair from her chin.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and made the mistake of leaving the batteries in and it corroded. This new purchase does not work as well as my last one which was the same brand. Yet, it is better than using a hand held tweezer.</li>
    <li> This is the worst item I&#x27;ve EVER purchased from Amazon and I&#x27;ve purchased a lot from Amazon.  This item doesn&#x27;t work at all, it does not remove one, not one hair at all.  As soon as I turned it on it smelled like it was about to burn out.  It&#x27;s truly worthless and should be banned from being sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s working very well, not too painful.  It leaves your skin smooth and no more facial hair.  I recommand it.</li>
    <li> This product is a good order. Arrived on time. Sturdy, made well.</li>
    <li> Works great. It stings a little, but duh, you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your body, lol.</li>
    <li> It functioned well but wore out quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this for tweezing hair on my underarms.  Works great for that.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair.  If I was using it for thicker hair I would buy a more expensive one.  Also,  It doesn&#x27;t work well on very long hair, so it should be used on longish stubble after shaving long hairs.  I love the small size.  It fits perfectly in tight curves.  Skin must be held tight so tweezers can grasp the hairs--hairs must be standing up for it to work.</li>
    <li> Very easy-to-use you get used to it I bought one for my sister she loves it</li>
    <li> This item is well-priced and easy to use. It does a good job in a quick manner. My sister loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I have had and the little clear plastic top breaks easy need to redesign this</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this to me.  I really like it.  I still have to tweeze, but it definiately cuts down on tweezing time.</li>
    <li> My wife had me get this item for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;She tried them one day &amp; has never used them again.&lt;br /&gt;She tells me that they worked great on yanking her whiskers out,&lt;br /&gt;but she tells me that the problem is it hurts like he!! when the AP-9T is doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 3 star for an honest review because of her claimed pain, but she may be&lt;br /&gt;more sensitive to pain then the next person &amp; she did say that it does the job for the&lt;br /&gt;person that can handle it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year. The sting of the hair getting pulled lessens the more you use it and my experience has been that hair grows back finer. I use it on my legs and forearms, not my face. I&#x27;ve gotten best results with Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries. Batteries from the dollar store are not going to cut it. You will need good power to make this device work the way it should, snagging every hair in its path. I really like this a lot. No more messy and expensive waxing.</li>
    <li> This item works fine on fine hair, but cannot handle the tough hairs on my chin, which is the main reason I bought it.  I was going to purchase the bigger model, but thought I&#x27;d try this one first.  If your hair is very fine, then this will be great for you.  Otherwise, back to tweezers and the big mirror or to hair removal creams.</li>
    <li> My mom has one so I had to have one, too! It is a neat little gadget.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time</li>
    <li> I loved the first one I purchased 3-4 years ago.  This one is not good.  The motor runs half the speed and is almost worthless.  I am crushed because the first one works so well.  Will probably need to find something else.</li>
    <li> love the price. slightly uncomfortable when using.  I have to pluck less often. small size and easy to carry in purse.</li>
    <li> Emjoi is easy to use.. It really works and is much better than tweezing. Small size makes it ideal for travel</li>
    <li> I liked this so much I bought it as a gift for a few other women in my life I&#x27;m close enough to do that for. I am prone to ingrown  hairs, but I don&#x27;t know that this makes it any worse. I simply need to remember to exfoliate a couple days later. The more you use it, the less it stings and the finer the growth is, too. It&#x27;s a great deal for a good product. I&#x27;ve had mine a few years, now, and no one I&#x27;ve bought it for has had any complaints, either.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the first one I bought years ago. This never worked as well, and have completely stopped working in less than a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my neck and chest hair (This was before Groupon had laser hair removal deals for $90). I followed the instructions precisely and this piece of garbage did absolutely nothing. If you want better results for the same price, go buy a lighter, and what ever change is left over, use said lighter to light on fire. You could also use the same lighter to burn off the hairs you were planning on tweezing.</li>
    <li> This tweeze worked great a few times and then stopped working. I tried replacing the batteries and it will not turn on</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer so I was excited  to  find it again.  I stocked up in case I have  problems  finding  it in the future. It works well  for chin hairs and mustache. Just make sure  you  hold your skin taut. My only negative  is not about the product  but shipping  time. The  listing  doesn&#x27;t  mention it ships  from China.</li>
    <li> This product does what it promises. It removes the facial hair with just a little sting, leaves the face smooth. Not flimsy, sturdy. This is my second one; they do give out after about a year or so. But it&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> As expected.  I have owned one for many years.  This was a replacement.</li>
    <li> I have used these for some time, and love them.</li>
    <li> I ordered a new product but when I received it, it was clearly used. It didn&#x27;t come with the original packaging or anything. All I received was the tweezer wrapped in bubble wrap. It was coming apart and it l</li>
    <li> works but not as well as expected good price though for the product</li>
    <li> My wife loved this device.  Does a neat job with minimum effort.  Liked it so much that we ordered another one for a senior friend; well received.</li>
    <li> This is my second one, wore the other one out. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Quicker and easier than waxing for upper lip</li>
    <li> Had to return it...wasn&#x27;t put together very well.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> painful and does not work as advertised</li>
    <li> Loving it.  Have had one before which lasted years (finally gave to a friend of mine) thus, needed new one. And not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the second Tweeze I&#x27;ve had.  I bought the other in a retail store, but they don&#x27;t carry them any more.  I ordered this one, it came in a few days, works great!</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with the product and seller. The packaging shows batteries included but they never came. Product does not turn on and off easily and seems to be defective.</li>
    <li> I had one and needed another so I could keep mine  from my daughter always using mine and not returning it</li>
    <li> Did not use enough to give an opinion at this time seems to be useful.</li>
    <li> I use it every other day and that keeps the tweezing pain down when I use it.  A great money-saver.</li>
    <li> Had one of the first issues on these it worked great but this one does not seems to have the same great coverage.  Note it does pull the hair out, you better be tough skinned.</li>
    <li> a really inexpensive item that really does the job.</li>
    <li> great product , bye, bye hand held tweezers</li>
    <li> Painless? This thing hurts like hell. Anyone who claims otherwise should probably be tested for nerve disorders. I want my $20 back.</li>
    <li> The Tweeze is sheer gem.  It&#x27;s wonderful for all those unwanted hairs on ladies&#x27; chins which sprout as we get into the \\&quot;golden years\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve had mine for some time now, and recently introduced a friend to it who had a stroke, which left her hands weak and shaky so she couldn&#x27;t manipulate her old tweezers.  She was very relieved to find the answer to her problem with my borrowed Tweeze, and we quickly found it on trusty Amazon.com so were able to get one for her own use.  It&#x27;s a great product, well made and I couldn&#x27;t think of anything wrong to warrant anything less than 5 stars.  I strongly recommend it ... and so does my friend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping for easy hair removal. It would quit easily just by removing fine facial hair, so it is not worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> This just wasn&#x27;t as good as the old Tweezer I had and takes much more concentrated time to use it satisfactorily.You have to go over an area repeatedly to get it to remove any hair at all!:-(</li>
    <li> I have owned three Tweeze Tweezers, but all of them have stopped working now after several years of use. Since I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores after a thorough search, I decided to look on Amazon and found it, but I might try another epilator from Amazon instead of buying this product again. It removes hair very well on the upper lip and chin area, but the hair has to be long enough for the device to grab it. It&#x27;s not good for underarms, and I didn&#x27;t use it on my legs because I didn&#x27;t want to run out of batteries just to do my legs which take longer. I found I needed to go over and over the same hair on my legs but the device didn&#x27;t remove it that well, maybe my leg hair wasn&#x27;t long enough. Additionally, when the batteries run low it doesn&#x27;t go at full speed, so it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to pull the hair out. The bottom line is at this price it&#x27;s good for facial hair removal, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon.  I first tried it about 8 years ago, it was an impulse buy at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for around $15-20.  I hadn&#x27;t even seen the infomercials yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt?  YES!  However, I had been tweezing my chin for years so it didn&#x27;t bother me so much in that area.  Upper lip is super painful for me.  I can&#x27;t use it in the area under my nose, too sensitive, but I got used to it on the sides of my upper lip and right under my bottom lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost my original and ordered another a few years ago.  I actually use it without the plastic cover, probably not recommended at first, but it seems to work better without it.  Just make sure your head hair is completely out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hairs it gets, it does last awhile (definitely not 6-8 weeks as advertised), but I do need to go over some areas several times.  The skin can get a little red and irritated if you go over the same area too many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more it&#x27;s used, the less effective it is, as the inside gets clogged with hair that&#x27;s difficult to remove by cleaning.  I still have and use this device, but I&#x27;m going to try another product for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is way better than creams or trying to tweeze hairs one by one.</li>
    <li> I did not feel this product was effective in removing facial hairs. I am not sure if it was defective or not, I also replaced the batteries twice within two weeks. I would have returned it , but I would have loss more money</li>
    <li> Fell apart. Have to hold my fingers a certain way in order to work.</li>
    <li> It was a replica&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work like the original one I own</li>
    <li> This did not pull my hair from the roots, and it gets hot really quickly (smells like plastic melting)</li>
    <li> Ordered one each at two different times.  Long ship times, (over three weeks) and neither worked.  So disappointed, because the original, which I purchased at Walgreens, worked fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was something else. This did not work as well as the other and caused me some problems. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before last year and will purchase again if ever needed.  This product is near painless and works better than any other method (including laser and electrolosis).</li>
    <li> I keep this product in my makeup bag.  It is perfect for quick fixes and catching those hard to grasp hairs that crop up.</li>
    <li> Not enough power. Will buy corded</li>
    <li> Does&#x27;t even come close to reducing the fuzzy on my face..&#x3D;(</li>
    <li> the plastic cover that keeps you from getting your skin caught breaks too easily.&lt;br /&gt;I have three units that work fine but I can&#x27;t use them because the plastic covers&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this is so painful guess I have to go on flex pay with HSN and get a NO NO hate to spend that much money</li>
    <li> recommend for all.  pluck away without even looking in the mirror.  Not for eyebrows but get rid of those chin and/or ear hairs without pain or trouble.  Highly recommend it.  Uses 2 AAA batteries which I think it comes with.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  I order two because my daughter will use one and my wife will use the other one.</li>
    <li> Replaced worn out one. I stocked up. I love that I can sit and watch TV and use this at the same time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a razor. it doesn&#x27;t work like advertised . what more can I say? If i still had the packaging I would return it.</li>
    <li> Bought this due to unwanted hair popping up on my face after menopause. It works great and doesnt cost an arm an a leg. I love it.</li>
    <li> It was better than I expected, really kept the hair from growing back as soon as normal.  Easy to use, complete instructions.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I used to wax, not anymore! You will love it also! Less pain than waxing and less time than tweezing!</li>
    <li> I have been using it even before I bought one to keep in one of my parents&#x27; homes. This makes getting rid of facial hair easy, and it is portable, and is effective. It might take some accustoming to, because it tweezes rapidly and the skin can get warm, but it&#x27;s not extremely painful, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those [women] who want to get rid of facial hair without having to shave or wax, this is ideal.</li>
    <li> I did not like Tweeze at all. It was too painful for the few stray hairs on my face, had to throw the darn thing away.</li>
    <li> I bought the \\&quot;Tweeze\\&quot; specifically for the hairs that I was always having to pluck under my chin.  As opposed to having to have great light and actually being able to see the hairs when plucking, the \\&quot;Tweeze\\&quot; gets the hairs you can&#x27;t even see.  The pain is nowhere equal to plucking.  I use it at least every other day and I am delighted with the results.  On a few occasions I have used it on my cheeks and there is a little more discomfort, but nothing unbearable.  I recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t tried this sooner!  I bought it for upper lip use specifically and I&#x27;ll never go back to waxing.  In about a minute, all my fuzz was gone.  It couldn&#x27;t be easier and didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  Just wish it could do my eyebrows too!  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted.  the old one worked great but just wore out.  The wife loves this one too.  fast delivery</li>
    <li> It takes care of smaller areas. When I can feel the hairs, even if I can&#x27;t see them, it finds and removes them.</li>
    <li> No this is not the miricle we all were searching for!  It hurts, like tweezing. Leaves the spot red &amp; irratated!  You get used to the pain, but not the bumps or red spots.</li>
    <li> I have one of these because a friend recommended it to me. Pros are that it does pull out hairs, fine or coarse, and it takes a pretty long time for them to come back. Cons are that it&#x27;s hard to find individual hairs that you want it to get because you have to roll the little , spinning, wheel that grabs the hair PRECISELY over the hair. So you go over and over an area of skin trying to find the right place. Sometimes the little wheel pinches your skin and that hurts. I end up being frustrated and having my beautician wax my lip every now and then anyway, just to spare myself. I am thinking maybe there are better versions of this kind of product, and I should try another brand. That&#x27;s why I am reading reviews and decided to write one. So in summation: yes it works better than tweezers because you don&#x27;t have to bring yourself to yank, and it&#x27;s faster, But it kinda hurts just under your nose, enough to make you prefer wax at the beauty shop. Not the perfect solution</li>
    <li> I just bout this a few weeks ago and carry it with me just in case I have those few hair that I miss using my larger emjoi double sided hair remover.  It&#x27;s great for the face for those small areas.  If you&#x27;ve used emjoi products before, the pain gets less and less until the nerve is dead and you can no longer feel pain.  This is my 4th emjoi product and I&#x27;m an addict.  I&#x27;m glad it was engineered.</li>
    <li> This product gets the baby-fine hairs just great but the whiskery ones takes a lot of work.  I find I have to use this device daily to keep on top of new growth.  I do not think it will replace my waxing.  Overall, this may be fine for some people but for people who have the whiskery hair growth, probably will not work to it&#x27;s advertised potential.  I would be reluctant to try it on my underarms or bikini area.</li>
    <li> I have this product and I love it! It&#x27;s not that it hurts any less than tweezers, but that it&#x27;s so much easier for fine hair and short hair. There&#x27;s often hair that you can&#x27;t easily pull with tweezers because its so fine or short and this is an excellent solution. Remember not to use it on your eyebrows though, you still need tweezers for that precision work.</li>
    <li> This review first said:  \\&quot;I used this product only one time, and I&#x27;ll never use it again.  It tore out all the hairs from my chin, sure, but the swelling and scabbing as a result is something I&#x27;ll never forget.  It was also very painful while it was extracting hair.  I&#x27;ll just go back to my trimmer/tweeze method to keep them away as best I can.\\&quot;    Then I read a review by marys mom who suggested to lightly dab the problem areas instead of running straight across the skin and decided to give it another try.  This time I found the procedure much more bearable and not the degree of irritation I felt the first time.  My only wish now is that the instruction pamphlet would make that same suggestion as the hair removal is remarkably effective...thanks marys mom!!!</li>
    <li> This was one that I should have read the reviews and took them to heart...this was a total waste of time.  I was just so desperate to find something that worked I thought...why not!  But I say...Why waste money???  It did not \\&quot;tweeze\\&quot; one hair and did however manage to pull some skin on my face though.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> I OWN A AS SEEN ON TV STORE ON THE ISLAND OF ARUBA SO IT&#x27;S REALY INPORTANT THAT PRODUCT THAT I BUY VIA AMAZON ARE SHIPPED FAST.....UNTIL NOW I HAVE NO PROBLEMS AND THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE DELIVERD HERE ON THE ISLAND ARE HIGH QUALITY...I&#x27;M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKE MY NEXT ORDER.</li>
    <li> I brought this product about few weeks ago. I can honestly say that it really isn&#x27;t worth it. Before I purchased it I read the reviews but I decided to buy it anyway. I found out that those who posted the negative reviews were accurate. The product hurts when pulling out the hairs and im not sure about getting used to that pain. I didn&#x27;t like it so be careful when purchasing</li>
    <li> Love this product!! With ageing eyesight this makes it some easier than tweezers. i would recommend this prodcut to a friend :)</li>
    <li> Well...I should&#x27;ve taken other reviews seriously.  This thing is a joke.  Yes...it does yank out a few hairs here and there.  But mostly it just misses them.  I give it two stars because it does actually pull some hairs out.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I think the problem with this tweezer is its just too small,but for areas around the face it works well for the price.</li>
    <li> I owned one before which died after a couple of years.  Glad to find a replacement on Amazon. Great for quick clean ups of odd hairs on chin and neck.</li>
    <li> Was excited to be able to replace my original Tweeze. Gave it to my daughter because she was always coming over to borrow mine.</li>
    <li> Glad it wasn&#x27;t expensive.  It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything especially remove hair.  Falls apart when in use...OH WELL I should have known better</li>
    <li> Does not work, horrible piece of junk. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> It simply breaks the hair. I have to move it around the same place but still it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair. Hair grows backs after 3-4 days. it also causes ingrown hair . I would suggest waxing is a better and safer option. Also it hurts a lot. The only thing is that it removes hair very quickly so if you r in hurry this is a convenient and portable option for you. You can use it for upper lip. For other part its not much useful</li>
    <li> This is much easier on your skin than the harsh cream hair removal or the waxing.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s a little painful above the lip, but the results are worth it. Thanks so much.  Nancy</li>
    <li> Meylis Narlyyev says the following about Emjoi Ap-9T&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The AP-9T with the AP-9L by Emjoi, which goes by the name Epi Slim. They are both extremely similar to each other. On the Emjoi website the Tweeze Tweezer and the Epi Slim are actually both listed currently to be the same price, $20. However on the Amazon website the Tweeze Tweezer is listed at just $6-$8. So in terms of price, this form of epilator is extremely cheap. We might not even be able to call it an epilator but more of a tweezer, which is aptly named.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is only a battery operated model of epilator. It uses 2 AA batteries to power it also. Of course, those batteries are not provided.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased at the drug store - no longer available.  I was really happy to find it on Amazon.  Easier than plucking or waxing.  Price is great.  My daughters use it too.</li>
    <li> This product was bought as a replacement for a lost Emjoi Slim epilator. I got this one instead because it was a few bucks less, unbeknownst to me that price is lower because it contains a single row tweeze system. My Emjoi slim had about 4 rotating rows of tweeze and never missed a hair with ease. This model forces you to perfectly align the hair to the single tweeze row, not impossible but not what I was expecting. Will return and go back to my tried &amp; true Emjoi Slim.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two of these in the past 4-5 years. I ordered this already knowing I love the product. But to be honest, I think this is a replica. It does not tweeze ANY hair and when you look at the name Emjoi it does not have the trademark stamped on it and when you open the back piece there are not four numbers engraved by the screw. I am HIGHLY disappointed in this. I don&#x27;t know if I am the only one, but I will not repurchase and will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is quite a handy tweezer and well made. This doesn&#x27;t always get every hair but it sure does help minimize all the endless searching one at a time approach. I got two more so one goes in the cosmetic bag, the other went to my husband. Battery operated makes this very convenient!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned this for about a month, but I can&#x27;t believe how little I have to tweez my annoying chin and upper lip hairs.  It&#x27;s hard to tell it&#x27;s working while using it, but the proof is in the results.  After years of looking in the magnifying mirror every morning (and sometimes in the afternoon),  I no longer have to do this every day.  Oh, I still have to haul out the tweezers now and then, but this little machine has been worth every penny.  I use it a couple of times a week.  A few people in their reviews said to take off the cover so I tried that, and it caused bleeding skin, so I don&#x27;t recommend doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rarely has something so cheap made me so happy.</li>
    <li> Beats hot wax any day.  Works very well.  Takes 2 small batteries that seem to last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a several years now. Same device, it&#x27;s very reliable, and I&#x27;ve only had to change the batteries once, maybe twice.I love this little thing, I only use it on my upper lip hair, that&#x27;s probably why I rarely ever need to change the batteries. Using it is easy. Typically I will pass over the area about the times in circular motions, checking to see if I got all the hairs. It works perfectly at removing all the hairs by the root, I do have very fine hair on my upper lip though, which helps. It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable, after about four uses I got used to the sensation, now I expect the discomfort and it doesn&#x27;t bother me any more like the first few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using it on my &amp;#34;happy trail&amp;#34; area before, that didn&#x27;t work out for me so well. The hair is more coarse on that area of my body, and as I can recall the device was unable to pull all the hair out by the root, sometimes the hair would break instead...so I use tweezers in that area now, and that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the hair removal on my upper lip, I&#x27;m very satisfied. And I only have to use it once every 30-40 days or so, I just let the hair grow back in fully before removing it again. But since the hair is removed at the root, I typically don&#x27;t notice the hair for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my device at Walgreen&#x27;s, but I don&#x27;t know if they still sell it there or not.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I was under the impression that it was an authentic product, but it was a generic brand.</li>
    <li> Do not work as well as the same brand we ordered to replace the worn ones!</li>
    <li> Great for pulling those annoying hairs that pop up on my chin.  It makes tweezing easy.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Like many others have said about this product, you have to find the right angle to capture little hairs, but once you find it - it works great!</li>
    <li> Does not always pick out the single hair, and since using it, I feel that I have more growth coming.  Disappointing.....</li>
    <li> This is a handy gadget.  When you travel it is easy to keep it in your case and keep those stray hairs away.  I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Removes all facial hair with no pain - just a tiny little pull when it gets a hair. I highly recommend this device.</li>
    <li> Best gadget for those annoyuing, bristly pieces of hair under the chin!</li>
    <li> My old one started to get dull so I ordered 2 more, I believe that they wonderful, getting to that small hair that seems to take for hours to get with regular tweezers.  Also it seems like the couple of places that I had problems with the hair(s) don&#x27;t grow back (after away) or takes longer to grow back</li>
    <li> Broken upon arriving, no batteries as shown on package and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> gets the job done for removing hairs from the facial area,all my fuzz was gone. It is a great product with great price.</li>
    <li> ladies,  we all know the pain that the old tweezer&lt;br /&gt;does when you pinch your skin instead of the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi is lightweight and easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;BEST PART,,,  it&#x27;s pain free!  Try it yourselfe&lt;br /&gt;and you will agree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it a year ago and the battery&#x27;s are still&lt;br /&gt;going strong,  and I use it once a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy onlone often and sometimes have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;there has been no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its small and easy to pack for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get  yours and I know you will enjoy your Emjoi</li>
    <li> Purchased this item approximately 3 yrs ago.  It finally stopped working and I&#x27;m lost without it. I glad that I finally found it again and have recorded it. It&#x27;s easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to worry about hair coming back the next day.  I would strongly advise using this product.  It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve trusted the other reviews. I bought this to replace my other mini electric &#x27;tweezer&#x27; (which had about 4 tweeting devices), but this only has one tweeting device on it. It will tug and tug and tug at a hair before it finally gets just the right grip to actually pull it out. I&#x27;m very used to the discomfort of regularly treatments from similar devices, but this thing is a lot more painful because it doesn&#x27;t get the job done correctly and quickly and the constant tugging is quite annoying and unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I am not required to fill in these reviews when I shop at a local store; I simply do not return if something is wrong.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  It was what I was expecting.  I have recommended it to quite a number of my friends.  I hope that they will buy it as I did.</li>
    <li> My mom uses this and it works very well!</li>
    <li> I FOUND A GREAT ITEM AND I  GOT IT AT A GREAT PRICE!  WHAT MORE COULD I ASK?  QUIT SIMPLY - NOTHING!</li>
    <li> but I wish it pulled more hairs at once.  I use it for my blonde facial hair, and it gets a good amount of them, but I still have to tweeze and sometimes wax.  Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this and raved about it. I bought three, one each for my girls and me.  I found that it not only didn&#x27;t get rid of the hard bristly hairs, it gave me several &amp;#34;ingrown&amp;#34; or hard pimply spots that took a week or more to heal.  I use an epilady on my legs and had hoped for the same results. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Needed a new one but this one was real cheaply made wouldn&#x27;t order another but for the price what do you want should of knew my fault</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  As soon as you lay it on your skin it stops running.  The batteries are not powerful enough.  Couldn&#x27;t do anything with it.  Not easy to return.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is small in size, but works well. There is no pain when using it...recommend for facial hairs!!</li>
    <li> Very good. This is the second one I have used. For the price it works great&lt;br /&gt;Was a little hesitant about buying because of reviews. For those who say it doesn&#x27;t work I found if you lightly go over the hairs you want to remove instead of pushing hard it works much better</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t think this method of hair removal is for everyone, I like this for the little hairs on my face.  I find this particular model ineffective for other areas, but they make different models with more of the tweezy bits for those.</li>
    <li> I had another Tweeze Tweezer and it worked great. It finally wore out and I had to get another.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> I had one of these and it was getting old so I ordere another. It is a very good product but the new one never worked so I threw it out and just kept using the old one</li>
    <li> So, I have never written a product review before, but this was so amazingly life changing for me I just had to.  Let me start by saying that I have tried EVERY hair removal method on the market.  I did laser hair removal a couple of years ago which was awful.  It left me burned, scarred, the hair was removed from my chin and upper lip.  The upper lip was fine, but my chin went horribly wrong.  The scarring has faded, but the hair in that area grows in thick and black.  Let&#x27;s be honest, it is completely embarrassing.  I have tried to bleach it, Nair cream, Olay cream, etc. and NOTHING works.  The only way to remove the hair is to shave it.  Which is humiliating for a woman.  The stubble makes me so self conscious, and I know it just doesn&#x27;t look right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I decided (since I have tried everything else) to give this Tweeze a try.  OH MY GOD!  It is amazing.  It removed the hair, kept me hairless for a long time, the new hair growth is so manageable, I have confidence again.  I read reviews about how much it hurt... are you kidding me?  Compared to everything else I have tried it is nearly painless.  I iced the area for 15-60 seconds before use just to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad, but I also did it without ice and it was fine.  If you don&#x27;t want to ice, use it after a couple glasses of wine.  The worst part of it is the noise, but who cares?  My confidence is restored, I feel amazing, and am so thankful to have this wonderful tool after years of pain, embarrassment and inconvenience. The only downside was that it didn&#x27;t come in the original packaging, or with the little cleaning brush, but whatever, it works, I found another brush to clean it.  If you struggle with embarrassing facial hair, TRY THIS!  It&#x27;s so reasonably priced it could be just the thing to change your life.</li>
    <li> it does what it is suppose to do that is why I bought it. It is the only thing on the market that does this</li>
    <li> yeah i have little bit of hair on my nose like most people but because of my skin its noticeable. so i highly recommend this to you.</li>
    <li> This item was for my wife, and she loves how it cut down on using the manual tweezer. She is completely satisfied. She didn&#x27;t know that I ordered it, and was really happy because her other one had a bad switch. Thanks for ordering it for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered a tweezer and received a razor. It is not as good as a Gillette Razor. I am very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> cheap plasticy flimsy tweezer....didnt take out all the hair....wont recommend buying it............probably should have looked at some name brand product do not buy....</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years (really) it finally died after many years of use. I had looked all over for another one thinking it would be easy to find because it was one of those &amp;#34;bought on TV&amp;#34; products. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and for giggles decided to look on Amazon. Sure enough there were a lot to choose from. this one works great. Hope it lasts as long as my old one.</li>
    <li> It is a great product&lt;br /&gt;I had one before lasted 5 years and when I did not have it. Happy again</li>
    <li> I love this. I have them in my purse bathroom. So I have an wherever I go. It gets rid of those little devils.</li>
    <li> It mostly works. I have thick coarse hair on my chin. I have to go over areas multiple times in a bunch of different directions. Obviously it&#x27;s painful, so I dread it, but it gets the job done. It works well on hair about 4-5 mm or a little longer. It leaves hairs, but it makes hair removal much more manageable than just tweezing, and it is much more cost effective than waxing. Sometimes the hair breaks and doesn&#x27;t get pulled all the way out, but that happens with plucking too. My skin gets understandably irritated after, so I use aloe vera to soothe it.</li>
    <li> This, for me, was a step up from tweezing each hair on my face by hand. However, I do have coarse hair, making it difficult to remove. It seems to give the Tweeze Tweezer a bit of a hard time and I find myself having to run it over a spot several times before all of the hair is removed. Otherwise, I&#x27;ve found it quite useful and much quicker than using regular tweezers. I imagine pricier epilators would work better, but if you were looking for something cheap, like me, this was a decent product to go with.</li>
    <li> This works well for me.  The only painful area is using on upper lip area, which I do as quickly as possible.  I&#x27;ve noticed since using it for awhile now that hairs grow back much finer and slower, so I don&#x27;t need to use it as often now.  It&#x27;s the best affordable product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I had ordered a Tweezer several years ago and loved it but decided it was time for a new one. It did a great job and I literally used it all the time and it lasted for years. I will definitely order this again and was also very pleased with the price and I got it very quickly and thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Great tool. Perfect for upper lip. No irritation though that may be because I have used a manual spring epilater before I tried this. It seems to hurt a bit when I start, but after a bit , you start to not feel it.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this tweezer to anyone with unwanted facial hair.  I use it about twice a month and love it.  I have bought them for others as gifts.</li>
    <li> ive used this product for a long time and theyd dont sell it in the stores anymore. so glad i found it on here.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  I brought my first at Walmart so I knew what I was getting.  I am usually wary about buying online, but this experience was excellent.  The price was right.  It arrived as promised, no problems.  I would use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Although it helps to tweeze facial hair , it can be pretty painful on sensitive skin, best used when your skin is warm from the shower</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 3 years ago and I loved it so I ordered a new one before my old one died.&lt;br /&gt;The new one is a big disappointment !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very loud and it doesn&#x27;t tweeze very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame the product has lost the quality it once had.</li>
    <li> Was debating on getting this or the NO NO!... This thing actually plucks the hair out and the NO NO! burns it off... Ugh, IDK about you, but I would MUCH rather have something plucked out and NOT burned off...  This is something that you will have to get used to working with. But it DOES work and it has made my self conscience higher :)</li>
    <li> works good enough for me</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close as my original tweeze. My first tweeze got closer to the skin and tweezed more hairs; my face was cleaner after use.</li>
    <li> Emoji is absolutely amazing. I spend less time tweezing!  I use Emjoi first and then tweeze with old fashion tweezers to get just a few if any harder hairs. Ordered one for my daughter too!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! But I had to change to batteries so often that I purchased a corded one. Will use this for travel.</li>
    <li> Liked the bigger one best. This only has one row of tweezers.</li>
    <li> This is such an easy device to use. It is much cheaper than waxing or threading and you are in the comfort of your own home. There is a bit of pain involved but I do believe threading is much more painful.</li>
    <li> one of the greatest inventions ever created. my wife just loves it. it&#x27;s has great performance and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is useful for hair above the lips but has to be use almost every day. Sometimes problems with in-grown hairs from use.</li>
    <li> I bought a Tweeze hoping that I&#x27;d have to shave less. The instructions said to use on arm first to get used to the feeling. Doing that didn&#x27;t feel good but I still hoped to be able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my face after I did it on my arm. I realized something right away. The only way for this to be as painless as it appears to be in the commercial is if you shaved right before you use it on your face! OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back the next day.&lt;br /&gt;VERY UNSATISFIED. :-(</li>
    <li> I use it everyday - It fell on the floor and the plastic cracked around the head but I just used scotch tape to secure it and it works great.  Saves me alot of money at the salon for mustache and chin hairs!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. It really works great. Of course it is only for small jobs. I would recommend it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Tweeze Tweezer  I love it and use it often.  It works very well at keeping unwanted hairs gone.  It works.</li>
    <li> This appliance is perfect for me - it is relatively comfortable to use, very portable and quite effective vs other hair removal methods.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now - it takes a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it after a few uses, it&#x27;s great.  The hair is removed easily and skin stays smooth for at least a week.</li>
    <li> it sucks don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I am satisfy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is not as good as the first one I had. It is much cheaper made. It is better than trying to pull out stray hairs one by one, with tweezers though. Too bad they cut the quality of the materials used to make it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t last long and it hurts</li>
    <li> This is helpful, but is not a wonder device. There are always hairs left behind, even after stretching my skin (as in the instructions) or hovering over an area. It helps reduce individual tweezing, but you need both.</li>
    <li> This little Emjoi is the greatest tweezers for the little hairs that crop up under my chin.  This is my second Emjoi.  I have used it for six years and wore the first one out. Great little tweezers.</li>
    <li> Fell apart within a month!</li>
    <li> works good  thank you</li>
    <li> I am a return buyer of this product.  I purchased a second Tweeze for me and one for my Sister-in-law after telling her how wonderfully it works to remove those menopausal chin hairs.</li>
    <li> works great! Now it not painless. Its just like when you pluck. But you never miss a hair and it does not pinch your skin, can  use it with out a mirror,  My hairs do not grow back as fast. This is my second one that I have bought over the years. It grabs the hair and pulls it right out. Its NOT a shaver. To me shavers make your hair grow back faster and thinker so do not use any things that shavers your face unless you are a man. And can not beat the price . love  my ( Emjoi  AP-9T Tweeze Tweezer ) Several of my friends seen mine and loved it and had to have one and they as happy as me !!!</li>
    <li> Of course it hurts but is super fast and hair takes longer to grow again.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good purchase I think</li>
    <li> This does make things fast and easy. You might have to run it over skin a few extra times with really slow movements and it works great! I love mine!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I would recommend it to anyone.  It is a great timesaver, very effective.  I use it on my chin &amp; above my lip, hair does not grow back for days.</li>
    <li> For me it works better for the fine hair then the thick one, like for my face it&amp;#60;s perfect but I don&amp;#60;t like it for the underarms. It hurts and it takes to much times.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for one that I have had so long it&#x27;s worn out.  They work great!</li>
    <li> I got this because I was tired of spending too much time tweezing hair. Do not use this in your eyebrow area. But it works great.</li>
    <li> Its the very same thing I had before and I really like it.  Serves and Perfect for me.  Thanks.  Char</li>
    <li> Works well for what it is designed to do. It does pull hairs some but all epilators do. Small easy to use</li>
    <li> painfull and not all that effective...arived on time and basicly worked as discribed, i will be looking for a better method in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using tweezie for a few years now and they are great. My hair has come in less and softer,</li>
    <li> A little painful, but I think all of these are... I have to run it over hair more than once, but is fully what I expected for the price. I really only use it on my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for limited use (which is how I use it).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and your money on a product that is totally ineffective and useless. Nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> Joke. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> reminds me of that Cheap Gift given with a &amp;#34;wait but theirs  More&amp;#34; item</li>
    <li> broke pretty quickly after i bought it</li>
    <li> This is my second one (Now I have 2 because the problem was batteries not the product) It works great- as far as it hurting, I just use it while doing morning computer reading. this is sooooo much better then shaving and the more you use it in the beginning , the less hair seems to grow back</li>
    <li> If your hair is too short or thick this won&#x27;t pluck it, which is a pain because I bought this for unsightly thick chin hair which it said it worked on. Also, it pinches my skin a lot. Gets the finer hairs, though.</li>
    <li> I really like this Emjoi and now own 4 of them. Why four you might ask? Well, the plastic shield keeps breaking and trying to use it without that shield doesn&#x27;t feel so good. Sigh, another one and that plastic piece snapped on the first attempt to clean it. Does anyone know if they make replacement pieces?</li>
    <li> One of the problems men have with grooming is ear hair.  The best way to tackle the problem is to tweeze.  However, that can be tedious if done manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if this product would solve the problem, and I found that it helped a lot.  However, there are two caveats:&lt;br /&gt;First, it is noisy, so wearing ear plugs during use is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is a little too big to reach some hairs deaper into the ear folds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user will find that it does a great job on easy-to-reach surface hairs, as long as they are not too long in length.  Continued upkeep solves that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is recommended, along with a good pair of tweezers, in one&#x27;s grooming arsenal.</li>
    <li> Needed a new one as cover broke. Glad I opted for newer model. Works great!</li>
    <li> this is the only one that works for me! The no no didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> does not work well on short hairs  so you have to let it get dark to yank out root</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this little contraption. So easy and quick to use.would recommend this to every woman. I ordered it and 7 days later had it in my hands. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.  I would like to order more if avIlable.</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend.  Both of us are at an age where we are losing hair and gaining it on our faces.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeeeeeeeeeee it!. Excellent product. Great price also. It plucks the hair so, it stays away longer.</li>
    <li> This did not remove the hair. Perhaps I used it improperly. Eithet way, it was not my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial epilator! I use it to remove fuzzy hairs on the sides of my face, and for darker, thicker hair on my chin (darn hormones)! It works very well for both types of hair, and skin is very smooth afterward. It does take a little bit of figuring out which angle works best for you/ type of hair, but once to get the hang of it, it&#x27;s incredibly easy. I used to spend about 30-45 minutes tweezing manually, but with this facial epilator, I get the job done is only about 5-10 minutes. It&#x27;s a great time saver!!  Update (changed form 5 stars to 3 stars): within a year of purchase, the unit wasn&#x27;t working well. The epilator started running very slow (resulting in not pulling out any hair), despite new batteries.</li>
    <li> Not very strong motor to remove hair</li>
    <li> Does not work worth a damn. Use regular tweezers.</li>
    <li> Did not work when I got it after waiting a few weeks. Did refund promptly.</li>
    <li> It a piece of junk, save your $$, don&#x27;t buy it !</li>
    <li> I love this it works great</li>
    <li> arrived as promised. gave as gift and no problems.</li>
    <li> Ok, so it is a tweezer....  But for those of you with those random facial hair issues, it works amazing.  I really like it a lot.  Quick, fairly painless.  Like that!</li>
    <li> Terrible... Plucks one at a time and breaks the hair..</li>
    <li> second one i have bought in five years. it works great and i can not imagine not having it. it makes an otherwise dredful experience quick and easy.</li>
    <li> After purchasing NO NO and returning it I went back to this tweezer  My old one lasted for many years, works good, a little tricky with older eyes, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used this and bought one for my mother she and I both love this product it is the best one I have found.</li>
    <li> The package arrived without batteries. Info on package states batteries included</li>
