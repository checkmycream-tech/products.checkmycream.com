      <li>, you just gotta take a chance and hope for the best</li>
      <li>Happy to say, it worked!</li>
      <li>I love this product!!!</li>
      <li>Awesome product works amazing</li>
      <li>discontinued product and happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but they grew it very nicely.</li>
      <li>I have fair \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin and had no problem using this.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a year - I find it to be really good.</li>
      <li>:) Good luck!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I honestly have not tried it yet.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>Best to just let things grow out naturally.</li>
      <li>Much more natural than I thought, but I am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>results are more than I hope for - my lashes are longer, fuller and look so much better.</li>
      <li>It come in colors also - so be sure you pay attention to the color offered.</li>
      <li>but they look thicker and more substantial to me.  </li>
      <li>I like being able to dip it into a bottle like mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes there isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the pen to start with, so be sure to check if you have a strong line of product coming out before your return period is up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for those with contacts or sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I do have to say that the selling shipped very quick</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to get that fine line around your lashes.  </li>
      <li>I love the results, gaps completely filled in &amp; much longer too.</li>
      <li>I love the clear serum!</li>
      <li>worth a try.</li>
      <li>I had lasik surgety done a month before I bought this products so my eyes are very sensitive, so I love this product because it&#x27;s very gentle on my eyes, and I can use it under my eye make up.</li>
      <li>Really does help grow my lashes in thicker!</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>I had it smudged when first applying to my eyebrow.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look real!</li>
      <li>This really worked for me!</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are really much longer!  </li>
      <li>I bought the clear kind for my mom, who has the same issue but doesn&#x27;t like wearing liner, and it resolved the problem for her as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read many others either had stingy eyes or had darker longer thicker lashes, for those who had a positive reaction good for you and those with negatives,m sorry to hear that.</li>
      <li>The one I have is a clear serum, but it dries quickly so that I can apply eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>So, I really dont know if this product works or not, but</li>
      <li>..had the product just a couple days after placing the order, and the package itself was sealed very well...</li>
      <li>The price is much better&lt;br /&gt;than</li>
      <li>I had very sparse eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>Did absolutely nothing at all no reaction what so ever.</li>
      <li>Also, the length of the holder is very deceiving.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making this.</li>
      <li>i cant tell if it is for real or my imagination</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the collagen powder I&#x27;ve been taking has contributed, but I am thrilled to have eyelashes now.  </li>
      <li>Although I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my lash length (they&#x27;re already quite long), using this liner has made an astonishingly significant change in my lash strength.</li>
      <li>I THINK 1 IS EVEN HIGH FOR A RATING FOR THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it and the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
      <li>I finally was able to bust into the tube, it was completely dry inside...</li>
      <li>Was even more difficult to secure the sections back once I had made the first application with the liner.</li>
      <li>I thought it was clear,</li>
      <li>I use the clear formula.  </li>
      <li>have been using it for months and definitely made a difference in the length of my eyelashes...and for a decent price.</li>
      <li>I personally felt nothing, I made sure I did get product on my lids and put it on correctly for a long time, I did it twice a day everyday for 4 weeks and nothing.</li>
      <li>Am using up other products I have first.</li>
      <li>good luck getting it out of the applicator, it is a small brush, you remove the lid and the product is supposed to be already on the brush, but if there was I could not see or feel any, just a slight dampness when I touched the brush to my lash line...and after about a week it seems to just dry up...</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks, those bare patches that had appeared with age, have re-sprouted hair.</li>
      <li>I am 67 and with age the eyelashes thin out and also since I cannot wear most eyeshadows -</li>
      <li>After a two weeks, my lashes were back to normal size and the bald spot I was left with due to eyelash extension removal, was gone (the new lashes were short, but they were growing).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I desperately needed help regrowing my eyelashes, but this product did not work for me.  I used it faithfully for four months - no results!  Ask your doctor for Latisse.  It&#x27;s pricey but worth it and the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> After removing my eye lash extensions, I lost half of my lashes and the ones I had left, there were very short and weak. I had lasik surgety done a month before I bought this products so my eyes are very sensitive, so I love this product because it&#x27;s very gentle on my eyes, and I can use it under my eye make up. After using this product for seven days, my lashes appeared longer. After a two weeks, my lashes were back to normal size and the bald spot I was left with due to eyelash extension removal, was gone (the new lashes were short, but they were growing). After one month, my lashes are fuller, longer and thicker. This product works so well, that once I apply the mascara it looks like I&#x27;m wearing falsies but I&#x27;m not!! This product is now part of my nightly and morning routine, I&#x27;ll keep buying as long as they keep  making it!!</li>
    <li> The seller was curteous. The product is escellent. I have used it before. I will recommend this along with the eyeliner if you can get two in one which I have been using for the last 1 year.</li>
    <li> Two weeks and I can see a slight difference in the fullness of my lashes.  I look forward to seeing what the next few weeks bring.  I can put brush it on while I&#x27;m wearing mascara and it is extremely convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased two days ago. Found it very difficult to open and expose the applicator portion of the product. Was even more difficult to secure the sections back once I had made the first application with the liner. Today, I could not get it to open at all. The bottom of the wand comes apart. But nothing I did would release the actual applicator from the lid/cover. Also, the length of the holder is very deceiving. Once apart I could see that there was minimal amount of liner/product (perhaps 1\\&quot; of the total 6\\&quot; wand length.</li>
    <li> Really does help grow my lashes in thicker! The product is a gel so I leave the tube standing with the brush end down. It just makes a moist line along the base of your lashes. You can&#x27;t hear or feel anything sloshing around in the tube. I get 4-6 months use out of a tube.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I wanted  to regrow my eyebrows rather than enhance my lashes. Happy to say, it worked! After 2 weeks, those bare patches that had appeared with age, have re-sprouted hair. I no longer have to fill in gaps with makeup. The serum dries in less than a minute, allowing you to use pencil/powder over it, if you like. I have fair \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin and had no problem using this.</li>
    <li> Awesome product works amazing</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 2 weeks and I think my eyelashes appear thicker to me !!!  i cant tell if it is for real or my imagination but they look thicker and more substantial to me.  I use the clear formula.  It feels like I am not wearing anything.  not greasy or anything.  I put it on at night or in the mornings and that&#x27;s it.   I have also started to use it on my eyebrows.   worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love the results, gaps completely filled in &amp; much longer too. But can not tell when container is empty.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing at all no reaction what so ever. I read many others either had stingy eyes or had darker longer thicker lashes, for those who had a positive reaction good for you and those with negatives,m sorry to hear that. I personally felt nothing, I made sure I did get product on my lids and put it on correctly for a long time, I did it twice a day everyday for 4 weeks and nothing. I dont think its a bad product I just think we all have different bodies and different reactions, you just gotta take a chance and hope for the best :) Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year - I find it to be really good. I am 67 and with age the eyelashes thin out and also since I cannot wear most eyeshadows - I ordered the clear.&lt;br /&gt;The results are more than I hope for - my lashes are longer, fuller and look so much better. Much more natural than I thought, but I am very happy with this product. The price is much better&lt;br /&gt;than other brands and it works. It come in colors also - so be sure you pay attention to the color offered. As others have said - it works under makeup.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> TRIED FOR A FEW DAYS AND FELT MY LASHES WERE FALLING OUT SO, I STOPPED USING IT IMMEDIATELY.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY!  I WENT BACK TO MY TRUSTY CASTOR OIL AND OLIVE OIL TO STRENGTHEN THEM AGAIN.  I THINK 1 IS EVEN HIGH FOR A RATING FOR THIS PRODUCT.  WISH I NEVER BOUGHT!!!</li>
    <li> I had very sparse eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve been applying this at least every morning and sometimes at night for about 2 weeks.The one I have is a clear serum, but it dries quickly so that I can apply eyeliner.  I&#x27;m not sure if the collagen powder I&#x27;ve been taking has contributed, but I am thrilled to have eyelashes now.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I used this on my eyelashes, and noticed after a few weeks, my eyelashes were brushing against my eyeglasses.  My eyelashes are really much longer!  Thanks for making this.</li>
    <li> This really worked for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in the black/brown colors for several years now. Although I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my lash length (they&#x27;re already quite long), using this liner has made an astonishingly significant change in my lash strength. They used to fall out all the time, into my eyes, which was really irritating and sometimes painful. After using this for a few weeks, I almost never had lashes falling out. I bought the clear kind for my mom, who has the same issue but doesn&#x27;t like wearing liner, and it resolved the problem for her as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes there isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the pen to start with, so be sure to check if you have a strong line of product coming out before your return period is up. Store it tip-down, and it should last you several months, even while using daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 tubes before and they worked. It took a month but they grew it very nicely.</li>
    <li> Like the packaging. I honestly have not tried it yet. Am using up other products I have first. Not sure how soon I will get to it. Could be several months yet.</li>
    <li> I love the clear serum! I use it on my eyebrows as well and it helps the patchy parts fill in. I wish they would sell it in stores again.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my eyelashes and brush was very difficult to remove from applicator. I never actually felt there was any product on the brush when applied to eyelid.</li>
    <li> Doesnt show any growth</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to evaluate.  Only received it last week and it takes 4 weeks to receive results.</li>
    <li> discontinued product and happy to find it on Amazon.  have been using it for months and definitely made a difference in the length of my eyelashes...and for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Ran dry after a week. It came in a package of two so I had enough to see a very little difference.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference. It didn&#x27;t feel like I was  applying anything.  I like being able to dip it into a bottle like mascara. Not like a pen.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Wal-Mart, be warned , it&#x27;s eyeliner! I thought it was clear, it&#x27;s black. I mean basic black. I had it smudged when first applying to my eyebrow. Do not listen to the reviewer on here about the eye brow idea. It looks fake, unrealistic, and very make up appearing. It doesn&#x27;t look real! Idk how she thought it would work on eye brows. Best to just let things grow out naturally. Even pencils are off in the brow shades or colors making it look drawn on. That&#x27;s what this eyeliner did. It looks drawn on. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> The tip is so small, it&#x27;s easy to get that fine line around your lashes.  This really works!  My eyelashes have grown back and are back to their long length, after using this product for about a year.  The fullness is coming back in now.  I continue to use it because I like the simplicity of application.  Stays put, doesn&#x27;t smudge.  I also use it on my eyebrows to bring them back! They are filling in and lengthening.</li>
    <li> I would NOT recommend. NOTHING comes out on the brush...,its like there is nothing in the container. waste of money. if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle returning things, I would get my money back!!</li>
    <li> not much liquid. too little product for the money.</li>
    <li> So, I really dont know if this product works or not, but good luck getting it out of the applicator, it is a small brush, you remove the lid and the product is supposed to be already on the brush, but if there was I could not see or feel any, just a slight dampness when I touched the brush to my lash line...and after about a week it seems to just dry up...I finally was able to bust into the tube, it was completely dry inside...so either they only give you a drop or two of the product, or it evaporated...either way, very little of it made its way to my lashes so I can not tell you if the actual stuff works...definitely will not be buying again.  I do have to say that the selling shipped very quick..had the product just a couple days after placing the order, and the package itself was sealed very well...no complaints with the seller, just the product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and it does seem to boost my lashes over time. Purchased it on Amazon because it&#x27;s getting hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> After one month of daily use, my lashes are thicker and longer (at least 1/8 in). It&#x27;s also great for those with contacts or sensitive skin.</li>
