<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this brush!  Bought 6 of them for presents.</li>
    <li> I was plesantly suprised to discover that it does in fact work.  Honestly, i was expecting it to be a 10$ throwaway idea kind of purchase, but it is still working quite well.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This wet brush is The only thing that saves my daughter from screaming when I have to brush her ridiculously knotty hair. I actually have an easier time if I brush her hair dry with a little Detangler spray and use this brush.</li>
    <li> Just bought our second one of these, since we used the first one so much we wore it out. The only brush that can handle my girl&#x27;s tangled curls. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush to untangle hair. Especially for little girls &amp; their long hair. My granddaughter won&#x27;t use any other brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever bought and used. I have long thick hair which the majority of brushes would not get through, not to mention other brushes would pull out alot of my hair. This brush glides right through even a tangled mess with ease without pulling out all your hair. It worked so good I had to buy 2 as my dad stole mine. He has long curly hair and even he loves this brush as it glides right through his hair. If your looking for a brush I&#x27;d buy this one</li>
    <li> The only brush I will ever use to brush mine and my children s hair. It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my toddler that has very curly hair. Works great! So I decided to try it on my own very long hair, and it&#x27;s amazing. I no longer need any detangler at all. I&#x27;ll be buying another for me!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this wet brush during my last visit.  She said she could order one for me but I would be better off finding it on Amazon.  I have fine hair that tangles easily so I use it in the shower after I&#x27;ve conditioned my hair.  It makes it easier to brush out and blow dry once I&#x27;m out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that gets tangled every night. This brush takes out all the knots WITHOUT A DETANGLER AND OUT OF THE SHOWER.  This brush will save your hair period. It works so well try doesn&#x27;t rip your hair. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write reviews about products, but this brush merited a glowing one. For forty years I have bought the sturdiest, most stable bristled brushes I can find. My hair is extremely thick and to-the-butt long. My hair has been known to break wooden brushes, plastic brushes, combs, picks and even an ice pick! I read every review available for these brushes and I still had major reservations. When the brush arrived, I had doubts as it just didn&#x27;t look sturdy enough to deal with my hair. To my surprise, in 15 minutes I had easily brushed through all my hair, including two clumpy thickets of snarls that would have taken me a half hour to forty five minutes to work through. There was very little pulling and not much hair loss at all. I can&#x27;t wait to try this brush the way it was meant, on wet hair after I wash it in the shower! I most certainly will be ordering more of these brushes and recommending them to my thick haired friends.</li>
    <li> Super brush, I need to get another!! No crying for my sensory sensitive child. FINALLY!</li>
    <li> I love the wet brush! Is is my third one - I have another for home, and another I keep in my travel bag as I&#x27;m on the road a lot. I have very fine hair and I used to always have to use a detangling spray to get rid of knots. This moves effortlessly through my hair and untangles so easily. I won&#x27;t use another type of brush to unknot my hair! Seller was great too - everything arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes and the lil ones are so nice to keep in your locker at work!!~</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It does not pull out my hair. I old one broke so I purchased a new one. I have one that I travel with also.</li>
    <li> I bought this before in a salon for double the price. My daughter has long thick hair and this is the only brush that she doesn&#x27;t cry with. I&#x27;m used to nights in front of the tv with a bottle of conditioner. Not anymore! I brush right in the shower with her or right when she gets out.</li>
    <li> Amazed by this brush. My daughter has very thin curly hair. So it can be a pain to brush and a struggle to get her to cooperate. This has changed that completely.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift for a 10 year girl. The brush was on time</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that can get through my long wet hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife after a recommendation from a friend, glad I did. My wife hated her old brush but says this one works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush my 4 and 5 yr old daughters will let me brush their hair with.  It works through tangles incredibly well.</li>
    <li> recommended by my hairstylist for our boys&#x27; very curly hair. works great in helping get stubborn tangles out.</li>
    <li> This brush has saved my life! I&#x27;ve had knots in my hair my entire life, and this brush saves me from 20 minutes of pain a day ! So worth it</li>
    <li> does what it says to a T. great product!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! If you are thinking about buying one go ahead and do it!!! My scalp no long hurts after brushing my think unruly hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is no different than any similar style brushes. It was not helpful with detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair, at all.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best! I used right after i took a shower and it works like magic! It used to be so hard to brush it because of my thick hair with my old brush but i just got this one today from Amazon and I already love it. There is nothing that I hate about it. If you are deciding to get a brush and your are thinking about this one, i really recommend it especially if you have a hard time trying to get knots an tangles out. It makes your hair really smooth.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick, long hair. This brush goes through it easily without pulling or ripping hair. THe bristles give instead of fighting against the hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter won&#x27;t let me brush her hair with any other brush!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd brush - my daughters keep stealing them. It is a great brush and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive in buying this product because I didn&#x27;t believe that it would really work wonders on my wet, tangled, curly hair. I am SO happy to report that it&#x27;s a WONDERFUL product that gets out all of my wet tangles with ease! The only thing different that I noticed from a traditional brush is that I have to brush my hair for a longer period of time (to get all of the tangles out) but I believe that it is totally worth it because I am not &amp;#34;fighting&amp;#34; with my hair to detangle! Great product Wet Brush!</li>
    <li> Great brush that really does work on super tangled hair!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have written.&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length, FINE hair, and a lot of it - this is a game changer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used combs + detangler on my wet hair my entire life, and was left with a comb full of ripped hair and a lot of remaining knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing easily combed out ALL of my knots, with little to no hair loss.  And I have the kind of hair that becomes dreads by the end of the day.  It even feels good and smooth going through your hair.  YOU NEED THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best $10 I have ever spent.  Make a joyous noise, the future is here  :D</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! If you have hair that is a chore to brush through after washing this is the brush for you!  I absolutely love this brush. I have told everyone about it!  No more pulling my hair out brushing after washing. I just brush right through my hair with this. It really is a hair and time saver!! Such a great price too!</li>
    <li> great for wet or tangled hair, feels good on the scalp</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing brush</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  I recently dyed my hair blonde and it gets extra tangly.  This brush changed the game!  Now I don&#x27;t stress over washing my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical at first... but this brush really does cut through my fine, easily tangled hair like butter! Loved it so much I bought a second one for my swim bag. My only complaint is that it has a very strong chemical smell when you first get it. I just washed it a few times in the sink.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned so many brushes in the past and I&#x27;ve always been looking for a brush that isn&#x27;t going to get stuck on every single knot. This brush does the trick; I love that I&#x27;m able to finally able to brush the tangles out of my hair and not be in pain while doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I&#x27;ve run into is that since using this brush I&#x27;ve had more flyaways on the top of my head than I used to get. It is not all the time; but most days. I&#x27;ve been using a new  product to help with that, but even when styling and using the flat iron I&#x27;m still having this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even still, this is the best brush that I&#x27;ve had for a long time and I&#x27;ve even used it on my little ones head since she gets lots of tangles and we have seen a huge improvement on brushing her hair as well. I would recommend it to anyone that has tangles in their hair and is looking for a better solution!</li>
    <li> This brush is a life saver for my curly haired child!  I can actually brush her hair without it taking hours just to keep from hurting her little head.  I love this too, it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much after showering.  On my child we use it dry or wet and both ways it works great.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush.  Works great for long very thick hair.</li>
    <li> Really like the wet brush but I like the smaller size better, it&#x27;s easier to pull the loose hairs out of it and it&#x27;s even easier on your snarls then the big brush. I have long hair and the little one definitely hold up.</li>
    <li> No more tears. Have to work a little to get the tangles out, but certainly not as painful as standard brushes.</li>
    <li> All three daughters found these brushes to be what they were looking for.</li>
    <li> I have two other WET BRUSHes, and purchased this one assuming they would be of the same quality. I think this was a knock-off brush. If you are familiar with the WET BRUSH it should have very pliable bristles so as not to pull tangles. The brush that arrived has much harder bristles than it should. In addition, where the bristle goes into the brush, it should be flush. This particular brush has little hard stubby pokey nubs next to each bristle that scratch each time the brush is used. This is the mark of a cheap brush -almost a dollar tree brush. I am very displeased with this purchase. I still love the WET BRUSH, but will purchase it again in the future from the actual website of the ORIGINAL WET BRUSH. It might be twice the price, but it will be worth it. You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> This brush has made an amazing difference to my frizzy hair.it is so much smoother even in Humid weather</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I just got my hair bleached blonde and the next day I used this brush with only two hairs breaking off. Two! I usually have 100 with a regular brush even before my hair was brittle before bleaching. I also use it on my son who has shoulder length hair and it&#x27;s detangles with ease. He loves it too. Great product.</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughters, one with straight hair one with very curly hair..both love ghem</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush. I don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s more amazing than other brushes. I have shorter hair, maybe that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
    <li> I had brushes like these during the 70s and as the years went by,  I could not find brushes to replace the worn out ones.  Although my hair is fine and thinning because I am older, until ordering this brush, I could not get a brush that could make it through my wavy hair.  Thank goodness I found this brush.</li>
    <li> So, so good. I have 3 daughters, and this just made life so much easier. Buy it!  You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> I read the other comments. I didn&#x27;t take their advice for granted. This brush even goes through my mom&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, bought one for both of my daughters as stocking stuffers at Christmas.</li>
    <li> Recommend 100% This absolutely de tangles with no trouble with thick hair! Worth the wait!</li>
    <li> certainly is amazing how easily it brushes through tangled wet hair without painful snagging.  Good with dry hair too but I do like my other brush that gives a more vigorous stimulation to scalp and hair.  After time in the wind though this would be the one to use</li>
    <li> Might sound silly but this brush changed my life. It is now so much easier and less painful to brush out my long and often tangled wet hair. Thank you for this wonderful tool!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this brush.  I have long, thick hair and washing it is a nightmare.  I tried everything, every comb or conditioner that i came across and none of them did anything to get my tangles out and i was tugging my wet hair every time.  This brush gets my tangles out.  you do have to brush your hair and work it a bit but for me, it&#x27;s a lifesaver!  I have 3 of these brushes.  I love them</li>
    <li> I have long, highlighted hair, so my hair tangles horribly after washing.  This brush has made the after-wash comb-through much more pleasant.  I really don&#x27;t quite understand why this brush works so well, but I am just happy it does!</li>
    <li> Very good performance for wet hair styling!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It removes tangles without pulling my hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever for thick, curly hair! I will never use another brush</li>
    <li> This brush works great for my daughter to brush out her wet hair after her shower!!</li>
    <li> Love this hair brush.  Still loose a lot of hair but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Material wasn&#x27;t as great as my first one.  This one is a lot lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  Didn&#x27;t realize there would be a quality difference.</li>
    <li> Wow! Ges though my grand daughters hair with ease. That is really saying something!</li>
    <li> Works great on both of my girls&#x27; hair. One has thin, fine hair and one has very thick hair. Much quicker and less painful detangling than a regular brush.</li>
    <li> I love, love ,love this brush. My daughter has very thick, semi curly hair and it brushed through with no pulling or pain. I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t started using this brush years ago!!! Defintley worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, long blonde hair which tangles easily.  My colorist uses this brush (post-wash and condition) for  blowing my hair dry easily after spraying Redken Color Extend Total Recharge on my hair, and which I use at home with this brush.  When damp dry, mousse can be applied for body.  It&#x27;s a great routine for women who color their hair (or not, I suppose) because the brush makes blow drying so simple, and has minimized hair damage and loss for me.</li>
    <li> I dont know what kind of magic is in this brush but it really works well!! Feels super soft, even while brushing hard knots out, and actually gets them out!!! Really impressed!!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that&#x27;s about midback legnth, so I&#x27;ve always had issues with brushes from them breaking to hurting a lot when I try to get out the knots. I got this brush and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Occasionally I have to pull a little hard but even that doesn&#x27;t hurt. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Goes thru hair that is otherwise a mess.  My kids love it because it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  This is the only brush they will use.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot currently. :) I enjoy it and it works very well and has not fallen appart like a previous hair brush that I had owned.</li>
    <li> Its true that this brush is great on my wet or dry hair. The bristles are very forgiving, thin, and flexible. It may take a couple of swipes to get a tangle out, bu at least you are not ripping your hair out by brushing too roughly!</li>
    <li> I thought the regular Wet Brush was a Godsend, until I tried this one.  Detangled my 3b/c curls in moments!!  I bought this brush to replace my last one, and I feel like buying this brush in bulk, so that I will NEVER be without it.  Love!!</li>
    <li> Incredible! Works wonders.</li>
    <li> We love this brush!! My 10 year old now willingly brushes her hair several times a day, sometimes without being told. Yep, I caught her doing it a few times on her own. She has told friends about this brush. Her hair looks so much better and there are no fights. It&#x27;s a game changer in our house. Must buy this brush!!!</li>
    <li> This really works well on wet, semi-wet and dry hair.  My daughter is almost 5 and for about 3 years we have battled each time I need to style her hair.  I bought a $20 brush from Aveda and it works well, but for the price this one is SO much better.</li>
    <li> I had a &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; from my local salon, and it was fantastic! So much so that, when my sister-in-law visited a few weeks ago, I let her take it home with her. I figured I&#x27;d just order my own, and I ordered this one. It doesn&#x27;t work badly, but I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the original, as it DEFINITELY snags in my hair wayyyyy more than the one my sis-in-law took. I&#x27;ll probably use it on the pets and go spend twice the money to get a replacement from the salon.</li>
    <li> We have ended up purchasing several of these. My daughter is very tender headed and brushing her hair was horrible for the both of us. This brush goes through a rats nest like butter. It has made our lives so much easier! I am NEVER buying another brush again!</li>
    <li> This brush really works on my long hair and my Granddaughters.</li>
    <li> My daughter will only use these brushes to detangle her long hair. It has been a great find.</li>
    <li> This works so fast on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s knotty ratnest!  She has a really sensitive head and fusses just a bit but I was able to get her whole head combed in less than two minutes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! I have a lot of thin hair that has an uncanny ability to get very tangled. This brush goes through my hair like a dream with minimal hair pulling. I find almost no hair in the brush afterwards. I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with this product!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a regular brush but it isn&#x27;t.  I actually love brushing my hair now because it doesn&#x27;t pull out my tender aging hair and it feels SO GOOD on the scalp. I want to get it for my grandkids.  Love it!</li>
    <li> detangles pretty good but you have to take another brush through to get all of your hair. does good on wet hair though. doesn&#x27;t pull so it would be good for kids</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I wish I had found it sooner. My hair is very think it when I used it I couldn&#x27;t even feel it going through the hair. But it was. I purchased it for a 9 year old girl with curly hair who is very tender headed. As soon as she used the brush she wanted me to fix her hair every day. Before that she couldn&#x27;t stand for me to because it hurt too bad. I recommend this highly for anyone that is tender headed.</li>
    <li> BEST BRUSH EVER! This is the only brush my daughter will let me brush her hair with. For that matter, it&#x27;s the only brush I want to brush my hair with-wet or dry. It combs through tangled wet hair like it&#x27;s nothing. I don&#x27;t even need to use a detangler, which is saying a lot for fly-away toddler hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair dresser told me I should. She claims it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair when you brush it wet. I would like to believe she&#x27;s right, but I can&#x27;t really prove it either way. It does seem to be less aggressive.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these brushes for myself, and one for my daughter and granddaughter.  We all have long hair.  We love this brush! It detangles so quickly and without hurting! I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has hair to her knees she is 10 years old and this is the first thing this has not pulled or damaged her hair we love it.</li>
    <li> Wish we had had his for my daughter&#x27;s Shirley Temple curls much sooner.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I have two Wet Brushes now and I make everyone try it... And then have them order theirs on Amazon when they love it bc they all do.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush!  I have a 7 &amp; 3 year old...and they thought I was trying to kill them every time I brushed their hair!  It seriously works better than any brush we&#x27;ve tried!  The girls love it and it has made &amp;#34;hair time &amp;#34; enjoyable!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and have several all over the house and at work. My hair is fine, long and can get very tangled because I live in a windy section of Dallas. These brushes are the best at getting out snarls without damaging my hair. They are also great at untangling wet hair. The best method of dealing with wet hair is to spray a little detangler on the brush (Hair n Mane is the best, doesn&#x27;t weigh down or get hair sticky) then brush through.</li>
    <li> If you have hair or a daughter with hair, get this hair brush!!! My daughter used to fight me every time I would brush her hair. It was to the point to where I was seriously contemplating chopping it all off (which would be very sad because she has gorgeous hair!!). My cousin who has really thick hair said it was totally worth it so I bought it. Boy howdy was she right!!! No more fighting! Hair brushing time is cake compared to our other brushes.</li>
    <li> This is great for wet hair.  It does not pull or rip at your hair.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I frequently brush through my heat protectant before using my styling tools, and this is a comb in brush form! Perfect for all hair types (I have fine but THICK hair), and doesn&#x27;t frizz wet hair, despite what you&#x27;d think! I went out and immediately bought a few more because I wanted other colors. Worth tracking it down and spending the $$ on this brush over another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work as well on dry hair (adds a bit of frizz to dry hair WARNING), but great in a pinch!</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  Works great &amp; my hair never looked better.  No fly-a ways &amp; retains its shape well.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this brush by my hair stylist. And it works really well for brushing through and detangling wet hair--which is when I need to do all my brushing anyway for my curly hair. Goes through hair very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t pull or anything unpleasant.</li>
    <li> We have the blue wet brush for my husband to use.  My whole family uses wet brush.  We can use the wet brush for wet and dry hair.  It is perfect for both men, women and children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves the brush and I love it that we can all use it.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we each have our own wet brushes to use!</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much. I really recommend it for girls who have trouble brushing their hair. It works so good for wet hair too. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, the brush is really nice and smooth on your hair. If you are someone looking for a nice brush that doesn&#x27;t hurt when you brush your hair, I totally recommend this brush</li>
    <li> I have been here that gets tangled easily and this brush goes right through the tangles without pulling. I don&#x27;t even know how it works, but my hairdresser recommended it to me and it is amazing! If you have thin hair or hair that tangles easily, this is definitely for you!</li>
    <li> The best brush I have ever used in my daughter&#x27;s hair! She has long, thick hair and this brushed was recommended by my stylist. When she gets out of the shower we use this magical brush and there are no tears while we brush out her tangles!</li>
    <li> I received the brush in a very timely matter and it works very well.  This is a great product.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Why did I not know about this brush sooner? My hair hates being wet, whether it was just submerged in the ocean, the pool, even freshly washed! It turns into a snaggy mess. My hairdresser tested this brush out on my hair last week during my haircut and it worked great! Ordered one immediately, just used it---very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll say up front that this brush changed the dynamic with my daughter when we bought our first one almost 2 years ago. I have no idea how it works, but my tender headed tween can actually handle brushing her very thick, long hair now that we use the wet brush. This review is a comment more on the design of this specific metallic model. It is a different shape than the matte plastic ones we have; it is thinner and therefore much less comfortable in the hand. It&#x27;s less weighty, which was a selling point for us, and feels too thin to hold comfortably. I don&#x27;t know why they changed the shape. I&#x27;m guessing it is to save money by using less material. I&#x27;ve posted a photo to show the size difference between the two handles. By all means get the brush. Just stay away from the metallic models.</li>
    <li> this is a great brush and it doesnt just help not hut wet hair but it makes getting tangles out of my hair so much easier.</li>
    <li> I have long thin hair, but a lot of it. This brush is great for detangling my towel dried hair after a shower. The bristles are so thin and plentiful that it doesn&#x27;t pull much when brushing. My kids love how the small bristles feel when brushing their hair so I bought another one for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it for smoothing my hair with a hair dryer but the bristles did get a bit bent from the heat. Great purchase, I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush in the history of brushes.  Do you have little girls? Buy this brush! You can brush your hair soaking wet and it doesn&#x27;t tangle.  Wooooo hooooo wet brush amen!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush due to the good reviews it had on here however I am very disappointed with this &#x27;pro&#x27; brush.  It does not detangle my hair!!! I&#x27;ve tried using it both on dry hair and wet hair and boy does it suck either way.</li>
    <li> Without exaggeration, this is life-changing little thing. I&#x27;m blessed/cursed with long, thick, coarse and wavy hair that tangles if you look at it wrong. Salon shampooing always leaves it in actual knots, and as a child, I had absolute rats&#x27; nests (that would sometimes not get combed out for way too long)... No matter how careful I am in the shower/drying, or how much conditioner I use, my even slightly-snarled hair USED TO TAKE 15-20 minutes to fully comb through (and that&#x27;s with extra leave-in conditioner and a wide-tooth comb). I hated it, and recently cut off several inches to lessen the misery. My daughters, unfortunately, also inherited the &#x27;knottiness&#x27; of my hair, and post-shower comb-outs were not fun for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENTER THE WET BRUSH! The stylist I&#x27;d started going to first washed my hair, and I warned her how easily it knotted... Back to her chair, and of course, it was in thick tangles. I was annoyed, and preparing myself for the 20-ish minutes of tugging it typically took to undo the damage from the sink-- NOPE! She took out a Wet Brush and it was like waving a magic wand. After a minute, I was in such awe, I asked her what it was, and where I could find one. I&#x27;ve since bought two-- one for my kids, and one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these, and only wish I&#x27;d had them forever. I can literally brush through my hair in 1-2 minutes now. I wouldn&#x27;t have just cut my hair if I knew how much easier my life would be with this brush. I don&#x27;t even care that I&#x27;m gushing-- if any of you have or love someone with thick and/or easily-tangled hair, please try this brush. (Btw, I don&#x27;t think there is a discernible difference between the WB &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; and the regular one.)</li>
    <li> Very nice brush on my daughters long thick hair</li>
    <li> Bought for my ornery grandson who refused to brush out the tangled mess!  He won&#x27;t look at me when I ask if he likes it - but he has to say yes - IT WORKS!  WooHoo - One for G-ma!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this brush to me, and even though it looks like any other brush, I thought I would give it a whirl. It may look fairly standard, but it definitely feels different when I brush my hair.  I never brush my hair immediately after a shower (I use a thick toothed comb), but as I have long, thick hair and it takes about half a day to fully blow dry it, I typically leave for work before it is 100% dry, so having a brush that not only pulls less, but also seems to cause less split ends, is a win-win for me! I can see how this would be an excellent investment for someone with young girls as well.</li>
    <li> Fast service..this brush is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has very thick, long hair that gets tons of tangles.  It&#x27;s a fight to get her to brush her hair because of all the tangles.  I used to work at a children&#x27;s hair salon and purchase a &amp;#34;Knot Genie&amp;#34; from the salon and it could barely comb through her hair, and she cried every time we used it.  Today the Wet Brush arrived and she squealed with excitement.  I opened up the package and she immediately started brushing her hair.  She has since brushed her hair 6 times and loves the brush!  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush and bought one for my mom too. We both have very long, very thick, and unruly hair. This brush is a miracle worker on hair that is wet or dry. It feels great on the scalp and is the only brush I use. Period. My hairdresser noticed my hair was less damaged once I switched and I notice a considerable difference with fewer split ends</li>
    <li> this works wonders!! im not sure if i ordered the right one my hair is (mixed) so its thick and curly and i can glide through my hair with this brush and i have almost no hair in the brush when im done! score!!</li>
    <li> Like the brush very much</li>
    <li> My kids have fine hair that gets knotted easily.  These brushes have cut our brushing time down SIGNIFICANTLY.  They are awesome.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, its past my hinny.  This brush said it would take out tangles, well the fine layer on top only. I get tangles and knots in my hair, so i had to bring out the comb again. UGH.&lt;br /&gt;So to me, it was a waste of money...did not do the job it said it would do.</li>
    <li> This is a Great brush. It Does not pull wet hair yet Works great on tangles. My daughter didn&#x27;t like combing her hair before because it often hurt but with this brush she has no problem!</li>
    <li> Easily detangles hair.  Great wet or dry.  A must have for easily tangled hair.  Brush through your hair while conditioning for EXTRA smooth hair.</li>
    <li> Reported that it never arrived and have had no response. So cant rate it and cant try it. Win some lose some.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a brush.  I was hoping, based on the fawning reviews, that it really would eliminate the daily tears over brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  No such luck.  It&#x27;s a brush like all brushes and will pull the knots out slowly and painfully.</li>
    <li> i love this silly brush. i will never go back to combing my wet hair. never. this brush is a life-changer.</li>
    <li> This brush works really well on both my daughter (age 9) and my hair.  We have thick, wavy hair.  It works especially smooth when our hair is wet, hence the name &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34;.  It does also work well with dry hair.  We love it.</li>
    <li> Great brush for tender headed kids! My daughter has waist length hair, and this is by far the best brush we have found to deal with knots and tangles..</li>
    <li> The bristles are flexible, so I can brush my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and it works out the tangles without breaking the hair.</li>
    <li> Best untangled. Bought one for each bathroom.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush!  I have long thick hair past the middle of my back and combing and brushing (especially while wet) has always been a chore.  This brush is amazing.  I have so much more hair on my head versus in my brush at the end of the day!  Right out of the shower, I can towel off my hair and brush it with the Wet Brush Pro and it just glides through...no snagging, no working on tangles with my comb and no piles of tangled ripped hair when I am done.  I took it to the beach with me on vacation this summer too, so I swam with my hair down without fear of a mess to rake through...it was great.  My daughter has long hair too and her comment was &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t even feel like it is doing anything&amp;#34;.  Which is the feeling, but it IS!  I sometimes miss the feel of a good hard bristle scratching my scalp, but I don&#x27;t miss the ten minutes of combing through my hair after a shower.  Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> This came early and was packed well. These brushes are incredible in my granddaughters opinion..  Thank You</li>
    <li> love it! My 9 year old loves it, it&#x27;s an amazing detangler!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  I have thick hair and this is like a dream come true.  I take it with me if I go to the salon and get my hair done.</li>
    <li> went to the hairdresser recently and he was using this brush while my hair was soaking wet.  the brush slid right through - without a single &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; - amazing.  of course i had to have one.  now i do.</li>
    <li> Girlfriends review: this brush is truly amazing. I have the hardest time brushing my super fine very long hair. This brush moved through my hair like butter. It&#x27;s incredible! Best 8 bucks I spent in a while!</li>
    <li> This brush causes the least amount of tears and anguish. And we&#x27;ve tried a lot of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great for people of all ages, but my 9-year-old daughter particularly appreciates it. My daughter has very thick hair that though smooth in texture, easily tangles into these huge gnarly knots, often close to her neck (very sensitive area!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After conditioning, we rub a little argan (Moroccan) oil between our hands (one or the other or in some cases, both of us) and starting at the ends, massage the oil into her hair. This helps me get an idea of the extent of the knottage and how many tears there will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair is just past her shoulders, so long enough I can grasp a hank and brush out the ends first. I can tell when there are no more snags because the brushing becomes quiet--I can no longer hear the actually brush going through her hair. The tricky parts are those knots close to her neck. Sometimes it&#x27;s clump-like, others it&#x27;s literally just a knot between two hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the brush too. I have long, thick, curly hair and I brush it before I take a shower. Sometimes it takes a while before the brush touches my scalp, trying to brush it tangle-free and smoothish. But it eventually gets there. And I use the same trick to determine when I can stop brushing--no more brush sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I knocked off one star is that, over time, the tiny balls at the end of the bristles come off (I have no idea where they all end up), and what&#x27;s left are the sharp prickles of the bristle tips. Ouch.</li>
    <li> This is a really amazing brush.  My four year old daughter will only WILLINGLY let me brush her hair if I use what she calls the &amp;#34;unhurt&amp;#34; brush!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.... not sure I functioned without it before!</li>
    <li> Brushing hair has always been a nightmare for my 7 year old. Lots of crying over knots and pulling. I ordered this brush at the recommendation of a family member and I would spend $100 on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it works but my daughter has not cried once since getting this brush. She now willingly brushes her own hair and raves about her new brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. I have 2 for my long hair</li>
    <li> Love it. I have super thick coarse hair and this brushes through smoothly without pulling or getting tangled. Cheaper on amazon than at salons. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Great tool.</li>
    <li> My daughters don&#x27;t cry anymore when untangling their hair wet or dry we love the wet brush . . .</li>
    <li> I have long hair to my butt and wet hair WOW goes through it with ease...</li>
    <li> If you want long hair that doesn&#x27;t break when you brush it... this brush is perfect!  I will never use another brush again!</li>
    <li> I bought a 6x5x4 brush, what I received was a miniature version. What a rip off!</li>
    <li> Best brush you will ever buy!  Especially for curly hair!  My daughter is mixed and has fine thick curly hair. This brush has made doing her hair tolerable again!  No more ouch it hurts and tears!</li>
    <li> My daughter no longer complains about it hurting as much when I brush her hair! Win!</li>
    <li> My 6yo daughter HATES getting her hair brushed.  Every morning we BOTH dread it... until this brush!  It seems the flexibility of the bristles help a lot with the pulling and it also gets all the knots out with less fighting!!!  We love this brush!</li>
    <li> We love this brush! It seems to really manage through tangles in both wet &amp; dry hair. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This brush does an amazing job at getting the tangles out of hard to brush hair with minimal pain.  Great for wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I do not know what the secret is with this brush. I probably will never know.... but Jesus Christ, it works and it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> It was stiffer than the other wet brushes but I will still use it</li>
    <li> This is my third but certainly not final wet brush. LOVE them. My hair is thick and wavy, and this makes brushing a cinch without any snags and minimal knots to pull.</li>
    <li> My little girls will only let me use this brush on their hair!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does, very soft on your hair. Overall it&#x27;s a great brush for wet or dry hair! Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have looked all over the earth for a brush that I could get through my girls&#x27; hair. One has long, curly, thick hair and the other long, straight thick hair. This brush is amazing. They called it magic!</li>
    <li> This brush worked so well for both of my girls. It was actually recommended by my stylist because my oldest daughter has the extremely thick and long hair and it would take forever to brush out her tangles. This brush has saved so many tears and fights and it is actually a joy to do her hair. My youngest has a very sensitive scalp so this is great for her finer hair as well to brush through tangles. I would highly recommend and will likely be buying a second brush so they don&#x27;t fight over this one!</li>
    <li> At first this product worked very well but after a couple of months the bristles have started to fall out. Unfortunately it is past the return time frame. I would consider other similar products before considering buying this product.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!!  No hair ripping or tearing out... amazing!</li>
    <li> Works so well my husband kept stealing from me so I bought him his own so we don&#x27;t have to fight over it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush on the recommendation of my stylist about three years ago. My daughter has hair almost to her waist and we are forever trying to get out the tangles. We know have four of these brushes in the house with each of us (myself and my three children) owing their own brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works great in both wet and dry hair. I love to take mine in the shower with me to brush through my hair when I&#x27;m putting in the conditioner. This really helps get the tangles out before I dry and brush out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I have it a 4 star instead of 5 is that we do still have to use a comb after using the brush sometimes to get out some of the smaller tangles from my daughters hair. The size of the gaps between the bristles in the brush just can&#x27;t get the smaller tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned I have had my brush for three years and it is still in perfect shape and I use it a couple times a day. This recent purchase was to purchase a brush from my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful I encourage you to vote so below. I&#x27;m happy to ask any questions</li>
    <li> I love the Wet Brush!  I have fine hair that has wave and curl.  My hair has always tangled easily.  This brush goes right though any tangle without pulling or damaging the hair.  It&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> Product worked as described. My son has curly hair that constantly tangles and this brushed worked beautifully. Everyone in the family agreed that it was a pain free brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included a photo of the brush we received and the packaging it arrived in.</li>
    <li> love this brush! gets the knots out of thin or thick hair without pulling or hurting</li>
    <li> Fabulous brush goes through wet hair like silk and dry hair goes through easily. Easy to clean the hair out as well.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!!!! I no longer feel like in ripping through my hair when I brush it! The tangles just disappear.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter hates to have her hair brushed.  So it is always a mess.  This brush doesn&#x27;t hurt no matter how matted up her hair is.</li>
    <li> No more pulled hair. This brush glides through your hair whether wet or dry.</li>
    <li> If you have a tender headed child this brush is a must have.  My daughter has thick but fine hair so it gets very tangled. Getting her to brush her hair was next to impossible.  However, the wet brush has changed that!  My daughter now loves brushing her hair and no longer needs leave in conditioners.</li>
    <li> Really great brush, doesn&#x27;t rip hair. Doesn&#x27;t do great on really large knots.</li>
    <li> What kind of voodoo is this?  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever.  Works great on my daughters very long hair.  I would recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this brush but after reading all of the positive reviews I decided to take a chance. Needless to say we were blown away. My daughter and wife love this brush!</li>
    <li> so yes I am one of those girls that brush there hair when its wet with a regular brush.. and I&#x27;m sure there was plenty of breakage... I have been finding my hair sheds more than normal so I bought this brush in hopes to minimize it as much as I could.. I love this brush it doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair.. its very gentle... I cant believe I waited this long to buy one... Purchase it if you have tangles from hell... because this will help :)</li>
    <li> Not as expected -the needles are way to flimsy for an hair thick or thin.  A friend had a wet hair brush that was much stiffer. This can hardly get through any hair.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment to us - perfect! Super fast - typical amazon great delivery!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd wet brush - I use it for myself and my children.  Hands down my favorite brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for kiddos who complain about getting their hair brushed. Adults will love it too. I am tempted to buy another one just so I don&#x27;t have to try to keep track of this one.</li>
    <li> The colors of the Wet Brush are really cool, I like how it feels on my hair, it is a really good product</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these for my daughters who have fine long hair. They like them. I&#x27;m not sure if they work any better than any other brush with the same shape and size.</li>
    <li> I like using this brush on wet hair.  It easily brushes through the tangles and snarls that you get when you wash your hair.  it is superior to other brushes of the same style. I use this brush daily.</li>
    <li> GREAT brush !! Even bought one for my Pomeranian as normally she isn&#x27;t crazy about being brushed but actually doesn&#x27;t mind with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to replace my wet brush that i got 3 years ago. The color brush I received is so much prettier than the one in the picture. Mine is a sapphire blue. The Wet Brush is so amazing. I have thick hair down to the small of my back and this brush does wonders in all conditions!</li>
    <li> My girls love these brushes. They never get lost as they are in constant use. I would have kept my girls&#x27; hair short if we hadn&#x27;t found these brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush does exactly what the description says, and it does it well.  Combing out my wet hair is now a breeze.  This brush works well on dry hair, too.</li>
    <li> This works well. It was recommended to us by a friend and since our daughter loves to swim, I felt we would get our use out of it (and that is true). We use this weekly and it does do a better job of brushing through the tangles (even for daddy).</li>
    <li> Great for wet or dry hair. Never snags even with my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it,  I loved it so much that I bought my grown son one and he loves it. Feels good on your scalp, and great for wet hair.</li>
    <li> We bought each of our young daughters one of these brushes. They loved them. And then I realized why they loved them - it doesn&#x27;t brush their hair! Because it&#x27;s not brushing, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and therefore they loved them. It really only brushed the top layer of hair, giving their hair a brushed look for a very short period of time. It just didn&#x27;t have enough durability to get past the outer layer of hair, only to create worse tangle issues for later.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush so much I bought a second one. I never thought I would find something that worked so well with my kids hair. Now they actually want to get their hair done.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable!!! My daughter keeps raving about how easy it is to brush her hair after showers.  It was like pulling teeth to get her to brush her hair before.  I had to buy one for me because I kept stealing hers.  I even got one for a friend&#x27;s daughter that has a difficult time brushing her hair.</li>
    <li> Works well for a quick brush of my little girls hair, however it seems to not brush deep enough. If I use only this brush for a few days my little girls hair is up in knots. Get for quick use otherwise its just ok</li>
    <li> this has quickly become my favorite brush.  just works better (wet or dry)</li>
    <li> I received The Wet Brush in a Popsugar Must Have box several months ago. I used it for about 6 months. I have long hair that is very fine and prone to breakage. I love this brush! I have been using plastic brushes for most of my life and I can&#x27;t afford to buy a really expensive brush. But plastic bristles for brushes that you get at the drug store can be harsh and pull on your hair, and hurt your scalp. This brush is a good combination of quality and price. The price on Amazon is great, you can get a lousy brush at the drug store for the same (or more), or you can get this brush and treat your hair right.</li>
    <li> This is literally my favorite brush. My stylist uses it and recommended it to me, and it does not pull my hair! Wonderful brush!</li>
    <li> What a perfect brush for any type of hair. I was completely skeptical when I saw this at bed bath and beyond because the bristles were thin and I have thick knotted hair. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using a comb again this brush is so completely gentle and doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair, even when I don&#x27;t use conditioner. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush! She said it was a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This works very well on tangles.</li>
    <li> Got this brush for my friend and she loves it! I wrote a longer review on it (the pink one), but this is a must buy for anyone whose hair gets tangled and has a tough time brushing. You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick, curly hair. Brushing it is no longer an ordeal with this brush!</li>
    <li> My 2-year-old HATES having her hair brushed for some reason. This brush really seems to help.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works so well, but these brushes are awesome!! I have a ton of long, thick hair and it gets all the tangles out. Had to order one for my kids too.</li>
    <li> Best brush for daughters hair! We have purchased many brushes to eliminate as much discomfort from everyday brushing of my daughter thick brown Caucasian hair and this is the best we have found. It works very well when the hair is misted with water and works better than others with completely dry hair as well. This is our 3rd WET brush in 2 years as the little plastic tips do wear off after everyday use in about 9 months. Best brush we have found even tried the battery powered ones. I would recommend it..</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush!</li>
    <li> Removes nots smoothly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best for getting through wet hair, hence the name.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!  My daughter freaks out if I pull her hair just a tinsy bit while brushing it.  This brush prevents the melt downs.  I love  this brush and so does my daughter.  Now brushing her hair is not painful for her or me! I recommended this brush to so many friends and they all say the same thing.  Live changer.</li>
    <li> As I struggled to get the tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s wet hair after swimming lessons, another mom told me about this wet brush.  She simply raved about it, so I knew I had to get one.  To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell that much difference in this and the brush we were using before.  I still use the detangling spray before using the brush, and she still complains that it&#x27;s pulling her hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only no-hurt hair brush that works for my daughter&#x27;s long hair. Her hair is thick, but the individual hairs themselves are fine -- just a lot of them to tangle up, oh-so-easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually use the brush dry, but it does work wet as well. Her hair is so thick that It does NOT get out all tangles; even brushing from the top side AND the underneath side, there&#x27;s still a middle layer that the brush&#x27;s bristles don&#x27;t reach.  So I still need to tackle her with a comb now and then to get them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does make everyday brushing so much easier. And at least her hair LOOKS tangle-free even if I know there are still tangles in there.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old loved it</li>
    <li> This came recommended to me by some teenagers with really long hair who said they&#x27;d never use another brush again. Well, it definitely meets the hype. It really is a painless brush and it actually feels really good to brush your hair with it. I purchased for my kids, but now plan to purchase more for me and my friend&#x27;s children.</li>
    <li> Granddaughters No longer cry when getting their hair brushed, When I first heard about it Didn&#x27;t think it would work, IT DOES !!</li>
    <li> where has this brush been all my life?!?!?</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!! I have two curly heads and this does wonders for the tangles. The trick to getting the best results from this brush is to do hair in small sections (i part the hair in half and then split each half into four sections). This ensures no tangles are passed over and allows for a much easier and quicker job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one criticism I have about the brush is that after a while the bristles start to fall out. My first one lasted about two years. I guess that is a reasonable time given the price and the daily job it has to do!</li>
    <li> this brush is literally a miracle. I have very long and super thick hair that gets extremely tangled whenever it gets wet. I also do diving which adds more tangles. my showers would be really, really, long because all of the knots and tangles. My hairdresser tried this brush on me because even she had trouble brushing out my hair after she would wash it. this brush literally worked like magic. my showers are now like 2 minutes long, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t break your hair. I recommend this brush 100%</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t pull out all my hair when wet like other brushes I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> This is a mircale brush it literally kicks tangles ass so happy i diacovered this will never use a regular brush again</li>
    <li> This brush is amaaaazingly gentle on my tangle-prone hair! Love it!!  Instead of ripping through a tangle and breaking hair, the bristles bend and pass over the tangle, at which point you can work the tangle out safely by going bottom to top.  I wish I had known about this brush when I was little!</li>
    <li> It doe&#x27;s not yank or pull. This will be great for all those tender heads, especially children.</li>
    <li> Works great on wet or dry hair. Finally no tears!!</li>
    <li> The magic cure for toddler tangles.  Brushing out hair takes a minute or 2 instead of ten plus with a traditional brush or comb.  I don&#x27;t even need detangler spray anymore just water.  Seriously, I don&#x27;t know how it works but it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have ever used! Removes tangles without breaking your hair. Great product that I recommend to all my family/friends.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It brushes gentky</li>
    <li> Simple design but effective...Great for the purposes advertised at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 5 year old daughter who has the worlds curliest hair.  When she gets out of the bath its almost impossible to brush her hair without her saying &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; or without any knots, but since we bought this brush she actually looks forward to getting her hair done!  This brush just glides through her wet hair with no issues and if there were any knots, they are gone in a second without pulling!  I am going to order one for myself :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I got along without this brush now that I have one.  It&#x27;s like some kind of miracle!  The first time I saw one, my hairdresser used it to brush out my hair after my shampoo.  She didn&#x27;t spray on any de-tangler and I was prepared for some tugging.  But these brushes are crazy!  The brush right through wet hair without the pulling, tugging or breaking.  I decided then to get one for my granddaughter since her hair is so difficult to brush after bath.  After using it for a while on her, I had to get one of my own!  The seller was great!  Shipped the product super fast.  It arrived well packaged and in great shape!  Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Works great with frizzy hair. It really doesn&#x27;t hurt when brushing. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works amazing on wet hair!! Detangles hair very quickly ;)</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  If you have a tender-headed child, then this is the brush for you!  (My grandbaby has a VERY tender head and would cry whenever getting her hair brushed.  She&#x27;s 11 years old now, so there&#x27;s been lots of crying!)  NO MORE TEARS!!! WooHoo!</li>
    <li> Works great in my daughter&#x27;s long hair (which tends to have lots of tangles).  But as the name indicates, it is to be use when the hair is wet.</li>
    <li> Great brush really gets through my tangles nicley without pain.</li>
    <li> Worked great and was delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this as my hair was falling out in clumps after I had my daughter. Works amazing!!!! Quickly and painlessly detangles my hair.</li>
    <li> 2nd one purchased.  We keep 2 on hand.  Will probably never buy another type of brush again.</li>
    <li> My hair tangles so easily and this helps so much. I&#x27;m always ripping my hair out it feels like with my regular old paddle brush. It works great on dry hair too!</li>
    <li> Detangles my hair better than any other brush!</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft and has grown so much since I have been using this brush especially to brush it when it is wet. It does not tear or frizz my hair. I have bought a couple extras to have in my purse and other places and for my granddaughters who love them!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these so far for me and my family. Amazing brush!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter will only use this brush now.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loving it, works awesome for wet and gentle enough to be kids brush!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and all of my brushes and combs constantly pulled my hair out. This brush is very gentle and is worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this brush! I have unmanageably thick hair but the brush just glides through the knots! ill never use any other type of brush for my hair</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I always thought I would just have to deal with the pain of brushing the tangles out of my long hair, but not with this brush! You don&#x27;t feel any pain when using this brush and the tangles come right out.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush for de-tangling hair!  My hair is extremely fine, thin and tangles so easily and the brush gets the tangles out without pulling hair out.  My granddaughters also love this brush for their hair.  One granddaughter has very thick hair which is very difficult to get tangles out and the other has fine, thin hair which also tangles easily.  It works very well for all of us.  I would recommend this brush for everyone!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH!  MY HAIR IS LIKE A HORSE&#x27;S TAIL AND IT GOES THRU IS SO EASY!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> If your reading this buy the brush! It&#x27;s amazing trust me it lets me brush my hair without pulling and damaging it !</li>
    <li> Does not work like the Wet Brush I bought at the salon; the bristles are different. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed or just have manufacturing irregularities because the Wet Brush company did not respond to my questions. This one works about as well as a cheap brush from the dollar store.</li>
    <li> daughter love this brush.. brushinghas become so easy now.</li>
    <li> Love Wet Brush! Works wonders on long or short hair and works amazingly with wet hair without any hair products. It also works good on dry hair. Cannot live without mine. Everyone should get one.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  Within a week of owning this brush - - I bought one for my neice and two for my co-workers.  Not sure how or why it works.......but it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> So disappointed. Opened the packaging to find the brush defective. It was all scratched up on the back and just didn&#x27;t look new.</li>
    <li> Finally!! No more fighting with my daughter about brushing her hair!! This brush is a lifesaver!! Brushes through wet/dry hair easily and releases knots and tangles. Not the best brush for styling hair, but once you use it to get the tangles out you can style with a normal hairbrush.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, who has really long hair, at the suggestion of our hair stylist. She told me to go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Well, I don&#x27;t like the Sally&#x27;s in my area: all the sales people are rude and if you are not a beautician of some kind, they don&#x27;t even help you. That being said, I looked for it here, and bought it.  A few weeks later, I went to Sally&#x27;s with a friend who was getting something and I found it priced at $3.00 more! Ha ha!! Sweet!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. Got it for my granddaughter, she loves it. It worked so good I purchased several.</li>
    <li> Combs right through wet hair, no snags, no pulling, great time saver!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair so brushing while wet can be torture.  A friend told me about the wetbrush and that I should give it a try.  After reading the reviews, I gave this one a shot.  It works wonders!  It goes through my wet hair so easily!  I highly recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the rave reviews -- after all, it is just a hairbrush -- but this is really a fantastic brush. Worth the few extra dollars relative to more generic brushes, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love, Love this brush !! My Granddaughter does not scream when I brush her hair anymore !!</li>
    <li> I do not regret this purchase was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> It really does work. Somehow my kids hair gets matted at night and this is the brush they reach for me to use. Definitely worth 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Ten year old loves.  Own 3 now.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best brush for little ones with hair that tangles easily. I have purchased other versions of brushes making the same claims, but, this one works the best. My daughter and I have lots of very thin hair which is the kind of hair that tangles so easily. This is the brush you need. My 4-year old used to run when she saw me coming to brush her hair, but, this has made it a less tearful event.</li>
    <li> Works well to get knots out of my daughter&#x27;s long hair!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing i have long but very fine hair and it gets all the tangles out easily with very little loss of hair</li>
    <li> My sister had one of these precious. When My daughter and I stayed with her  she used it on my daughters very very curly hair and it went through her hair no problem so I had to order. It is amazing. It brushes right through any tangles and it does not hurt I would definitely recommend this product works magic</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good brush for removing hard tats.  Granddaughter likes it and that is all that counts.</li>
    <li> My husband and son both have incredibly thick and curly hair. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to comb/pick through. We were amazed at how well this brush...a brush...was able to get out all the knots and tame their hair. Loved it so much I bought another so they each could have one.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because my 5 year old complained every time I brushed her hair.  She is very tender headed, and has lots of lock curls.  Once receiving this brush there have been no more tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best brush I have EVER owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, and is true to the reviews.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft on the hair.  Easy to use and nice bristles.  Won&#x27;t pull your hair out.  Soft backing for the bristles.</li>
    <li> This brush is simply amazing! Did for my super long hair what no other could do. Go buy it now!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Doesn&#x27;t snag at all. Was recommended to me by a hair stylist, who carries them in his salon..for twice as much! Happy I found it here for this price.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. First came across them at a very famous hairstylist&#x27;s salon on Beverly Hills. That&#x27;s what they use there. Great for wet hair as well as dry.</li>
    <li> It is a little larger in size than I expected, but it works very well to untangle my dogs hair when bathing her.  Helps to remove most of  the matted hair which her fine hair is prone to.</li>
    <li> A little bit ago I watched this commercial about the &amp;#34;Michel Mercier&amp;#34; detangling brush and sooner or later decided I wanted it. Before I (almost) bought it, I read some reviews. THEY WWERE LITERALLY ALL AWFUL! I like to be smart about my money, so I called my friend who has one. She said it worked like a normal hairbrush at first, but then after about 2 months, all of the bristles get bent and start to fall off and dosent work AT ALL. (Exactly what the reviews said!) And, one review said that the Michel Mercier brush sucked, and highly recommended the Wet Brush. So I searched it, reread some reviews, (all positive) , and bought it. IT WORKS GREAT. I&#x27;ve had it for around 4 months now and still works fine. You only have to run it through the desired section of hair once, and it works. Great. Trust me. GET IT GET IT GET IT!</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever!  Works on curly hair like magic!</li>
    <li> Good brush, but if you have really thick hair, you might notice a difference between this and a more traditional, firm brush. These bristles are pretty flexible. That being said, this works well on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine bought this brush for me because she knew what a hard time I have combing my wet hair.  I mean, I use conditioner in the shower, finger comb my hair with the conditioner in (while in shower).  I even use a big toothed comb in the shower with conditioner still in my hair.  I would then put in a leave in oil from Aquage.  Even with all of these measures, I would still end up with terrible split ends and breakage.  This brush is sooooo awesome!  I still everything above.  However, the amount of time it takes to brush through my wet hair is, well...no time at all.  And obviously, it&#x27;s an amazing brush on dry hair too!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best $9 I&#x27;ve ever spent! Brushing my tangled hair after showering used to be so painful and time consuming (and that&#x27;s saying something, because I&#x27;m not even remotely &amp;#34;tender headed&amp;#34;), but now that I have a wet brush, I no longer dread the brushing process! This product is honestly magical. I wish I had discovered it years ago!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and this brush works great, wet or dry. I have never used a brush that made it so easy. My stepdaughters also love their wet brushes, and their hair is thicker than mine. Love them!</li>
    <li> If your child cries, or hates having their hair combed, GET THIS BRUSH. My twin girls have stopped complaining about getting their hair combed. Happy mom, will order more.</li>
    <li> Great for due tangling wet hair. I keep it in the shower and use it after I condition my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush makes combing out the knots in my daughter&#x27;s wet hair after a bath so much easier.</li>
    <li> This brush works great on wet hair.  I wish I would have found it years ago.  I would highly recommend to any one who needs to brush wet hair so it does not tangle.  The girls have used several times and it is fabulous.  No more brushing tangles for a long time and spraying with detangler hoping it won&#x27;t be tangled to much.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It does everything it says...and then some.</li>
    <li> No one has used this brush!</li>
    <li> I agree with the majority -- this brush detangles my hair very well, with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is curly and gets snarls almost as soon as I&#x27;m done brushing it. This brush is more gentle on her sensitive head than other brushes we&#x27;ve tried and we get through her snarls without tears now that we are using the Wet Brush.</li>
    <li> This brush has very small and thin bristles and glides right through my long curly hair, wet or dry.  My hairstylist recommended this, and sells them at her shop for $12.</li>
    <li> Works well without pulling on your hair.  Feels good and is gentle on your scalp.  Wet or dry hair doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> love love love love love love love. seriously. if you have kids. buy this. if you have hair, buy this. if you have friends who have hair, buy this for them. i completely destroyed my hair chemically and didn&#x27;t think a different kind of brush would help as much as it did. but it did! and i love this brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. idk how they do it but it works great on my hair. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s magic lol</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the brush - however when I brush her hair I think the other brush we have does a more thorough job - quicker.  This brush does not hurt her as much, but takes longer to brush out  - one trade off for the other.  also love that this is less on amazon then in the store at $14 or $16</li>
    <li> My 7 year old got this for Christmas. It works awesome for getting tangles out on the top layer but useless on the hair under and she doesn&#x27;t even have thick hair. I have to use a regular brush to finish her hair.</li>
    <li> great product--quick delivery:))</li>
    <li> It works great and i love it😍😍😍</li>
    <li> My daughters&#x27; curls are INTENSE and after using a normal paddlebrush + products specifically for curly hair, I realized I was slowly losing a battle I could never win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Have you tried *THE* Wet Brush?&amp;#34; I kept hearing this from all sorts of people. I ordered one with a hope and a prayer that it would be just slightly better than a regular paddlebrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. This brush is TONS BETTER AND TOTALLY AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know how it works. I&#x27;m not going to ask questions. I will just continue to bow down to The Wet Brush Gods.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!! Our stylist first used on my daughter&#x27;s curly tangled hair and I was shocked at how well it worked.  She uses it all the time now and no more brushes full of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You feel the bristles and how soft they are and you can&#x27;t believe it does what it does.  I have used on my hair when tangled and I don&#x27;t know how it works but it just does.  Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. Bought for my 5 year old who has fine hair that gets tangled often.  She hates to have her hair brushed especially after bath.  This is the ONLY brush that she does not complain about.  It goes through her hair so nicely with out hurting her.  This brush was recommended by a friend who is a hair dresser.  When I saw the good deal on Amazon I bought it and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
    <li> Our 4 year old granddaughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Awesome and smells great</li>
    <li> I have long hair that tangles very easily, especially when wet.  Brushing my hair after washing it used to be a painstaking, and painful, task -- even if I used a de-tangler. This brush has made the process a non-event, which is a welcome change to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Use in the shower when the conditioner is on my hair, and it gets all the tangles out.  Then it is much easier to style when it is already de-tangled</li>
    <li> I have long thin hair that gets tangled easily and always have to spray detangler or put leave in conditioner in my hair. It takes a long time to brush my hair after i get out of the shower. After using this brush, I am amazed. It detangles my hair painlessly and quickly. There is not a lot of hair remaining in the brush. It is a great product!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a lot of hair and we have trouble with other brushes when it&#x27;s wet and dry.  This wet brush was a life saver because it worked so much better on my daughters hair and the fighting with her was less once we started using this.  My friends who have girls with curly hair and a lot of hair recommended it and I was so grateful!  I will never buy another brush for her again.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for myself in pink, then my son kept using it so we got the blue.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  The absolute best for wet hair. I had one for my daughter &amp; had to get my own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype around this brush.  It is literally like any other soft brush you&#x27;d find in a store.  I don&#x27;t particularly find any difference in detangling or brushing through hair when wet.  You can&#x27;t even use it to dry your hair, so it really isn&#x27;t even as good as a normal brush.</li>
    <li> No tangled hair with this when wet! And I have long hair! I love it</li>
    <li> My daughter brushes her own hair now using her new &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; brush. Her hair is thick and curly. Nightmare combo for tangles. I used to have to wet down her hair with a sprayer every day to comb her out. And I had to put on the TV while I did it so she would be distracted enough not to cry and fight with me. I&#x27;m finally free of the sprayer.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so forgiving on the hair can&#x27;t say enough about this product just great</li>
    <li> I almost never write product reviews (which is ironic as I rely on them heavily when making purchases). After getting this brush I felt compelled. My hair dresser used this brush on me and recommended me getting it. I bought it at the salon (more expensive than Amazon BTW). I loved it so much I bought another so I could have one upstairs and downstairs. When it is warm enough I will buy another for my RV so I can keep one in there. This brush is a wonder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long very course hair that easily tangles (aka goes &amp;#34;Wookie&amp;#34;). I have found up until this point the only way I got anything through it was immediately after a shower while my hair was soaked and had been conditioned. And even then I could only use a pick. My hair is that thick and course. This brush goes through my damp hair like a warm knife through soft butter. I have never owned a brush before that could do that. But as awesome as that is, that is not why I am writing the review. This brush is a sheer wonder when my hair is dry. I have NEVER in my entire 4 decades of life owned a brush that could go through my hair dry. This brush goes through it with no issue. My hair has never been so silky and tangle free. I cannot go on enough about how much I love this brush. If you have Wookie hair like mine...get this brush. Best investment ever.</li>
    <li> works good but not as good as the detangling comb</li>
    <li> I picked one of these up to try since I&#x27;ve read amazing reviews about and it was worth every penny! My hair is to my hips, really thick, and curly and very hard to brush, especially when it&#x27;s wet. I normally have to wait until it&#x27;s completely dry to even attempt to get a brush through my hair but for the first time in years I was able to brush my hair right after I got out of the shower! I would recommend this brush to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> This brush is not the same as one I previously ordered. The material seems cheaper and it doesn&#x27;t fit as naturally in your hand.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic! I have pretty thick, wavy, frizzy hair (for a white girl), and this brush is soft and smoothing,whether I use it wet or dry.</li>
    <li> The BEST brush I have ever owned. I am 45 years old so that should tell you. I have long, fine hair that tangles easy. So I read many reviews on this particular brush. I bought it and tried it for a week. Loved it and bought another just to keep in my purse. I don&#x27;t want to be caught anywhere without it. Thank you for making a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Was expecting this to work much better because I heard so much hype about it. It works just the same as any other brush I&#x27;ve used....even on wet hair I still have to brush so hard!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these.  She is very tender.</li>
    <li> Love what the brush does...but takes awhile for chemical small to go away!!! (left on porch!)</li>
    <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first; she&#x27;s been a Conair loyalist for quite some time. Still, after brushing with this for a few nights, she says it&#x27;s great. I should note that she tends to brush her hair very shortly after showering, so the ability to work with wet hair was a must.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!! It&#x27;s so easy to brush my wet, long hair.</li>
    <li> I heard about this brush from a friend. I have long hair and after washing it, it&#x27;s always tangled. I can untangle my hair easily and quickly now, much better than using a wide-tooth comb.</li>
    <li> My wife says it never hurts to brush her hair, which is thick, long, and curly.  However, now the paint on the handle is peeling and rubbing off on her hand when she holds it.  It doesn&#x27;t change the performance of the brush, but it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved this. Begged for it for a month and won&#x27;t let it go.</li>
    <li> But still hurts my tender headed daughter. At least it&#x27;s better than a comb and seems to be faster, too.</li>
    <li> The wet brush was sent to me not the wet brush pro. The pro is much softer for tangles.  But both are nice in the fact heat doesn&#x27;t really warp the bristles.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my wet hair. Tangles come out very easily. With a regular brush it takes ages to brush my hair when it&#x27;s wet as well as my daughter&#x27;s.great buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great hairbrush for little girls with long hair.  No pulling - gets through tangles.  I wish I had known about it earlier!</li>
    <li> Wish I would have heard of this earlier. Wonderful brush</li>
    <li> hmmm - im not 100% sure i like this brush.  I seem to get a lot of hair on the brush afterwards and I/m not convince that this isn&#x27;t pulling my hair out excessively.  It was bought for my daughter but she would still rather use a tangle teaser</li>
    <li> This brush looks like a thousand others, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. The Wet brush is fantastic. It&#x27;s bristles are so soft and it makes brushing tangles out so much easier. Your hair and scalp will thank you. This brush was 1st recommended to me by a friend, who is a cosmetologist, and saw the tangled mess my daughter&#x27;s hair can be. The Wet brush works great with wet or dry hair and is a favorite at our house for sure.</li>
    <li> I only asked for standard shipping and got the product the next day. Also these hair brushes are amazing.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect! I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with brushing my hair because it&#x27;s so long, thick, and curly. This brush definitely helps.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush! I read the other reviews and was skeptical, but it really does work. My 4 year old daughter used to scream when I brushed her hair. Not anymore! No tugging, pulling, or snagging. It glides through her hair and leaves it soft and silky.</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush is just the best brush there is. I keep buying them, and my daughter keeps snatching them. Every salon I go to uses them for everything from blowouts to extensions. The best!</li>
    <li> Works well.  It does not work as well as my other wet brush, which has smaller balls on the tips of the bristles.  But this is still a good product. can&#x27;t live without a wet brush!</li>
    <li> Works well on my little girls SUPER curly hair.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old has quite long (most of the way to her waist) and moderately thick stick straight hair.  She hates EVERYTHING about getting her hair washed and combed at bathtime (and yet freaks out at the mere suggestion of cutting her hair a bit shorter.  Dang threenagers).  Her hair get quite knotty, especially at the nape of her neck under the top layers of hair.  Desperate to try anything to keep the neighbors from calling DCFS on us due to the every-other-nightly SCREAMING coming from our house, I ordered one of these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on myself before I tried it on her.  My hair is substantially thinner than my daughters, though comparatively just as long.  I don&#x27;t tend to get a lot of knots, but I was encouraged when I used it after a shower.  Seemed to go through my hair very easily, left it thoroughly combed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I tried it on the threenager.  At first, I though that possibly Jesus himself had sent me this brush - it was gliding through her hair with only mild whimpering coming from her.  Sadly, after a few minutes I realized that it was because it WASN&#x27;T ACTUALLY BRUSHING HER HAIR.  The top millimeter of her hair was smooth and knot-free.  The deeper layers of her hair were actually more of a rat&#x27;s nest when we were done, if that&#x27;s possible.  Brush went in the garbage, since it wasn&#x27;t going to work for her and I had no need for another brush for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, might work wonderfully for thinner/finer hair, but if it&#x27;s even slightly thick, don&#x27;t waste your time/money.</li>
    <li> Love, love, lo... Sweeps out the tangles of my wet, washed 18&amp;#34; hair without a struggle or pain for my once broken wrist that will never be the same. I now have three: one for in the shower, one for regular brushing and drying, and one for my travel bag. Chucked my others: the vent brushes, round brushes, paddle brushes, and wide toothed combs.... This one&#x27;s bristles have some play to them and the round ends save the scalp.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best brush ever.  I have long (down to my lower back), straight hair and this is now the only brush I use. It Is also they only one I use on my 2 year old.</li>
    <li> Have had this several months, and can honestly say it&#x27;s the best hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve got incredibly thick, tangle-prone hair, and this just works so smoothly (especially when my hair is wet).  The bristles make for little to no &amp;#34;tearing&amp;#34; through, as other brushes tended to do.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush. My hair gets extremely tangled and this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt and works amazing.</li>
    <li> I have super long hair and I got the brush at a professional supply house. And I love it so much i had to give someone my 2 cents. I HAVE LONG hair and it tuff sometime brushing my hair i bought the as seen on tv it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair it doesn&#x27;t have long enough bristles.... This i brushed my hair after long day fourweeling and was braided and then sleeping in it as is and today i out up what was left of the braid... I was about to brush it with conditioning stuff in I thought ill try this after seeing sowmone on youtube haul it.  ...... best brush I have ever had</li>
    <li> Very Happy with product and seller... Received quickly...  And is exactly what I wanted...  Thanks so much :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have bought 4 and my girls love them.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairbrush you will ever buy. I have 2 year old twins. One of which has an extremely sensitive head. I have long hair past my elbows. Thus brush easily and painlessly gets all tangles out and actually feels like a scalp massage. I&#x27;m ordering a second one immediately.</li>
    <li> I have two of these brushes perfect for any hair type. Definitely works better for wet hair but still is good with dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best hair brush that I have ever used, and I have tried many different brushes.  I loved it so much that I bought it as a Christmas gift for friends and family members.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost six months and all of the bristles are still in tact, which is amazing!  Highly recommend for both long and short hair!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical, but this brush works wonders!! It glides through my colored wet hair just as smoothly as it goes through my seven year old daughters unconditioned hair. Great buy at a decent price!!</li>
    <li> best brush ever. does not rip out hair like other brushes</li>
    <li> Works great on my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s hair! We are both amazed what a difference it is from her old standard brush. She has thick naturally wavy hair. It&#x27;s been a godsend.</li>
    <li> Gave to a neighbor as a thank you for watering my plants while I was away for a weekend. Her two girls LOVE it!  So glad I thought of it. I love mine too,  I think it is only good on wet hair. I use another type once hair is dry.</li>
    <li> Hair brushes have always hurt my head not this one awesome</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my daughter who has very fine hair.  She says that it really is a better brush than the normal brands that we have purchased over the years.</li>
    <li> just buy this already! I feel weird calling a brush &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;,but if you have a birds nest in your hair after conditioning, wearing a scarf, or just waking up in the morning.....this is a savior!</li>
    <li> This product surpassed my expectations.  My friend suggested it to me, and I thought for $9 i might as well try it.  I am blown away by it.  It detangles my hair with very little pain and does not rip my hair out like my other brushes.  I find it works much better in wet hair than dry.  Some reviewers complained that the brush just moved the tangles to the bottom of their hair...  you still need to actually brush your hair.  You will still pull your hair a bit. However, compared to my other brushes it definitely lives up to its name.  I have thick, wavy hair.  I do not know how it works on curly hair, but I have recommended this to all my friends and family members.</li>
    <li> The best brush EVER!  I am a hairstylist and this is my favorite.  It is able to detangle the worst hair.  Very recommended</li>
    <li> Great! Would buy 5 more!</li>
    <li> great product my daughter love it.</li>
    <li> This brush is a dream come true!  I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for more than a year and it was getting to the point where I was going to cut it because I had such a tough time getting the tangles out of my thick hair.  The wet brush eliminated that problem!</li>
    <li> This brush is a winner. My 2 year old daughter&#x27;s complaining is 99% gone since I switched to this brush. The 1% is because toddlers get food in their hair and there is no stopping that kind of occasional owwie. It also works great on my hair. My hair tangles easily because it is long and fine. Great brush.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I was skeptical when reading the reviews, but it really is a great brush for wet hair. Didn&#x27;t know what I was missing!</li>
    <li> Great for detangling hair! This brush just glides through hair. Excellent to use in shower to detangle hair after you put in conditoner.</li>
