### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>She was very happy we found it.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent hand lotion.</li>
      <li>AWESOME product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for maybe five years at the recommendations of my dermatologist and feel it is great for the hands.</li>
      <li>Shipped great &amp; my friend loves it😄</li>
      <li>I wish this product lived up to great reviews I read.  </li>
      <li>I was not expecting the Theraseal to work, so I am really happy.</li>
      <li>It worked great on those areas as well.</li>
      <li>Wife uses this product says its great.</li>
      <li>When I wake up in the morning, my hands feel remarkably softer.</li>
      <li>quick delivery and product is wonderful.</li>
      <li>It has to be the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used by far!</li>
      <li>Definitely better than paying so much more for prescription Tetrix!</li>
      <li>My favorite hand creams remain the Eucerin Intensive Hand Cream and the Aveeno hand cream.</li>
      <li>While TheraSeal is not a \\&quot;cure\\&quot;, for me, it&#x27;s the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product, Theraseal, is pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount of product.</li>
      <li>She constantly washes her hands at work and found that this product is really great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d hoped it would be somewhat waterproof, but it washes off very easily (unless you wait hours before handwahing), and it&#x27;s effects aren&#x27;t very long-lasting even if it isn&#x27;t washed off first.  </li>
      <li>This lotion which I apply  twice in the morning protect my hands from all the elements and my skin problems are clearing up quickly.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or slimmy.</li>
      <li>so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used as a skin protectant, I feel this washes out in water so quickly.  </li>
      <li>He also washes his hands a lot at work and finds this product to be worth the $15.</li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>however I won&#x27;t be buying this product as it&#x27;s DOUBLED in price since I first purchased it</li>
      <li>It lasts for more than one handwashing and afterwards, if needed,  I just apply a small does to maintain crack free hands during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This works really well as a barrier cream.</li>
      <li>I was having some real skin problems on my hands, I swim in a pool a lot and play tennis and bike.  </li>
      <li>I tried this in place of a prescription that I had for my cracked hands and it has worked very well.</li>
      <li>Reasonable priced, would recommend.</li>
      <li>Since I have small children, I wash my hands several times a day and the TheraSeal does a great job of protecting my hands so that my treatment creams can do their job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased TheraSeal multiple times over the past 10 years and feel it is very effective and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>Both work way better at less than 1/2 of the cost of this product.</li>
      <li>Theraseal seems to work better with lighter lactic acid lotions than heavy, oily lotions.  </li>
      <li>Once that dries (maybe 20 minutes total) I can run my hands under water and the water beads up and runs right over them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first couple of times I applied it, I ended up putting the extra on my foreams and elbows.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for the past 2 months and my hands have never been softer or more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;re hands and stays on until you wash it off (as far as I can tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased TheraSeal at the recommendation of my son-in-law, a doctor who must wash hands frequently.  </li>
      <li>A little spendy but worth it.</li>
      <li>I have dry skin normally and this helps me retain moisture.  </li>
      <li>I use it with \\&quot;Eucerin Professional Dry Skin Lotion\\&quot; and a prescription steroid cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent hand lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Wife uses this product says its great.</li>
    <li> My wife has ecezema and this product seals her hands well after showers. It provides a coating. Everyone should try it !!!</li>
    <li> I tried this in place of a prescription that I had for my cracked hands and it has worked very well. I put it on several minutes before getting my hands wet and it stays on after I have had my hands in water for several hours. Reasonable priced, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It has to be the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used by far! I have a auto-immune disorder that causes my skin, specifically my hands,  to crack, peel and split open. While TheraSeal is not a \\&quot;cure\\&quot;, for me, it&#x27;s the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it during the day to put a coating over my hands and seal them, but I also use it at night. I put a somewhat thick coating on my hands and cover it with a pair of cotton gloves before I go to bed. When I wake up in the morning, my hands feel remarkably softer. It lasts for more than one handwashing and afterwards, if needed,  I just apply a small does to maintain crack free hands during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past 2 months and my hands have never been softer or more moisturized.  I have dry skin normally and this helps me retain moisture.  AWESOME product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for maybe five years at the recommendations of my dermatologist and feel it is great for the hands. But what is the reason for the substantial price increases over this period? Perhaps it is lack of competition?</li>
    <li> I wish this product lived up to great reviews I read.  I&#x27;d hoped it would be somewhat waterproof, but it washes off very easily (unless you wait hours before handwahing), and it&#x27;s effects aren&#x27;t very long-lasting even if it isn&#x27;t washed off first.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It was only after I purchased this and tried it did I start to realize that perhaps this is not a true a hand moisturizer at all, but a protectant for hands?  At any rate, used for both uses, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  TheraSeal is not at all moisturizing and 5 seconds after application, I feel the need to go apply another hand cream over it b/c my hands still feel so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used as a skin protectant, I feel this washes out in water so quickly.  I was sorely disappointed in this product and even more upset about the pricing.  My favorite hand creams remain the Eucerin Intensive Hand Cream and the Aveeno hand cream. Both work way better at less than 1/2 of the cost of this product.</li>
    <li> Shipped great &amp; my friend loves it😄</li>
    <li> I purchased TheraSeal at the recommendation of my son-in-law, a doctor who must wash hands frequently.  I use prior to knitting because sometimes the yarn is hard on my hands.  Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> My husband has very dry hands, to the point of cracking. He has tried numerous different products unsuccessfully.  I read about Theraseal in Real Simple magazaine and thought we would give it a try.  After paying twice the price at a pharmacy, I checked on line and found it on Amazon.  The cream works wonders!</li>
    <li> I have moderate, but persistent, psoriasis.  My dermatologist recommended that I use TheraSeal in addition to my treatment creams.  Since I have small children, I wash my hands several times a day and the TheraSeal does a great job of protecting my hands so that my treatment creams can do their job.</li>
    <li> This product, Theraseal, is pretty amazing. My skin is very dry, I have eczema. I apply lotion in the morning, and when it dries a bit I put on the TheraSeal. Once that dries (maybe 20 minutes total) I can run my hands under water and the water beads up and runs right over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy or anything like vaseline. It doesn&#x27;t just rub off if you put your hand in your pocket. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve got nothing on you&#x27;re hands and stays on until you wash it off (as far as I can tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not supposed to wash my hands (doctor instructions), but I find that impractical. I wear nitrile gloves when cleaning, but cannot always wear gloves and must avoid hand sanitizer. So I have a prescription for Tetrix. It works alright with the Cera Ve lotion that comes with it, but it is such a small amount for almost $200 and a prescription. I have also tried \\&quot;gloves in a bottle\\&quot; which does not work as well (it rinses off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using the TheraSeal very long, and it takes time to apply the layers properly, but I&#x27;m seeing an end to my hand eczema soon and a serious $ savings. Theraseal seems to work better with lighter lactic acid lotions than heavy, oily lotions.  I use it with \\&quot;Eucerin Professional Dry Skin Lotion\\&quot; and a prescription steroid cream. I was not expecting the Theraseal to work, so I am really happy.</li>
    <li> Average nothing to write home about. Does not really seal anything. I was looking for something to protect from continuous hand washing.</li>
    <li> My hands need alot of help. I get very dry skin from washing my hands in harsh chemicals. This works really well as a barrier cream. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or slimmy. It lasts about 5 handwashings and then I need to re-apply. Other creams and lotions have to be applied after a couple of handwashings. It also doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount of product. The first couple of times I applied it, I ended up putting the extra on my foreams and elbows. It worked great on those areas as well. I noticed that my nails and cuticles are stronger and healther looking after using this cream for a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased TheraSeal multiple times over the past 10 years and feel it is very effective and non-greasy.  However, this pricing is unreasonable so it only gets 4 stars instead of five.  As a nurse and caregiver to my husband who has had 2 stem cell transplants due to lymphoma, I wash my hands constantly.  I&#x27;m in need of a tube now however I won&#x27;t be buying this product as it&#x27;s DOUBLED in price since I first purchased it and I find this unreasonable.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another product with the same active ingredient Dimethicone 1% to try instead.</li>
    <li> Definitely better than paying so much more for prescription Tetrix!</li>
    <li> quick delivery and product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was having some real skin problems on my hands, I swim in a pool a lot and play tennis and bike.  This lotion which I apply  twice in the morning protect my hands from all the elements and my skin problems are clearing up quickly.</li>
    <li> My mother had used a sample of this product and thought it worked well. She had looked for it at the local stores, but was unable to find it anywhere. So, she stopped by one afternoon and asked if I could look it up on my computer. She was very happy we found it. She constantly washes her hands at work and found that this product is really great. It forms a protective barrier on your skin, so when you wash your hands with soap, the water kinda beads up. I ordered the TheraSeal for her and one for my husband, who has really dry skin. He also washes his hands a lot at work and finds this product to be worth the $15.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dermatologist for a condition my son had and it worked well.  A little spendy but worth it.</li>
    <li> My infant son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product as an extra protective barrier for his cheeks due to a rash. The product seemed to make the rash worse, not better, so I stopped using it on him. I use it on my hands since I bought two bottles of it but I&#x27;m not even a fan of it for hands.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it as foot cream to pervent cracking.  Won&#x27;t be our last order</li>
    <li> Seals in moisture. Protective barrier when washing hands.  I am a nurse that washes my hands multiple times a day and this does not wash off the moisture barrier every time I wash my hands. I was unable to find this in local drug stores.</li>
