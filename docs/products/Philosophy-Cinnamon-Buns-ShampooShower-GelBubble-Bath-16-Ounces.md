      <li>Philosophy has many scents but the Cinnamon Buns is my all-time favorite.</li>

      <li>Its just that it ACTUALLY smells like cinnamon buns, not the best scent for a body wash.</li>
      <li>I just love the scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wife likes it, smells good enough to eat.</li>
    <li> I love this 3 in 1 Cinnamon Buns Philosophy product it&#x27;s great and smells so good. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Omg, the smell is delightful. This and the strawberry Philopsphy three in ones are my favorites of any bath and body products. So convenient as you can these for hair (it&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner) and your body too. My son only uses these Philiosophy Shampoo/Shower products. The cinnamon smell lingers after the shower and smells incredible in your hair. Also, my son has sensitive skin and had bad eczema but, despite the fragrance, these have never irritated his skin. These are always in our shower in at least three scents, Cinnamon Buns, Strawberry (for me) and lately Peppermint Stick. All smell delicious and are so much better than Bath and Body Works bath products, which irritate my skin and allergies.</li>
    <li> Philosophy never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Everything about it is great</li>
    <li> Love this product by Philosophy!!  I love especially love the scent.  How could you not?  Smells just like cinnamon  buns.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious in the shower and leaves you feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> With almost everyone&#x27;s favorite smell being chocolate or cinnamon, I bought some cinnamon products. This shampoo and shower gel is awesome-you must try it! Susan Lauer</li>
    <li> She says it&#x27;s the best stuff she&#x27;s found, says it can be kind of hard to find. As long as she&#x27;s happy! ;)</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products because they are safe for all skin types, especially for people who have allergies.  The Cinnamon Buns scent is my favorite.</li>
    <li> smells good and cleans me.</li>
    <li> I first started using this body wash in college almost ten years ago. I used to buy it as a treat for myself, but now it&#x27;s the only body wash I use. I leave an extra one in my guest bathroom, and people always compliment the scent. I&#x27;ve also given it as a gift to several other women, and they all loved it. Even my boyfriend uses it occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the scent: it is by far the most amazingly scented product I have ever used. Other Philosophy scents just don&#x27;t live up to this one. To me, it really does smell like someone is cooking cinnamon buns in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is sub-par as a bubble bath. My go-to bubble bath is Skin Milk foaming bath, which I buy in a pack of 6.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ET774S SkinMilk Soften Foaming Bath, 22-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it as a shampoo once, and that was disappointing. They really need to be honest and just market it as a body wash alone, rather than a 3-in-1 solution.</li>
    <li> Wonderful but way too pricey</li>
    <li> I got philosophy wash as a gift some years back and could not bear going back to my normal wash. I tried. It&#x27;s great quality. Leaves you soft and smooth, leans well. Worth the price. I would just choose a different scent next time. This was ok, but weakly scented and did not last like others.</li>
    <li> Omg the scent is wonderful and one of my all time favorites.&lt;br /&gt;this soap is so terrific it smells liked yummy baked rolls out of the oven it makes you feel like you could eat the product and the scent is a little lasting and lathers well.</li>
    <li> I usually use this as a shampoo, although it can be used as a shower gell and bubble bath as well. The shampoo is lovely and gentle on my hair and gets it clean, and I enjoy the way it lathers. The fragrance, however, is also a BIG selling point for me. I love the cinnamon buns scent!  This is a winner!</li>
    <li> Love philosophy brand. Cinnamon buns is my favorite scent yummy</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Will order again! Everything met expectations.</li>
    <li> Cinnamon Buns has got to be my favorite shower gel fragrance from Philosophy.  I love the way it smells like fresh cinnamon buns from the oven.  The scent almost makes your mouth water.  Fortunately for some, unfortunately for me, the scent only lasts while in the shower.  You do not smell like a cinnamon bun afterward.  The best value on this product is the 32oz or 64oz that you can get from a certain television shopping channel that starts with a Q.  There is even a recipe for cinnamon buns on the label.  Yummy.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products, and I&#x27;ve bought this scent several times.  I&#x27;m always happy with it.  High quality, pleasing scent, and the bottle lasts for awhile.</li>
    <li> I have used Philosophy products for a number of years. This one is exceptional. Smell is just wonderful! Soaps up with many bubbles and leaves your shower with a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prepared to pay for the Philosophy products because they are high quality and last a long time, but $14.95 for shipping is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for a friend and she was just thrilled with it! I smelled it and Almost didn&#x27;t want to give it away.</li>
    <li> its a mild cinnamon scent, very lovely as a bubble bath</li>
    <li> Is there anyone out there that HASN&#x27;T tried this?  It is their best scent in my opinion.  If you get sick of the flowery scent, try this for a change.  It&#x27;s wonderful way to wake up. The smell doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell like cinnamon all day - just nice and clean and pleasant; the best part of this product is the lovely smell of of cinnamon engulfing your nose while you shower. It&#x27;s like opening the oven while baking fresh cinnamon rolls!  Only negative; the price; try to find the 32 oz bottle if you decide you like it - better value.  You can also order the pump dispenser for any size philosophy here; [...]</li>
    <li> RVERYONE IN FAMILY LOVES THIS SCENT!!!</li>
    <li> The product consistency was thinner than what i have had in the past and the scent was faint. I not sure of the authenticity of the product.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo\wash because I read a book where the main character used it... and the author kept peppering the text with references to how good it smelled. When I tried it for myself, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! You&#x27;ll smell like warm breakfast for at least 1\2 the day. If food smells are your thing, this may be the one to add to your shopping list. Delicious!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a bubble bath and I should have looked at the size, I thought it was larger.  I found this same item in the department store for less than half the price.  Smells good just feel I overpaid for it.</li>
    <li> Philosophy has many scents but the Cinnamon Buns is my all-time favorite. It&#x27;s a wonderful shampoo and can also be used on the body. Your hair feels clean and fresh with a a hint of the cinnamon smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cinnamon buns for at least 15 years and will use nothing but Philosphy products on my skin</li>
    <li> smells great and works great too. great deal for the money. you should try it at least once and i think you will come back for more!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this actually deserves 3 stars. Its just that it ACTUALLY smells like cinnamon buns, not the best scent for a body wash.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for younger brother&#x27;s fiance last year and she loved it.</li>
    <li> This was my first philosophy scent that I was willing to fork over the $$$ for. It lasted so long that it is still a good deal for the price. This scent smells as described like a warmer frostingy version of cinnamon...Lately I&#x27;ve been wanting a more spicy smell and have been thinking of trying some of the other scents, but I still like this one a bunch!</li>
    <li> Loved the smell of shampoo. Great product. Will buy again. Love how it&#x27;s a 3 in 1 product. Works great as a shampoo. Bottle last a long time. You don&#x27;t have to use very much. It&#x27;s real creamy.  The scent is fabulous.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the service, nice shipping, and wonderful smell of this product. It was a decent time to wait for shipping, the price was right, and the product was absolutely wonderful! I am very fond of philosophy brand and this was the same price as you get at Ulta, so I was fond of being able to buy this at a good price without driving anywhere!</li>
    <li> This stuff indeed does smell good. It&#x27;s not that strong a scent: I lather it up and sniff my arms in the shower to get the scent. The scent immediately washes off and doesn&#x27;t linger after showering. I give it 4 stars for a pleasant scent, but 3 stars for the price. It is pricey for the size you get.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shower gel.  It smells good enough to eat.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Ive been a fan for many years now, this one is my favorite! smells delicious! Would recommend :)</li>
    <li> Philosophy products are really awesome. They have sure captured the scent of cinnamon buns with this product. It is for my sister for Christmas. She will love it, smells great, no calories.</li>
    <li> Okay--I love many Philosophy scents, but I have to say that this is now my favorite!  It smells sooooo good when you&#x27;re showering--I just ordered more so I wouldn&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents. I have very sensitive skin and I have no issues with this product.</li>
    <li> This scent is more complex than just cinnamon buns - it has a little warm nuttiness (maybe almond) that perfectly complements the sweet cinnamon. It&#x27;s completely addictive and it&#x27;s a great way to start your day - just lifts your mood!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday. She&#x27;s obsessed with cinnamon buns. She had the greatest face in the world when she opened this up. This stuff smells exactly like cinnamon buns, it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
    <li> I have used many different shower gel&#x27;s and always go back to philosophy.  The smell is sooo delightful and it makes tons of suds with very little product.  Smell goes down the drain so you do not smell like a cinnamon bun, although I would not mind.  Love this shower gel.  Oh yes, great shampoo also..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son and my husband (shhhhh). They love it. It smells like Sunday morning when I have enough time to bake breakfast. It smells like home all cinnamony and warm. The scent does NOT last once you step out of the shower but this is a BONUS when you are a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to leave the house smelling like you smeared cinnamon roll all over yourself.  Co-workers and kids can be seriously mean and are always on the lookout for a new means of attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it as a shower gel. As a shampoo? Well, as a shampoo I would only use it in a pinch because I don&#x27;t like the thought of all of that fragrance (even if it doesn&#x27;t linger) on my scalp and drying out my fragile hair. As a bubble bath? Eh, the suds don&#x27;t last for long and you have to use a lot of this rather pricey stuff to get a good amount of sudsy action going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I love it too but we tire of scents quickly and like scents that stick around a little longer and we are always switching it up. This one I replenish purely for the guys.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, great price and it last forever. Only wish they make more cinnamon fragrances. Nice that you can also use as bubble bath and shampoo.</li>
    <li> The lid of one of my bottles came shattered. I love the product and with the 2 for one package I could have rotated the lids. But Unfortunatly I was planning on using them as gifts and had to go buy a new gift. :( more wasted money. BUT I STILL ADORE THE SCENT OF THE SOAP! Heavenly!</li>
    <li> Great shower gel-yes it does everything &amp; leaves your skin delightful-have used for years-different scents-love this gel!</li>
    <li> I just love the scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they make it smell like the real thing, but it smells like you can eat this stuff! I confess - I tasted it. It tastes like soap :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick and nice, and there&#x27;s a cinnamon buns recipe on the bottle. I liked it so much that I bought 2 other flavors as gifts.</li>
    <li> This product is an awesomely yummy shower and bath that the whole family can love especially for the holidays. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Philossophy has the best Shower gels ever - they last forever beause they suds so much with just a little product.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite bodywash! It makes me smile everytime I use it as it reminds me of....cinnamon buns in my oven!!! YUM!</li>
    <li> great product and best price available.</li>
    <li> --Or end it! This amazing bubble bath smells EXACTLY like what it says it is--I was not at all disappointed!! It&#x27;s one of my favorite bath treats!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel, it smells so good when your showering with it. You feel real clean and refreshed when you finish showering. I plan to buy 2 more bottles, one for me and one for my daughter. If you like the scent of cinnamon, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this shower get.</li>
    <li> This shower gel smells extremely good. I&#x27;ve had other products from Philosophy but this Cinnamon Buns Shampoo is so far, my favorite. I was the first one who used this product and now, my entire family is using this one.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the good smell, it moisturizes your skin, leaving it silky smooth and soft after every wash.</li>
    <li> Out of all the Philosophy products I&#x27;ve tried, this is my favorite.  I use these shampoo/shower gel combos as liquid hand soaps at the bathroom sink, because they don&#x27;t dry my hands out like many other brands of liquid soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  I really like the light fragrance of cinnamon bun, which is very pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I recently received it in the mail and the first time I smelled it, it is delicious! It makes you want to eat it!! Using it in the shower the smell is also strong an lingers even when you are done in the bathroom. The smell however does not say much on your skin. I tried it as a shampoo and it was ok. It&#x27;s a great body wash though but a bit pricey for the size.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If your wife must have the smell of cinnamon buns, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is the smell does not last very long. Once out of the&lt;br /&gt;bath or shower it quickly disappears. Beyond the unique smell&lt;br /&gt;this is no different than any other bath soap or gel - just a&lt;br /&gt;bit more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my wife feel good - so I am happy.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy and although it&#x27;s a good price compared to what I&#x27;ve seen this item for at retail and even discount cosmetic shops.  It&#x27;s nice that this can also be used as a shampoo since I use it on my face so it&#x27;s fine if it gets in my hair.</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS SO DELICIOUS BEFORE AND AFTER A SHOWER!! THIS PRODUCT HAS CHANGED THE WAY I DO BODY WASH FOREVER!!! IT LAST FOR A LONG TIME!</li>
    <li> My husband, son in-law and father in-law love this!  Great gift for a man</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent, it&#x27;s hard to get out of the shower. It lathers so well and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Philosophy fragrances, particularly &#x27;Amazing Grace,&#x27; and &#x27;Pure Grace.&#x27; However, this is my first experience experimenting with the shampoo, gel, bubble bath line. I opted for the &#x27;Cinnamon Bun&#x27; fragrance based on reviewer popularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait for the first shower.  I had high anticipation that I would experience an olfactory delight --- that of walking into a bakery where &#x27;Cinnabon&#x27; rolls were just being removed from the oven.  Was that my experience?  Well, not exactly. Yes, there is a cinnamon fragrance, but it is rather artificial with plasticky undertones.  That said, it was still nice.  But, as soon as the shower was over, the scent in my bathroom and, on my body, dissipated, almost immediately. This has been an ongoing complaint of many Philosophy products, including the fragrances that require frequent reapplication. I&#x27;m not sure why this can&#x27;t be rectified. I have used cheap, grocery store shower gels, that perfumed half my house and I could still smell the scent on my skin the next morning. What gives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although somewhat disappointed with the fragrance, I was pleased with how soft the product left my skin.  I actually forgot to apply body lotion, after the first use, which is always a post shower ritual for me.  I can see this product assisting with winter dry skin issues, so I think I will keep some handy, for that reason, alone. I do think I will try a couple of the other fragrances, too. Oddly, my hubby seemed to like this one more than me, so it&#x27;s not a very feminine fragrance. It&#x27;s one that can be shared with the entire family.</li>
    <li> Smells great in the shower, however it doesn&#x27;t last past that. I put some in a water bottle for wetting my hair when I comb it so I can keep SOME of the smell :P You gotta hand it to Philosphy for having such spot-on scents... just wish they lasted beyond the bath :(</li>
    <li> This product has a doughy smell and the good parts (sugar and cinnamon smells) do not linger.</li>
    <li> Works great as a body wash although the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin long. But didn&#x27;t like it for my hair at all !!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it.</li>
