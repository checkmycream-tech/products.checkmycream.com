      <li>love this soap.  </li>
      <li>I love using this soap.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it disinfects but does not strip your skin.  </li>
      <li>love this.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love the soap</li>
      <li>Hands are clean and the fragrance is nice.</li>
      <li>feel like my hands are very clean after I wash them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>bottle is a good enough size, and you get a good dollop of soap with two pumps of the dispenser.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The soap cleans amazingly well, feels great, has a refreshing scent, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this natural product which does not contain Triclosan.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time buying Cleanwell, and I&#x27;m already in love!</li>
      <li>and I can do a quick sniff check to make sure they&#x27;ve washed.  </li>
      <li>On top of that the foamy soap washes hands quite well and the smell is fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>I have been searching for a foaming hand soap that leaves hands clean and not \\&quot; coated\\&quot; feeling after washing that was triclosan free.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I made that first purchase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not give it 5 stars because it is not enviromental friendly</li>
      <li>clean</li>
      <li>I use it in the kitchen when I am doing food preparation to keep my hands clean when a degreasing soap is not required.</li>
      <li>Has nice foaming action and smell.</li>
      <li>First, although it comes out of the dispenser in a foam that spreads easily over you hands, it just feels like you have bubbly water on your hands.  </li>
      <li>but if so, this product leaves my skin moist which feels Great, in referance to other products I have tried.</li>
      <li>spearmint lime scent is fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>We have only tried the Spearmint/Lime scent and although we love the scent which is much more spearmint than lime, others do not like the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more expensive for a reason, but peace of mind to us is priceless.  </li>
      <li>We dont need antibacterial because we dont want super bacteria growing</li>
      <li>but this one is just so nice and mild...not overwhelming and leaves a nice scent behind....</li>
      <li>This is a nice fairly gentle soap, but the mint/lime scent is so strong that it&#x27;s powerfully present on my hands for a while after I wash them.</li>
      <li>Further, it may work OK when your hands are already clean, but I found that it did not work well if your hands are soiled with dirt, stains, or something that is greasy.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients have natural anti-bacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for people who suffer from any allergies, the ingredients are all listed and are easy to decipher.</li>
      <li>Second, I might still have continued to use the soap when I just needed a light cleaning or disinfecting of my hands, except that the odor is so-ooo strong and persistent (a kind of spicy, peppery, herbal smell) that it is obnoxious and you can&#x27;t smell anything but the smell of the soap for hours!  </li>
      <li>BUT I do like the quality very much.</li>
      <li>The foam pretty much disappears once it hits the water so we don&#x27;t really feel like we&#x27;re getting that soapy, sudsy clean.</li>
      <li>that stay on your hands and this one is pretty neutral.</li>
      <li>Simply put, I love it.</li>
      <li>I really like this soap!  </li>
      <li>( does not come with a refill pouch which would make this product much cheaper) and it is overpriced!</li>
      <li>Once Amazon gets it back for sale, I would love to see it in Subscribe and Save.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a LIQUID soap, which means you better contact shipper and ask for proper protective, otherwise (happened to me..)</li>
      <li>finally found at Amazon and got it delivered right to me!!  </li>
      <li>This did not dry his hands out any further and we love the smells!</li>
      <li>The odor is so persistent that even after using a different kind of soap and using dish washing liquid to try to remove the smell from my hands, it was less strong but persisted.  </li>
      <li>I love the soap because it does not dry out my skin despite frequent hand washing.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is exceptional.</li>
      <li>Good clean, light scent that does not stay with you past a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last few years and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>because really, that&#x27;s what toddlers do.  </li>
      <li>We realized don&#x27;t really need the \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; bottles they sell this in at the stores.  </li>
      <li>it just smells natural and fresh, not chemical-like.  </li>
      <li>I like the scent because it&#x27;s fairly low key compared to soaps from other brands, and it seems to clean very well (removes oil and grease fairly well).</li>
      <li>This product kills more types of germs than any other sanitizer and cleanser out there.  </li>
      <li>(Would love to try the other scents sometime...</li>
      <li>We tend to get dry skin easily around here</li>
      <li>If you use higher quantities of soap it may not be practical nor economical to constantly purchase the dispensers.</li>
      <li>Our daughter has an autoimmune disease and blood disorder (severe aplastic anemia) that requires she be as near to germ free as possible at all times.  </li>
      <li>After reading the other reviews I was pretty excited to try this one, and bought 3 bottles.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this soap for its medicinal properties alone.</li>
      <li>I find most fragrances irritate my nose and eyes, and &amp;#34;fragrance - free&amp;#34; feels like something is missing.  </li>
      <li>but we use it in the kitchen especially after handling raw meat just to be safe around our baby!</li>
      <li>Removing one star because it doesn&#x27;t go very far at all.</li>
      <li>In fact, if you try to put a little more water on your hands as you wash them to produce more lather (as you might do with the typical hand soap), it actually reduces it&#x27;s effectiveness and washes it off your hands.  </li>
      <li>for a short time.. this is not perfume folks, but a disinfectant and a gentle one!</li>
      <li>I use Cleanwell products because they are natural.</li>
      <li>My toddler has sensitive skin prone to eczema and this soap is not harsh on his skin at all.    </li>
      <li>Like it is natural based anti bacterial based.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and we save by buying in bulk</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of an all natural anti-bacterial hand soap, but was disappointed with this one.  First, although it comes out of the dispenser in a foam that spreads easily over you hands, it just feels like you have bubbly water on your hands.  In other words, the soap does not feel slick or slippery like hands soaps usually do and it does not produce more lather as you rub together and wash your hands.  In fact, if you try to put a little more water on your hands as you wash them to produce more lather (as you might do with the typical hand soap), it actually reduces it&#x27;s effectiveness and washes it off your hands.  Further, it may work OK when your hands are already clean, but I found that it did not work well if your hands are soiled with dirt, stains, or something that is greasy.  Second, I might still have continued to use the soap when I just needed a light cleaning or disinfecting of my hands, except that the odor is so-ooo strong and persistent (a kind of spicy, peppery, herbal smell) that it is obnoxious and you can&#x27;t smell anything but the smell of the soap for hours!  The odor is so persistent that even after using a different kind of soap and using dish washing liquid to try to remove the smell from my hands, it was less strong but persisted.  The offending odor didn&#x27;t smell like spearmint, and the lime scent is fairly faint and undetectable after rinsing your hands, so I wonder if it is the active ingredient disinfectant, thymol (thyme oil).  (There is a similar smell with the citrus scented surface disinfectant wipes.)  In the end, unfortunately, the combination of the these two problems makes the product un-usable for me.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001G7PQM8 Cleanwell All-Natural Hand Sanitizer, Pocket Size, 1-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)]][[ASIN:B001G7PQLY Cleanwell Natural Hand Sanitzer, 6-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 3)]]  Our family has used all types of hand sanitizers and cleansers all with ingredients ranging from triclosan to alcohol.  Previous products dried out our skin to the point of itching and sometimes bleeding and the strong alcohol scent gets old quickly.  Our daughter has an autoimmune disease and blood disorder (severe aplastic anemia) that requires she be as near to germ free as possible at all times.  Cleanwell products were developed by a husband and wife team who&#x27;s son also has an autoimmune disease.  Check out their website [...] for a complete bio and list of products.  We have only tried the Spearmint/Lime scent and although we love the scent which is much more spearmint than lime, others do not like the fragrance.  It reminds me of mint toothpaste which I don&#x27;t mind and there are other scents to choose from - it just smells natural and fresh, not chemical-like.  This product kills more types of germs than any other sanitizer and cleanser out there.  It&#x27;s more expensive for a reason, but peace of mind to us is priceless.  We keep the larger bottle in our cars and the smaller ones in our purse, backpack, etc.  We also use the foaming cleanser in the kitchen and bathrooms - particularly handy after handling raw meats and eggs as it kills e-coli and salmonella and a little bit of product goes a long way.  Buy it, try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it disinfects but does not strip your skin.  I use it for all kinds of things and is hard to find... finally found at Amazon and got it delivered right to me!!  Yeah Amazon!!!  (Would love to try the other scents sometime... but this one is just so nice and mild...not overwhelming and leaves a nice scent behind.... for a short time.. this is not perfume folks, but a disinfectant and a gentle one!</li>
    <li> Great for kids.  No mess and I can do a quick sniff check to make sure they&#x27;ve washed.  I&#x27;ve bought a couple packs and plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> We love it just wish it were cheaper. My boyfriend and I removed Triclosan from our homes and he has very dry hands. This did not dry his hands out any further and we love the smells! If only they sold it in the stores where we live. We dont need antibacterial because we dont want super bacteria growing but we use it in the kitchen especially after handling raw meat just to be safe around our baby!</li>
    <li> This is a nice fairly gentle soap, but the mint/lime scent is so strong that it&#x27;s powerfully present on my hands for a while after I wash them.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased CleanWell All Natural Anti-Bacterial Foaming Hand Soap because I somehow, somewhere had read that it killed staph infections (including MRSA), and I suspected that my family had been exposed to staph. I am so glad I made that first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap for its medicinal properties alone. It kills staph. If you have a stubborn staph infection, you should at least give using these CleanWell soaps a try. Honestly, any time I have a cut or infection, I wash immediately with this soap. Though it stings at first, the injury seems to heal faster and with less pain overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like knowing that there is no Triclosan or any other \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; in the soap to kill bacteria. The ingredients have natural anti-bacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for people who suffer from any allergies, the ingredients are all listed and are easy to decipher. They are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient:.....................................Purpose&lt;br /&gt;Thymus Vulgaris Oil (Thymol 0.04%) ........... Antibacterial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice*, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf Extract*, Citrus Aurantifolia Dulcis (Lime) Oil, Copper PCA*, Glycolic Acid*, Hydrolyzed Oats, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Origanum Vulgare Oil, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Decyglucosides Hydroxypropyl Sulfonate, Sodium Methyl 2-Sulfolaurate, Sulfated Castor Oil Methyl Ester, Water&lt;br /&gt;*skin conditioners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a good enough size, and you get a good dollop of soap with two pumps of the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spearmint lime scent is fresh and clean. It&#x27;s my favorite of the four scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my hands are very clean after I wash them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These soaps can be a little pricey, and this scent is usually the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it to wash your face, it can be a bit drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these soaps. The good points far outweigh any bad. I am very happy to have discovered them, and these are all we use in our bathrooms now.</li>
    <li> Ever since the Environmental Working Group mentioned the harmful effects of Triclosan in anti-bacterial products, I&#x27;ve been looking for a foaming anti-bacterial hand soap without it. I was happy to find this natural product which does not contain Triclosan.  According to the label, it kills 99.9% of germs including MRSA, Salmonella, Staph, and E. coli. I only use it in the kitchen. I find it helpful to use after handling raw food while cooking.

    <li> This is my first time buying Cleanwell, and I&#x27;m already in love! I actually like the lime spearmint scent, and it feels clean and less drying than the other natural soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The Cleanwell foaming hand soaps are the best hand soap product on the market. They are non-toxic, triclosan-free, no bleach or harsh chemicals, so very kid-friendly. When my husband was in chemotherapy and immuno-suppressed, I used this on everything (fruit, thick-skinned vegetables like avocados, countertops). The soap cleans amazingly well, feels great, has a refreshing scent, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is exceptional.</li>
    <li> one of the bottles had leaked out everywhere.  i&#x27;d like to be compensated for this please.</li>
    <li> love this.  easy for little ones to use, and no worries about odd chemicals when they over-use... because really, that&#x27;s what toddlers do.  They skip soap entirely or bathe in it.  All is well with this one.</li>
    <li> No triclosan is huge! On top of that the foamy soap washes hands quite well and the smell is fresh and clean.  We tend to get dry skin easily around here but we have never had dry skin using this soap.  My toddler has sensitive skin prone to eczema and this soap is not harsh on his skin at all.    (We use their little hand sanitizer sprays too).</li>
    <li> This soap smells like Listerene mouthwash!!  I had to throw them away.  Did not return because some were leaking on arrival.  Pump was in open position on one of them.  Bottom line - smells awful to me!!</li>
    <li> love this soap.  target no longer sells it, glad to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> The foam pretty much disappears once it hits the water so we don&#x27;t really feel like we&#x27;re getting that soapy, sudsy clean. But, it is a foaming cleanser and it does work so I think it&#x27;s just a preference thing. Works well. Hands are clean and the fragrance is nice.</li>
    <li> - provides antibacterial benefit without triclosan&lt;br /&gt;- smells great like a mojito&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t dry my hands</li>
    <li> Good clean, light scent that does not stay with you past a few minutes. I cannot stand soap scents (Meyer&#x27;s Basil)  that stay on your hands and this one is pretty neutral.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap, but its so hard to find locally.  I love the smell and always get compliments from visitors on it.</li>
    <li> Best soup I&#x27;ve found for daily use</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last few years and it&#x27;s great. No dangerous chemicals and the best smell in soap around. Simply put, I love it.</li>
    <li> This foaming hand wash is a great alternative to antibacterial hand soap.  I trust Cleanwell for my entire family.</li>
    <li> I am a physical therapist and use this soap at work.  I love the spearmint lime scent because it is energizing and uplifting.  I love the soap because it does not dry out my skin despite frequent hand washing.  I only wish that it came in larger sizes.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the fact that there are no chemicals that go in to making it antibacterial!</li>
    <li> I like how this soap foams up and lathers real good.  It cleans without any harsh chemicals.  The scent is just alright.  I prefer the orange scent.  Still the Cleanwell products are great!</li>
    <li> I love the soap but I won&#x27;t keep buying it if I can&#x27;t get the refills.  We go through a lot of soap and I don&#x27;t want to throw away all those bottles!</li>
    <li> I got tired of always having to go to the store, usually when we have just run out of foaming hand soap.  Decided to try this.  I am going to set it on automated shipping now that we have tried it and found it a superior product.  We realized don&#x27;t really need the \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; bottles they sell this in at the stores.  If you do, just save the ones you bought before using this!</li>
    <li> Excellent soap - but....it is increasingly difficult to find the 32oz refill bottles.  I&#x27;ve contacted Cleanwell a few times and have not gotten a clear answer.  All their retailers are out of stock or indefinitely backordered.  If you only use small quantities I highly recommend the 4-pack.  If you use higher quantities of soap it may not be practical nor economical to constantly purchase the dispensers.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Love that they don&#x27;t use alcohol. Removing one star because it doesn&#x27;t go very far at all.</li>
    <li> I like the scent because it&#x27;s fairly low key compared to soaps from other brands, and it seems to clean very well (removes oil and grease fairly well). Its foaming action is a little \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; than other brands.</li>
    <li> I am never sure if these products are doing the job they advertise but if so, this product leaves my skin moist which feels Great, in referance to other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love using this soap.  I find most fragrances irritate my nose and eyes, and &amp;#34;fragrance - free&amp;#34; feels like something is missing.  This soap works well and smells great without irritants.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap!  Has nice foaming action and smell. Like it is natural based anti bacterial based.</li>
    <li> I went to local grocery and smelled the different scents and this is the one I liked best.....but it&#x27;s personal preference. I use Cleanwell products because they are natural. This soap I only use after handling raw meat and regular soap for everything else.</li>
    <li> I really do like this foaming soap as it does not seem to dry out my hands so much as other soaps. I use it in the kitchen when I am doing food preparation to keep my hands clean when a degreasing soap is not required.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a LIQUID soap, which means you better contact shipper and ask for proper protective, otherwise (happened to me..) it can leak all over your package.  It doesn&#x27;t spread esily so you have to use *bigger quantity compared to other soaps*. BUT I do like the quality very much. So if you have the money, go for it..  Some1 else said here that it&#x27;s not good for cleaning, mainly for disinfectioning. I agree, it won&#x27;t *clean* dirty hands more than water alone. Personally I use it in addition, mainly when I need disinfectioning. For that&#x27;s less-frequent use, the price is OK.  Smells good IMO.  Update Aug 2016: In a recent shipment, I noticed they changed the squeeze so it won&#x27;t leak. Good.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a foaming hand soap that leaves hands clean and not \\&quot; coated\\&quot; feeling after washing that was triclosan free. After reading the other reviews I was pretty excited to try this one, and bought 3 bottles. WELL- I am giving them away as I cannot stand the SMELL- it smells like hospital disinfectant, and don&#x27;t try to use this and then eat something, you might really be sick. Very strong odor,  and I would not compare it to anything \\&quot;natural\\&quot;...</li>
    <li> I am alergic to triclosan and other anti bacterials. I have terrible rashes , since I wash my hands tons of times per day I chose this soap.I do not give it 5 stars because it is not enviromental friendly ( does not come with a refill pouch which would make this product much cheaper) and it is overpriced!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this product through Amazon, yet, but I have been buying it directly from Cleanwell for years.  Of late, this scent has been out of stock for some reason.  Probably because it smells so nice!  Once Amazon gets it back for sale, I would love to see it in Subscribe and Save.  I get the Orange scent that way.  Once you start using this product, you will want to order it regularly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap because of it&#x27;s low \\&quot;toxicity\\&quot; score given by SkinDeep.  I doubt I would purchase again because it didn&#x27;t feel sudsy enough and the thyme smell lingered.  It is, however, the only foaming hand soap that I have found that doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff (like parabens....).</li>
    <li> This soap is quite nice.  My only complaint is it goes very quickly.  The scent is lovely and I&#x27;m all for an organic and safe product!!!</li>
