<li> It lasts me everyday for almost 6 months ( u only need a little bit).</li>
<li> Dry chapped lips suck!!!</li>
<li> I use it much less often, maybe half a doz times a day, than I ever did the blistex,</li>
<li> It feels about the equivalent of putting Vaseline on my lips, maybe a little smoother.</li>
<li> Have used this for years because it seems it is the ONLY lip balm that doesn&#x27;t chap my lips worse.</li>
<li> Keeps lips from getting dry without all that shine and extra unneeded artificial junk</li>
<li> Does not keep the lips moist after a few minutes, its gone!</li>
<li> I must admit my lips are addicted.</li>
<li> It leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.  </li>

    <li> This is lip balm at its finest! Keeps lips from getting dry without all that shine and extra unneeded artificial junk some of the other brands provide. My favorite brand at an economical price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lip balms EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> Great scent. Definitely ultra moisturizing</li>
    <li> Dry chapped lips suck!!! So I see this product and think, \\&quot;I no longer have to worry about dry, chapped lips AND I can support the hemp industry?!?!\\&quot;.  The answer is: HELL YEAH!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many chapstick brands and this one lasts the longest. I must admit my lips are addicted. I have let several people try it and they like it as well.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever! This is all I use. It lasts me everyday for almost 6 months ( u only need a little bit). Works great under lip stick, but I prefer to wear alone and wear Vaseline under lip stick instead, it lasts longer.  Great buy especially for the price. Love Hempz! I sware by it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have used this for years because it seems it is the ONLY lip balm that doesn&#x27;t chap my lips worse.</li>
    <li> The best hydrating lip balm!</li>
    <li> Makes my lips very soft but i can taste the petroleum.  It leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.  I wish they would use more of the natural ingredients and less of the toxic petroleum.</li>
    <li> I have notoriously dry skin and lips.  Used blistex balm for about a million years now.  When I developed extremely dry skin on my face and my lips and around my lips were all flaky the woman that does my facials suggested something else.  I bought it, $7/tube, and immediately dropped it and can&#x27;t retrieve it.  I didn&#x27;t want to go back to the blistex and had a tube of this at home.  Started using it.  Love love love it.  I use it much less often, maybe half a doz times a day, than I ever did the blistex, a couple times an hour maybe?  With this my lips feel soft and not dry all the time.  I was buying it local for $7/tube also but found it on Amazon, 2/$11.99.</li>
    <li> I like how this one is actually moisturizing instead of just a film of grease on your lips like Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> lip balm stays on all night and stops dry lips.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Came on time and earlier it was everything I was looking for! This came just in time and more! Amazon is amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I had extremely chapped/cracked lips and used different lipbalm with no luck, just constanlty putting it on everyday and my lips would get worse and needing more lipbalm for my dried lips.. Once I brought hempz it restored my lips greatly, made it smooth again. not only that but I don&#x27;t have to put it on every single time since my lips don&#x27;t get dry much thanks to this product. Sometimes I forget to put lipbalm but I don&#x27;t have to worry since  this product helped my lips retain its moisture so I can use it every other day unlike other lipbalms where my lips got so  dry that I have to use it more than once a day..&lt;br /&gt;I still have 2 Hempz Lipbalm which can last me 2 to 3+ months since I don&#x27;t have to use it often which makes this great .</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used. It doesnt go waxy, its smooth. It soaks in to keep your lips moist so you dont have to use a lot of it.</li>
    <li> Does not keep the lips moist after a few minutes, its gone!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this lip balm would be as awesome as the Hempz Age Defying Herbal Body Moisturizer that I feel in love with, but I think it&#x27;s just so-so. It feels about the equivalent of putting Vaseline on my lips, maybe a little smoother. The moisture lasts pretty well, but I haven&#x27;t seen a lasting improvement in the condition of my lips like I was hoping. I could take it or leave it.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with the labeling and the people at Beauty 4 Us took care of my questions and made everything right.  They are very good to work with.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular lip balm again. I use this for the moisture and then a stickier top coat like (my favorite so far) Bite Agave Lip Mask.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I am allergic to several lip moisturizers out on the market, thankfully not this one!</li>
    <li> would highly recommend this to everyone, I keep one in my purse, one next to my bed and one in my makeup case</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing! Super smooth going on. Has a great taste and stays put. Very good for sensitive lips. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for lip moisturizing.  It was well packaged and arrived promptly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> wow. my winter lips were DYING and then i received this...they literally were back to kissable perfection by the end of the day from using this. I&#x27;m in love with the Hempz line.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I first found this product when grocery shopping a long time ago and was very happy to see that Amazon has it in stock. Gives you great coverage but it not too sticky - wear it to bed every night.</li>
    <li> Smooth, silky, and soothing.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT AND HAS NICE SCENT.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used! I have bought it for family members and they love it! Just an excellent product. Their moistureizer is excellent also,,,&lt;br /&gt;tomas</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used, I wont even try another one!!!!!!!!! Love love love the lemon tone.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Multiple repeat for me</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these!!!</li>
    <li> Just might be my most favorite beauty/personal product.  I use this all day every day.</li>
