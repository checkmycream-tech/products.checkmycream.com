    <li> I like it ,, very fast shipping 🚀</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have acne and scarring. I have been using it on my upper back, shoulders, chest and lightly on my face for a few weeks now and my scars on my back are definitely starting to lighten. It leaves my skin so soft and the oil in it really moisturizes my skin. It smells good too, a mixture of coffee and orange.  Make sure to use this scrub only in the shower since it makes a mess but rinses easily. I use it 2-3x per week and make sure to keep your hair up in a bun since it gets everywhere. ALSO it&#x27;s 14$ on frankbody.com idk why it&#x27;s so expensive here.</li>
    <li> I have been using the original body scrub as well as the pepper mint scrub for 6 months and I absolutely love it. My skin feels and looks amazing. My skin has been much smoother and I have less body blemishes. One of my favorite products! I do find that its cheaper on the site.</li>

    <li> Perfect for skin!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> This scrub definitely works makes my skin feel smoother, but it is a harsh scrub and hard to clean from your tub.  My skin does not like jojoba and I itched after.  My sister bought for me to try!</li>
    <li> Best Scrub EVER!!! Love this all the way around! I add a little of my own avocado oil and scrub away... so amazing. Who would have thought coffee grounds could be so amazing.</li>

    <li> i LOVE frank! I had a bad scar from a big pimple i got not too long ago and usually my scars go away with time, but ive been using frank on it and its almost completely&lt;br /&gt;gone within a couple days! i also have a skin condition on my arm called keratosis paralis. it creates little bumps on my arms and leaves scars, and since ive been using frank on my arms ive noticed the severity of the bumps has cAlmed down and the scarring has also faded. miracle product!</li>
