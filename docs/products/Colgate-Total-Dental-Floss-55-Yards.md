      <li>The floss is great and deserves 5 stars but $10.00 for one 55 yard container is an outrageously high price.  </li>
      <li>I liked Glide in it&#x27;s own way, but it always folds over in certain circumstances.  </li>
      <li>thickness, slides easily between even crammed together teeth, but still gets the gunk out and doesn&#x27;t break - ever.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for really tight teeth</li>
      <li>It does not seem commonly available in the U.S,.</li>
      <li>Guessing they must be discontinuing it, as it&#x27;s becoming pretty pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>To be honest, it took a while for me to get into the habit of flossing regularly.</li>
      <li>WAY better than the crappy Glide stuff, or the old school unwaxed.  </li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t available where I live, so I tried the Oral B Essential Floss instead and now love it more than Colgate&#x27;s floss, also it cost $1.47 for 50m  why pay so much for an inferior product</li>
      <li>and like it more that the other stuff as it can easily slide through your teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple floss but better than just about everthing else</li>
      <li>It tells you how much I like this floss that I paid TOO MUCH!</li>

      <li>I find that this floss slides over my crowns better, so maybe less chance to accidentally pull one off.  </li>
      <li>I have tight spaces between many of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I had a sample of it, I don&#x27;t even remember where it came from, but it was the only floss that would make it between these two particular teeth of mine.  </li>
      <li>: It appears to be mainly for the European and elsewhere market.</li>
      <li>Our dentist gives us little samples of this when we go, and the whole family got hooked.  </li>

    <li> I find it a very good thin dental floss that can go thru all your teeth smoothly without getting stuck. And its also mint flavor. Sara L.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss my husband will use! It glides between tight teeth much easier than other flosses that he has used in the past. I think its a great floss. I like the flavor, and I can floss with ease instead of getting it stuck and having to yank, or pull it through like other flosses I have used.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few dental flosses that is thin enough to go between my teeth. Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Our dentist gives us little samples of this when we go, and the whole family got hooked.  WAY better than the crappy Glide stuff, or the old school unwaxed.  It&#x27;s just the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; thickness, slides easily between even crammed together teeth, but still gets the gunk out and doesn&#x27;t break - ever.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to find in stores around here, so resorted to ordering it from Amazon.  Guessing they must be discontinuing it, as it&#x27;s becoming pretty pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, try it, and buy all you can when you can.  It&#x27;s great stuff!!</li>
    <li> others said they found this at Walmart but it isn&#x27;t available where I live, so I tried the Oral B Essential Floss instead and now love it more than Colgate&#x27;s floss, also it cost $1.47 for 50m  why pay so much for an inferior product</li>
    <li> Fantastic... also, at least where I live, very hard to find in stores, I had to get it here at Amazon.  I had a sample of it, I don&#x27;t even remember where it came from, but it was the only floss that would make it between these two particular teeth of mine.  I liked Glide in it&#x27;s own way, but it always folds over in certain circumstances.  This is basic floss, very thin, and goes places other flosses don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have tight spaces between many of my teeth. Some brands of dental floss just don&#x27;t work for me, even when I buy the waxed variety. The floss winds up breaking or shredding in my teeth, and I&#x27;m left with a bit of floss stuck between my teeth. That means I have to use another piece of dental floss to extract the piece that is stuck. At times I&#x27;ve wound up with two pieces stuck. Thankfully, a couple years ago my hygienist gave me a sample of Colgate dental floss after a checkup. Its smooth and strong and doesn&#x27;t get caught in the spaces between the teeth, no matter how tight the spaces are. Since then I&#x27;ve switched brands and am very well pleased with the performance of this Colgate dental floss.</li>
    <li> I kept getting samples from my dentist and liked it. It gets in between my teeth easier and feels better. It&#x27;s simple floss but better than just about everthing else I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It appears to be mainly for the European and elsewhere market. It does not seem commonly available in the U.S,. and is thus more expensive. I could get it from Amazom though.</li>
    <li> The floss is great and deserves 5 stars but $10.00 for one 55 yard container is an outrageously high price.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> I find that this floss slides over my crowns better, so maybe less chance to accidentally pull one off.  It works better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this floss use it every day.</li>
    <li> Perfect for really tight teeth</li>
    <li> Fine product, but I am an idiot for buying it at this stupid high price.  I found it at Walmart for $2.  I THOUGHT AMAZON HAD BEST PRICES.  This product is so overpriced you are a fool to buy it here.  Yes, I was a fool, fool me once.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with dental gloss, as my teeth are close together, and the floss breaks.  With Colgate Dental Floss, I get a nice smooth glide, with no breakage.  The only problem the product is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I love the floss-but thought it was HIGHLY OVERPRICED! I was desperate because I couldn&#x27;t find it any place else. It tells you how much I like this floss that I paid TOO MUCH!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love mint flavored floss. To be honest, it took a while for me to get into the habit of flossing regularly. Having this floss makes it a lot easier so I look forward to it now. Go figure!</li>
    <li> My favorite dental floss but is not available in stores near me. This floss is very thin and slinky. Not over waxed. Gets in between teeth like it should and doesn&#x27;t shred. You won&#x27;t find a better floss!!</li>
    <li> I tried this floss from the dentist as a sample and like it more that the other stuff as it can easily slide through your teeth. This is probably the only place you will find it.</li>
    <li> I tried it and really found great has my teeth are very close together.  I tried many other products with poor results.</li>
    <li> Unless you tear off about a 2 1/2 foot piece, this floss is difficult to grip. This causes it to slip out of your hands.</li>
