<li> Just what I expected.</li>
<li> this product may not look or smell a little original, horrible, not recommended at all, not even worth the low price I paid for this colony</li>

<li> He will know absolutely no difference!</li>
<li> The plastic that covers the can was violated when he received, I think someone opened the colony in the transfer process, I think someone opened the colony in the transfer process and change the colony oroginal by imitation</li>

<li> even buy.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll waste your money.</li>

<li> It sucks.</li>
<li> Waste of money!!</li>
<li> the package was too small that the item inside were broken</li>
<li> Packaging was weak.</li>
<li> The glass was dirty, like was used, dispenser don&#x27;t come and the smell don&#x27;t have any smell, less than water...</li>
<li> This is a very disappointing impression of Le Male.</li>
<li> i thought it was poorly packaged  scratches all over bottle</li>
<li> I am very disappointed and just wasted $15.</li>
<li> What a disappointment.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go bad with this one</li>
<li> This stuff was really bad</li>
<li> Once again, I am very disappointed and angry!</li>
<li> This a horrible impression.</li>

    <li> Thank&#x27;s for best supply!</li>
    <li> The glass was dirty, like was used, dispenser don&#x27;t come and the smell don&#x27;t have any smell, less than water... A complete fraud</li>
    <li> This is a very disappointing impression of Le Male. It sucks. It smells like a $5 cologne and no where close to the actual Le Male Jean Paul Gaultier. I am very disappointed and just wasted $15. I recommend that you should not buy this impression cologne or any impression cologne or perfume. Save your money and get the real actual colognes. And last but not least, don&#x27;t buy colognes from Amazon. I recommend you should go to Outlets for example, places like Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, A.J. Wright, Burlington Co. Factory and other places. Once again, I am very disappointed and angry!</li>
    <li> Smells just like the paul gaultier. Ordered it to give to my Dad for Christmas. My mom always buys him Paul Gaultier, but i cant afford that. He will know absolutely no difference! win win</li>
    <li> This product continues to stand the test of time and be at a level that has barely been matched. My husband doesn&#x27;t wear it often except for special outings which I appreciate so I can smell it more often when I am with him.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like the original, no good</li>
    <li> esta bien el producto es original bien embalado y es bueno no tengo quejas el precio esta bien la entrega fue rapida</li>
    <li> the cologne smells like 95% to the actual jean paul gualtier .... good quality of perfume i recomend as a gift if for urself get the actual one...(it stays on longer) but for this price u cant beat it</li>
    <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great, but it goes away really fast. Anyways its a very low price. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This stuff was really bad it was a surprise gift for my husband for fathers day and he sprayed it and the smell was gone after 10minutes. It was the most horrible  gift ever</li>
    <li> The cao das off. The la el of the. Perfume das lose. And I hace the feeling that id bit original.</li>
    <li> MAKE NO MISTAKE: THIS IS NOT JEAN PAUL GAULTIER product! It smells like Le Male but it lasts for two minutes. It is watery Toilette that I would not recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> It is so good perfume and smell last long. Good deal for my budget and I love it so much.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE PERFUME. I RECOMEND IT. THE SMELL IS SO NICE.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and brought two bottles gave one away and kept one for myself. It has a very fresh and clean scent. Not overbearing like most men fragrances.</li>

    <li> garbage product, smelled like cheap toilet bowl cleaner.  It was a total rip off</li>
    <li> very good. excellent.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an ok product only one thing with the case, it came to me some demage but i could use it</li>
    <li> very good product I liked a lot the take this into account for future purchases and recommendations to friends and acquaintances</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. You sent it as described, Great product and reasonable price. It&#x27;s all worth it. Thanks very much.</li>
    <li> This is a suttle fragrance, not too strong on my sinuses. It lasts longer on the skin and it can be worn both in winter and summer. The ladies in my office are raving about it so I guess I can&#x27;t complain...</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. Looks like the real deal but I did expect the scent to last longer than it did. For teh price it was fair value.</li>
    <li> I have no comment about this product was ok, no tengo comentarios sobre este producto estuvo ok, gracias por todo, espero no haber causado inconveniente</li>
    <li> Expeceted more &amp;#34; the can it came in looked taky&#x27; and the bottle is kind of weird,I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> todo llego en muy buen estado me encanta ... lo recomiendo 100% la entrega fue en el tiempo estimado tal como lo esperaba no tuve ningún problema gracias</li>
    <li> Buen aroma y duradero! Conforme con el producto, fue un regalo para mi harmano y él quedó muy contenta con este detalle!</li>
    <li> Packaging was weak. The product had shifted in delivery so the can it&#x27;s sent to you in was not sealed and the plastic pieces meant to hold it in place during shipping broke and the top of the sprayer had fallen off as well as the bottle itself banging around inside the can. I had to break the plastic sealing all the way to open and try and reposition the product which was a gift so it kinda made it look like I bought it at a flea mall.</li>
    <li> llego rapido el producto y el perfume es agradable , desde venezuela asi que lo recomiendo 100%&lt;br /&gt;llego rapido el producto y el perfume es agradable , desde venezuela asi que lo recomiendo 100%</li>

    <li> i purchased this cause my girl wanted the women version so i bought this so we could wear them at the same time, i love the bottle and i love the smell, would bye over andover again....</li>
    <li> this product may not look or smell a little original, horrible, not recommended at all, not even worth the low price I paid for this colony</li>

    <li> Timeless scent and my girl friend love it.  I could not pass up on the price it was awesome.  I use this cologne all the time and am about half way done</li>
    <li> I reccommend spending the extra money and buying the real product. it&#x27;s worth spending a little more. The scent lasts  longer and it actually improves as the day wears on.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, very good product, exactly what I was expecting, good price and quality, thanks for your commitment and delivery time. 100% very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. My package arrived earlier than I expected to be. What I didn&#x27;t like is that 1.) the package was too small that the item inside were broken 2.)The Perfume itself is fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only package I&#x27;ve ever received and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even buy.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll waste your money.</li>
    <li> It meats my needs.&lt;br /&gt;It fits my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;The service was very nice to work with.&lt;br /&gt;There is no problem here.</li>
    <li> The title is very misleading. This a horrible impression. The cologne doesn&#x27;t even last as if it was washed out. There is no reminiscent that you even had cologne on. Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume to make a present for my boyfriend and he liked it , still using every day</li>
    <li> i thought it was poorly packaged  scratches all over bottle and when i opened the box it came it the cologne was all over. Never again</li>
    <li> muy buena me fascina esta colonia la recomiendo 100% el olor es super agradable y suave perdura en la ropa hasta despues de lavada</li>
    <li> WHEN TOLD BY A FRIEND OF MINE THE SMELL OF THIS FRAGERANCE WAS UNBELEIVABLE I HAD TO ORDER IT!  GLAD I DID AND HAVE RECEIVED SO MANY COMPLYMENTS (NOT OVER BEARING BUT RIHT THEIR!!</li>
    <li> Great cologne to give as a gift or to keep for yourself. Men enjoy classy gifts that they would not normally for ones self</li>
    <li> muy buena creo que hay que tener dos colonia una muy buena y otra regular para ir a la cama esta es la ideal para la cama</li>
    <li> The plastic that covers the can was violated when he received, I think someone opened the colony in the transfer process, I think someone opened the colony in the transfer process and change the colony oroginal by imitation</li>
    <li> Excelente producto recomendado.. lo recomiendo! funciona excelente y llego a tiempo, excelente envoltura y tal cual lo describio el vendedor</li>
    <li> This product is terrific and its a great price too! I bought it for a gift and it was well received! Can&#x27;t go bad with this one</li>
    <li> es una burda imitacion del original</li>
    <li> nice but the sprayer broke left with 3/4 of the bottle and no way to get it out</li>
    <li> ok todo muy bien con este equipo.. lo ocupe para lo que necesitaba&lt;br /&gt;ok todo muy bien con este equipo.. lo ocupe para lo que necesitaba</li>
