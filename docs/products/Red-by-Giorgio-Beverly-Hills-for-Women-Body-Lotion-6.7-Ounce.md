    <li> I looked at other reviews before buying. I wanted to try something new.  The scent is a little to much for me, but my daughter liked it. I like softer and cleaner smells. If you like a sandalwood/musk in your cologne/lotion, this is a nice choice.</li>

    <li> About twenty years ago, I sampled ten or twelve fragrances in order to find one I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction to.  RED by Giorgio was the winner.  Now I put some on my arms when I go to bed and enjoy that immensely while I&#x27;m reading myself to sleep.</li>

Thank you Amazon.</li>
