    <li> great price for this product, cost more in store, will buy again</li>
    <li> My aunt gave me a jar of this to try.  I love it!  It isn&#x27;t greasy, yet it seems to be healing on my very itchy skin.  My skin is always so soft after using it, so I keep a jar for my body and a tube in my purse for my hands.  So glad I was able to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product, love it ^_^</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cream to use on skin that was newly grafted on my legs.  I wanted the Antimicrobial aspect of the cream.  This product worked very well for me.  It is not all that greasy but does have a mineral oil in its makeup.  If worked in to your skin it will not feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> OK, my grandmother gave me one of her creams...I have been using it as facial and body cream.  It is the best, I brought some to work and the ladies loved it so much they began ordering their own.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have found this cream to be effective on my Psoriasis and recomend others with this problem to give it a try. The stuff I had been using from my doctor did not seem to do any better and costs five times more. Try it and see for yourself, it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
    <li> i hated it, but the person who stole it from me loves it.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product.  I am 70 years old and this cream makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  My only problem was they sent the tube instead of the jar I ordered.  I don&#x27;t understand why they show the jar as available, but ship the tube???? Other than that I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I use it on all skin rashes. They clear up within two days. If I was a baby I would insist that my mother used it on me.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic find! Great for heat rash and yeast rash. Used it for about 3 years now and it always clears up the burning immediately. A must have for people with burning red rashes. I tell everyone about it. No one has ever complained that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> like it  but VERY  disappointed  it was not the Jar I thought I was ordering.  Would order it again if you could guarantee  I  can get the jar and not the tube!</li>
    <li> helped my dry top of foot when used daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 71 and disabled. I rely on this cream to help my skin remain hydrated and smooth without being wet or visable.</li>
    <li> This is the best rash cream so far found in the market.  Highly recommend it to anyone who has tried others and didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I wanted in a round container not in a tube. Other than that, the product itself was satisfying. I guess I just need to make sure what i order.</li>
    <li> I came across this cream  unintentionally, shelved it for a long time.  I have sensitive skin always, so when I had an outbreak of a red itchy rash, I tried everything. Then remembered this, read the label used it, and it worked almost miraculously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be a mainstay in your cabinet. It is in mine.</li>
    <li> A+++++, excellent transaction</li>
    <li> An excellent product!  I&#x27;ve used it before, and the makers have improved the quality!  I recommend this cream for anyone that has trouble with minor dry skin.</li>
