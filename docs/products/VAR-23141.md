      <li>I Love this concealer in corrective yellow!</li>
      <li>I got this hide everything concealer because I had read in a makeup book that yellow is better for hiding spots &amp; imperfections.</li>
      <li>product itself is pretty creamy, and seems to be pretty moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the highest coverage concealer ever, but it is very decent.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used many concealers over the years due to acne, acne scars, and a having naturally reddish skin.</li>
      <li>It was the first time I tried a corrective yellow, and it was a bust.  </li>
      <li>and it conceals them completely.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan of this concelear. Didn&#x27;t feel like it looked right on me (im a fair skinned girl) and that it didn&#x27;t blend nicely.</li>
    <li> It really does cover everything..</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t exceed my expectations. Its a cover all concealer but it didnt cover my dark circles at all. Half and hour later I could see the dark circles again. At least for me did not work.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this concealer! I&#x27;ve used many concealers over the years due to acne, acne scars, and a having naturally reddish skin. I rarely get pimples anymore so I can&#x27;t say how well this works on blemishes. It works wonders on acne scars and red skin. The texture is perfect. It isn&#x27;t runny like many concealers are. It blends in very well with my foundation. It blends in with my skin too. I can wear this and skip foundation all together some days. It isn&#x27;t really yellow once it&#x27;s on. This stuff beats the pants off of more expensive concealers!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend well enough for me to keep using. I was disappointed in this product and don&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Beautiful corrector!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It was a great price and works well.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It does cover redness on acne. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my skin at all and I have been using it consistently</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and I bought this product because I was having something done which I thought would cause bruising.  It caused a tiny bruise on the side of my mouth and this concealer really did the job.  It went on smoothly, stayed on and it was easy to put other products over the top.  I have started to use it every day on the sides of my nose to lessen the shadows there, and under my nose too, and it is great.  It really helps me get an even base for my makeup.  I wish I had bought this before.</li>
    <li> If you dont apply it correctly you will bet yellow spots on your face. With proper blending it works great!</li>
    <li> I Love this concealer in corrective yellow! It is so easy to use with my wet concealer brush or even a finger.&lt;br /&gt;It works over dark under eye circles plus covers any redness perfectly. It is perfect for large areas with red skin or small bright red blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily and it lasts without being noticeable in any way. Works great with my bare minerals, MAC and Lorac beauty routine. -I do not use any other concealer, only this and follow up with powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complexion: Golden Tan. It still blends perfectly and is undetectable!</li>
    <li> It does what it says I use it for me dark circles and it conceals them completely.  I highly recomend this. also try the elf liquid cover everything concealer.</li>
    <li> I like this item, because it&#x27;s easy to bend but not too soft like some concealer can not conceal horrible dark eyes bags.</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday and love it. I have really noticeable dark circles under my eyes and couldnt find anything that would actually cover them. I figured I&#x27;d try this since it was only I think $2. It seemed light at first, but once I set it with my foundation powder, it looked like my regular skin tone.</li>
    <li> Covers nicely, great product! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The best concealer I&#x27;ve ever purchased...and for such an amazing price!!</li>
    <li> ONLY PLACE I CAN FIND THIS ANYMORE! I use it for highlighting</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer, the color is great I do have some cons and pros thought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con- it covers pretty well and pretty creamy to it blends well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- it does tend to sink into fine lines a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good bargain and covers pretty well.</li>
    <li> Great item!  Easy to apply and fixed the problem quickly!</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage a lot smaller than expected but can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
    <li> Good. Just check to make sure its enough for you very very very tiny amount. But for me it was just a try thing. I do like it good coverage (med) yellow so its a warm color on your face under makeup.</li>
    <li> Yet another item I bought to combat gnarly dark circles.  It was the first time I tried a corrective yellow, and it was a bust.  The color just didn&#x27;t work for me...I&#x27;m going to try a salmon or peachy color next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is pretty creamy, and seems to be pretty moisturizing.  But it seems a bit sticky, and did settle into creases.  Might work for someone with drier skin &amp; a different skin tone, but it&#x27;s going in my bin of stuff I&#x27;ll never use.</li>
    <li> I got this hide everything concealer because I had read in a makeup book that yellow is better for hiding spots &amp; imperfections. So here I am today! This was alright I guess, I just had really high hopes and was let down. I was expecting much more from the great reviews and it just fell short. The product is not horrible or anything like that it just did not do much for me!  The seller was great very fast and good pricing.</li>
    <li> I am  so glad to make this purchase.... Elf discontinued it I don&#x27;t know why.... It is a great conceler .. For some people the yello might be scary .... It canclel out the red undertones ready for makeup...</li>
    <li> It lays in the fine lines around my eyes and makes me look tired and old! I look better without it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I had hoped, but for the price it works okay. I use it under my eyes and on the occasional blemish. I didn&#x27;t notice any caking. I apply it after I use a moisturizer in the morning and before I put on my foundation. I think it would go best with beige to olive colored skin. I have an olive skin tone and the color works okay for me. I will probably look elsewhere before purchasing this product again, because I was hoping for something that would cover better.</li>
    <li> Came sooner then expected a few day&#x27;s works well with sponge brudh.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT LOVE IT TY</li>
    <li> need to apply with moisturizer already on</li>
    <li> Somewhat good coverage, buy makes your face white kinda, can&#x27;t wear in summer, and makes your face oily, you don&#x27;t need to use alot, if you do, then you&#x27;ll have a ghost face</li>
    <li> This product covers well works under makeup, I use BB cream.  I have dark circles under my eyes they go away, what a surprise!  I see a much younger me.  Yea!</li>
    <li> I have this in corrective yellow and I find that it works well on my undereye area. My dark circles are pretty bad, but this does a good job of concealing them. It&#x27;s not the highest coverage concealer ever, but it is very decent. I even hit pan on this which doesn&#x27;t happen a lot with all the makeup I own. I like this one.</li>
