      <li>Zinc is good for the skin in general but this product really works on issues with the scalp!</li>
      <li>It probably works as well but after many years of use Zincon and I are old friends.</li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is the fault of AmericaRx, the vendor, but when my latest order arrived it was 6 months old.  </li>

    <li> I have been using Zincon for 20 years or so and is the best product that I have ever found for my dry skin.  I emailed the company and asked for a lower shipping rate since I bought 4 of these 3 packs and received an almost immediate reply with a lower shipping rate.  Great product and great service from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZDog</li>

    <li> Excellent product that is fulfilling with my needs. Excellent Service in shipping my product.</li>
    <li> Through trials of different dandruff shampoos Zincon not only works for me but it smells great as well.  Even the dark tar shampoos stopped working after a while and I hated how my hair smelled after using them.  Its been a month of using Zincon and Im using it every other day and so far this delivers the results I want.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>

    <li> My husband suffered with dry flaky scalp for years. This shampoo took care of it with the first week of using it. Thank  you very much. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product is extremely good and the service from Amazon as well.  I have purchased many items from Amazon and always recieved excellent service. I have used the Zincon shampoo for many years and Amazon is the only place I can now find it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo looks like head and shoulders but works like Nizoral.  Fortunately you can still buy this one, at least on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use it in my head and is so refresh and very confortable in warm days and it smmell well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dandruff shampoo for 30 years and it works for me like NOTHING else out there. For the life of me, I cannot understand why this product is not more available in stores out there.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo and hard to find where we live.  It is nice to find it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo stops my scaling and itchy scalp, when others do not.  I alternate shampoos, using this every other time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it has never let me down.It is one of my go to products that really works.....</li>
    <li> this is the best shampoo for eczema problems through the winter. after 2 washes of my hair the problem is solved.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used for not only dandruff control, but for dry, red, flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I am a 74 year old male and have tried several dandruff shampoo product over the past 30 or more years.  This one seems to work well to control my dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> we ordered two packs of 3.  one of the packs was totally broken and had leaked all around the box</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ZINCON FOR MANY YEARS. CAN NO LONGER GET IT AT WALGREENS. IT STOPS THE ITCHING AND MAKES MY HAIR FEEL FRESH AND CLEAN.</li>
    <li> Product was just as represented and well packaged.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years, but lately it&#x27;s become impossible to find at any store. So when I found it on Amazon I was pleasantly surprised. So I bought several bottles. Great item, fast shipping and much less expensive than what I had paid locally. Thanks Amazon for saving my hard earned dollars.</li>
    <li> Mild medicated shampoo contains zinc. Stops dandruff.  Hard to find in stores. Over the counter, but was prescribed originally by my dermatologist. I&#x27;ve used it for ten years or more. Works great.  Hair looks good.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on the past and have been happy with it.  I can no longer find it in the area, so was quite pleased to find it on line!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the Absolute best for me.  I have severe seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried dozens of dandruff remedies and none but Zincon and Neutrogena containing the same active ingredient of Zincon -- zinc pyrithione.  I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena product when I couldn&#x27;t find Zindon. [Local drugstores have quit carrying it.] It probably works as well but after many years of use Zincon and I are old friends. :)  Dermatologists urge me to rotate dandruff shampoos, because they say using the same product consistently will quit working.  But, since nothing but shampoos with zinc pyrithione work for me I can&#x27;t rotate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different dandruff shampoos work better for different people, partly due to the person&#x27;s biology and partly because the thing we call dandruff can be different problems.  One that works well for one person my do nothing for another, so rating shampoos it something of folly.  You have to try different one and see which work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is the fault of AmericaRx, the vendor, but when my latest order arrived it was 6 months old.  Since the shelf live is only 2 years, a quarter of its useful live has been lost and It&#x27;s likely to expire before I use all three bottles.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo. I use it 3 x a week. I have been using it over 25 years. You can longer buy it in the stores locally and the prices here on amazon are the cheapest I have found! This 3 pack is by far the cheapest way to buy it and last forever. This is the only product than I found to work when I was young! its really works great at eliminating dandruff when used regularly. I have continued to use it all these years. I would not have done so had it not worked! Zinc is good for the skin in general but this product really works on issues with the scalp! You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this purchase!</li>
    <li> Excellent service, good price and fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
