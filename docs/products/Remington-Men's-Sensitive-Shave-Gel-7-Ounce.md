      <li>I used Edge for many, many years</li>
      <li>I like this over foam as I am able to see what I am</li>
      <li>I prefer gels to foam, because they are better lubricants and give me a smoother shave.  </li>
      <li>it is a much better lubricant and gives an easy indicator of what still needs to be shaved.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth, the ideal outcome of a shave.</li>
      <li>I realized I really enjoy a creamy lather in the mornings -</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>

      <li>Very good, hard to find item.</li>
      <li>The aloe component really helps but it being a gel isn&#x27;t as good of an experience as a foam (personal opinion).</li>
      <li>My brother loves it because it is clear and he can see better where he is shaving.</li>
      <li>There is nothing better out there for a man to use if he has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Since I began using this product I no longer cut or nick my face when shaving and rarely do I get any razor burn.</li>
      <li>It is all right.</li>
      <li>--happy to report, I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.  </li>
      <li>Now that I can actually see what I&#x27;m doing, my goatee never looked straighter and more shapely.</li>
      <li>It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find in local stores</li>
      <li>I get a nice shave, but no matter how sparingly I applied the gel to my face in the beginning, it begins to drip down the handle and by the end of my shave</li>
      <li>Bought it because it was a reasonable price/ add on item.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s particularly effective because unlike other gels, IT REMAINS CLEAR, making it a breeze to follow the line of your beard.</li>
      <li>Better than any other shaving cream/ gel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve moved on to Aveeno Active Naturals and am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Very nice gel; you only need a small amount.  </li>
      <li>being clear allows me to see exactly what I am shaving rather than having to guess like I used to.</li>
      <li>but I am glad that this came along and beats it hands down.</li>
      <li>This stuff seems to be really hard to find in stores in my area, so I was glad to find it here!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Should have probably done a little more research.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, but never quite could adjust to the clear gel and lack of lather.  </li>
      <li>Only need to use about a dimes worth.  </li>
      <li>This product helps improve the normal electric shave.</li>
      <li>Incredibly surprised!</li>
      <li>Before purchasing, I thought oh it&#x27;s clear</li>
      <li>Goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is by far the slickest gel I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Or if you are a man who has really sensitive skin, I think you&#x27;d like this too.  </li>
      <li>I squirt the gel into my left hand, wipe it onto my face with my left hand and then pick up the razor in my right hand.</li>
      <li>This is great for all your shaving needs ill guarantee it!</li>
      <li>Recently I decides to try something new</li>
      <li>My husband claims no other product works as well.</li>

<li> I ran out and bought some other gel that foams, and was a bloody wreck.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It can be very thinly applied and still works.</li>
<li> If you, like me, hate that inferior, overly-scented, razor-clogging goop that they sell in the women&#x27;s shaving aisle, give this a try.  </li>
<li> Horrible product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Before purchasing, I thought oh it&#x27;s clear so there must be a trade-off in shaving quality--happy to report, I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.  It is by far the slickest gel I&#x27;ve used.  The razor blade glides like a pair of buttered skis.  Not only is it much superior than the Costco special Gillette edge foam but it&#x27;s transparent! Now that I can actually see what I&#x27;m doing, my goatee never looked straighter and more shapely.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Does not produce any lather. Total waste.</li>
    <li> It is all right. The aloe component really helps but it being a gel isn&#x27;t as good of an experience as a foam (personal opinion). You may wind up using more than you think.</li>
    <li> Very good clear shaving gel for a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but never quite could adjust to the clear gel and lack of lather.  After shaving I would always have spots I missed and would have to go back to touch up.  I realized I really enjoy a creamy lather in the mornings - it is a much better lubricant and gives an easy indicator of what still needs to be shaved.  I&#x27;ve moved on to Aveeno Active Naturals and am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Best shave gel ever. I&#x27;ve tried many products. This one truly lubes your face for a great shave. Haven&#x27;t been able to find in local stores so here I am on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to be really hard to find in stores in my area, so I was glad to find it here!  I&#x27;m a woman who uses this product, and this stuff is great.  If you, like me, hate that inferior, overly-scented, razor-clogging goop that they sell in the women&#x27;s shaving aisle, give this a try.  Or if you are a man who has really sensitive skin, I think you&#x27;d like this too.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth, the ideal outcome of a shave.</li>
    <li> Awesome it smells realy good too</li>
    <li> It is the only shaving product that keeps me from cutting myself.  I ran out and bought some other gel that foams, and was a bloody wreck.  This does not turn into foam.  It is just a gel, but it protects my skin like nothing else I have ever used.  If they ever discontinue it, I&#x27;ll have to stop shaving.</li>
    <li> My favorite shave gel! I had to resort to Amazon since my local stores no longer carry it. This shave gel glides nicely and doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;waxy&#x27; feel afterward like Edge does. Do yourself a favor and try this out.</li>
    <li> I prefer gels to foam, because they are better lubricants and give me a smoother shave.  This one is great, and it has a nice masculine scent that is not overpowering. Just a small dab does my whole face.</li>
    <li> Works well with wettec shaver. Almost as close as actual razor.</li>
    <li> The best lubrication I&#x27;ve ever had for shaving. I used Edge for many, many years but I am glad that this came along and beats it hands down. I have now added it to my &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This gel has made shaving an almost pleasant experience. The razor just glides over your face, eliminating all razor burn. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year and can now only find it online. It&#x27;s the only shave gel I&#x27;ll use. I have a beard and it&#x27;s particularly effective because unlike other gels, IT REMAINS CLEAR, making it a breeze to follow the line of your beard. This is what makes it so good!</li>
    <li> Great product, smoother shave</li>
    <li> Bought it because it was a reasonable price/ add on item.  Incredibly surprised! Better than any other shaving cream/ gel I&#x27;ve used. Found my go to product.</li>
    <li> This is great for all your shaving needs ill guarantee it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shave gel. There is nothing better out there for a man to use if he has sensitive skin. I like to shape my sideburns and this gel being clear allows me to see exactly what I am shaving rather than having to guess like I used to. Since I began using this product I no longer cut or nick my face when shaving and rarely do I get any razor burn. This product is a must have for any man that still likes to shave with a blade.</li>
    <li> I get a good shave with this gel, but it&#x27;s so slippery I can hardly hold onto the razor. I squirt the gel into my left hand, wipe it onto my face with my left hand and then pick up the razor in my right hand. So far, so good. I get a nice shave, but no matter how sparingly I applied the gel to my face in the beginning, it begins to drip down the handle and by the end of my shave the razor is spinning around frictionlessly in my hand.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington&#x27;s Shave Gel and the King of Shave&#x27;s equivalent for many years now. Recently I decides to try something new so I bought some KMF and also the Cremo Shave Cream. My personal experience is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMF &#x3D; Good&lt;br /&gt;Remington/KoS &#x3D; Better&lt;br /&gt;Cremo &#x3D; Best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that all of these provide a quality shave. It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
    <li> Very good, hard to find item.</li>
    <li> Dry shaving in my case, works just as well.</li>
    <li> Provide a smooth clean shave for me. I like this over foam as I am able to see what I am shaving.&lt;br /&gt;And there isn&#x27;t any overpowering scent after washing, great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice gel; you only need a small amount.  Fragrance-free formula makes it much more pleasant to use that other varieties from Gillette, etc.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great value. Only need to use about a dimes worth.  It&#x27;s going to last a LONG LONG time.</li>
    <li> Will never use anything else. Great product.</li>
    <li> My husband claims no other product works as well. After a long lifetime of shaving with disposal blades, for a closer shave, on a heavy beard, he found the electric shave a medical necessity. This product helps improve the normal electric shave.</li>
    <li> My brother loves it because it is clear and he can see better where he is shaving. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good shaving experience, no bumps or burns. Keeps teh skin hyderated and no need for aftershave with this one. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good value.  When used in combination with skin moisturizer and a fresh blade, provides just about a perfect shave - comfortable, quick, no nicks or irritation even when shaving against the grain.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be very thinly applied and still works. That takes some getting use to.</li>
    <li> Should have probably done a little more research. Product does not foam and does not work as well as traditional foam.</li>
    <li> Really good gel helping close and clean shave with masculine smell.</li>
    <li> This shave gel is excelent!! i will buy it again...</li>
