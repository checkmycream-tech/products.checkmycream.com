<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you like metallic, this is the collection for you! I would purchase this again! Looks great on the toes!</li>
    <li> The color comes out great and looks so cute on my nails! I would defiantly recommend this to any one</li>
    <li> Nail polish is extremely thick. When I applied a clear top coat, it streaked the nail polish. After drying the polish still looks thick and goopy.</li>
    <li> I was astonished by this color! It looks identical to a penny and looks great as an accent nail! 1 coat required to be opaque, lovely!!</li>
    <li> Some metallic nail polish is hard to apply and never looks quite right. The Essie Mirror Metallics  go on smoothly and look really pretty when they&#x27;re on. People notice the color. I&#x27;ve had many, many compliments. Be sure to apply a base coat and a couple layers of top coat, as the color is easy to chip - but it&#x27;s not at all hard to touch up or reapply.</li>
    <li> I love this color for my toes!  it look gorgeous. Unfortunately it lasts 2-3 days at most before chipping. Almost, but not quite worth it. It does come off fairly easily with remover though.</li>
    <li> Perfect copper penny color. I really like this shade and i use it as an accent to go with other colors when I paint my finger and toe nails. It&#x27;s really nice. I Love it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shade but chips horribly, the finish is almost mirror like but it chipped with base and top coat both</li>
    <li> This polish looked pretty on line, but in person was more gold with just a hint of copper. I was disappointed. However, it is a pretty color, just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a neat color for cool nail designs! The color does remind me of a penny which is nice. Wear time is about 2-3 days. I would recommend if you like metallic/frosty looking colors!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this color! It was compared to Rose Gold (the color of my engagement ring) so I ordered it for that reason. It&#x27;s slightly more copper colored but still VERY pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most definetly use this for my wedding. Very elegant and classy. Shiny but not over the top.</li>
    <li> Love it! Don&#x27;t know how to articulate the greatness of nail polish.  I&#x27;m happy with every color I&#x27;ve purchased. Essie does it!</li>
    <li> i tried the metallic polish in silver because i wanted the chrome look on my nails. The silver was ok. Penny talk is better. This had great coverage and long lasting. Great to wear to parties.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as copper-colored as all the photos I&#x27;ve seen online but it&#x27;s still a pretty color.  It&#x27;s a much more delicate shade and it&#x27;s very close to the color of Good as Gold.</li>
    <li> Coverage is amazing and dries quickly! Just a little darker than expected. Hints of black, when I thought it would be light and reflective.</li>
    <li> Cost a little more than I usually would pay for nail polish but I had read glowing reviews about Essie and so I bought Penny Talk. Its an AMAZING rose gold color that goes with almost every outfit I wear, lasts for a week without chipping without any base or top coat and dries within minutes. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. I&#x27;m not a fan of the Essie line, just my opinion of all the other color&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried of theirs. They never seem to wear long. It always chips off no matter how great/expensive my top and bottom coat products are I use, they just take almost 2-3 coats and chip off within a few days. OPI to me is the better brand if I had to choose, but I couldn&#x27;t find this metallic color that I was looking for in this brand. I do love the color, but like I said, you have to do 2-3 coats and it chipped too fast. I&#x27;ve had other Essie colors as I mentioned and all just chip within 3ish days. I normally go at least 6 with my other Orly or OPI&#x27;s. I probably wont buy it again unless I really just want to either redo them every few days.</li>
    <li> The absolute perfect color!!!</li>
    <li> Color is AWESOME, looks just like a penny! Goes on really smooth.  Stays on for a little over a week. Comes off easily. Love this color &amp; brand!</li>
    <li> i love this color it looks really nice on. the only thing one really cant help is it chips a bit too fast but hey there are always chip free clear nail polish to use. but i have gotten many complments when i wore this color. its a rich looking color</li>
    <li> The color is amazing. SO pretty &amp; so different.  I have another color that is more glittery &amp; I put that on top, it comes out like a true rose gold. Beautiful !!</li>
    <li> Very wearable color.  Goes with everything.  The color is contemporary but not garish.  I love vampires but don&#x27;t want to look like one.</li>
    <li> Penny talk is a very beautiful color. It really stands out on my skin and brings my fingers to life. It is very smooth and dries rather quickly. This is definitely a real Essie polish.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color!  It is very neutral color that goes with everything!  It went on smooth and had no streaking.  It is very shiny and there is really no need for a top coat. I can not say enough about the company I purchased this from (AVEYOU) they are TERRIFIC. I had this polish stolen out of my mail box (along with some others from another seller) After notifying USPO and police I contacted the company and AVEYOU did not question me at all.  They were VERY nice and sent a replacement out ASAP.  PLEASE be careful who you order from. You will LOVE this polish, I can not stress that enough, a polish that will be your go to color!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color goes with everything.  But it does not stay on well. it chips easly. I have all the colors of mirror shine this is my favorite but is the worst for durability.</li>
    <li> I think this color looks just like rose gold.  One coat is plenty and I don&#x27;t find it chips easily at all.  It&#x27;s a very cool and different color---you don&#x27;t see this one anywhere else.  Now that I am getting into rose gold more, I love using this on all my nails!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  Would recommend this seller to all Amazon shoppers.  Would by this product and from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Essie is one of my favorite brands. Now consider that reading the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The picture looks a bit rose-goldy, but it&#x27;s a bronze, copper-y color. A shiny penny.&lt;br /&gt;- This nail polish chipped within 8 hours of putting it on. (I had two coats, plus Seche Vite top coat on.) And they weren&#x27;t small chips, they were large, quarter to half a nail chips.&lt;br /&gt;- The color is opaque first coat, but that won&#x27;t help you unless you&#x27;re using this polish for accents or designs.&lt;br /&gt;- Fast dry time. Like 60 seconds or less if you don&#x27;t glob it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is that unless you&#x27;re getting this polish for accents or designs, you can find a better one. It chips too easily for the time spent on your nails.</li>
    <li> So surprised with this shade, its a shimmery copper with a great creamy tone to it, it really pops and looks good with whatever your wearing! And it&#x27;s a eye grabber, be prepared to get a lot of compliments when you wear this! Essie, always worth the extra! you get what you pay for , with Essie its top shelf quality.</li>
    <li> I love this color! When I saw it on a nail blog, I had to have it. It&#x27;s very metallic, as it&#x27;s part of a metallic collection from essie last summer. Ladies, if you&#x27;re thinking about this color, get it! :)</li>
    <li> I am in love with the rose gold shade of this color. It is a very shiny and pretty shade.</li>
    <li> I love love love this polish</li>
    <li> Love the color but it chips very easily even with a top coat on. If you don&#x27;t mind repainting frequently, the color is worth it.</li>
    <li> excellent, very happy.</li>
    <li> Not was I was looking for. I wanted it o look like a sheet of metal on my nails and it doesn&#x27;s but it is a very pretty color anyway. Will definately rock it in the summer months as well!</li>
    <li> I had just been trying the Julep maven program and was not impressed with the formula.  Oh how good it felt to put on Essie again!  This is a really great formula.  Only really needed one coat, but did two out of habit.  Penny talk a lovely rose bronze with a great shine and glides on like a dream.  Keep &#x27;em coming Essie!</li>
    <li> When seeking a bronzy gold color, Penny Talk is the way to go. Opaque: one thick coat or two thin coats is all you need; but three is better.  This polish gives professional looking results, no streaks. This polish can be used alone or with a coat of glitter for a magical affect. I love it. If you love polish, don&#x27;t hesitate to add this color to collection.  It looks good on the palest to darkest of complexions. It&#x27;s a fabulous neutral and every day color.</li>
    <li> Typical Essie formula, and a great metallic polish! It&#x27;s the perfect new penny copper color, and just as shiny as a penny. It needs two coats and since it is a metallic it will show nail imperfections - you will need a ridge filing base coat to get the most out of this polish.</li>
    <li> This was too runny for me to get an even application. I am not the most skilled self-nail polisher, so there was probably some user error to that, however I do okay with other nail polishes. This is my first Essie polish so I can&#x27;t speak to how it compares to their other shades, but this shade is definitely runnier and more messy to apply than the OPI shades I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color, but the polish peels off my nails right away. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it longer than a day because it peels off so quickly.</li>
    <li> Its a really pretty metallic color and it dries super fast. However it doesn&#x27;t look too great with my tan skin.</li>
    <li> Although this is a really pretty sort of rose gold color, it goes on terribly.  If you use a base coat the polish doesn&#x27;t want to go on top of it and it becomes very uneven but if you don&#x27;t use a base coat it shows all of the ridges and flaws in you nail.  I bought both penny talk and nothing else metals (the lavender one) and they both have this problem.  It&#x27;s really disappointing because the colors are so pretty.</li>
    <li> Product came exactly as stated, wrapped perfectly for protection and very fast! Love the customer service from this company. Will use again.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, it looked great with my engagement ring, however it is very thin polish and it shows the brush strokes very easily.</li>
    <li> I would recommend mixing it fully about an hour before you paint you nails. It will allow the bubbles to surface and will mix the paint well. If you don&#x27;t mix, the polish will paint streaky and thin. The color is great and I got lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color. Great for stamping designs.</li>
    <li> I love the color it looks great on my nails. I hope to get more colors to purchase soon. thanks</li>
    <li> The color is perfect - received many compliments and matches everything!  Only downside is that it did not stay on very long.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the color it actually is versus the picture shown. I will not send it back because I do not want to deal with it, but I honestly question the authenticity of the product. The actual nail polish seems either really OLD (the color is not how it should be, spotty and discolored) or it is not actually Essie. I have never had issue with Essie products until this bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this color on my nails. It really is the color of a penny. Fun, sophisticated nail polish everyone should have. This compliments a little black dress perfectly.</li>
    <li> This color is just beautiful. It really stands out. And is perfect for nail art, especially stamping (though you do need to work rather quickly because it tends to dry quickly). One coat is good, but I just can&#x27;t break the habit of using two coats. Though do be careful since it does dry rather quickly, you risk smudging the polish if you use too many brushstrokes.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this color. As usual Essie polish goes on smoothly with no streaking. I follow Missjenfabulous. This is one of the colors that she recommended. If you don&#x27;t follow her she has great nail art and makeup tutorials. This polish is the color of a brand new shiny penny!! Beautiful!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but then my friend tried it and it looked so good - I&#x27;m giving it to her for a gift.  But it was so awesome I just ordered another one for me!  And the cost even with shipping was reasonable for an Essie polish.  Essie polish I find to be a good product - better than most other brands on the market.</li>
    <li> I saw this color on the pretty receptionist at my dermatologist.  Color arrived, it was beautiful, and dried quickly.  I love this collection, and would purchase from it again!</li>
    <li> Penny Talk is kind of like a rose/metallic color that depicts the shade of a brand new penny. I am in love with this shade! I purchased this from CVS Drugstore for $8 so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind if you decide you want to pick this color up without having to wait on shipping. I would highly recommend this for any skin tone.</li>
    <li> First, the color is perfection. Definitely a bright &#x27;penny&#x27; tone. Super cute. With that said, I found the color difficult to paint on. Very streaky - could just be me, dunno. I use a foundation and top coat with the nail polish and was very disappointed to see the paint started to chip after 24 hours. Usually an Essie will last me through the week. The metallic option must be thinner.</li>
    <li> I purchased Essie&#x27;s Penny Talk after seeing someone post a picture of it online. It looks sort of silvery-pink in the bottle, but when the polish dries on your nails, it is a gorgeous copper, just like a new penny. I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s perfect for a business setting, as it&#x27;s a subtle neutral color, but I&#x27;d wear it out anywhere and everywhere! Five stars, hands down!</li>
