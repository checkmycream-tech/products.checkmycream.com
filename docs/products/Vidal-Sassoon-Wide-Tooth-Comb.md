      <li>Now he is pooping out rainbows like he&#x27;s some kind of Funke or Nyan or something.  </li>
      <li>A comb is kind of a comb.  </li>
      <li>Good filler to get free shipping.</li>
      <li>This comb works better than the picks I have been using forever.  </li>

      <li>I decided to use it for my children&#x27;s hair, and it works fine for that.  </li>
      <li>However this one is just fine and does well.</li>
      <li>It would probably be fine for someone with shorter or thinner hair.</li>
      <li>Price is super!</li>
      <li>This brush is really some kind of something.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, has anyone seen my dog?</li>
      <li>so I could get free shipping on my order (figured I could always use a comb), but</li>
      <li>This comb is fantastic.</li>
      <li>i just smooth it out with my hands after.  </li>
      <li>it was cheap and does the job.</li>
      <li>This comb is kind of flimsy and the plastic doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Great for a long beard.</li>
      <li>Nice form color, is not heavy, so far so good no problems.</li>
      <li>Bought this as an add on in order to avail for the Super Saving Free Shipping.</li>
      <li>Super cheap, so can&#x27;t complain.</li>
      <li>If you want your hair to go to the right... it can do that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of combs until I found the right one and this one is it.</li>
      <li>I combed my dog&#x27;s lush, fluffy hair with this, he was so excited about it that he learned how to fly across the universe.  </li>
      <li>Like that this one is well balanced and the finish is smooth - no nasty, rough plastic edges.</li>
      <li>I recieved it very fast.</li>
      <li>This is a good quality comb, great for brushing through wet or damp hair (never want to use a regular bristle brush in wet hair).</li>
      <li>Overall, one of the best combs I&#x27;ve used in my in the past 3 decades</li>
      <li>Will buy more in the future .</li>
      <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d think from the picture.</li>
      <li>This is too big for a pocket, and seems to cause static electricity in her hair when I brush it.  </li>
      <li>i just needed it to get my order over a certain amount.</li>
      <li>It works on wet and dry hair, which is great.</li>
      <li>Very versatile.  </li>
      <li>and it works great for thin hair and hair on the side of my head.</li>
      <li>I had my husband order me a comb but wanted more of a wide toothed comb.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.  </li>
      <li>I really like this comb.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>This is a nice quality comb for combing both short and long hair.  </li>
      <li>I liked how small and convenient it is.  </li>
      <li>It moves the hair gently and in a firm manner, while feeling comfortable in my hand</li>
      <li>I was sceptical about it at first, but have now put my picks away and only use this comb.  </li>
      <li>This looked like a nice comb but the tines are unusually sharp and you must be very careful to not injure your scalp.</li>
      <li>I will go back to my other cheap plastic comb, which happens to be a Conair.</li>
      <li>This is a regular large handled comb, it is not wide tooth as advertised.</li>
      <li>The comb is thinner than the ones from main stores such as Target.</li>
      <li>Not worth returning, but we wont be able to use as my daughter&#x27;s hair is long and tangly and really needs a wide tooth comb.</li>
      <li>I have thick, coarse and super straight Asian hair, and I really don&#x27;t have to comb.</li>
      <li>When it gets dry, it&#x27;s as if I have combed it really well.</li>
      <li>The material is of higher quality and seems to produce fewer electrostatic charges than other combs.</li>
      <li>The wide teeth really help to comb through longer hair.</li>
      <li>This is a regular comb nothing special and not wide tooth as the say or at least not as wide as the one I currently have.  </li>

    <li> I use this comb everyday, i&#x27;ve noticed minimal hair shedding since using it over a brush. The price is a plus too! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s expected to do, and despite being stepped on by adults and abused by a toddler it hasn&#x27;t chipped or broken at all.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d think from the picture. Inexpensive, sturdy. The colour is a bit drab, but hey. It&#x27;s a no-frills comb.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality comb, great for brushing through wet or damp hair (never want to use a regular bristle brush in wet hair).</li>
    <li> This comb works better than the picks I have been using forever.  I was sceptical about it at first, but have now put my picks away and only use this comb.  It works on wet and dry hair, which is great.</li>

    <li> Good comb. It&#x27;s much bigger in person. The teeth don&#x27;t scratch your head and make your scalp bleed like other combs I&#x27;ve had before. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of combs until I found the right one and this one is it. I&#x27;m a balding male in my 40&#x27;s and it works great for thin hair and hair on the side of my head. It moves the hair gently and in a firm manner, while feeling comfortable in my hand and it looks like a stylish comb that you&#x27;d find in a Beverly Hills salon. My ex-wife didn&#x27;t like the comb, but she&#x27;s a stupid, cat hoarding butch so her opinion on this comb doesn&#x27;t matter.

    <li> A very nice comb .  Definitely recommend it to others. Will buy more in the future . It is perfect for detangling wet hair.</li>
    <li> A comb is kind of a comb.  Like that this one is well balanced and the finish is smooth - no nasty, rough plastic edges.</li>
    <li> It is easy to carry in my purse.  I liked how small and convenient it is.  I would recommend to anyone because it is convenient.</li>
    <li> This come was an add on item that I decided on at the last minute. Great choice for girls with longer hair. The wide teeth really help to comb through longer hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wide tooth comb, and it works.  It isn&#x27;t the best comb I&#x27;ve had, but it is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I had my husband order me a comb but wanted more of a wide toothed comb. However this one is just fine and does well.</li>
    <li> I really like this comb. I recieved it very fast. Can&#x27;t wait to used it. I would recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> I needed a good comb to replace my Sam Goody one but this was a bit too flimsy for my thicker hair type...bends a little too much when I am combing wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is a regular large handled comb, it is not wide tooth as advertised. Not worth returning, but we wont be able to use as my daughter&#x27;s hair is long and tangly and really needs a wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> I combed my dog&#x27;s lush, fluffy hair with this, he was so excited about it that he learned how to fly across the universe.  Now he is pooping out rainbows like he&#x27;s some kind of Funke or Nyan or something.  I don&#x27;t know, man.  This brush is really some kind of something.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, has anyone seen my dog?</li>
    <li> this is a nice comb to relieve tangles after showering!  i love the ease and comfort of this comb! Sweet!</li>
    <li> It brushes your hair.  It works in any direction.  If you want your hair to go to the right... it can do that.  If you want it to go to the left... it can do that too.  Very versatile.  It has a handle to hold while combing your hair.  Very convenient.  It has teeth to move your hair...  Nice addition.  Good filler to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> gets the job done, plain and simple. i just needed it to get my order over a certain amount. thanks.</li>
    <li> The comb is thinner than the ones from main stores such as Target. I think this is a knock off.</li>
    <li> I prefer a comb this shape and size and find it difficult to find.  It works well for my waist length hair and I am happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> This comb is usable but it&#x27;s not as sturdy as I&#x27;d like. I have long hair that tangles after washing. I need a sturdy comb to brush out the tangles but this comb bends slightly when I use it. It would probably be fine for someone with shorter or thinner hair.</li>
    <li> Great for a long beard.</li>
    <li> This is a well made comb that has rounded edges that feel nice on your scalp. The material is of higher quality and seems to produce fewer electrostatic charges than other combs. All teeth are intact after years of usage.</li>
    <li> great detangling comb</li>
    <li> This comb is kind of flimsy and the plastic doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  I decided to use it for my children&#x27;s hair, and it works fine for that.  Definitely not recommended for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t combed for over a decade. I have thick, coarse and super straight Asian hair, and I really don&#x27;t have to comb. When it gets dry, it&#x27;s as if I have combed it really well. And most of the time, I put on gel or wax so combing is really not necessary. Bought this as an add on in order to avail for the Super Saving Free Shipping. Forgot how good it feels to be combed. lol. Just like someone is massaging your head/scalp... Great quality too!</li>
    <li> I got this to take in when I drop my daughter off at pre school.  I haven&#x27;t used a comb...ever.  This is too big for a pocket, and seems to cause static electricity in her hair when I brush it.  i just smooth it out with my hands after.  Super cheap, so can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Nice form color, is not heavy, so far so good no problems. I have not used it much but is good quality</li>
    <li> This is a regular comb nothing special and not wide tooth as the say or at least not as wide as the one I currently have.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality comb for combing both short and long hair.  The comb is easy to grip and the shape of the teeth is great for making parts.</li>
    <li> This comb is fantastic. I have long hair and needed a heavy duty comb to get thru it when showering. Gets the tangles out without pulling all the hair along with it..Price is super!</li>
    <li> I got this comb so I could get free shipping on my order (figured I could always use a comb), but I should have found something else. The plastic is not smooth at the ends, so it scratches my neck and ears whenever it makes contact. Combing hair is painful enough as it is, so I don&#x27;t plan on using this comb again (I used it once). I will go back to my other cheap plastic comb, which happens to be a Conair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb it was cheap and does the job. I use it to get tangles out. Three more words required.</li>
