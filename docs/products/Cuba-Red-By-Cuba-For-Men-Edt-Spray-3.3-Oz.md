      <li>I love all the Cuba colognes.</li>
      <li>Fidel Castro would love this product</li>
      <li>I have most of them.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the smell of this cologne.</li>
      <li>I think it is very nice too, very manly.</li>
      <li>My son was very pleased with &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; since it was his first time using it.</li>
      <li>I can easily see wearing this every day, if I weren&#x27;t always wearing CIGAR.</li>
      <li>This could be an everyday Cologne for me,, smells great and for the price, its all good..</li>
      <li>not really a bad cologne.wouldnt recommend it in the summer time.its more of a winter cologne.</li>
      <li>Packaging is very cool and unique as well</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the smell, especial in the fall.</li>
      <li>This brand has a few more versions and they all are an extraordinary great buy for the price.</li>
      <li>I bought blue too, and like red the best</li>
      <li>I have purchased three of the Cuba colognes, and though Red has a nice manly aroma to it, it doesn&#x27;t last for more then an  hour or two at most.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Orange, by far has been my favorite.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice score for people only looking to pay $5 to $10.</li>
      <li>smell fresh and nice for a daily work day</li>
      <li>This did arrive in the mail pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Both are wonderful fragrances for less though I prefer the latter a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price.</li>
      <li>always have at Least 3 Cuba styles Colognes on my list as I think they all smell great..</li>
      <li>The odiferous scent is extremely pleasing and refreshing, plus it&#x27;s not to over powering, I own eight of the many different Cuba varieties offered and will be purchasing the others in the future.</li>
      <li>Fragrance\\&quot; kick in hopes of finding some inexpensive but good enough to wear on a daily basis without offending others.</li>
      <li>Cheap enough to try without having smelled it before.  </li>
      <li>Something about that spicy peppery type smell that I love.</li>
      <li>The item came in very quckley.</li>
      <li>My husband has several and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Really nice smell,but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to retail stores.</li>
      <li>Clean scent, and seems to last much longer then the Red.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try some new fragrances</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re familiar with Burberry&#x27;s London, you&#x27;re going to recognize RED right away because it&#x27;s pretty close to identical outside of a few notes.</li>
      <li>Smells terrific.was doing laundry and still smelled it on 4 day old shirt.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s intense after spraying but softens on the dry down.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My personal opinion it has to much alcohol there for it doesn&#x27;t las all day on me like the smaller version 1.7 Oz.</li>
      <li>Mild but masculine cologne that smells like a fresh, expensive, Havana cigar wrapper.  </li>
      <li>RED isn&#x27;t as shameless a \\&quot;smell-alike\\&quot; as some of the old school flea market fragrances</li>
      <li>This is one-dimensional, with a slightly sweet tobacco note and not as thick or boozy as London.</li>

    <li> wonderful and excitingly bright cologne.  This brand has a few more versions and they all are an extraordinary great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells like a water downed peppermint version of London Burberry.  I really enjoy the smell, especial in the fall. This is spicy, but not off putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Last only 1-3 hrs</li>
    <li> Not a great fragrance</li>
    <li> Nice Item.well recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific.was doing laundry and still smelled it on 4 day old shirt. Definitely worth the purchase. I bought blue too, and like red the best</li>
    <li> Good Price. The item came in very quckley.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand and scent for several years.  Different color &amp;#34;cigar bands&amp;#34; represent different fragrances.  I have tried all of them, but I prefer &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;.  I am so glad to find them at Amazon.com in this size at a good price.</li>

I personally like all of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased. The price is very reasonable and so is the quantity for that price. Packaging is very cool and unique as well and it&#x27;s compliments my perfumery/cologne display collection.</li>
    <li> this cologne makes me smell like a Cuban dictator that smoke 30 cigars a day. Fidel Castro would love this product</li>
    <li> I love everything Cuba Makes!</li>
    <li> smell fresh and nice for a daily work day</li>
    <li> I think this cologne smells great and never hurts your wallet. The smell is like a cigar but with a sharp citrus kick to it.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the bargain hunters out there.  Cheap enough to try without having smelled it before.  I have went through a spell where I bought 7 different colognes.  This is one of my favorites and I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Cuba red is simply awesome for the money!I will buy this again,and look forward to trying more from Cuba!!Try it,you will like it!</li>
    <li> I love all the Cuba colognes. You just can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality scents you get! I have most of them.</li>

    <li> I like the pleasant scent this has</li>
    <li> Amazing Product, my dad&#x27;s loves wearing it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try some new fragrances and I was on a \\&quot;Drug Store Fragrance\\&quot; kick in hopes of finding some inexpensive but good enough to wear on a daily basis without offending others. I purchased this and CIGAR BY REMY LaTOUR. Both are wonderful fragrances for less though I prefer the latter a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with Burberry&#x27;s London, you&#x27;re going to recognize RED right away because it&#x27;s pretty close to identical outside of a few notes. This is one-dimensional, with a slightly sweet tobacco note and not as thick or boozy as London. RED isn&#x27;t as shameless a \\&quot;smell-alike\\&quot; as some of the old school flea market fragrances but it&#x27;s a smell-alike nonetheless. One or two small sprays will be all you need. It&#x27;s intense after spraying but softens on the dry down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice score for people only looking to pay $5 to $10.
