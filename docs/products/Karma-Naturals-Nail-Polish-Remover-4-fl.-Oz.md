      <li>I absolutely love this remover.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>and I love that it is not toxic.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this polish remover.</li>
      <li>My favorite nail polish remover.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>LOVE this nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>After researching many many removers, I came across this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff works better than the chemical stuff.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a non-toxic nail polish remover to replace my very toxic one, and I&#x27;m happy I found this one.</li>
      <li>Love this product .</li>
      <li>It is definitely the best nail polish remover that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Wash your hands if you&#x27;re going to apply more polish afterwards, so it will adhere, since it&#x27;s an oily product</li>
      <li>This works better than the toxic stuff.  </li>
      <li>I tried two brands and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Nowadays everything has harmful chemicals and this is a safe, effective and child friendly alternative.</li>
      <li>It has amazing reviews here, and they were true.</li>
      <li>It removed my glittery polish very quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>It might not do a great job as the acetone based removers but my nails are not dry.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Worked: screen is free of nail polish and is also undamaged.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and iS odorless.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The cover isn&#x27;t to secure either so</li>
      <li>and I feel comfortable using it on my toddler.  </li>
      <li>The smell is much more pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails.</li>
      <li>Yes, you have to rub quite a bit more than with normal nail polish remover but two huge factors will keep me purchasing this product: the smell of this product does not kill my nose and head and it leaves my nails feeling HEALTHY after I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>It works quickly and you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time in order for it to be effective.</li>
      <li>Leaves nails healthy while gently getting rid of the polish!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
      <li>Yes, you do need to do a bit more rubbing than acetone removers, but there is no odour, and it has a nice, sheer oily consistency that makes rubbing easier.</li>
      <li>it felt soft on my skin, like a moisturizer, which is nice</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love it.  </li>
      <li>It has no harsh smell and leaves my fingers and toes feeling fresh and nice with the vitamin E oil in it.</li>
      <li>It removes the nail polish really well and easy.</li>
      <li>It is definitely overall amazing.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but worth knowing it is not as harmful.</li>
      <li>Solvents are solvents, natural or not, so I&#x27;m sure this product isn&#x27;t harmless.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for an effective, natural nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll notice that when removing nail polish with this prodcut, a bit of it will smudge on your fingers surrounding the nail, but just wash your hands afterward (as you should anyway after using nail polish remover) and it will come right off.</li>
      <li>When I saw a review of this on YouTube, I ordered it right</li>
      <li>I will continue to look for a good alternative to conventional polish remover.</li>
      <li>Works very well and no bad scent ,i use it at a nursing  home.</li>
      <li>It has almost no smell (you maybe can detect a hint of a smell if you put your nose right up to the bottle and really huff, but if you don&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t smell a thing!)</li>
      <li>Worked really well, quickly and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>There is no offensive smell, no chemicals, and I&#x27;m completely comfortable using this product around my 5 month old, and it conditions your nails!</li>
      <li>Very gentle alternative to acetone.</li>
      <li>The smell is much better than regular polish removers but it takes a lot of product to remove the polish.  </li>
      <li>so this product doesn&#x27;t work exactly like others</li>
      <li>Just hold it on the nail for 5-10 seconds to let it loosen up your polish first</li>
      <li>Really works and none of the chemical smell!</li>
      <li>I was actually able to use it again a couple of days later.  </li>
      <li>It works WAY better than traditional removers and has NO smell!</li>
      <li>that very minute!</li>
      <li>each nail with a pad soaked in the nail polish remover first.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this nail polish remover because I wanted something that did not have alcohol or acetone in it. Nowadays everything has harmful chemicals and this is a safe, effective and child friendly alternative.</li>
    <li> Works great with no smell or harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> the best nail polish remover i ever used</li>
    <li> It is a good nailpolish remover. It might not do a great job as the acetone based removers but my nails are not dry. My finger tips do not look wrinkly the way they used to when I used the nail polish removers from the drugstore.  It removes all the nailpolish , but you have wipe it off with another cloth to take off the residue.</li>
    <li> This stuff BARELY takes he nail polish off and it smells funky and it&#x27;s just pretty crappy</li>
    <li> Great. Works well, although you have to apply it to all nails, then go back and rub it off. There is no smell. I threw a cotton ball soaked with regular nail polish remover in my trash can, and it ate a hole through the bottom. Sooo, yeah. Spend the extra money and get something that doesn&#x27;t eat plastic.</li>
    <li> I like any product trying to do the natural thing so I will always give a product 3 stars for the effort.  I will say that this product is pretty odorless...just faintest odor but not offensive like regular polish remover.  The issue I have is that, unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.  I had to rub for awhile to get my (also natural) nail polish off &amp; it just got frustrating - it felt soft on my skin, like a moisturizer, which is nice but I want a polish remover too.  So overall, I&#x27;m sad to say I can&#x27;t really recommend.  I will continue to look for a good alternative to conventional polish remover.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Leaves nails healthy while gently getting rid of the polish!</li>
    <li> This nail polish works great.  Better than having to use all those bad chemicals and it does the job.  A bit pricey, but worth knowing it is not as harmful.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other nail polish remover i have ever used!</li>
    <li> My favorite nail polish remover.  Goes on smooth and iS odorless.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how well this worked.  I was a little hesitant thinking it would not work well...I was wrong.  There is absolutely no odor and I feel comfortable using it on my toddler.  I use it as well.  I dab some on my fingers and then go back to wipe off.  It take a little elbow grease, but not much if you place it on and let it sit for a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I have severe migraine disease, but I&#x27;m also a bit of a glamazon and love to wear nail polish and I have a LOT of it.  It seems you can get 3-free, 4-free, and even 5-free nail polish and base/top coats, but still have a hard time finding removers that aren&#x27;t toxic and have horrible fumes.  I was starting to have such a bad time with acetone that I would let polish just sit on my nails for weeks at a time, looking terrible, because I couldn&#x27;t bear the smell of acetone with migraines.  When I saw a review of this on YouTube, I ordered it right that very minute! I have to say, it&#x27;s every bit as good as the review stated.  It has almost no smell (you maybe can detect a hint of a smell if you put your nose right up to the bottle and really huff, but if you don&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t smell a thing!) and it really removes polish like gangbusters. Just hold it on the nail for 5-10 seconds to let it loosen up your polish first and then you may have to rub a few seconds longer than with acetone.  Because it&#x27;s soybean oil based, instead of sapping every bit of moisture from your cuticles and nails, which leads to peeling, splits, and breaking, you are actually conditioning that area as you remove your polish.  Wash your hands if you&#x27;re going to apply more polish afterwards, so it will adhere, since it&#x27;s an oily product (I always washed with acetone, anyway, because ewwww).  I will NEVER be without this stuff.  I am going to get the lavender to use during headache free times!  :)</li>
    <li> Bottle came and was leaking slightly.  I didn&#x27;t bother to complain.  The smell is much better than regular polish removers but it takes a lot of product to remove the polish.  Since it is much healthier I guess it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product and would buy it again.  Works well, does not leave nail too dry, very little smell.</li>
    <li> does not work well. takes forever to remove nail polish.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my natural Piggy Paint nail polish. Bummed out.</li>
    <li> This is an oily mess. It couldn&#x27;t take off ORGANIC nail polish. The cover isn&#x27;t to secure either so watch out it doesn&#x27;t spill everywhere.</li>
    <li> It works amazingly well and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible!  I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this remover! I bought the unscented one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just recently switched to natural nail polish and removed products, as I was concerned with the chemicals used in the conventional forms since becoming pregnant. After researching many many removers, I came across this product. It has amazing reviews here, and they were true. Yes, you do need to do a bit more rubbing than acetone removers, but there is no odour, and it has a nice, sheer oily consistency that makes rubbing easier. It took off my Essie polish no problem. I would assume then that it would remove natural nail polishes, like Zoya, with no problem as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a bit smaller than I was hoping for, but you really don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to get polish off. I am very happy with this product, and would repurchase when I run out. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for an effective, natural nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This works better than the toxic stuff.  I tried two brands and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Wow, so I took a chance with this product.  I had tried natural nail polish removers in the past and they were horrible- stank, dried out nails, and involved tons of scrubbing the polish off, and they were expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is incredible-- totally worth the cost, and phenomenal experience.  Granted, I was only removing clear polish (though will definitely update if using it on colored polish doesn&#x27;t go well), but it was easy and really left my nails in fantastic condition.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen with a nail polish remover.  It almost made me want to swoosh the remover on my fingernails with no polish on them just to get the conditioning action!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I haven&#x27;t had a ton of experience with this product yet, because I recently bought it, I can say that the price is definitely justified to get a nail polish remover that actually works great, way better than conventional ones, conditions the nail, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad!  Great for anyone wanting to use clean, healthy beauty products.</li>
    <li> Love this product . It doesn&#x27;t smell and I can use it on my three year old. You have to work a little harder and it takes a little longer to remove the polish then regular acetone but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Very gentle alternative to acetone. No scent. My only complaints are that bottle appeared under filled and left behind staining that I had to remove with acetone anyway. Otherwise, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Why anyone would by any other nail polish remover after trying this is beyond me. It works WAY better than traditional removers and has NO smell! What an awesome product!</li>
    <li> i love it!!! thank you so much for this organic product. Because i am pregnant and i am so happy with this!! ;)  its definitely unscented, remove very quickly and vitamin E cares my nail.. so its perfect! i recommend to everyone...</li>
    <li> One of the gentlest polish removers! This is the second time I&#x27;m purchasing this product and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Does not smell, gentle. Would give it 5 stars if the polish came off easier</li>
    <li> This product works very well and I love that it is not toxic. I will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. It fully removes nail polish while sparing you the terrible smell and drying effects of a standard drugstore remover. A little goes a long way - so, it&#x27;s fully worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this nail polish remover. It works well. No fumes or weird smells. I&#x27;ll buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just a tip for making the process quicker and easier for any nail polish remover:&lt;br /&gt;Wipe each nail with a pad soaked in the nail polish remover first. Then start working on each nail individually. It allows the nail polish remover to start working without you having to spend extra time rubbing each nail. Often my second hand only takes a single wipe to get most of the nail polish off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this remover. It has no harsh smell and leaves my fingers and toes feeling fresh and nice with the vitamin E oil in it. Doesn&#x27;t take too much time to wipe away polish. It is definitely overall amazing. A bit pricey but aren&#x27;t all healthy products? Awesome!! :)</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover is great! It doesn&#x27;t stink up the room with a chemically smell.  It took off all my red nail polish with one try. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this polish remover. Works so well and leaves my nails/nail beds feeling great. There&#x27;s a bit of a scent but it&#x27;s very subtle and pleasant. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve used it on all sorts of polish and it&#x27;s held up to each one!</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Little odor, did the job removing my natural nail polish, left my nails and cuticles feeling more nourished than dried out like most removers. Takes a little extra rubbing but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works so well, as well as what I remember using when I used nail polish 10 years ago. It doesn&#x27;t burn any open wounds, and feels so soothing to the nails! The smell of the unscented is... interesting; very mild but not easily described. I&#x27;d prefer it over commercial nail polish remover any day, but I purchased the lavender and may be giving the unscented to my cousin with super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was sad to hear when my previous favorite nail polish remover was no longer being made (this was by another brand), so I had to find another natural nail polish remover. I tried this one. The unscented version. I love it. It&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;m so happy that I was forced to find another brand because this nail polish remover takes off polish better than the other brand I had been using for a year. This nail polish remover takes off regular and natural nail polish and has no smell. Yes! If the nail polish has been sitting on for more than two weeks (like toe nail polish does) it may be slightly harder to get off, but that&#x27;s expected. At least I don&#x27;t have to scrape at the polish with this remover. This remover actually takes it all off.</li>
    <li> Very good but one the bottles leaked, so it is about 3/4 full</li>
    <li> I bought this product, but the box was wet when it arrived and upon opening the package I noticed the contents had leaked into the box and the bottle was empty.  I am extremely displeased and would like my money back!</li>
    <li> Works very well and no bad scent ,i use it at a nursing  home.</li>
    <li> Worked really well, quickly and thoroughly. Nourishing, not drying like those removers. AND LOVE THAT THERE IS NO SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately came not entirely full; some had spilled out. Most liquid remained in its containing baggie, but it was still greasy to touch, and got on some other things in the package. Luckily my other orders were undamaged, but be careful if you&#x27;re ordering other things with this and they come together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that means the packaging is not good? Like that it&#x27;s glass - but the little silver cap makes me nervous it&#x27;ll spill again in storage somehow. Will think about purchasing a dispenser for this, one of those push ones, but don&#x27;t know if there are glass ones anywhere. Will update if I find any!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love it.  The bottle is pretty and I like the consistency and the relative purity compared to acetone removers.  But here&#x27;s the thing:  You have to rub and rub and I finally gave up and used my chemical remover.  It would be great if they could boost the &amp;#34;remover&amp;#34; function up a notch or two, while retaining the purity.</li>
    <li> Very little scent. Works great! I wish they sold bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> IT does not remove nail polish at all. We even let it soak in for over 15 minutes, reapplying every five and it did nothing. It was the same case for both regular nail polish and the natural kind (with no formaldehyde) from whole foods. Would not buy again, and can&#x27;t even use what we have left. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product before purchasing so I knew what to expect when using it myself. Yes, you have to rub quite a bit more than with normal nail polish remover but two huge factors will keep me purchasing this product: the smell of this product does not kill my nose and head and it leaves my nails feeling HEALTHY after I&#x27;m done. No dry skin or fingernails after using it but instead my fingers feel oh-so-soft!! I&#x27;ll take a little bit more time removing the polish, which is the ONLY downside to this product, but I can totally live with that! Oh, and a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t think the bottle is ridiculously small and not enough to last you a while!</li>
    <li> Solvents are solvents, natural or not, so I&#x27;m sure this product isn&#x27;t harmless.  But it&#x27;s probably way safer than conventional polish remover.  The smell is much more pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a non-toxic nail polish remover to replace my very toxic one, and I&#x27;m happy I found this one. It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, it removes the nail polish really well, and it hydrates the nails and cuticles. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, and one bottle will last for several months. I&#x27;ll never use acetone or those other toxic nail polish removers anymore!</li>
    <li> Works but takes a while to get polish off.</li>
    <li> Rather oily and it took quite a bit of effort to take polish off.</li>
    <li> Finally I found a nail polish remover that nourishes my nails and doesn&#x27;t smell. It removes the nail polish really well and easy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  No peeling nails!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with it.  Does the job and no odor.  Will continue purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a non-acetone oil-based nail polish remover for years. It removes nail polish without drying out my nails and moisturises my cuticles as a plus. I won&#x27;t be buying anything else!</li>
    <li> LOVE this nail polish remover. Cruelty free, natural. Great. Leaves your nails feeling moisturized and lovely, not dry like traditional nail polishes. You&#x27;ll notice that when removing nail polish with this prodcut, a bit of it will smudge on your fingers surrounding the nail, but just wash your hands afterward (as you should anyway after using nail polish remover) and it will come right off. Don&#x27;t let that deter you from purchasing, though. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This works very well. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I hope they&#x27;re honest about it being less harmful than the regular type. My nails aren&#x27;t as dry as they usually are with other polish removers.</li>
    <li> horrible item. You really have to rub for an hour to get the polish off. What the point of making something that doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> got nail polish on a touch LCD, and after a lot of googling decided to try this (it didn&#x27;t contain anything in the manufacturer&#x27;s DO NOT USE list).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked: screen is free of nail polish and is also undamaged.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!! Yes, it does take a little more work to remove the polish than if u bought acetone remover from your local drugstore, but it is totally worth it. There is no offensive smell, no chemicals, and I&#x27;m completely comfortable using this product around my 5 month old, and it conditions your nails! Recommend this all moms!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove anything, had to scratch with my nails to get the polish off, got one star as that is the lowest possible.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as expected. Takes off Zoya Polish easily-no smell! Love this product.</li>
    <li> Works well to remove nail polish and does not have a harsh odor.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish remover ever. I got this because I didn&#x27;t want harsh chemicals. This stuff works better than the chemical stuff. Worth the expensive price. You really don&#x27;t need to use that much to get rid of the polish. Works great.</li>
    <li> This takes the nail polish off just as good as the acetone versions.  On the plus side, the oil base moisturizes the nail instead of drying it out (as I&#x27;ve experienced with the acetone based polish removers).  And definite plus that it&#x27;s organic and non-toxic! Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I like the product.  I like the oiliness because it leaves my nails and cuticles feeling like they have been moisturized.  I dislike having to go wash my hands before I polish.  I also discovered that the pad I used does not dry out like it does with the usual nail polish remover.  I was actually able to use it again a couple of days later.  The downside to keeping the old pad, though, is that if it gets up against a painted surface (like my nail brushes) it dissolves the paint.  I bought an extra bottle to give to my young granddaughter who loves polished nails because, especially at here age, toxins worry me.  I will have to give it to her mother with cautions about its use because I think the discarded oily pad could cause some damage if a child is in charge of disposing of it.</li>
    <li> Not a good remover of polish. have to do it over and over again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It is definitely the best nail polish remover that I&#x27;ve ever used. It works quickly and you don&#x27;t need to use much at a time in order for it to be effective. It removed my glittery polish very quickly and easily. It also leaves your nails feeling nice and moisturized. Besides being non- toxic and non-carcinogenic, the other BIG bonus is that this unscented version actually smells like...NOTHING. There&#x27;s no suspicious chem smell or any chemical scent that&#x27;s &#x27;masked&#x27; by added fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to the toxic chemical polish remover so this product doesn&#x27;t work exactly like others but it gets the job done. The bottle is small and you have to work at it but I&#x27;m willing to do it for the sake of not using harmful chemicals. It leaves a little bit of an oil which I like because it doesn&#x27;t leave that stripped dry feeling on your nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3380f26a040937c8d36ba0192f435b11]]This polish remover is super good. I had stopped polishing my nails because I&#x27;m getting rid of chemicals on everything.&lt;br /&gt;A regular polish have many carcinogenic chemicals and a polish remover have a few more.&lt;br /&gt; I found a good quality polish that I can use without worrying about these ingredients, and now i have found a very good remover  after searching and searching for the best one.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the unscented one, at first I was a little skeptical about the quality, but I decided to try it, it works great, more that I expected, you just have to rub a little stronger than with a regular one but that&#x27;s not important to me .... I left a video to show you how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really works and none of the chemical smell! Doesn&#x27;t dry your nails out. I will never go back to drugstore brand after using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and have refused to use regular nail polish remover since learning about the baby. What a treat to find this product! I can now use my three and five free nail polishes again, knowing I can easily remove them without the use of caustic chemicals. Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited until my eighth month to restore the luxury of nail polish to my life! This stuff works great!</li>
