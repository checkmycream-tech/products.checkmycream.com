      <li>I would not use any other product on one of the most important organ of my body - my skin!</li>

      <li>I use the entire collection and have fabulous results - my skin is naturally smooth &amp; soft, healthy, glowing and invites constant touch from my hubby ;-)</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive, but last a long time and is a very good product.</li>
      <li>Overall, waste of money and not even sure if it&#x27;s the real McCoy given the broken seal.</li>

    <li> It was opened when I received it, the protective seal was not secured to the jar.  I kept it try but have not seen real results.  I personally feel Oil of Olay is just as good. Overall, waste of money and not even sure if it&#x27;s the real McCoy given the broken seal.</li>
    <li> I use this on my neck and chest. It takes away all those lines and wrinkles in that area. I gave it 4 stars becuz of the cost. It is worth every penny but - geez!</li>
    <li> Just as I expected - thank you.</li>
    <li> Was very satisfied with the timely manner in which it arrived.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> love it! Have tried many other products and I can really see the results.  A little expensive, but buying my second container!!</li>
    <li> Same excellence as expected</li>
    <li> I have experienced a 50-60% improvement in firming of my neck with this product. However it takes about 30 days to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am 68 years old. It does not take the place of a facelift but, it is helpful.</li>
    <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t burn your neck really gentile and moisturizing! Haven&#x27;t noticed wrinkles are less but I did notice the texture is better</li>

    <li> Really does work, the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> Since discovering Arbonne, I don&#x27;t use any other products. This really helps keep the neck tighter. It&#x27;s not a miracle so it&#x27;s not like surgery, but it definitely helps. I see a huge difference. I&#x27;ve thrown all other brands of face cream away and only use Arbonne products. Organic, safe and they work.</li>
    <li> The best thing I have found  for age and neck.  This is a great buy</li>
    <li> Love Arbonne products and this is one more to add to my list. It makes my neck and decolletage very smooth and supple and helps get rid of my wrinkled neck. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but last a long time and is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Great product thank you</li>
    <li> I had a lot of sun damage from years of exposure. It&#x27;s amazing how much of a difference this product has made. I have tried numerous other products, but nothing has come close to the results I get from this product.</li>
    <li> Love this. Texture is so smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> Love the product! Works great!</li>
