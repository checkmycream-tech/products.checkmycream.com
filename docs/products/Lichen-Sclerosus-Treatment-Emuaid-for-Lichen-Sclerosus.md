### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m just so happy this is working for me!</li>
      <li>This is real Amazing!</li>
      <li>Wonderful Amazon Seller.  </li>
      <li>I find the cream very good</li>
      <li>but Emuaid turned like a magic!</li>
      <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing ointment.  </li>
      <li>It is almost as effective as steroid ointment.  </li>
      <li>I consider Emuaid a safe ansd effective alternative treatment.</li>
      <li>there has to be a better way getting  what you need after you fall in the donut hole...</li>
      <li>and I think if I used it more consistantly rather than when it flares up</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>I tried many over the counter remedies.  </li>
      <li>This works ok, but seems overpriced for what it contains.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
      <li>So far so good...  </li>
      <li>It has been a tremendous help for my Lichen Sclerosus which I&#x27;ve had for twenty years.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Very healing, extremely quickly.  </li>
      <li>Not only that, the extremely speedy shipping time was incredible as well.  </li>
      <li>This is the first that has worked to control the itching.  </li>
      <li>The first application stopped the itch and pain.</li>
      <li>then I could keep it more under control When I did use it daily the itch and soreness</li>
      <li>Did exactly what it said it would.</li>
      <li>After using every day and evening after three weeks made a real difference.</li>
      <li>Really works.  </li>
      <li>It did help more than the other things Ive tried</li>
      <li>I had instant healing....  for those who have tried everything and never worked, I did that too for the last many years...</li>
      <li>paying high dollar all year fell in the hole in April 14.....  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product for lichen sclerosis.</li>
      <li>I only wish I had found something like this when I was first diagnosed with LS.  </li>
      <li>Major results in a week.</li>
      <li>did clear up almost entirely!</li>
      <li>This product is not made any different than the &#x27;normal&#x27; Emuaid cream, it is just advertised as different.</li>
      <li>It may be due to the diagnosis process of remedies, much of the treatment is based on emotional state, which is tricky to mass treat.</li>

<li> on my second jar of Emuaid for lichen sclerosis,  the first couple of weeks I used it at least twice a day, now once at night or morning keeps the itch away.</li>

<li> Soothes a little but not even close to prescribed topical medication from my Doctor</li>
<li> It was to relate that this product caused increased swelling ,inflammation and other side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Be very careful using this product..</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using emuaid for at least ten years.  </li>
<li> maybe it will work on someone with less area to cover or if it has just started</li>
<li> Took a little bit of time but with soap even though pricey at 20.00 lasts along time.</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> i get almost immediate ease when I use it the only gripe that it is quite expensive</li>
<li> The small script written &#x27;For Lichen Sclerousus&#x27; is just plastered on the container and fell off almost immediately.  </li>
<li> Am not sure I will order again when this finishes.</li>
<li> The steroids did a lot of permanent damage to a delicate area which can never be reversed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
<li> The emu oil this contains is a VERY small amount.</li>
<li> My doctor prescribed the usual steroids which do work, but I have always been fearful of the long term affects.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed, it didn&#x27;t help for this condition.</li>

    <li> So far so good...  Beats the $270.00 for 2 scrips at the pharmacy ...I was in the donut hole....paying high dollar all year fell in the hole in April 14.....  there has to be a better way getting  what you need after you fall in the donut hole...</li>
    <li> It helped but definately not a cure like they claim</li>
    <li> This works ok, but seems overpriced for what it contains. The emu oil this contains is a VERY small amount.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, it didn&#x27;t help for this condition.</li>
    <li> Works for relief of LS.  Not a treatment for, but a lubricant/barrier cream that aids in the treatment of LS.  Rather expensive for a small amount and not particularly any better than pure coconut oil.  Am not sure I will order again when this finishes. The small script written &#x27;For Lichen Sclerousus&#x27; is just plastered on the container and fell off almost immediately.  This product is not made any different than the &#x27;normal&#x27; Emuaid cream, it is just advertised as different.</li>
    <li> I find the cream very good i get almost immediate ease when I use it the only gripe that it is quite expensive</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said it would. I saw results in 3 days. Major results in a week. Highly recommend this product for lichen sclerosis.</li>
    <li> Took a little bit of time but with soap even though pricey at 20.00 lasts along time. After using every day and evening after three weeks made a real difference.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on shingles</li>
    <li> Soothes a little but not even close to prescribed topical medication from my Doctor</li>
    <li> It did give me some relief, however the itch is still their. It did improve my skins texture so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> Immediately after diagnosis of vulvar lichen planum I ordered this cream. The first application stopped the itch and pain. Amazing stuff. Wish it was in larger container and cheaper, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second jar of Emuaid for lichen sclerosis,  the first couple of weeks I used it at least twice a day, now once at night or morning keeps the itch away. Used it immediately on a sign of an analysis fissure and that was gone in 3 days. I have found over the years that either a homeopathic remedy works aost immediately and well, or not at all. It may be due to the diagnosis process of remedies, much of the treatment is based on emotional state, which is tricky to mass treat. I&#x27;m just so happy this is working for me!</li>
    <li> I wrote a review that was not admitted on amazon...It was to relate that this product caused increased swelling ,inflammation and other side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this minus stars if it were possible...Be very careful using this product..Also the chat room offered no information on treating the side effect</li>
    <li> Really works.  Also used this with tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I saw no results. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using emuaid for at least ten years.  It has been a tremendous help for my Lichen Sclerosus which I&#x27;ve had for twenty years.  I only wish I had found something like this when I was first diagnosed with LS.  The steroids did a lot of permanent damage to a delicate area which can never be reversed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you emuaid for the healing.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with this condition for years.  My doctor prescribed the usual steroids which do work, but I have always been fearful of the long term affects.  I tried many over the counter remedies.  This is the first that has worked to control the itching.  Thank you to everyone who took the time to write a review.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> It did help more than the other things Ive tried and I think if I used it more consistantly rather than when it flares up then I could keep it more under control When I did use it daily the itch and soreness did clear up almost entirely!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing ointment.  Very healing, extremely quickly.  It is worth the money.  That&#x27;s for sure.  I am having some marvellous results with this ointment.  Not only that, the extremely speedy shipping time was incredible as well.  Wonderful Amazon Seller.  A1!!!</li>
    <li> it does not seem to be working for meat this time maybe it will work on someone with less area to cover or if it has just started</li>
    <li> This is no cure. Is not what is says does.&lt;br /&gt;Did not help with the scars.  Had to use&lt;br /&gt;Triamcinole to help my problem. And I don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil as wellm</li>
    <li> This is real Amazing! I had instant healing....  for those who have tried everything and never worked, I did that too for the last many years... but Emuaid turned like a magic!</li>
    <li> It is almost as effective as steroid ointment.  There is still some itching but it is manageable.  I had to stop using a steroid treatment because I developed a serious eye condition called central serous retinopathy from the long term treatment with steroids. I consider Emuaid a safe ansd effective alternative treatment.</li>
