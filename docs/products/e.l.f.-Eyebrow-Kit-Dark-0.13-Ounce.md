      <li>Either way this is hands down the best eyebrow fill in tool I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re patient with it, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>I ordered this in the light color (I&#x27;m a blonde with mousy brown brows) and it doesn&#x27;t look great on.</li>
      <li>It appears to be  cheap brand</li>
      <li>Well, later on I learn how to use it correctly and had gotten a tint to my hair, it matches great.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t  go on that smooth and looks so unnatural.</li>
      <li>a Lil bit too light</li>
      <li>I never over plucked them, they&#x27;ve always just been too light for my liking.  </li>
      <li>You will need to invest in your own angled brush, because the one included doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing for an older person whose eyebrows are fading.</li>
      <li>I think this formula may be a knock off to the original product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this! Makes your eyebrows look much natural and its so easy to apply!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have tried for eyebrows, it stays longer and is not messy at all, I love it ..I am getting ready to order two more.</li>
    <li> I have really light eyebrows and dark hair. I love this stuff, it&#x27;s my favorite. I put it on with a hard angle brush and it makes my eyebrows perfect. I always run out of the darker one first though. I barely use the light powder</li>
    <li> I apply this with an angled brush (not the one provided). It looks more natural than most of the brow products that I&#x27;ve tried.  It stays on quite well if you seal it on with eyebrow sealer.</li>
    <li> love this product. easy and natural looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this more than a dozen times, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same consistency as the one I purchased from the e.l.f. website. I think this formula may be a knock off to the original product.</li>
    <li> i like it compared to the price. The shipping was fast and it draws smoothly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for an older person whose eyebrows are fading.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to use this but I will learn. I do like that the colors aren&#x27;t so dark it will make my brows look like I drew them on</li>
    <li> I love ELF. I misplaced my eyebrow kit that I bought from another major label brand and tried this on a whim. It worked just as good if not better, I love it that much more because the price was so reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair and fairly sparse eyebrows.  I never over plucked them, they&#x27;ve always just been too light for my liking.  I use this product to fill them in and it helps quite a bit.  One thing that I do recommend, is to apply the wax first to hold your brow hairs in place.  Then, before you apply the brow powder, set the wax with some translucent powder first.  After you&#x27;ve set the wax, go ahead and apply the brow powder to fill in your brows.  The reason I recommend doing it this way is that I&#x27;ve found that if I apply the brow powder straight over the wax, the color will migrate/clump because the wax is oily.  Putting the translucent powder on before the brow powder greatly diminishes this effect, in my experience.  A great product, but as with all elf products, check their website for any sales that could allow you to get the product cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product , i reoredered 3 times now . the color is perfect for my eyebrows !</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous brow kits, mostly containing pencils and they were SO harsh for my fair skin. I may have fair skin, but I have dark, dark brows. It&#x27;s tough to find a product that pops my brows without draining out my face. This kit is perfect. The colors are great, no smell from the wax, powder isn&#x27;t too loose, darkens the brow NOT the skin around it. The tool isn&#x27;t the absolute /greatest/ but it&#x27;s totally usable. If I am home, I use my own brushes, if not, no biggie to me. It&#x27;s my go-to now. I never leave the house without it on my face or in my purse. I would recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAVO E.L.F! Cheap and great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It stays on until you either rub it off or wash it off. The gel is a bit tricky, but the applicator brush has a flat side that makes adding definition easy. If I just want a soft quick application, I just use the powder side.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is awsome.  The reason for ordering it online is cause in my area it is hard to find the dark kit.  Came on a timely manor.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I am happy with my purchase and I can&#x27;t wait to open it</li>
    <li> Great little product, cheap too!  At first I wasn&#x27;t impressed but that was my fault; I didn&#x27;t know how to apply it and picked the wrong color. Well, later on I learn how to use it correctly and had gotten a tint to my hair, it matches great. Frankly I&#x27;m a bit depressed I&#x27;d ever bought the much pricier Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade. This is good enough and easier to use! My consolation is that the Anastasia will likely last me centuries (its almost too potent, the ELF is not so freakin&#x27; pigmented and that&#x27;s a good thing!). I dislike the powder over the creme, either only use the creme or only use the powder, but not both. Both look good, but only alone. For reference my eyebrow hair is black, and my scalp hair is black with chestnut ombre.</li>
    <li> For this price you can&#x27;t be it. The color is what I wanted and the little makes it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyebrow kit! I always use the cream side to seal in my brow shape. The powder side is too light for my brows, but is the PERFECT blending color for my eyelids! I use this just about everyday.</li>
    <li> I love it, after watching some reviews on YouTube abut this eyebrow kit, I almost cancel my order, I was so afraid that this kit was going  have reddish tint, I was wrong, this is perfect brown, this does not have any reddish tone in it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye brow kit. It works amazing. I told my sister about it and she got one too and she really loved it. Highly recommended it really works wonders! Get this trust me you won&#x27;t regret it and the price is amazing! Will shop here again thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have used a few e.l.f. products before. This eyebrow kit is great.  I like it and would buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I just got this from Target, it&#x27;s the first time am using it. I must say I ABSOLUTELY love love it, goes on perfect and looks super natural. Buy it, worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> The product is ok, I received it prompt with no complaints from the distributor.</li>
    <li> I more often than not, just use the brow gel solo and set with translucent powder however I&#x27;ve used both for a more dramatic brow. Either way this is hands down the best eyebrow fill in tool I&#x27;ve ever owned. The brush allows the ability to fill in the brows and the look is very, very natural. My daughter got a hold of it (teenager) and fell in love too!! About to buy another one because the stinker keeps using it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was afraid it would be hard to put on right, but it&#x27;s really easy and looks great--much more natural looking than what I was using before.</li>
    <li> I will never use another eyebrow kit AGAIN. Besides the remarkably low price this kit is..its AMAZING!! The gel fills in brows to perfection and the powder tones down the shiny waxy look and make them look so natural which I LOVE. If you use a pencil or any other brow kit please give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.Thanks E.L.F. another product I can add to my favs from you all.</li>
    <li> It appears to be  cheap brand but it works okay for me.The color was true to spec. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> I love it ! It makes your eyebrows look so natural ! The only thing is the fluffy side for the powder does shed a little bit but its nothing to worry about. But I absolutely love it! (:</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of make up, but my eyebrows are getting thinner and showing touches of gray so I needed something.&lt;br /&gt;Powder eyebrow make up looked fake, and I could not make it conform to the shape of my brow. This kit solved all that! It is so easy to use, my eyebrows look natural, the color is perfect. I can easily correct any wayward smudges with a q-tip, and the waxy half really shapes the brow and keeps it in place.</li>
    <li> Best product ever,leaves me looking fierce! Easy to work with &amp; very inexpensive! The angled brush works so well with blending in the eye gel &amp; the powder just makes your eyebrows soft &amp; perfect</li>
    <li> i love it! finally found my color</li>
    <li> ive boughten it like eighty million times&lt;br /&gt;its fab</li>
    <li> Great product and looks great on</li>
    <li> This is awesome , looks very natural except the powder a Lil bit too light you could use another from another pallet of yours. And it&#x27;s good as high end brow kit. Definitely worth the money. But the price over exaggerated it&#x27;s 3$  on the ELf website smh. But it came really quick.</li>
    <li> The only thing I will use on my brows. Loveeeeeeee.</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all. I am going to return it. I would not recommond to anyone. I had high hopes but did not like it.</li>
    <li> Helps give your brows a more defined look, make sure you get a good brow brush for a smooth application.</li>
    <li> I love eyebrow powder and wax, it helps it go on well, plus elf brand has nice packaging, great prices, didn&#x27;t take long to receive. Will order more of the products.</li>
    <li> love elf products they are cheap and and good quality. It&#x27;s not high end and amazing quality but really good for non high end product.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not a makeup artist but this product did not go on smooth or natural looking. It looked heavy and cakey.  The application process was also less than seamless.</li>
    <li> NICE COLORS AND EASY TO USE, STAYS ON A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TIME. LOOKS GOOD. YES WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMMEND  IT</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I wanted to try this out because so many people rave about it. It gave my brows a less natural appearance that what I am used to.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no complaints about this product. It arrived quick, firstly. And on top of that its so quick and simple to use. I have black hair and got it in dark and it couldn&#x27;t be more perfect! It fills my eyebrows in jist right and once you blend the powder it looks totally naturally. It looks like my brows are naturally fuller, if that makes sense. The angled side of the brush is a little flimsy so I use one I already had. The little powder side of the brush is fine. I&#x27;m a total newbie at all this eyebrow stuff (first time filling them in today) and it looked great. Super easy to use and great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of products similar, but this one is the best, the eyebrows look so natural, and stays for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I can totally recomend this for people with very little facial hair..</li>
    <li> Very good coverage for my eyebrows</li>
    <li> The wax is a dark enough color that it&#x27;s good enough to use without the powder.</li>
    <li> Love it but only thing that I don&#x27;t like that its to expensive for so little other than that I love this product</li>
    <li> So I originally wrote a bad review for this, and didn&#x27;t try using the product again for over a year. I recently pulled it back out, and gave it another try. If you&#x27;re patient with it, it works just fine. It&#x27;s pretty dark, so unless your eyebrows are black I would recommend going one shade lighter. The powder that comes with it gives it a more natural finish. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again, I think it takes a bit more work than I&#x27;d like, and would probably try an eyebrow pencil next time, but I don&#x27;t regret my purchase. If you have a better brush to use this with I&#x27;m sure it would make the process faster!</li>
    <li> This product gives you the most natural, yet defined eyebrows, which seems like a contradiction in terms, but really isn&#x27;t with this product. It makes your eyebrows look refined, but not clownish, basically making it look like you were born with perfect eyebrows. The wax helps to keep the eyebrows in place and gives them a color base. Topping the wax with the much lighter powder I was skeptical at first, but it actually makes everything look much softer and natural. I would repurchase this over and over, but there&#x27;s so much product, I am still working on my first pan. Btw, the product is cheaper on the elf website.</li>
    <li> Excellent I recieved it before the expected date!</li>
    <li> BEST eyebrow kit I&#x27;ve used, better than salon high end. I mean for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. And my brows have never ever been complimented like they are now.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyebrow products that would not make my dark eyebrows look brown. I finally found it! The closest I had gotten was using Smashbox, but this by far is the most natural look for me. I highly recommend it. It lasts all day and it is an amazing deal.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I dye my hair black and this is the only eyebrow product that gives a natural look to my eyebrow color and style. The brush is easy to use with both the wax and the powder. The wax is great for filling in and shaping and with the powder on top it softens it all up and keeps it from looking drawn on. If I am having a casual day I will just use the powder sometimes to fill in the brows and make them a bit stronger without looking fully made up. Great quality for the price, especially compared with other wax brow sets out there.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.  It doesn&#x27;t  go on that smooth and looks so unnatural. Not happy with the product</li>
    <li> Overall really like it. Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t stay put to long. Looks really nice on, probably just have to retouch a bit after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my hair from light brown to black. I started using this product not only to darken the color of my eyebrows but to fill in missing hair from over plucking. I am amazed at how well this product works and how cheap it was! I would recommend this to anyone with medium brown to black hair because the color is so dark. I use this product everyday and i&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
    <li> Amazing I love all there products !</li>
    <li> i love this product! it makes my brows look perfectly natural which is what i want, and it does just that! so i rate it a 5 star as it deserves it!! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using brow powder for a few years, and I wanted to get a new powder compact without spending a lot of money. I saw this and--honestly, misread the description and thought it was two different colored powders in one compact--purchased it. The dark brown wax is awesome! It looks even better than the super expensive brow powder I had been using. The little wax brush that comes with the kit works just fine. I have another full-size brow brush, and I rarely use it now. The little one in the kit does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fair-skinned, hazel-eyed brunette. I color my hair to a medium auburn-brown. This kit works with my natural hair color and my lightened color.</li>
    <li> I use a good mix of expensive and cheaper makeup products, and ELF is my go-to for affordable products. I find that their stuff is usually of great quality. I ordered this in the light color (I&#x27;m a blonde with mousy brown brows) and it doesn&#x27;t look great on. It applies nicely but it just doesn&#x27;t translate well onto my face. I&#x27;ve only used it once and don&#x27;t really see myself using it again. Not my favorite ELF product, but overall not a bad one.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after my friends recommended, and I&#x27;m glad I did. 2 months later, and I can&#x27;t go a day without filling in my eyebrows with the elf eyebrow kit. In love!</li>
    <li> Amazing brow kit!! I love it. Comparable to kits at sephora</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few of these so far and every time I receive a good quality product. The dark brown filler goes quicker then the powder, but together each side makes a great team and leaves me with amazing looking brows!</li>
    <li> Really nice kit at a great price.  I love that it is not tested on animals.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to remove the brush; I accidentally got a nail mark in the gel side a couple of times.  I use the powder a bit as eyeshadow, making it a versatile addition to my purse.</li>
    <li> This is a great match for me.I am happy with this purchase and i would recommend to anyone who is looking a for a natural and fuller looking eye brows.</li>
    <li> This product is the first to actually help my eyebrow situation. I have a pretty bad scar on each eyebrow. The gel side stick well over the scar, and the powder sets it for the day. The color is a perfect match to my hair color.</li>
    <li> i have never been into eye brows, however, this kit gives me the opportunity to have picture perfect brows. Love it!!</li>
    <li> very difficult to pick up even with a good brush</li>
    <li> This is the best brow makeup I&#x27;ve ever used by far. You will need to invest in your own angled brush, because the one included doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> This works great for my brows. The color works. I use my own brush with it. I tried looking for this color in store but medium is all I found.</li>
    <li> I chose 3 because even tho&#x27; it&#x27;s a great concept, the coloring wasn&#x27;t quite right for me. I think others would like it tho&#x27; if it were to match their coloring.</li>
    <li> Make sure to buy the small angle sigma brush with this. It works perfect!</li>
    <li> I am not that good with a pencil and this definitely helps to make my eyebrows look natural.  I use this literally everyday.</li>
    <li> love it. works as well as my other benefit brand..but at a better price.</li>
    <li> It was nicely packaged. I have dark dark brown hair and black eyebrows, but I felt like it was easy to go too dark on my brows if I wasn&#x27;t careful. The brush that comes with the product is usable, but not the best. However, for the price it is, you can&#x27;t expect too much out of the brush.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyebrow kit I&#x27;ve ever bought and its so good for the price! I can honestly say I won&#x27;t ever use any other eyebrow kit. This is the perfect color for my brows and it creates such a natural look (if you know how to apply it). Its also very small and compact and mine doesnt seem to be running out anytime soon! I&#x27;ve gotten so much better at doing my brows since Ive owned this kit and I would absolutely recommend this ! LOVE IT!</li>
