      <li>love.....</li>
      <li>love.....</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My first bdellium brush and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>and I love Bdellium, I have many brushes from this company and</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>and i love using it for light powder under my eye area.  </li>
      <li>This is so easy to use</li>
      <li>I am really happy with the way my makeup turns out in all the aforementioned uses.</li>
      <li>The handle is light, but sturdy.  </li>
      <li>This brush feels very nice and is inexpensive, but mine is shedding almost all its hairs instantly upon opening the brush.</li>
      <li>They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  </li>
      <li>I do find that the bristles come out every time I clean it.</li>
      <li>After having tried so many higher end product, i have found out that sometimes, lower end item are just as nice, if not, more suitable for me.</li>
      <li>and i find that with a light application, my blusher pigment goes on very well</li>
      <li>I like to use more of a sweeping motion and use it to apply blush, especially the apples of the cheek.</li>
      <li>I feel i can handle it better with the smaller head</li>
      <li>Small enough to contour nose perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is my first brush from BDellium Tools, and I will definitely be trying out more brushes from their Studio line.  </li>
      <li>Nice and soft but dense enough to place the product exactly where I want it.</li>
      <li>I did wash it after the first use, and it washed very well, no shedding or funny smells.  </li>
      <li>and it dries pretty fast.</li>
      <li>The only downside I have to this, and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars, is because I got some fallout the first time I pulled it out of the box as well as the first time I washed it.</li>
      <li>I certainly would not recommend purchasing a brush that sheds so intensely.</li>
      <li>The price is very affordable.  </li>
      <li>The brush washes well and seems to be very sturdy</li>
      <li>I use it to couture and it blends the poweder very well</li>
      <li>I used it to contour with my bronzer and it placed the color really well.</li>
      <li>and i don&#x27;t use this for my very pigmented blush as i can over apply and look like a clown.</li>
      <li>I have the whole maestro line and some of the studio line</li>
      <li>I mainly use this for bronzing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
      <li>It is too bad because if it didn&#x27;t shed, this brush would be superb.</li>
      <li>Love the small but not too dense brush that i mainly use it for blusher.</li>
      <li>I have tried cheap to expensive brands and this one I even like better than my</li>
      <li>It blends well and feels very soft on the skin.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft and distribute and blend color evenly.</li>
      <li>The density of the brushes, the feel of the brushes and the use of the brush are exactly the same!!</li>
      <li>Really recommend it and possibly can be a dupe for the sigma one that everyone uses</li>
      <li>I wiped it gently on a paper towel, which was then totally covered with hair.  </li>
      <li>Although i think the dye is coming out from my frequent wash</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft</li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  </li>
      <li>soft brush</li>
      <li>It is only slightly lighter and has a more tapered cut than the MAC 109, but is the same height and width.   </li>
      <li>Love this contour brush, I did a side-by-side comparison of this brush and a Sigma Small Contour and the only difference is</li>
      <li>It works very well on the face, especially for those with smaller and narrower faces.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup professional, but I wanted a smaller multipurpose face brush.</li>
      <li>it blends well and is soft enough on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I was using brushes that were too small or too big or not shaped right</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got this while reading the raves review and i wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Love the small but not too dense brush that i mainly use it for blusher. I feel i can handle it better with the smaller head and i find that with a light application, my blusher pigment goes on very well and i don&#x27;t use this for my very pigmented blush as i can over apply and look like a clown. I&#x27;ve wash it a few times now and it didn&#x27;t shed at all. Although i think the dye is coming out from my frequent wash but there was no problem with its shape and it dries pretty fast. Also, i love it for the price as i am cutting down on my budget on makeup brushes and cosmetic. After having tried so many higher end product, i have found out that sometimes, lower end item are just as nice, if not, more suitable for me. Hence, it help me to save alot. Will repurchase this if my brushes are spoilt but i find it is not easily accessible online, was happy and surprise to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> love.....love.....love this brush is amazing....it doesnt shed and the dome is perfect and so similar to a high brand name brush that I own and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for contouring!! I love using this brush to contour cheeks and nose. Small enough to contour nose perfectly. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush. It blends well and feels very soft on the skin. It is also perfect for the hollows of the cheeks. The only downside I have to this, and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars, is because I got some fallout the first time I pulled it out of the box as well as the first time I washed it. But overall, I like this and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for setting powder under my eyes...love it</li>
    <li> I have tried cheap to expensive brands and this one I even like better than my Too Faced Teddy Bear brush which I always loved.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use it for contouring.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was going to be just like my MAC 109 but it&#x27;s not. This one isn&#x27;t as dense and you can&#x27;t buff with it. It does pick up color well and deposit it well. I used it to contour with my bronzer and it placed the color really well. I got the intensity I wanted but it was hard to really buff it out the way I wanted. I like to use more of a sweeping motion and use it to apply blush, especially the apples of the cheek.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  These brushes are really nice.  They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  The price is very affordable.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this brush. I seem to have gotten all the wrong brushes for what I needed this brush for which was contouring my cheeks, forehead and down my nose and this brush is the perfect size to do all of them without any issues. I was using brushes that were too small or too big or not shaped right but the rounded edge is perfect for every angle and again, the size works out flawlessly I am so happy I have this brush now.</li>
    <li> Great brush! I use it to couture and it blends the poweder very well</li>
    <li> soft brush and I love Bdellium, I have many brushes from this company and I m happy with them... better than Mac and Sigma in my opinion.</li>
    <li> THIS brush is magic.  I love it.  I tried a different shaped (a slanted one) contouring brush and I hated it.  This is so easy to use and I just love it!</li>
    <li> I am sooooo disappointed with this brush, it shades like crazy, you will be picking hair&#x27;s off your face at all times.  the quality is sooo poor.</li>
    <li> This brush works amazingly!  The handle is light, but sturdy.  The brush is comparable to the MAC 109.  It is only slightly lighter and has a more tapered cut than the MAC 109, but is the same height and width.   It works very well on the face, especially for those with smaller and narrower faces.  You can even contour your nose with it.  I did wash it after the first use, and it washed very well, no shedding or funny smells.  This is my first brush from BDellium Tools, and I will definitely be trying out more brushes from their Studio line.  For the less than $10, this brush is essential to your kit!</li>
    <li> Greatt brush I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this contour brush, I did a side-by-side comparison of this brush and a Sigma Small Contour and the only difference is one brush is a little longer than the other. The density of the brushes, the feel of the brushes and the use of the brush are exactly the same!! You can only tell a difference in the color of the handle.</li>
    <li> Love this brush to apply contour or blush.</li>
    <li> This is the best blush brush I own however it doesn&#x27;t clean off well.I do find that the bristles come out every time I clean it. That however has not changed that fact that it puts the product on my cheeks the best. That is why it still gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Ordered this brush for contouring.  It does what it is supposed to do.  Does well with buffing out compaired to the white angled contour brush.  I have the whole maestro line and some of the studio line and I think these are quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I have the 955 stippling brush in this line and I love it. I love this product also but where the bristles meet the metal section it looks like it got bent so the metal isn&#x27;t circular like it should be. That&#x27;s why the three stars. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to return it but when you buy something you want it to start out perfect.</li>
    <li> i use this brush for a blush brush and i love it! it blends well and is soft enough on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I love this brush alot!  It&#x27;s so soft and i love using it for light powder under my eye area.  works great for contouring also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup professional, but I wanted a smaller multipurpose face brush. I have been using this brush for the past few weeks for various purposes - powdering center of face, contouring cheeks, highlighting cheeks...etc. I am really happy with the way my makeup turns out in all the aforementioned uses. It&#x27;s the perfect size, very soft and distributes product evenly. I would definitely recommend this brush to others.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it! None of my Bdellium tools have shed and they work better then my drugstore brushes..lol</li>
    <li> My first bdellium brush and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! Way better than the mac 109 brush which sheds everywhere. I mainly use this for bronzing.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for highlighting with bronzer. The bristles are very soft and distribute and blend color evenly. The brush washes well and seems to be very sturdy</li>
    <li> This brush feels very nice and is inexpensive, but mine is shedding almost all its hairs instantly upon opening the brush. I wiped it gently on a paper towel, which was then totally covered with hair.  I certainly would not recommend purchasing a brush that sheds so intensely. I have never bought a Bdellium brush before and this will be my last purchase from them. I have other inexpensive brands of brushes and they do not shed like this, so it not a matter of price alone. It is too bad because if it didn&#x27;t shed, this brush would be superb.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for contouring my cheeks. Nice and soft but dense enough to place the product exactly where I want it. Great brush!</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve discovered this brush sooner! But I think it&#x27;s dense for setting powder contour shade. It fits perfectly on the hallows of the cheek! Really recommend it and possibly can be a dupe for the sigma one that everyone uses</li>
