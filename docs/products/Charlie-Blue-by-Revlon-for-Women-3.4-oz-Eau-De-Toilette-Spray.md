    <li> I bought the original plus all the other versions. Love them all. Blue is the most closest to the original version.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  Wonderful scent that is very expensive when one can find it in stores.  I ordered it through Amazon at a more reasonable price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne. It is not overpowering like some can be. So thankful to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A most wonderful and hypnotic scent! It is indeed an old-y, but a goody! They do not make them like this anymore! I adore Charlie from the bottom of my ever so furry heart. It reminds one of the south of France---of the villages of St.Paul and Eze. It is absolutely meow-a-licious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ko-Ko the Cat</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, it isn&#x27;t overly powerful, yet enough so that others know you are wearing it. Have had many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Been a long time since she had used this one.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne since it came out in the 70&#x27;s and always get compliments on it.  Makes a great gift as well</li>
    <li> First off, I finally heard from them, they were out of stock, they didn&#x27;t know when they would have more in, so they refunded my gift card.</li>
    <li> This product shows the bottle and box for Charlie cologne, not Charlie blue eu de toilette.  They are very different versions of the Charlie product line.  The colone spray is the bottle shown in there ad, they ship charlie blue which could be purchased much cheaper from other venders on amazon.  I thought I bought and paid for Charlie cologne spray as pictured the bottle with white writing on it. This is not what I recieved, I got the charlie blue toilette spray a bottle with blue writing and the word blue on the bottle.  Deceptive seller........</li>
    <li> Great amount of perfume. It did not come in a box but i prefer more product than less packaging. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle for the wife. She loves the smell of this cologne and so do I. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Just as I ordered! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister.  Smells wonderful on her.</li>
    <li> Great price for an excellent product. I only use Charlie. Did not come in original box but that was OK. The bottle was brand new.</li>
    <li> ts hard to find the Charlie Original but I expected it to come in box!  It was just the bottle wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it is hard to distinguish Charlie Cologne from Toilette Spray , etc.  This is the real 3.5 oz Cologne, i.e. perfume, that my sister-in-law has been using for many years.  It is a traditional gift that we give her every year.</li>
    <li> Better than expensive ones from Macy&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most perfumes, but, not CHARLIE.  I started wearing it when it first came out.  I have enjoyed it for many years!!.  Anna.</li>
