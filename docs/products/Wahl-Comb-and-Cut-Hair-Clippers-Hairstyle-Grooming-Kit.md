      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and works great.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t quite get the edges nice and neat, so I used the scissors included with the kit and then ran over the edges with the Comb N Cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a really nice clipper that will assist you in trimming hair if you&#x27;ve never cut hair before.  </li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t doing my son&#x27;s hair as nicely as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>He did like it, and used it himself, and works great to maintain a clean cut.  </li>

      <li>Overall a great concept!</li>
      <li>Mostly, it cannot even out the edges</li>

      <li>Does not take the place of a full hair cut</li>
      <li>Repeat as necessary and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>This trimmer is pretty fool-proof and the instructions are easy to follow.  </li>
      <li>In fact this product worked great FOR 5 MINUTES, than the speed slowed down to a crawl and it gradually sputtered out.  </li>
      <li>I got red old one that was a great unit.</li>
      <li>However, there is no cutting force whatsoever.</li>
      <li>You just start with clean dry hair &amp; comb it through your hair &amp; it gives you a nice haircut.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not but it will extend the intervals between cuts by nicely thinning and shaping the sides and back, which in my case, grow a lot faster than do the top and front.  </li>
      <li>You will not be happy with these clippers if you are looking for them to quickly cut long hair, they cut very similar to thinning shears.</li>
      <li>decided to go out and buy myself some clippers and was surprised how easy it was to cut his hair with the attachments.</li>
      <li>Have used one since they were first advertised on t.v.  </li>

      <li>yr while actually looking better between cuts.    </li>

      <li>My son&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t look quite right for more than on turn with the Comb &#x27;N Cut until I had to bring him back to the shop, which turned out to be too frequent for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This product works very well if you understand what the real use is--to maintain the hairstyle already in use.  </li>
      <li>The hair lays against the scalp, unlike clippers where you use hands or comb to pull it straight out.  </li>

      <li>At the small scale of the blades, this \\&quot;jagged cut\\&quot; gives you a finely layered trim!  </li>

      <li>Bought the product and only 3 days later had to by a real shaver/clippers for the buzzed look that I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It only trims a small amount of hair with each \\&quot;comb\\&quot;; go over the same area several times if you want more cut.  </li>
      <li>That may be so, but for my thinning, slowly-growing one,  a few passes per section leaves it looking reasonably fresh and shaped in between cuts.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using these clipper for years. I use traditional clippers to shorten my hair and then use these to thin and get a smooth layered look .  You will not be happy with these clippers if you are looking for them to quickly cut long hair, they cut very similar to thinning shears.</li>
    <li> My sister gave this to me for Christmas.  I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it ended up working really well.  You just start with clean dry hair &amp; comb it through your hair &amp; it gives you a nice haircut.  They say it&#x27;s intended to maintain your style in-between regular haircuts, but I&#x27;m going to try to use it all the time to save money.  It pays for itself in just one use.  The thing I like is that it comes with a DVD that shows how to use it.  It also comes with lube for the blades, 2 types of combs, and a barber&#x27;s cape.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, go for it.</li>
    <li> I was off and running with the Comb&#x27;N Cut in the time it took to oil the blade and plug it in. It was easy. Just comb the hair and then run the cutter through the hair in the direction it&#x27;s combed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son was the guinea pig. He has bushy hair in a boy cut that&#x27;s ready for a trim. He never wants his hair cut too short, so I thought this was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Comb&#x27;N Cut just takes a little off at a time. I ran it through about three strokes in each area, and it did make that bushy hair look trimmer. I couldn&#x27;t quite get the edges nice and neat, so I used the scissors included with the kit and then ran over the edges with the Comb N Cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay. I will definitely continue to use it for maintenance between cuts, but I do see why it&#x27;s only for maintenance. Mostly, it cannot even out the edges well, so we&#x27;ll need to go to the shop to get that done, but at least we&#x27;ll only need to go half as often. That&#x27;s at least worth the price I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ quick and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;+ comes with everything necessary: combs, machine oil, clippers, scissors, plastic drape, clipper brush, pamphlet and video instructions, case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- not for long hair&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t neatly trim edges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl Comb &#x27;N Cut probably does better on short hair. My son&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t look quite right for more than on turn with the Comb &#x27;N Cut until I had to bring him back to the shop, which turned out to be too frequent for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go out and buy myself some clippers and was surprised how easy it was to cut his hair with the attachments. It was almost idiot proof. So, the Comb &#x27;N Cut has found itself in storage after a very short period of time. It just wasn&#x27;t doing my son&#x27;s hair as nicely as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> For someone like me, who becomes ever more \\&quot;follicularly-challenged\\&quot; with each passing year, this combNcut works like a charm.  I&#x27;ve enviously read reviews where this product barely makes a dent on a thick head of hair.  That may be so, but for my thinning, slowly-growing one,  a few passes per section leaves it looking reasonably fresh and shaped in between cuts.  Will this replace a good haircut?  Definitely not but it will extend the intervals between cuts by nicely thinning and shaping the sides and back, which in my case, grow a lot faster than do the top and front.  Most importantly a little bit of attention each week keeps you well groomed, but an incidental benefit is that by extending my hair cut cycle from approximately 4 to 6 weeks @ $22 (cut and tip) per cut, I&#x27;m saving about $90/yr while actually looking better between cuts.    This trimmer is pretty fool-proof and the instructions are easy to follow.  Essentially take 3 passes per section on the thick part of your head and 1 pass on your thinning hair.  Repeat as necessary and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Have used one since they were first advertised on t.v.  Bought the 2nd one from the company direct and am still using it, but just purchased my 3rd from Amazon, (at a better price) as a spare.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and works great.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using one for many years until the blades got dull. Great price on the new unit. Easy to take the bulk out of your own hair or use on someone else. Really helps maximize the time between haircuts and keep you looking groomed.</li>
    <li> Have not used a hair clipper since my two sons (50/52 yrs) were children.  I used my new hair clipper and trimmed my own hair, with remarkable results. My hair looks good, I saved time, money and am very happy with the entire experience.</li>
    <li> Seems the clipper of my razor does a better job!  post if you want to buy it from me.  Used it once?</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. Great for trimming hair. Does not take the place of a full hair cut</li>
    <li> Product came on time, brand new seller delivered as promised great on his/her/thier behalf. But this has to be the worst Wahl clipper every invented. Glad it was heavily discounted for 8 bucks. I just don&#x27;t know what wahl was thinking and who hair they had in mind ?. Best it doesn&#x27;t cut all hair as stated, it will be going to charity.</li>
    <li> before buying it... I spent a lot of time comparing all these kind of products and then had a look at the Wahl website. Saw actually two videos on this product. It LOOKED great and I bought it. The problem is you have to be a professional to cut your hair by yourself. There is only one cutting mode, only one speed and the cutter vibrates a lot, so your hand must be firm. I did not expect this poor kind of service and I returned it, but for experienced people can be a good and inexpensive solution.</li>
    <li> The Comb&#x27;N&#x27;Cut works as advertised, but the picture and the description above are misleading:  You don&#x27;t hold it down like the picture; you hold the head up.  And it doesn&#x27;t work like clippers, despite the similar-sounding description.  Imagine it like this: Take regular clippers, rotate the blade head, make the blades (and the spaces between them) triple wide, slow down the motor, and adjust the blades so they (apparently) don&#x27;t all close at exactly the same moment. Now you have an instrument that, because it&#x27;s moving through the hair, cuts each bit at a slightly different instant!  At the small scale of the blades, this \\&quot;jagged cut\\&quot; gives you a finely layered trim!  (Looked at another way: The blades are perpendicular to the scalp, unlike clippers which run horizontally.  The hair lays against the scalp, unlike clippers where you use hands or comb to pull it straight out.  Thus you can&#x27;t mistakenly cut a swath with it, but no crewcuts either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you can screw it up.  To avoid this: (1) Keep your hands moving; never stop pulling the clippers until they&#x27;re out of your hair.  (2) Start the stroke away from a part (or cowlick), not right on top of it.  (3) Oil the blades before you start work.  (This is particularly important because you&#x27;re already \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; on your hair while cutting it, so you need for the actual chomp to be as clean and quick as possible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Comb&#x27;N&#x27;Cut only 3 stars because it works, but I only used it once!  For my do-myself haircuts, I prefer the vacuum-based Flowbee.  For a crewcut, regular clippers would be cheaper and better.  To do someone else&#x27;s hair, it&#x27;s a toss-up: If you&#x27;re a klutz or a first-timer, this will allow you to do multiple passes, approximating the finished result.  But if you have any skill with a styling comb, you can do more different styles, and cut faster, with regular clippers.  But remember -- they advertise this unit for between-cuts maintenance.  For that purpose, it&#x27;s just fine, maybe almost 4 stars., maybe almost 4 stars.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT CUT HAIR. It vibrates a lot, but it does not cut hair of any length. JUNK</li>
    <li> This product works very well if you understand what the real use is--to maintain the hairstyle already in use.  It does an excellent job for keeping that just trimmed look.  It only trims a small amount of hair with each \\&quot;comb\\&quot;; go over the same area several times if you want more cut.  We bought a second product in case it is no longer available in the future!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an identical model that worked well for me for over 15 years. I was happy to see that it was identical. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> You send me a unit with unremoved GLUE on the handle. Ihad to tape it to use it.  I try to return it but It didn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t know what to do. I got red old one that was a great unit.</li>
    <li> I am 69 years old and my hair is very thin on the sides and even thinner on top so the Comb&#x27;N Cut works very well for me. If you have a thick head of hair it will take quite awhile to remove much of it but it should work well to keep your hair neat between haircuts. &lt;br /&gt;For people like myself who have thin hair it is great.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old autistic son hates haircuts.  He won&#x27;t allow us to use scissors, won&#x27;t enter the barber or haircuttery, and lately has been protesting getting the top of his head buzzed.  I bought this to try to even out the top of his head.  But unfortunately, it was just too long.  He did like it, and used it himself, and works great to maintain a clean cut.  I figured out it was the noise of the buzzer, and after purchasing another one on Amazon, I am able to buzz again (it&#x27;s designed for kids, that&#x27;s a key!).  I can use this to maintain and prolong haircuts.  It is very different in that you go the opposite way than you do when you buzz.  Overall a great concept!</li>
    <li> Received product yesterday and tried this evening. Very simple to use, just plug in and follow hair growth. In fact this product worked great FOR 5 MINUTES, than the speed slowed down to a crawl and it gradually sputtered out.  When I unplugged it I noticed the plug had become red hot.Went from box to garbage in one night. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a lemon or if its just a cheap product.  &lt;br /&gt;To bad cause its a good idea. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> For simple trimming that&#x27;s easy to use and takes little time. You too will benefit in using this grooming item.</li>
    <li> I do not know what this product is but it is not a shaver. This product will NOT cut your hair by any means. What it does is simply \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; your hair and whichever hairs give will be the hairs that actually get removed. However, there is no cutting force whatsoever. Bought the product and only 3 days later had to by a real shaver/clippers for the buzzed look that I was looking for.</li>
    <li> We ordered this to replace an old unit that had served us very well for years..this does just as well!</li>
    <li> very functional for the price and the quality is good.</li>
    <li> Acquired all went bad you lost by that product</li>
    <li> This is a really nice clipper that will assist you in trimming hair if you&#x27;ve never cut hair before.  This is my second one and I use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
