<li> Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I love the vanilla, but I think some of the heavier base notes are over done.</li>

    <li> Everything was great, except for the wallet. U would never think it&#x27;s versace. It looks like Kmart brand</li>
    <li> Everything is nice, came quickly, with no issues. The wallet is too feminine for me though.</li>

    <li> Authentic cologne. My son loves it!</li>
    <li> The perfume is high quality and also the creams but the wallet doesn&#x27;t worth anything if I would&#x27;ve known I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this offer and I just would&#x27;ve bought the perfume and the creams.</li>
    <li> I smelled this at a department store and fell in love with it. The lady who worked there said she didn&#x27;t like it much, I disagreed, but that should have been my forewarning.

You may feel differently.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty nice collection of cologne and I must say this is hands-down one of my best</li>
