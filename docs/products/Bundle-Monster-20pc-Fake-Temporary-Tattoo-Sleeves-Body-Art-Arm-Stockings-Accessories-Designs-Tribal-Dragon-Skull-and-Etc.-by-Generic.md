    <li> They are super, just filled the bill for my intended use, I looked for quite sometime and was ready give up and thought (amazon) and y&#x27;all had them.</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars but was kind of lose around my wrist but still looks good.</li>
    <li> these things r fun u put them on ur arms n they aculy keep my arms cool they look cool better if ur arm mathes the skin tone there pretty noticable close up but they still look great</li>
    <li> Helps with protection from the hot Florida Sun</li>
    <li> I love tattoos I am so amaze of these sleeves great as gifts. I wear them for reaction...lol. I seen a sleeve in a movie and thought wish I had one. Well I do now thanks to Bundle Monster so B. M. deserved five stars. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Teenage son loved this!</li>
    <li> the size is ok&lt;br /&gt;i was a bit disappointed, because i didn&#x27;t get some of them what i wanted (AC/DC)</li>
    <li> Items not correspondien arrived and requested the public are very different models.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for these for her birthday and I have to say that they are a lot nicer than I thought they would be for the price.  Very pretty designs on most of them and she has had a lot of fun wearing them.  Thanks for a great product at an excellent price!</li>
    <li> Came fast..&lt;br /&gt;Work great...!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, we used these for a cycling vacation and gave them out to everyone. What a blast we all had wearing them. Lots of double takes.</li>
    <li> I find these to be very unrealistic looking. We bought them for an April fools joke but it is immediately obvious that they are not the real deal.</li>
    <li> got these to wear when riding my bike.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t look bad at a distance and crusing @ 55 mph.&lt;br /&gt;The big plus is that they cool down your arms by helping sweat evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;When the temps are in the 90s, I really like them.</li>
    <li> They are great---from a short distance they look like the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing--- My daughter which is eight years olds, could wear them on her legs--way cool--my sister thought we make a spectacular dad and daughter duo!!!</li>
    <li> Great for faking people out, some are realistic while others are not.  For the price, its a deal.</li>
    <li> great but could be a little longer and thicker</li>
    <li> Bought these for our youth group to honor one of the other leaders that was being deployed and was a big hit!</li>
    <li> I am a disabled veteran and this is a great cover for my arm!! It keeps people from staring at my wound! It also helps my self confidence!!</li>
    <li> They fit my girl and 10 year old son...not for a dude  with 15&amp;#34; arms or bigger</li>
    <li> The perfect thing for the summertime</li>
    <li> Ahhh... I dunno what I expected.  just ok.  Good for a laugh but pretty quickly you can tell its fake.  I have big muscular arms however... maybe more suited for you skinny bean pole arm people...  If you are an accountant or someting, or  do office work and that leads you to soft hands and you want to look more mannish, these might be for you. Zing!  For the price I&#x27;d say they are ok.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied at all... I got shorted by 10 pieces. I paid for 20.. got 10... not very nice at all.</li>
    <li> No good at all. Extremely small and the colors no looks good. Most of them looks same</li>
    <li> They do not fit correctly. Once applied they roll down the arm and lastly they do not match skin color and look very fake.</li>
    <li> None of them match.  The colors are all different.</li>
    <li> They are what I needed</li>
    <li> Sleeves are incredibly short and tight. Not made for full sized man. Better option for petite women/ child. Possible for more of a short, slender frame. Also does not breath well.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the product.  Had much better quality from some in the past made in the Phillipines.  These simply frayed apart and became tattered at the ends almost instantly.</li>
    <li> In the past I have gotten the sleeves they were individually packaged with a label tattoo sleeve.  I ordered 60  and they were in three bags.  The sleeves were okay and I have no complaint about them.  If you want a lot of sleeves I doubt you can beat this deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been  having some fun with these. They do provide some sun block.&lt;br /&gt;They are about 12&amp;#34; long, so not quite long enough to reach my wrist, but I cover the end with my watch.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I love it. My co-worker think it is real tattoo and they arrived early than estimated delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Good deal also for the price.</li>
    <li> bought them as a joke gift for a friend and they were fine for the price.  They can only really be used once and after that they are to stretched out for me.  Also when they stretch the tattoo becomes more and more unrecognizable and fake looking</li>
    <li> Use these to protect the arms at work will protect some uv rays from the sun ,cool in tem and looks. look real I have large arms they fit good .</li>
    <li> These were really just a waste of money for me, they are not durable at all. My husband opened the package first thing and looked the first set and they are thin like panty hose and snag and run with no effort at all. My husband also complained that after about 20 minutes of wear they fall down his arms. He just threw them away. He wanted to use them for work but they are really just for show and definitely for very slim people. They do not stretch well before tearing, or running.</li>
    <li> This are the ones to order they are great price and are made of a great material. Unlike the others that are made with pantyhose. These are long lasting and are great for handwashing. Great bundle price.</li>
    <li> nice fake tattoo. wish its my skin complexion cuz pples think its real. i like da design. will buy more for my skin color type</li>
    <li> Every one of the arm sleeves fit great and look cool. They also keep my arms cool and protected from sunburn.  And in the mornings, when the temp is a little cool, they even provide some warmth.  AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> Good gift to have fun with friends, to feel for a momento how is to have a tatoo, but... with out the trouble!!</li>
    <li> my expections were not top satisfactory because i didnt recieve all of my product that i paid for. Its bad enough it took longer than before for me to get it,then on top of that,they messed my order up! I e-mailed them the problem.They responed back and apologized and said they will send the rest of my order as soon as posible but i think the least they could do is express mail my order since they made the mistake!</li>
    <li> Just what they were suppose to be! Thanks ☺</li>
    <li> I got these for all my workers here in Afghanistan.  The heat is a huge problem to skin, so these really help protecting your arms from the heat and also keep your arms cool.  There are allot of cool designs, but that was not the reason I purchased them.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a golf tournament. They were a hit!, ran out by the 9th hole  would buy again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Was more than what my cousin expected love every last on of them and wears them daily. Would buy again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> My little brother loved these!!</li>
    <li> Super product, works great! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The tattoos took forever to arrive. Tattoos are very colorful, but my son who plays varsity football and is very muscular was not able to actual use any of them.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 2 months.  I have not had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing from seller was painless.&lt;br /&gt;Need big (thick) arms to have the best affect with these.</li>
    <li> They are cool feeling on your arms. I like the look. They block the sun so you don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
    <li> its good deal they ruin esaly but...okey there full of hole there fist cupple of days and some of them were diffrant than the pic</li>
    <li> I work in place we&#x27;re you have to cover up so they are perfect For my work</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and beautiful details. Duration is better than expected. Impressive and look like real when viewing from a distance.</li>
    <li> Wow came so fast they are so unique I like very much. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but they are a bit tricky to keep up, my son says. He also found they unraveled a bit. I &amp;#34;inherited&amp;#34; them from him, and will use them this winter to make my t-shirts into &amp;#34;long sleeve&amp;#34; shirts!</li>
    <li> When I put these on, people think that I have real tattoos.</li>
    <li> I wear tattoo sleeves daily to cover up a compression sleeve I am required to wear. I am an average built man and the sleeve do not fit, both ends appear to be the same size, so there is no differential between top and bottom and they do not stay on if you manage to stretch one on. I have found another supplier that workout perfectly, but I would not purchase these for myself again. If you are purchasing for a child I could see these to be useful.</li>
    <li> As stated above, everything about the transaction was great, but the actual merchandise was poor quality. Everyone that I have opened so far is fraying on one opening and unraveling.</li>
    <li> These will look bad ass on anyone</li>
    <li> i DO get a lot of compliments on them, everyone always says how realistic they look. Oh but wait, they are realistic, BECAUSE I NEVER  GOT THEM!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old got a kick out of this stocking stuffer. Looks &#x27;real&#x27; from across a room.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my Steampunk Dude Vader outfit</li>
    <li> it is what it says it is</li>
    <li> half a dollar for every sleeve tattoo? not bad. the best thing about this is that it protects you from the harmful rays of the sun.</li>
    <li> I found they were to short and ravelled to easily.</li>
    <li> My son recently had a pre-teen party and the sleeves were a hit, all of the boys were proud of their body art, even some of the parents wore them.</li>
    <li> A little tight for my arms</li>
    <li> Thanks&lt;br /&gt;I like it much&lt;br /&gt;👍👍👍👍👍 ✌✌✌✌✌✌ 👏👏 👋👋 ✋✋ 🙌🙌 ☝☝☝&lt;br /&gt;000 000 000 000 000 00 0 0</li>
    <li> They are a little tight on the upper arm but served the purpose for our party.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for hubby&#x27;s harley themed 40th bday.</li>
    <li> for kids and people with small arms</li>
    <li> They take forever to arrive....... Product is fine..</li>
    <li> I work at a very large construction site where all the employees are required to wear long sleeves for safety reasons. This site has approved these tattoo sleeves to be worn in the place of long sleeve shirts. The best thing about wearing these sleeves is that they have a cooling effect while walking. I sweat while I work but the sleeves help cool me off from the natural swing of my arms when I walk. Although the sleeves allow air to pass through them, they are extremely tough in that they last for months while keeping their shape under harsh conditions. I wash them in the washing machine and I let them hang dry. These sleeves are the big sleeves for bigger men but they can be worn by smaller guys and gals as well. Sometimes I order sleeves from other companies and the sleeves are the smaller sleeves that won&#x27;t fit my arm. These sleeves have the seam down one side which I turn in towards my inner arm when I wear them. They stay up on my arm while working all day. I have been rotating 6 pair of sleeves for a year and I haven&#x27;t worn out a pair yet. I order many sleeves every month because I sell them to my fellow work mates which helps me generate lunch money. This is an excellent product and I recommend these sleeves for every appropriate occasion.</li>
    <li> Cool looking but small</li>
    <li> Great product! i bought them for my bro as a xmas gift and he loved them! they look so real and were definitely worth purchasing. i would buy them again in a heart beat.</li>
