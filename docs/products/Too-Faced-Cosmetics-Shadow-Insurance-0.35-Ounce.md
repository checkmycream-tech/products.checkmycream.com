<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worth every single penny!!</li>
    <li> This product was not the original product!! I have bought this previously from Sephora and it is completely different consistency and doesn&#x27;t hold the color.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and when I first tried this omg! I never let it go. My eye shadows stayed on all day no creases or oil stains. It held everything in place</li>
    <li> This product left a crease in my shadow at the end of the day looking oily and run together. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone especially for this price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I heard it was better for oily eyelids than the Urban Decay primer. I guess I must have super oily lids, because it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. My eyeshadow creased within a couple hours. Going back to Bareminerals eye primer, that stuff lasts all day!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye shadow primer. It does exactly the job it&#x27;s intended to do. Keeps your eye makeup put. Get the glitter one, however, if you plan on wearing glittery eye shadow, obviously, as this primer isn&#x27;t suited for the glitter. Other than that, love this product!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about having non-creasing eye shadow after living with that problem for many years but this really cures that! I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup that needs to last more than 6 hours very often, but when I do I always use this as the primer.  You just use a tiny bit so this will last me forever. Shake the tube well to mix the creme and oil otherwise you&#x27;ll get a bunch more oil than you want.</li>
    <li> Primer is essential in making your eyeshadow last all day.  Since this doesn&#x27;t have any tint or color to it, I use this under my lower lash line to keep my eyeliner in place. I use TFSI on my lid every day as well, but some days I use the champagne one instead. Just depends on the look I am going for. Works just as good as the Urban Decay primers.</li>
    <li> Holds as it promisses, reduces fines lines appearance and lets ly eyeliner/shadow last for looooong all day till the evening and beyond...it&#x27;s not waterproof but it won&#x27;t be removed without make up remover.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product for a long time. My friend strongly recommended this as a eyeshadow primer But, I&#x27;m not sure how old this is Cuz  this primer looks like too old and Crumpled box.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have always had the problem of my eye makeup ending up on my face no matter how I apply it, what&#x27;s applied before, and after- no matter. This keeps my eyeliner and mascara in place.  It&#x27;s translucent and matte.  DuWop makes a great one, too.</li>
    <li> i love this product  really help to keep the eyeshadow on for hours !</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and eyelids. This product is awesome. I&#x27;ve never been able to wear eyeshadow for more than 3 hours before it creases. With this shadow primer, my shadow lasts all day at work. I&#x27;ve never been able to wear eyeshadow to work! I love it!</li>
    <li> Primer works really well for oily and greasy lids. There were no signs of creasing if you use the right amount. Product came the next day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small miracle in a tube! My eyeshadow lasts ALL day, with no creasing, none.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a lot to pay for such a small amount, but it takes so little to make my eyeshadow last that it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands before with the same claims, but none have worked as well as advertised, this does.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it was opened and messy...</li>
    <li> I used to use this almost every day. But since I&#x27;ve started to wear Benefit&#x27;s creaseless cream eyeshadow I don&#x27;t have to use a primer any longer because that stuff does not budge at all. In fact it is hard to get off. Back to this product. I&#x27;ve used about 20 different eye primers and this wins hands down. Also it does not irritate the eyes like some others do. I would recommend this for eye shadow staying power.</li>
    <li> So this is a very, very good base for eyeshadow. It stays put all day long and into the night too! The only drawback I have with it is it tends to dry out the skin on my eyelids if I leave my makeup on for more than 9 or 10 hours. Like I said it does its job a little too well by blocking/absorbing the oil from my skin so the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease or fade, but does make it a little dry after long periods of wear.</li>
    <li> This stuff really blows to me. About an hour after I put it on, my shadow starts to crease even before I get to work. Maybe it works for other people, but this will not be used by me again. I will happily go back to my Shiseido Hydro-Powder eye shadow, which NEVER creases the whole day. I&#x27;ll just put my shadow on top of it :-)</li>
    <li> After thinking about it and considering the product for forever I finally took the plunge and bought it. I must say I REALLY like it! It does what it claims: keeps your eye shadow in place all day long without fading and dramatically creasing. It also makes the color go on much better. All you need is a tiny dab. A little goes a long way and I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday so I know this tube will last forever! Get it!</li>
    <li> Item came to me used and when I opened makeup poured out. I had to return it. I went to ulta and bought urban decay primer. That stuff is amazing. I would not purchase makeup online ever again!</li>
    <li> My eye shadow lasted all day!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad eye primer. My eyeshadow last almost 8 hrs with this primer. But every time I squeeze the tube, there are some clear liquid (oil) came out first. I tried to shake the tube, but it still happens every time I open the tube.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. I don&#x27;t know if this is not the real two faced product. I&#x27;ve had this primer before, then I started using urban decay. And I decided to go back to two faced. This particular product creases like crazy. I am usually out of my house at 9 am and come home at 10 pm.  By 3 pm my make is gone. Even though I use setting spray on top of it. Don&#x27;t buy this. This is waste of your money. I ended up going and getting Mac&#x27;s primer potion. I have tons of two faced products and I am happy with each one of them, and previous years I&#x27;ve used this primer I never had any problems. Sad...</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product but I have very oily lids and I still get makeup meltdown under my eyes by lunch time even when I use it.  I&#x27;m going back to Urban Decay Primer Potion because it worked better for me.  If you don&#x27;t have very oily lids I suggest Too Faced Shadow Insurance because the tube allows you to get more out of it than the Primer Potion bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with eyeshadow disappearing after a couple of hours.  So I decided to try this stuff.  It kept my eyeshadow perfect from 5:30 PM when I put it on until 1:30 AM when I took it off.  This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
    <li> I like a lot of the too faced products but this eyeshadow base proved not to be crease free. I still think MAC paints are the best. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product, or any other that claims to help with the issue of eyeshadow creasing.  I have tried everything out there and nothing ever worked for me.  I have extremely oily eyelids and even my mascara ends up under and over my eyes!  I received this primer yesterday and used it today for the first time.  I simply cannot believe my eyes.  My eyeshadow looks like it did when I put it on at 6 am, and it&#x27;s 2pm in the afternoon!  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.  Do these folks also make mascara?  If so, I&#x27;m buying that too.  Get this stuff. You won&#x27;t be sorry you spent the money on it!</li>
    <li> i have oily skin so i always have mirror ready in my purse to check OFTEN if my eyeliner smudged, but this product change that scenario. I no longer need to check check check coz my eyeliner will stay for 10 hours! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have oily lids and before I started using eyeshadow primer, after a couple of hours my makeup would disappear into my crease.  By the end of the night it would look like I had no eye makeup on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too Faced Shadow Insurance is a great eyeshadow primer.  This stuff does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned in my Urban Decay Potion Primer review that I find UDPP and Too Faced Shadow Insurace to be equivalent.  I use them interchangeably and have not found that one is better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having problems with your eye makeup creasing, fading, or \\&quot;disappearing,\\&quot; using an eyeshadow base will solve your problem.  Definitely try one!</li>
    <li> I use this primer EVERY DAY, I cannot live without it since I have very oily eyelids and my eyeshadow never seemed to stick or stay put on them, always seemed to crease and fade by the end of the day, but ever since I started using this primer my shadow actually stays put. I was about ready to just give up on wearing eyeshadow period and figure it was a hopeless cause until I found this product and read such good reviews and I&#x27;m so happy I caved and bought it, it works wonders.  Oh and not only does it help my shadow stay put and actually last all day, but the colors are more vibrant and noticeable, which is wonderful since I tend to use very subtle and light colors on my lids and used to have to cake on layer after layer throughout the day, but not anymore, one maybe two layers and bam I&#x27;m good for the day.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever given anything I&#x27;ve reviewed 5 stars, but this deserves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even wear that much eye makeup but this didn&#x27;t work at all, I ended up sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> An eyeshadow primer that actually works!!!!! The best on the market bY FAR! I have tried them all and I still have creases and very little color left at the end of the day, until now! This stuff is fabulous and I will never try another. You will NOT regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I hate putting eye shadow because it would crease and look oily by late morning. I tried Sephora brand primer and it was horrible - I still had smudgey eye shadow and creases. My friend told me to try Too Faced Shadow Insurance and I am amazed how wonderful the product it. It is so worth the money. I have not had to re-apply my shadow in the middle of the day. It last alll day and night. It is simply amazing. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other shadow primers by Too Faced. I will be a long time user!     Recommend 100%!</li>
    <li> I have oily eyelids (go figure) and this product does really seem to keep my eyeshadow from creasing and coming off too early. You only use a small amount and with the size of the tube, I&#x27;ll have it for a while.  Recommend it for people with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely manner. The owner of the company left me a personal note regarding how she strives on making customer service a priority which I admire. I never write a comment due to lack of time, but the fact I received a note from her meant a lot to me. So thank you Kim. And, I LOVE my product. I&#x27;ll never use another eye primer again! Have a good one and much success to your business.&lt;br /&gt;Ashlee</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eye primer I have tried. It lasts at least 6-8 hours before I see any creasing. Easy to apply, and makes the shadow colors deeper, so I apply less of it. Great product!</li>
    <li> Good primer. Holds eyeshadow like a champ ;)&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
    <li> This is Ah-mazing!!! It sets the eyeshadow and brings out the color in such a nice way!   My eye makeup normally lasts a long time but this just brings out the color! and it   will not crease.    The tube is actually rather small so i really felt that my money had been stolen but the   thing is that you only need a TINY drop for each eye, so this can last a long time and unlike  the other primers such a Urban Decay, you can squeeze the tube to get ALL your product and   since you dont expose all the product to air everytime you use it will not spoil (I know this  is something that bothers me whenever i buy something and gets ruined before i even use half   of it).    Overall I think this is a Steal! And the shipment also comes with a Vitamin Serum A&amp;D which,   well, is free for you to try out and I dont know if it&#x27;s just me but I does feel like it works  and smoothes the skin around my eyes.   &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I had seen this product used in many online makeup tutorials so I thought I would give it a try.  I was very skeptical about it, however, I am extremely pleased to say that it indeed does work as advertised.  I have very oily skin and my eyelids are no exception.  Without this product, my eyeshadow would crease after several hours.  Now I can wear eyeshadow, even with a cream based product under it, and I still have no creasing after 8 hours.  It feels very silky when applied and a little bit goes a very long way.  The tube design also allows you to get all the product from the container.  This product is amazing and is well worth the money.  I highly recommend this product!    Update 10 Feb 2011: After a couple months of use, I have found that this product does crease.  The results are inconsistent.  Some days it may last eight hours without creasing, some days just three hours.  What I did find to work for me is putting this primer down first and then MAC&#x27;s Painterly paint pot on top of that before applying eyeshadow.  I&#x27;ve had consistently great results this way.  Most days I can go 8 hours without creasing and have gone as long as 12 hours (maybe more if I tried) and still look great.  Neither alone works as good as they do together.  Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long if you have oily eyelids. The Urban Decay one is the best for me but I&#x27;m glad to have tried this product out.</li>
    <li> This product is the best! I&#x27;ve tried many! I live in an extremely hot and humid country, so i need my makeup to hold and not to melt. This product makes his work!</li>
    <li> This primer works great~ I am awake for up to 20 hours a day, and at the time I&#x27;m about to go to bed, it still looks great! thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Too Faced products before a few weeks ago, when I was actually in Sephora looking for a good hairspray (tip: Bumble and Bumble products!!!) But I walked by the Too Faced counter and saw this little item, was curious and decided to give it a try. I have never not had a problem with crease lines halfway through my day or night, which as I&#x27;m sure pretty much all women reading this know is such a pain and looks so sloppy. (Even my boyfriend, who is so oblivious to 99% of my makeup/fashion blunders, admitted when I asked him if he ever noticed my shadow creases.)  But this product? AMAZING. This is a staple for every woman&#x27;s makeup bag and morning routine. Dab a bit of this in the morning and your shadow is good to go ALL DAY LONG - I even went for a run a couple of weeks ago with my shadow still on and it STILL didn&#x27;t smudge! At night, removing it is as simple as a brush of makeup remover or just warm water. I will never again be without this product, and I am definitely singing the praises of Too Faced from now on.  Sidenote - Too Faced&#x27;s face primer is an equally amazing product as well :)</li>
    <li> Stayed on all night! Urban decay was ok and nars never worked for me. MAC irritated my eyes but two faced was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing light weight base for your eyes that lasts all day.  You will save quite a bit here on Amazon vs. buying it at Ulta.  Strongly recommend trying it out - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wearing this primer definitely makes a difference for a couple of hours, but eventually my eyeshadow begins to rub off and crease. Will probably try something else next time. It may just be impossible to find anything worthwhile since I live in central Florida where it&#x27;s humid 24/7 and I have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I just received my Shadow Insurance last week and have been using it every day. In the past I have been loyal to Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion.  I immediately liked the consistency and feel of this primer over UD and the packaging is smarter to ensure product is not wasted or dried out.  (Although I know UD has changed from a wand to a squeeze tube too).  My eyeshadow definitely stays on better with Shadow Insurance although at least from this initial week I think that UD&#x27;s Primer Potion is actually more effective at keeping eyeshadow on - although maybe I need to play around with the shadow insurance more.  That said, this works very well and it spreads easier on my lids and feels silkier than UD.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow Insurance from Too Faced is awesome!  I&#x27;ve used one other eyelid primer and I wasn&#x27;t happy with it - it got clumpy and seemed to magnify the creases on my lids.  I wore Eyeshadow Insurance today for the first time and it is wonderful! It goes on very smooth (a little goes a long way) and my lids were ready for makeup right away. I wear matte shadow and this has held my shadow in place all day while keeping the creases away. After today I&#x27;m not sure I would ever apply my eye makeup again without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this with a Too Faced eye shadow palette for my wedding make-up. I can definitely tell the difference between when I use the primer and when I do not. I use a little on my eyebrows, and it helps keep the powder to darken my eyebrows from smearing or wearing down. I will say that if you have a long day, or if your face is really oily, the effects of the primer won&#x27;t last as long. If I am working for 12 hours, I notice that there is a minor eyeshadow crease that forms. Overall, the quality is amazing and it definitely helps enhance my make-up application.</li>
    <li> Though this is perfect for some people, it&#x27;s very drying. I put it on over a water-base moisturizer, and that helped, but it was still very dry and made my eyelids look like crepe paper. I think it would be perfect for a very young person who also has oily eyelids. One plus is that it truly will hold your shadow until you remove it with a remover.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to receive the product cause I&#x27;ve been looking for a great primer for a LONG time. It does the job although I believe an applicator would have assisted. As for it having long wear in the tropics, it depends on the type/ brand you pair with it in terms of  base (foundation/ powder)and shadow. It generally goes with all the brands, from M.A.C. straight down to Avon. This is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something to help make my eye makeup last all day without touchup. This product does the job and without eye irritation. I love this product and recommend it to anyone having a problem with eye shadows fading or if you have oily eye lids.</li>
    <li> great product. it really works. no smell. no bad reaction. simple to use. eyeshadow stays all day. very good product.</li>
    <li> I have very oily eye lids so I need an eye shadow primer before I apply my eye shadow. This one works great!!!!! I have tried a few other primers they work great for some of my eye shadows but not all. So i wanted one that would work for all my eye shadows. I was hesitant to try this because to be honest I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to pay the money. But it was well worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect. This is my first eye primer and it worked really good! I would buy the other one if I use it all.</li>
    <li> was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time</li>
    <li> This product is ok! Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. After a few hours I started to see creases in my eyeshadow. Wasn&#x27;t very happy.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye primer I have ever used. I have extremely dry skin and other primers tend to dry me out and make me look flaky. With too faced I can wear my eye make up all day with out having to worry if my eyeshadow has faded or not. I do recommend applying it with your finger instead of a brush because it can be a little hard to spread evenly. A little goes a LONG way so only apply a nerd size amount. I don&#x27;t really recommend this for people with oily lids.</li>
    <li> I hate it when eyeshadow disappears before the day is over.  This shadow base works well to keep my eyeshadow on until I&#x27;m ready to take it off.</li>
    <li> This item deffinitely is a fake! I purchased one a year ago and adored the product. My shadows lasted for 12-16 hours. With this fake product, my shadows become greasy in 4 hours and after 8 hours they can disappear. I can see difference even in shape of product bottles and in their design.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, do not buy it here.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my daughter raved about it, saying it kept her eye shadow in tact the entire day. She said her eye shadow looked the same at the end of the day as when she applied it. I don&#x27;t find it to be much different than what I was using before. However, my daughter said she was using Too Faced eye shadow as well, which I do not. Perhaps that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Fake. I have been buying this product for YEARS from Sephora and without a doubt this product is fake. It is too creamy/runny, and looks more like a lotion. Creases by 11:00 a.m. as where the real product does does not budge until you wash off. The only good thing I got out of this order was a free liquid eyeliner which actually surprised me because it works so well. As far as the primer, I wish I would have saved my money. Just stick to Sephora people.</li>
    <li> I hoped this product would be a cost-effective alternative to Urban Decay&#x27;s shadow primer. However, while I liked the packaging and the price, the product itself fell far short of my expectations.  I have oily skin, and wearing eye shadow without a base results in noticeable creases by the end of the work day. Use of the Urban Decay primer keeps the shadow looking satisfactory throughout an average day. This product failed to do so, and actually appears to have worsened the tendency of my eye shadow to migrate into the folds of my eyelids. It may be passable for those with dry skin, but I do not recommend it as a good alternative for oily skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it every day under powder eye shadow and eyeliner. My shadow and liner stays in place all day.</li>
    <li> Does an ok job in being the &#x27;primer&#x27; for the eye shadow. Did not provide the layer that would keep the eye shadow oil free.</li>
    <li> Im totally blow away with this product,it makes my eyeshadow last all day long YES I KNOW, but its true i work all day and dont have the need to retouch my eyeshadow.    Amaizing and u totally most have it to make your eyeshadows POP all day long.</li>
    <li> This was my second tube of this particular eye shadow primer.  The first tube seemed to work very well.  The day that I changed to this second tube, it was like a completely different product.  It didn&#x27;t last nearly as long; it creased within only several hours.  I really think they changed their formula.  If they didn&#x27;t, then the quality of the product must be quite variable.</li>
    <li> Works well to hold and not crease eye-shadow.  I had my daughter try it also as she is a server in a very busy restaurant and she was very impressed with this product also and really liked it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this primer!  I have tried a few others (not naming any specifically) and this was hands down THE best.  I work in a really stressful environment and routinely put in ten to twelve hour days and my eyeshadow and liner don&#x27;t budge an inch.  Seriously, they only come off when I clean my face at night with eye makeup remover.  You cannot go wrong in purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver!  I ordered a sample size and wow was I surprised at how long I could keep my eye makeup looking fresh.  I have very oily eyelids and now that problem is solved.  I was wasting money on clinique eye makeup and now I can wear drugstore brands with no problem.  I was able to keep my eye makeup frest all day even through a hot humid day at a cookout and then at night in the hot tub.  I was amazed!</li>
    <li> * I am really happy I got the small travel size Too Faced primer  * Goes on very smoothly, get the most out of it when I first apply the Studio Gear Primer  * Most face primers cause me to break out, but the one that took the longest to break me out was the Hard Candy or Too Faced Face Primers  * Would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> I bought this locally after hearing my friend rave about it. So I decided to give it a try and was amazed at the results. My eyeshadows stayed on all day no problem!!! All you need is a little because it definetly goes a long way!!! Will repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> After looking at and trying several different eye primers (my eyelids are VERY oily), I think I&#x27;ve finally found one that I like and that I can actually afford.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this performs any miracles, but my eyeshadow generally stays in place without much creasing when I wear the primer, even after 11-hour days at work.  I do have a little bit of creasing if I&#x27;ve been wearing shadow all day, but like I said, my eyelids are above-average oily, and they look MUCH better if I have applied the primer before my shadow in the morning.</li>
    <li> Like many folks, I sometimes buy products based on positive reviews. This time, the product didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.      I&#x27;d been looking for an eye makeup base that works better and lasts longer than drugstore brands (such as Almay Bright Eyes). My face is oily, even around the eyes, so it&#x27;s hard to have fresh-looking makeup for more than a couple of hours.     I applied Shadow Insurance according to directions, but after a few hours my eye shadow and liner began to crease and run as usual.    While I don&#x27;t regret buying Shadow Insurance, next time I&#x27;ll try a new beauty product in person before buying it online.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on purchasing this because it&#x27;s a small amount for $10, but I decided on it anyway. When it arrived, I was eager to try it, and even said I wasn&#x27;t going to wear makeup until it got here. When I put it on I didn&#x27;t really think much was going to change, until 6 hours later I checked the mirror and everything was still in place! I was so impressed with it. Even my crease makeup was staying instead of running into my base. I compared it by not using this the next day and 3 hours later my eye shadow looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer is pretty much amazing. Now I can wear eye shadow and not be self-conscious about my eyes if I&#x27;m going out for a few hours. :)</li>
    <li> this primer is fantastic. It keeps your eyeshadow on for hours, and pretty much every other primer i&#x27;ve tried hasn&#x27;t been able to do the same. You just squeeze a teeny tiny little dot on your finger, and it spreads all across your eyelid and beyond. It has lasted months for me, i&#x27;m finally starting to run a little low. It doesn&#x27;t make your eyeshadow any more noticeably vibrant, as many reviews have said. It does make them a bit more saturated, and they last all day. I would most definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> great product.  Meets my needs.</li>
    <li> I was so psyched to try this as opposed to UD...I didn&#x27;t do so well with it...my eyeshadow creased in a couple of hours and I don&#x27;t even wear that much!!  **SIGH!** :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have a chance to try this product, since I fly a lot, and the bottle exploded on the first flight I took it on.  Made a big mess on all my other products (which have managed to stay nicely sealed through a lot of flights).  I still haven&#x27;t gotten all the gunk off.</li>
    <li> Whatever you do DO NOT buy the urban Decay Primer Potion! It is a waste of money since you cant get all of the product out of the bottle because of the brush and you just end up throwing away ALOT of product! And it $35! Not worth it. The Too Faced is only $18! Which is a steal because it works just as good as the Urban Decay, if not BETTER! All in all i would recommend this to a friend, and repurchase for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> most amazing primer ever, Ive used this for about 2 years and Im in LOOVOEE! it makes my eyeshadows smooth and perfectly perfect!</li>
    <li> I just loved it from the first day i got it! I didn&#x27;t believe that shadow primer could work for me, but after first time i used it, i couldn&#x27;t believe that shadows actually stayed all day and looked like freshly applied! I have oily-combination skin. so everybody with the same problem, don&#x27;t doubt and buy this product!</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow stays put when you use this, plus the colors are the same as in the palette.  BUT only if you are using quality eye shadow.  And if your buying this, Im pretty sure your splurging for Urban Decay or the likes of.......I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse, and it is a pleasant surprise to see my makeup looking fresh after my shift.  I don&#x27;t look fresh, but my eye shadow is!</li>
    <li> It gets runny and has to be squeezed out until the oil gets mixed.</li>
    <li> I was a little leary since I buy most of my makeup from sephora. I didn&#x27;t know if this would be authentic but it is!  It blends sheer. you need very very little (little bit bigger then the tip of the tube but not by much and it will do both eyes). Product sets quick and is very blendable.  The great thing I just purchased this and I got it very quick!! Super excited and the first day I used it was the hottest/humid day we have had and no budge on my eye shadow.  Its a must try for a great price! THANK U!!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow primer! It makes my lids oil-free and eyeshadow (and eyeliner for that matter) stay put and crease free. I read in another review that someone used it just to keep her lids oil-free and used no eyeshadow. It also lasts a long time since you just need a very small amount. One thing that is a little difficult is blending eyeshadow because it is very slightly sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are into fancy eyeshadow blending.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good deal here. It works really well. I use this more then the urban decay one</li>
    <li> I bought this under the recommendation of a youtube user after seeing them use it countless times and I must say that it works wonders. I can wear my makeup for close to and sometimes over 10 hours with no creasing, where before it would crease up within an hour or 2. You don&#x27;t need to use much at all, just the tiniest pinch, so it lasts forever. Hint though, I&#x27;ve seen people comment that their&#x27;s was a little watery or thin; sometimes I have to shake/squeeze mine to mix it up before use.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I use it every day.  Does everything it is supposed to do.  I use both the regular and the candle light ones.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing this under my eyeshadow and it totally works.  I have to confess that I sometimes crash immediately when I get home after a night out.  I wake up and my eyeshadow&#x27;s still flawless!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and use it daily. It works very well to eliminate eye shadow creases and a little goes a long way.  I like the color of it too. I would definitely purchase this product this again.</li>
    <li> I watched so many review for this product and I was very excited to try it as I thought I&#x27;d finally found a solution to makeup caking in my eyelid creases. Alas, it did nothing for me. I tried varying amounts of the product thinking I was just using it wrong but it just never held up nor kept my eyeshadow from fading. Totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> works great use a small amount to cover lid and then apply eye shadow  there will be no crease and eye shadow stays on better.</li>
    <li> i swear by eyeshadow primer, and i have to say this is the best one. i could fall asleep and my makeup would still be on my face. its a mush have.</li>
    <li> I seriously question whether the tube I received is actually Too Faced eye-shadow primer. I got this because I bought a Too Faced eye-shadow pallet and I had used a sample of this I got from Sephora that worked really well. The full size one I bought here doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL, after only a couple hours all my eyeshadow is in the crease of my eye. I have the Urban Decay in Greed (its shimmery) and I love it so I think I&#x27;m just going to make the trip to Sephora and buy a tube of that in the original Potion shade for when I don&#x27;t want my eye-shadow to be iridescent. I am absolutely returning this for a full refund and I won&#x27;t be trusting this seller ever again. I purchased this from LimitlessBeauty</li>
    <li> i dont think this too faced primer was the real deal. you get what you pay for. its decent but definitely better off buying it at sephora</li>
    <li> It certainly goes on nude tone and is like a puddy, so shadow really sticks. I have oily skin and I notice after my eight hour shift the shadow remains on, but its a bit shiny on my lids.</li>
    <li> I bought the candlelight type in Sephora store and is great the moment u applied it it dry ready for ur eyeshadow, the one I bought in amazon is very liquid and doesn&#x27;t work I think is fake, I don&#x27;t like it:-/</li>
    <li> **Insurance you can&#x27;t put your eye make up on without!!  As a gift, I was given an adorable Too Faced travel make up kit that included a few trial size products.  The best one of them was the Too Faced Shadow Insurance!!  Not only does it prevent awful creases of eye color on my eye lids, but it makes my eye lid color pop!!  When I apply eyeliner to my lash line or above the lash line, it prevents smudging or smearing of my liners.  I generally will use a small bit of the Shadow Insurance underneath my bottom lid to keep eyeliner in place there, as well.  I receive so many compliments on how vibrant my eye lid colors are when I use Shadow Insurance as a base/primer for my eye lids.  I have tried several other comparable products, but they just do not meet the qualities &amp; expectations that I receive from Too Faced Shadow Insurance!!  It is definitely a must have!!!</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this stuff I was skeptical, and honestly I would never have tried it had I not received a free sample.  Now it&#x27;s one of my makeup \\&quot;must-haves.\\&quot;  It gives your eyelids a nice, smooth surface to work on, intensifies your eyeshadow colors, and definitely helps your makeup last. I&#x27;ve used this product before going to concerts, clubs, bars, etc. and at the end of the night my makeup was still going strong.  Also, a little goes a long way so the tube lasts forever.  Really, if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this item I highly recommend buying it at least once and giving it a try.  I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Too Faced Primer for quite a while and immediately I noticed the tube and packaging is slightly different. The next thing I noticed is that the smell, color, and texture are all different. You guessed it, this primer did nothing to keep my eye makeup from creasing and wearing off.</li>
    <li> I love this primer, works well for everyday makeup and special occasions. Lasts really long. I have been using this product for years and I have tried others but this is just my go to. I love most product I purchased by too faced. The primer itself lasts really long and you don&#x27;t need much so be careful to not squeeze the tube to hard.</li>
    <li> It was good, but I have oily eyelids so my eye make up would crease by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Glides on the eyelids easily and keeps eye shadow in place all day.  I&#x27;m happy with the product. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Keeps your shadow from running away or disappearing, wonderful product.  A must have for everyone&#x27;s makeup bag, home or on the go,</li>
    <li> I recently got into the makeup scene and needed a good eye shadow base to make my more vibrant colored looks pop, and this certainly did the job. it kepy my makeup fresh looking all day, didnt crease, and kept my eyeshadows vibrant. I chose this one over urban decays primer because the urban decay bottle is shaped funny and you cant get all the product out, so you end up throwing away a third of the bottle. not a problem with this product! it also lasts a really long time, ive used it every day for 4 months now and am still not out. my only complaint would be thats its matte, and I wouldnt mind a little shimmer. but still a great product :)</li>
    <li> I have no idea why everyone loves this product so much.  It comes out of the tube very runny.  When I apply it under makeup it makes it creases so much worse than if I was wearing nothing at all.  And the whole day I can feel it all greasy on my lids.  There is absolutely no benefit to this product!</li>
    <li> I use this primarily to clean up stray liquid eyeliner which is a trick a makup artist from sophora showed me, it&#x27;s better then liquid, easier to control application. I haven&#x27;t used it as a base but I bet it would be good too.</li>
    <li> Just for the record, this is Shawn&#x27;s wife reviewing this, not Shawn. This works so great! I have never before had my eye shadow last ALL DAY!!! This really makes it last - by the end of the day there is very moderate creasing, but the rest still looks great! I LOVE this stuff - works best when you allow it to dry before applying shadow.</li>
    <li> This really works. With only a little required each time, my eyeshadow lasted all day without any creases. The texture you get when you apply it is nice. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and is so lightweight. I used the Bobbi Brown cream stick before but it was a little rough, thick and chalky.</li>
    <li> I should have realized this was a fake when: the cap was a different color than the tube, the logo was different, the tip kept coming out, the color of the primer was cream rather than beige, it was very liquidy, and it didn&#x27;t seem to work for very long. I just bought another tube from Sephora and it was back to the right stuff, just like the one before I bought this. There is also a possibility that I developed infected eye lashes from this product as they were very itchy and falling out a week or so after I started using this. If you notice any of the attributes I described - beware. This was purchased from Sanchez Bargains. When you buy the real product, it works very well at holding your shadow and liner. The real prodduct is also good for brow fill-in applications too.</li>
    <li> its not the real too faced u get at sephora like i though it was it was way too runny and didnt make my shadow last at all wont be buying from them again. the tube looks almost identical to the real thing but if u look at the actual one from sephora it is slightly different</li>
    <li> I was debating whether to get the Shadow Insurance by Too Faced or the Primer Potion by Urban Decay. Let me say that I&#x27;m not sorry I got the Too Faced one!&lt;br /&gt;The primer is sort of thick and heavy but glides on my eyelids perfectly. It&#x27;s not too oily and my eyeshadow won&#x27;t budge after putting this on. Let me also say that the packaging is extremely cute. (Like all Too Faced products)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would find a product that would keep my eye makeup on without fixing it at least once a day until I walked into a Sephora store one day and asked one of the makeup specialists for their recommendation.  Typically, without an eye shadow primer, my eye makeup creases and runs off in just a couple of hours after it&#x27;s been applied.  This product, unlike many others that I&#x27;ve tried, keeps my eye shadow without even a hint of creasing for over 12 hours!! The fact that it comes in a tube, makes it so much easier to apply it without making any mess. What&#x27;s more, it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my eye shadow, and only a tiny drop of this product is all that&#x27;s needed to do the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love this primer!!! A little goes a really long way and feels good applying,very smooth. Other than Ud&#x27;s primer,nothing beats this. I find this is better than MAC&#x27;s primer,and significantly cheaper. You will not regret this purchase</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and item is what was described.</li>
    <li> As a make up artist,I have tried MANY MANY eye primers. This one is by far THE BEST. Your shadow doesn&#x27;t crease,it doesn&#x27;t fade,it doesn&#x27;t crumble and it stays put for hours. I will definitely be buying this again. My new favorite :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of this primer. It does make eyeshadows look brighter and last longer, but it often separates in the tube into the pigment (or whatever the tan part is) and oil. This primer is often too greasy for me, and it&#x27;s gross when it separates (so you have to knead the tube before use); the separation isn&#x27;t because I&#x27;ve had the product too long- it did that a week after I opened the brand new package. I also have really pale skin, and I find that if I get any primer above my crease, it looks yellow and cakey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a loooong time, everyday (not the same tube, of course!), and absolutely still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work outside somedays, and my eye shadow will not smear after sweating even.</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily eyelids and this helps my eyeshadow stay on pretty well. It&#x27;s not my favorite though</li>
    <li> This really helps keep my eye shadow on for a whole day. And it&#x27;s very durable. I purchased this quite a while ago and I&#x27;m still using it now. Will buy it again after I run out of this one.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works perfectly and prevents eyeshadow from creasing.  And you need to use just a little so it lasts a lot</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good eyeshadow primer after reading the reviews. I have pretty oily skin and this primer slides my shadow into the crease after a few hours. I&#x27;ve had much better luck using anti-chafing gel(Monistat)as a makeup and eyeshadow primer.</li>
    <li> On me, my eye shadow still creased.  With Urban Decay, my shadow never creases.  This is still better than others I have tried but not as good as Urban Decay or the Bare Minerals primer.</li>
    <li> This product really keeps my eyeshadow in place, even in humid conditions!  Love it and will buy again!  It also looks&lt;br /&gt;good alone for a fresh look.</li>
    <li> Works great! I work outside all day. I come inside and my makeup was always thrashed. Not after using the primer. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve probably seen my review before, but I had to share my opinion on this product to make sure. There are different sellers who sell this product and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to miss my review. So here goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this product sooner. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with my eyeshadow creasing not long after applying it. I have really oily eyelids, along with my forehead and nose. I would just reapply my eyeshadow and it just looked like a caked on mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bought the Too Faced Shadow Insurance and I am SO happy! To see a difference, I used the primer on one eyelid and none on the other. After only just three hours, the primerless eyelid was already creased and the shadow was fading. It looked terrible. How did I ever put up with this? The lid with primer was flawless! I checked every hour and it stayed put for over EIGHT hours! After about eight hours, the shadow did start to fade, but not as bad as the primerless eyelid. After 12 hours, I did notice a little creasing. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that the Urban Decay Primer Potion is really popular, so I got a small sample of it at Sephora to compare the two. Well, they were pretty much the same. The Too Faced did go on my eyelids more easily and it felt more silky. But the results were the same. Here&#x27;s my opinion. With the Urban Decay, the bottle design is really stupid. In order to get all the product in there, you have to literally saw the bottle into three parts. Then you have to scoop out the remaining product and put it in jars. And even if you do get all the remaining product, there&#x27;s a possibility that the product might dry out. Plus that doesn&#x27;t sound hygienically safe. I say get the Too Faced because the tube is squeezable, allowing you to get all the product inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought that this product wouldn&#x27;t work. I was skeptical because my eyelids are so oily. I was pleasantly surprised and now I&#x27;m sold. This will be a staple in my beauty routine. Go get it!e. Go get it!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow primer / base works fantastic. My shadow goes on nice and stays where I put it.  Urban Decay works well, too. I do have to use a Q-tip to put it on though. Unlike Urban Decay, Too Faced does not come with any type of applicator and the only way I can get it all across my eye lid is with the Q-tip. It comes just in a plain tube.  I should note that Too Faced is quite a bit cheaper than Urban Decay.  I&#x27;ll stick with Too Faced.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Wears all day long with no creases. Preserves the color of the shadow very well. I&#x27;ve done everything from yoga to chopping wood with this as a base under my eyeshadow and have been very pleased with how well this product does its job. I&#x27;m a repeat purchaser.</li>
    <li> I use eyshadow about everyday. I am still using the same tube I purchased in 2011.  This product goes a long ways. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is not a good primer.  I guess I will stick with loreal&#x27;s no crease primer works much better.  I was very disappointed</li>
    <li> This stuff is ah-mazing! My eye makeup stays on for well over 8 hour workdays without ever fading or creasing. You could rub your eyes and your eyeliner would still stay in place!</li>
    <li> I use less eyeshadow to achieve the same results when I use this primer vs without a primer. This little tube also lasts me several months. It is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this, but: it DOES crease into the lid.....&lt;br /&gt;And when i opened it, it came out too much product, it wasted a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;But,to save it, if you apply an amount of powder , maybe it is not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it may change from one person to another, but for me at least it didn&#x27;t work as good as expected.</li>
    <li> I have tried other eye shadow primers before and this one by far is the best! Your eye makeup stays on perfectly all day and even if you sleep with it (it happens) you&#x27;ll be shocked at how perfect it still is in the morning, eye liner and all! I even put it under my eyebrows (i have to really fill them in) and it helps greatly with that too! I will use this forever!</li>
    <li> I apply this with a q-tip and it does what it is meant to do. I have had to use this as a glitter glue in an emergency, and it doubled as that as well. This little tube will last a pretty decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Got this for before attending a wedding in mid summer. Holding up well even in the heat and humidity. Wish I&#x27;d found it sooner.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye primer. It&#x27;s better than the Urban Decay one. It goes on really smoothly, and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Maybe it will work OK; I don&#x27;t know yet. However, it&#x27;s disappointing to order a fake product. I should have noticed the package design was a little different.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years! Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered &amp; used off a major makeup retailer. Consistency seemed a tad different, but works great! If you want your shadow to stay in place all day, order it!</li>
    <li> The best eyeshadow primer bar none! No creasing or fading after over 9 hrs of wear, even in very humid weather.</li>
    <li> This shadow primer makes your eye shadows go on smoothly and stay put for the whole day. I have purchased 3 or 4 of them already.</li>
    <li> I have very oily eyelids and have had a very hard time finding an eye shadow or primer that would stay on for more than a couple of hours.  This worked for about 4 hours before it creased.  Purchased NYX HD Eye shadow Primer and my eye shadow stays on ALL DAY LONG!</li>
    <li> I had used this years ago and don&#x27;t remember any problems with it then.  But this time my eyeshadow comes off pretty fast, as if I didn&#x27;t put this eyeshadow primer on at all.  I think I may have more oily eyelids than other people.  I&#x27;ve always been happy with Urban Decay, I&#x27;m going back to their product.</li>
    <li> So I have combination skin (oily/dry) and have found that most primers don&#x27;t really do any good and leave me looking horrible and make the eye shadow just smear. Definitely not the case with this primer. I don&#x27;t really have to use a lot and it stays on all day. I am super pale and was worried it would be too dark, but it blends in perfectly with my foundation.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye shadow primers and this is one of my favorites.  It goes on silky smooth and makes the shadow last all day.</li>
    <li> Eye shadow is so much more vibrant when you use a primer and it stays all day! You don&#x27;t even really realize how much your eye shadow comes off during the day until you try using a primer. The first primer I bought was Urban Decay and their&#x27;s are awesome, but thought I&#x27;d try this too since it&#x27;s a little less expensive and I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s just as good! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> this ieye primer is GREAT!!!! Came in the mail FAST and lives up to all standards!!! Especially if u are a smoker! People who smoke have oily lids and with this eye primer, ur makeup stays put, even in 90 degree weather!!!</li>
    <li> Fabuloso producto! ha sido una recomendación de una amiga, y ha sido de gran utilidad. las sombras quedan intactas en el ojo por muchas horas. La entrega fue antes de lo esperado.  -    Fabulous product! a friend recommended this product and has been very useful. The shades are intact in the eye by many hours. The delivery was sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-works well for liquid liners and non-cream eye shadows&lt;br /&gt;-feels a little greasy going on, but greasiness goes away&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t work too well for cream based liners&lt;br /&gt;-very unforgiving for mistakes (I have to use makeup remover to remove mistakes-which I guess can also be a pro)</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me and I love it.  I am 46 yrs old and my eyeshadow just wasn&#x27;t staying put anymore, nor my eyeliners, this product keeps eye make up on ALL day. I have continued to purchase the product.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A girl told me about this years ago at Sephora.  I have been using it ever since and it&#x27;s so great, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.  I hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> works great! no creases with my eye shadow anymore, still looks good in the morning if i forget to wash it off!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my eyeshadow settling into the creases of my eyelids throughout the day. This product completely solves that problem. It&#x27;s easy to use and totally worth the price. Love it!</li>
    <li> Simply works. and feels good on the eyelid. I haven&#x27;t tried others, this is my first primer, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be looking for another.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for almost 3 years now, everyday.  I use it on my eyebrows and top eye lids to keep my powders and eye pencils in place.  It secures all make up for a full, 10 hour day.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading lots of positive reviews.  I am very pleased with this product.  I totally noticed my eyeshadow lasting ALL DAY and looking really fresh even though I hadn&#x27;t touched it in hours.  A little goes a long way so I feel like the price was well worth it.  I was using e.l.f. primer and so this is a huge step forward for me and for $7 more it was so much better quality!  A good buy!</li>
    <li> good eye primer even though not the best. help to make the eye makeup stay longer and show the color more.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I thought I was getting a great deal.  The color and consistency of this product is the same - however, it does not prevent creasing AT ALL.  In fact, I think it accelerated the rate at which my eyeshadow creased.  I am disappointed and will be throwing this tube out - who knows where this product is from, and what kind of harmful chemicals it may contain.</li>
    <li> I got my product earlier than the expected date. Brand new in its box like it was said! I&#x27;m beyond happy with my purchase! I use it everyday, so I definitely needed to get it, so when I saw it available at this price, I had to try it out.... Don&#x27;t regret it at all!!!! :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t liked too much.</li>
    <li> Is it me or this product came in like an empty tube? i gotta squeeze so hard to get the primer out. Is it design like this because i felt like this product was shipped for me after the owner almost done using or something?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer for years now but wanted to try something new so I bought this one. The quality was not even close to Urban Decay&#x27;s. I wear a good amount of makeup and love to make up my eyes with shadow, over eyeliner, mascara, etc… and with Urban Decay, I almost never see any creases on my eyelid, at least for a good amount of hours.. but with this Too Faced primer, I had makeup everywhere and lots of creasing. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> This review starts with a sad story.  My phone, which is my life, was stolen at work tonight.  Needless to say, I was bawling my eyes out as I questioned staff, searched and finally called the police (for my phone insurance, etc).  My mascara smeared.  My eye make up did not.  I was bawling and wiping, not really scrubbing or rubbing my eyes, but plenty of tears.  I still had lots of make up to remove when I got home, and it was pretty much in the same place as it was.  I was happy with it before, I use it every day and my eye shadow makes it through my shift every time.  But the fact that it held up with crying, that my eyes were swollen and red but at least my eye make up stayed put!  Doesn&#x27;t make up for the loss of my phone but it was at least one good thing of the day.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, works very well to keep eye shadow looking flawless all day long. Worth the investment and is cheaper than urban decay yet still does an equally effective job.</li>
    <li> I should of went with my gut instinct that this was a fake... The packaging is similar but not the same... And the product is more liquidly than a matte finish that it&#x27;s suppose to leave like the REAL primer... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Go buy the real s***!</li>
    <li> first time i&#x27;ve used an eyeshadow primer... and it works well! will buy again when i run out of it</li>
    <li> This stuff makes me look like a raccoon because I want to look like a raccoon, and no longer because my eyeliner melts down my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, this stuff works great. I put it all around my eyes (using as little as possible to not waste it), wait about 30 seconds, then go to town with my eyeliner. I used to have issues with it melting into creases around my eyelids or getting wiped off by my tired (or drunk, or absentminded) self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it will be a little harder to get a smudgy/smoky eyed look, but it is doable. Just don&#x27;t mess up because you&#x27;ll then have to take off the makeup and base to do the entire eye.</li>
    <li> Use it every day because if I don&#x27;t my eyeshadow disappears by noon!</li>
    <li> Have always used Urban decay, thought I&#x27;d try this, love it actually easier to use, because it&#x27;s in a tube form so you get all the product, and I think it&#x27;s a little easier to apply.......gets 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> Primer creased. After reading the reviews, I was really hopeful! The smashbox primer works great.</li>
    <li> I am so rushed to put my makeup on and have NO patience.  LOVE this - takes 3 seconds to apply - just a tiny amount.  But makes eye makeup so easy to apply and it stays in place!!  Highly recommend.  I am in my 50&#x27;s, getting saggy creases - and this stuff really helps.</li>
    <li> I love too faced products and i love their shadow insurance. This is one of the best eye primers i have used in awhile. I had this a couple of years ago and when i ran out i was so sad. I never got around to buying it again so i was just using foundation or concealer for awhile. I just bought this again this week and oh my how i have missed it. It not only blends well into my skin but it helps make my eye-shadow brighter and more intense and will not budge. Usually i would be reapplying my eye-shadow through out the day as i live in Florida and it is august so is hot and humid, and it feels like your face is going to melt off,  but with this primer i don&#x27;t have to do anything. This stuff makes anything stay. It even works on really cheap eye-shadow that is hard to get to its true color and it makes any eye-shadow so much easier to blend. I highly recommend this product and this will always be my go to primer.</li>
    <li> This past year I have become a bit of a makeup junkie, purchasing several high-end products for the very first time. Most of these purchases have been in the form of MAC eyeshadows, which retail for either $11.00 or $14.50 each (depending on whether you get them in a pan or a pot). Because I began spending so much on eyeshadow, I wanted to make sure that it would not fade or crease throughout the day. I was getting recommendations for both Too Faced Shadow Insurance and Urban Decay Primer Potion, but because they are the same price and have equally favorable reviews, I went with the less complicated packaging and chose Too Faced Shadow Insurance. Overall, I give TFSI a rating of 4. Not only is the tube super convenient, but the product sticks to its promise of prolonging the wear of eyeshadow by preventing creases/fading. And for those of you who are wondering, this product isn&#x27;t just designed for higher-end shadows. Many of my drugstore shadows display an increase lasting power and become super blendable when applied over a thin layer of this. And because TFSI is tinted, it also evens out eyelid discoloration and makes the eyes look a bit brighter. Sometimes, if I do not feel like putting on eyeshadow, I will just apply a small bit of this to make me look more awake--it&#x27;s a bit like foundation, but with a MUCH thinner consistancy and only for your eyelids. Because a little goes a long way (you will only need a small dot about half the size of the head of thumbtack), TFSI lasts for awhile. I have had mine for four months, and even though I use it up to twice a day, the tube is still very full and shows no obvious signs of heavy usage. However, though my rating is positive on the whole, I do have one complaint. Whether this is the fault of the company, just a faulty product, or due to improper storage I am not certain, but my tube of Too Faced Shadow Insurance often gets very watery. There have been many times (at least once or twice a week) when I go to squeeze on the tube and only a clear, watery liquid comes out. A second squeeze usually warrants better results, but I find this kind of annoying for such a pricey product. As I said, this may be totally my fault (though I store my makeup in a pretty normal environment), but I had to deduct a rating point regardless. Even though I have put it on my to-do list to try out Urban Decay Primer Potion, I will most definitely repurchase this. Afterall, why mess with a (99.98%) perfect thing?</li>
    <li> I dont care for this product because it does not work. I have used other eyelid primers that worked better. When I used this it was like I put foundation on my eye lids.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete disappointment.  I have used it many times and have not noticed any benefit.  My eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t look any better and I can&#x27;t see where it actually lasts longer.  Will not buy this expensive product again.</li>
    <li> Nice little product, that I use on clients to keep their eyeshadow in place!  It sinks right into the skin, and works nicely!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan! My make up creases within like 2 hours, or less. I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase. I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> Got this as a sample for purchasing too faced products from Ulta and LOVE this, and so does my college age daughter, It made our eye shadow more vibrant, it applied easier with better coverage and it DID last all day , I&#x27;ve never had a product deliver quite so well, will be buying this to add to my &amp;#34;staples&amp;#34;. You wont regret this product!</li>
    <li> i think this product is overhyped. too faced is a nice company but i just don&#x27;t think this is absolutely necessary. i didn&#x27;t notice a big difference using this over a regualr moisturizer on my eyes before applying shadow.</li>
    <li> this is one of the only products i have actually finished, and a small tube used every day lasted me like two years. you only need a little, its not too oily or too dry, i just love it and i would recommend it, and yes i would buy it again and i plan to, after i use up all my other primers. also, no eye irritation!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Before my eyeshadow was bland, but this stuff makes it POP! Goes on smooth and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My shadow stays on all day with no creasing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Urban Decay for years, but decided to try this.  It works OK, but is kind of thin and watery.  Eyeshadow does not last as long as with Urban Decay.  I&#x27;m disappointed, and the tube will probably go to waste.  I should have stuck with what I knew.</li>
    <li> This keeps my eye make-up intact the whole day! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Used it for a whole year until it dried up. Only a tiny amount is needed and it holds the shadow all day (and night, if you forget to take it off)</li>
    <li> I bought this product from ULTA and it was waaaaay different/better than the one I received from here. the consistency is super &#x27;liquiddy&#x27; and it feels like i put lotion on my lids rather than primer :/  very skeptical, and not saying as fact, but it is so different than the same exact one I get at Ulta that I feel they had filled this tube with something other than too faced shadow primer.. from the very beginning at times when i unscrew the lid, the top tube (supposed to be attached) falls off, so it is very well possible. I was very disappointed in the product as I was very excited to get a genuine refill of the shadow primer i had been used to.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well I was actually surprised.  I was looking for something to use for my wedding day to make sure they eye shadow stays on.  Well the wedding isn’t here yet so I had to test it.  I could not believe hoe vibrant the colors are with this stuff.  Plus it lasted all day!  So far I think I made a great choice buying this. It lasts all day and you do not have to put a lot on at all! Hope it will work just as good on my wedding day!</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite a while when I had originally got it as a mini size in an eyeshadow kit. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for something that will keep your eye shadow on all day. It goes on smooth and really keeps my eyeshadow on all day even with my normal touching of the eye area. A little goes a long way, so I feel like it is WELL worth the money. Also my husband bought this for me at Sephora and it was $5 more there than getting from Amazon with Prime shipping! Sweet deal to me. So I took back the one my hubbs bought for me and ordered the one online b/c I was already going to the Sephora store anyway.</li>
    <li> i do not think this is the&amp;#34; Real&amp;#34; thing i believe this is a knock-off. it doesn,t work at all. i have used the real product and loved it, but this is garbage...do not waste your money, sorry i did !!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the 24 hour hold like it says but that&#x27;s probably because I use the cheapo pallets. Definitely better results than any other primer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I guess I always just thought foundation primer was enough, but ever since I&#x27;ve used this eye primer (compared to a cheaper one I had recently used from a big well known SuperCenter) I have noticed that it keeps the chosen eye shadow color almost identical as it looked as before touching it, not to mention that ever since I&#x27;ve used it, I hardly ever see creases from the makeup on my lids, it just keeps everything intact, from the color&#x27;s radiance, to it&#x27;s position lol Seriously, truly worth the buy* ;)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite neutral eye shadow primer. I have had it forever and the product is still just as effective--no texture or smell changes either. The shape of this tube is more economical than the Urban Decay Primer Potion, which I could never seem to get all of the product out of. I like the tube because it also seems more sanitary than a primer in a tub or with a wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyeshadow stays on all day when I use this and the colors definitely &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; more than without a primer. If you&#x27;re going to do a very bright look, you might want a primer in the same color family as your eyeshadow (e.g., a Mac paintpot). For every day neutral looks, this is the best primer out there.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and love it. I recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s my favorite cosmetic</li>
    <li> Sorry to say but this product did not meet my expectations. Whether I put a little or a lot, still have my eyeshadow heavy in the crease of my eyelid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this Too Faced primer; the only ones I have to compare it to are Urban Decay&#x27;s Orginal Potion Primer and Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Eye-Fix Primer. With the latter two, my eyeshadow slid around and by the end of the day, all the colors on the lid were mixed together; Too Faced is the only one that worked. Also, it&#x27;s liquidy, which is what I prefer, as you don&#x27;t need much to cover the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It works great. I have really dry skin, but my eyelids flip flop between greasy and dry...it&#x27;s really annoying. This stuff ensures that no matter what my skin is like on any given day my eyeshadow will look great. It smooths on great and keeps my eye make up looking great for hours and hours. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this primer! It keeps my eyeshadow on and in place all day. I&#x27;ve had no creasing, or fall out. Keeps the colors more vivid as well. This was at a great price, for only $10 it was almost half the regular price at stores. Shipped in original unopened package, and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> It really helps with my oily eyelids. No more creasing!</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see what everybody else is talking about.. Unless you use a primer and a base.. It will crease and leave a streak in your eye crease. I can use a cheaper shadow primer and get the same effect! PLEASE I do makeup every single day! I thought I would check this out, but don&#x27;t see what all the buzz is about.</li>
    <li> This product is good but it doesn&#x27;t work well with my naked palette.</li>
    <li> Works really great. Keeps even cheap eye shadow on for hours.</li>
    <li> My best friend is a make up artist and she turned me onto this. I use this for my eyebrows. I place the too faced shadow insurance primer on first then Anastasia of Beverly Hills powder and my brows look natural and great! I also use this for my eyeshadow. A bit pricey but great investment. No creasing or drying up.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and the seller&#x27;s quick turnaround time.</li>
    <li> This is a bit pricey, but it really works and it&#x27;s kind to my aging skin.  I&#x27;m pleased and will order again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It&#x27;s the first and only primer I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it. A little bit goes a long way so one tube lasts a very long time. It goes on colorless and helps my eye makeup stay on all day long. Even when my foundation has long since been sweated off, my eyeshadow will be perfect, hours later. Even after a quick dip in a pool or a half-assed job at washing my face, it stays on. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. For years I used Urban Decay&#x27;s primer potion. When I saw YouTubers giving Too Faced Shadow Insurance good reviews, I was excited to try it, especially because it was in a squeezable tube (this was before UD Primer Potion changed to a tube). I got my two tubes in the mail and replaced my UD Primer Potion and did my dressy-makeup (which I usually do every Friday). I wore my makeup for 7 hours and then removed it the way I usually do, with my Nude cleansing oil and Bioderma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later when I was taking off my eyeliner, I noticed a milia on my upper eyelid right above my tear duct. I&#x27;ve never had milia on my eyelid before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shrugged it off and didn&#x27;t think much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next Friday I did my dressy makeup again, using the Too Faced Shadow Insurance. I wore it for 3 hours and took it off when I got home with my normal cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later my other eyelid started twitching an awful lot-- spasming about every thirty minutes or so. I figured I must be catching a cold or stressed and rested my eyes for nearly the whole day. The following day the twitching was worse. I was decided to do a facial massage and noticed ANOTHER milia on my other eyelid, right in the middle. It hadn&#x27;t really appeared yet, but I could feel it. Two days later and I could see it on my lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I discontinued use of the product immediately. I haven&#x27;t had another milia since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only found a few other people complaining about this issue. They all mention having dry skin. I think what may happen is that dry skin tries to absorb the shadow insurance, causing the product to get trapped in the pore. Then, when oil does try to come out of the pore, it gets trapped by the oil-absorbing shadow insurance inside the pore. I don&#x27;t think that people with normal or oily skin would have this problem, because their eyelids secrete enough oil to keep the product from getting absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, I just wish I could use it.</li>
    <li> With all the positive reviews Too Faced Shadow Insurance has gotten, Id expect the product to do exactly as it says. Maybe my eyelids are just too oily, Maybe I apply too much of it or maybe I apply too little, or maybe its the type of eye shadow I may choose to use on a given day. Maybe I should try shaking it up before using it... I do not know exactly what it is, but this primer just does not last after a few hours. While...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Primer Potion\\&quot; (Urban Decay) lasts forever, Its staying power is at least 7 or 8 hours straight without creasing! will cost you close to $28.00/$30.00 in some places but it works &amp; lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Lime Crime\\&quot; is next in line...its probably one of the BEST shadow primers I have ever tried most recently. It will run you close to $20 bucks. Next to that one would be...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;ELF shadow Primer\\&quot;....hands down is one of my \\&quot;BESTEST\\&quot; primers for everyday, it lasts for hours, and its not THICK at all like \\&quot;Primer Potion\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;Lime Crime\\&quot;. ELF is a thin, light, formula that dries quickly &amp; is very affordable and lasts for hours. only problem I have with that primer is the bottle and wand it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them should come in a squeeze tube. \\&quot;Primer Potion\\&quot; FINALLY makes its primer in a easy squeeze tube. \\&quot;Lime Crime\\&quot; comes in a little Pot with the screw on lid.(thats cool). But I have to say \\&quot;Too Faced\\&quot; is just an \\&quot;OKAY\\&quot; product. Im still gonna try different things to improve its staying power...Because I bought 2 of them &amp; I refuse to let them sit in my makeup drawer for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as Always in my reviews, I say TRY IT! For yourself , what may not work great for one person may work wonders for the next, so go on and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Never again will i wear shadow without this stuff. It makes my shadow last for hours, its easy to build on and has a smooth texture. Do yourself a favor and buy this product! I use it everyday and dont know why I didnt buy it sooner.</li>
    <li> No matter what eye shadow brand you use, this primer sets your eye makeup on all day. I have used everything from urban decay to an off brand- all perfectly on for over 14 hours with no fade or smudge. I highly recommend everyone to give a try it :)</li>
    <li> this is the first eye shadow primer that I have ever tried. I was extremely happy with the results. I have oily eye lids and had intense creasing problems, the very first time I used shodow insurance I became a life time buyer. I can  not imagine wearing eyeshadow with out my primer. I highly reccomend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow primer. I use it EVERY day and I simply cannot live without it :)</li>
    <li> My eye makeup stays all day! I am very happy with it!  I have found that a little bitty bit can go a long way.  I like that it goes on and dries quickly, and is not oily or greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this primer.  I was a little surprised by how wet it is, but it dries quickly.  I can wear the lowest pigment eyeshadow and not only does the color pop, but it stays on all day.  I haven&#x27;t had it sweat or rub off or crease at all - even after a 10 hour day at work followed by working out and cooking dinner.  It does come off easily with eye make-up remover.  Good stuff and a great value compared to other products of its kind.</li>
    <li> This product is great and does exactly what it says it will do. A little bit goes a long way (just a tiny drop for each eye). It must be shaken or it comes out of the tube slightly oily. If you do not mind applying this with your fingers, it is excellent!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Without it, my eye shadow creases and smears everywhere.  It&#x27;s worth the price and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Definitely provides long lasting eye shadow wear. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without! my makeup last all day!!</li>
    <li> Amzing! I recommend this seller! Everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> I work in a hot kitchen 8-9 hours a day - This stuff makes my eye makeup last allll day. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with Shadow Insurance Eye Primer form Too Faced Cosmetics. Not only that it is creamy and does not crease, it is also the right size for my make up bag. I have used Urban Decay and MAC before, but I like this one much better.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye shadow primers from many different companies and I always come back to this one. I have oliy/combination skin and I suffer from allergies (I sneeze a lot, my eyes constantly water and itch, etc) but this primer helps my eye shadow to last all day.Besides it&#x27;s ability to prolong wear, it is also amazing at making eye shadows more pigmented.</li>
    <li> Product is a bit pricey for the amount, but DEFINITELY worth it. Can not live without this seeing that it works very well with my sensitive skin. After a hot summer day and 3 hours of swimming in a pool, absolutely NO creasing or fading ( unless rubbed off ).  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I purchased my Too Faced product through drugstore.com. I really liked it, but I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day and after a medium stretch of not wearing any I went to put it on and it was all watery (more like oil). I had to squeeze and squeeze on the tube (for quite a long time) and then shook it (again, for quite awhile) really hard and got it back to some semblance of normal consistency. This was my complaint about it -- that it separates. I think I will try the Urban Decay product the next time I buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular makeup junkie, as well as a freelance Makeup Artist. I specialize in water-based airbrush makeup, and I work with a lot of different skin types, including more mature skin and somewhat oily skin. For the average wearer, this is the perfect primer. A little goes a long way. It does not have too much color to it, but just a little to help even skintone. It is easily spread with either the tip of your little finger or with a small concealer brush, and it blends into the skin smoothly. Because it is s/b (silicone based), it feels very silky, almost moisturizing. You do not have to rush to get your shadow on because it remains pliable, and it does not enhance any crepiness or wrinkles on a more mature lid&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this with a variety of different pressed and loose pigments, as well as some rather heavy Dinair airbrush colors. Without this, all of my airbrushed eye makeup looks crease almost instantly. Even Stay Don&#x27;t Stray couldn&#x27;t keep the w/b (water based) airbrush pigments in place more then a few minutes! Just yesterday I put on a very layered eye color look consisting of 6 different shades of Dinair&#x27;s w/b fantasy, bright, and shimmer colors, and I was VERY impressed by the results. Previous primers (or worse yet, NO primer used at all) leave the skin on the eyelids feeling wrinkly, crunchy, dry, and always with an extremely obvious crease after a few blinks. w/b airbrush pigments are not easy to wear on the eyes! my lavender/blue/teal look lasted for hours into the night, never creasing, and never creating the old, familiar &#x27;shrink wrap&#x27; look I had before finding TFSI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that such a tiny amount goes such a long way! It makes me feel save that I am getting my money&#x27;s worth out of this tube. I have other bases I need to use occasionally, such as a NYX Milk Jumbo Pencil, or Glitter Glue for extreme glitter/shimmer loose pigments, but those bases always crease if used alone. TFSI has to go on first, under everything. It&#x27;s a real life saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UDPP is comparable, but I prefer TFSI over it due to the applicator and the price. UDPP is around $4+ more at full retail price, and you loose so much product when dealing with a wand. I really like Benefit&#x27;s SDS under certain circumstances, such as under the inner corners of the eye before applying an airbrush foundation since it is so heavily pigmented that it doubles as a concealer, but still, SDS will allow the makeup to crease when this one does not. Stay Don&#x27;t Stray also is packaged in a pump that puts out much too much product at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, I find cleaning the lid appropriately first, and then using the tiniest smidge out of the tube onto the little finger tip to be the easiest way to get this massaged into the lid well, and then I use a small concealer brush to make sure I get it into every corner, and all the way along under the brow. I appreciate the way that I can blend my colors easily, but still get the gorgeous POP out of them that I want. Once I have primed with TFSI my shadow stays put until I remove it. It even withstood the most miserable summer heat while I was stuck at home all day without any a/c! I could not get this sort of performance out of any other primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems I have encountered with previous primers include: too dry, leaving my lid feeling crunchy; too moist, leaving my colors creasing; too pigmented, so I have to cover the primer 100% or else look like I have a poorly matched foundation or concealer; sticky, so my shadow won&#x27;t blend; weak, so my shadow fades; hard to get out of pots; over-distributing pumps and wands, and my least favorite: GREASY primers. I do NOT have any of these issues with TFSI! It has served me rather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone whose skin is so oily that there is still a creasing problem, even with TFSI on top of a freshly cleaned/toned lid, I would suggest trying something dryer, like Stila&#x27;s Prime Pots, or MAC&#x27;s Paint Pots. Still, forthe majority of makeup wearers, I believe this is the most effective, efficient, and comfortable primer out there. If I find something I like better, I shall return to report it in an edit. I always edit my reviews for accuracy should anything new arise! I am on a mission to try every primer on the market, and so far, this one is the only one I can&#x27;t live without. I cannot emphasize enough how impressive it is when using in conjunction with a w/b airbrush makeup like Dinair!! If you&#x27;ve never worn airbrush eyeshadow, you just can&#x27;t imagine how HUGE the difference is with and without this specific product.

    <li> The tube itself is very small and when you try to get a small amount of product out the very first time, you have to squeeze out the air from almost half of the tube. So, there&#x27;s actually VERY little product in the small package. But the primer does wonders. Just a dot of it goes over one whole eyelid area around the eyes and my shadows/eyeliners stay the way i left it when initially applied.</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviews about this product, I was excited to purchase this product.  Both my eyes puffed up for two days, COMPLETELY disappointed, threw in the garbage IMMEDIATELY....</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brand of eyeshadow primer.  The eyeshadows last all day and look as good at the end of the day as they did when I put them on in the morning.  This one is clear with a little bit of shine.. Really nice... if for some reason not all gets covered it looks almost good enough to wear on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, because the primer looks so light. I have a medium-olive skin tone, and I thought the primer would make my eyelids too light. Well, it blends in seamlessly and gives my eyelids a slight shimmer as well. I am a makeup artist, and I love to play around with bright colors and crazy patterns. This is a must for anyone who loves bright eyeshadow colors. It makes all your colors more vibrant, and you can use less eyeshadow to achieve the same concentration of color. It&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re using multiple colors, as it keeps the color in place. It also lasts ALL DAY, and well into the evening. Like other users have said, make sure you move the product around in the tube a bit before you use it, otherwise it comes out oily. You only need a tiny, tiny amount per eyelid, so this tube should last you quite a while.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin/eyelids and this does exactly what is says it will! Will never use another brand again, I&#x27;ve found what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a FAKE. DO NOT BUY IT. This product does not work and could have dangerous amounts of lead or other harmful chemicals. Shame on you, &amp;#34;Too Faced&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It was really well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;this product is awesome! I use it all the time especially for school and it did last all day some days and&lt;br /&gt;crease a little on some days but other then that I recommend this product and will get more when i run out</li>
    <li> This product is one of my absolute favorite products I have ever purchased. It makes my makeup more vibrant looking and keeps it from creasing or melting off of my face. I have oily lids, so this product is a godsend to me. I will say though, it doesn&#x27;t really help with eyeliner, for whatever reason. Perhaps it is just the brand of eyeliner I use, but it still melts off rather quickly from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product DOES need to be shaken if it has been sitting for too long. It separates and gets an oily substance that comes out first from the tube if you don&#x27;t. It ends up making a big goopy mess, it is still useable, it just takes longer to dry onto your lid and is messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: let the primer dry COMPLETELY before putting the makeup on. When I first used this, I thought it was supposed to be wet and put eyeshadow on right after, and wondered why it didn&#x27;t work. When it dries completely (about a minute, if applied correctly) you can tell the difference even when you just start applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, other eyeshadow primers do work just as well, but I wanted to explain why this one is my personal favorite:&lt;br /&gt;Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow primer is just as good as Too-Faced, but it had one major design error in my opinion; you will never be able to use all the product in the tube without struggling a lot to get it out. This is the same with many many eyeshadow primers. The little wand is nice for application, but it makes the product non-economical. With Too-Face&#x27;s squeezable tube, you can more accurately choose how much you use and squeezing out the last bits of primer are much easier.</li>
    <li> I tried a Shadow Insurance Sample that came with a Too Faced palette I got and it was amazing! My shadow stayed on the whole day without creasing or fading.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I ordered this product, the results were different. My shadow faded within hours and then I noticed that the part that says \\&quot;Shadow Insurance\\&quot; on the tube looks different from what Amazon&#x27;s picture shows. I&#x27;m not sure if this is genuine, and plus why is it $5 cheaper? It makes you question if it&#x27;s fake....Very disappointed, will return ASAP.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.</li>
    <li> Finally my eyeshadow stays put, awesome. I use very small amount on each lid/below the brow bone, a little under the lower eyelash line, a very thin layer, then let it dry for a couple of seconds, and then apply and blend mineral shadows on top.</li>
    <li> My roommate and I swear by this stuff. Works better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using the urban decay primer potion and decided to switch to this because it was cheaper, and it was better than I thought it would be. It works better than urban decay in my opinion</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this eye shadow primer. Prevents creases and makes my eye shadows blend a lot easier than if I hadn&#x27;t put a primer at all. It&#x27;s not thick and goopy and it&#x27;s easy to blend into the lid with fingers.</li>
    <li> goes on smoothly  I can&#x27;t really tell if it is making my shadow last longer.  I think I need to try it in the summer when it&#x27;s super humid to see how it holds up.  But, it seems to be a decent product, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> By far one of my favorite products! It keeps your eye shadow in place - I have used this for several years and it really doesn&#x27;t let your eye shadow come off unless you wash your face. I would recommend this as a staple to anyone&#x27;s makeup routine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eye shadow primers, and this is my favorite.  The only wish I have for it is to allow me to see how much is left in the tube so I re-order before I run out of it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love how it goes on and makeup is on all day and brighter too.  Recommended for all to use!</li>
    <li> I was using Urban Decay make-up which was slightly pricier than this brand, but I think I like Too Faced even better now. The products go on great. They come in really cute vintage looking packaging and the convince of getting them through Amazon is great!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great texture &amp; coverage, does exactly what it claims. Would definitely recommend this product to others looking for an eyeshadow base.</li>
    <li> You do not have to worry about your eye shadow fading with this product.  Your shadow stays on until you take it off.  You just need a little bit.  You will not be disappointed.  The Too Faced Cosmetics line is absolutely incredible!</li>
    <li> I was tired of having my eye makeup crease in my eyelids.  My sister recommended this to me and she uses it to</li>
    <li> I love this and use it everyday! I made my mom try this one day and she slept in her makeup and didnt even have to reapply! Old habits die hard but says good things about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to decide if this really does maintain the eyeshadows on a lot longer, maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly.</li>
    <li> This primer makes the colors of your eye shadow much more high-pigment.  It also keeps your makeup looking fresh all day by keeping your eye shadow from getting pushed into the creases when you blink.  Def recommend!</li>
    <li> I had bought this product with Sephora first, then found it cheaper on Amazon and bought it here again. I was disappointed with the one I bought from Sephora because it seemed old and the product was watery and oily even though I shook it. The one from Amazon was better, but I have to say there is nothing really special about this product. My eyeshadow still smeared and I frankly don&#x27;t have any use for this. I tried Urban Decay&#x27;s primer potion which was way better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The Too Faced Shadow Insurance does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I tried this product because I was unhappy with the Mary Kay Eye Primer that replaced their Triple Action Eye Enhancer (which I had used for many years and loved).  The MK primer only held off the creasing of my shadow for a few hours.  By lunch time every day I was touching up.  The Too Faced lasts all day with no creasing or wearing off.  Also, I use a fat, creamy shadow pencil to make a wedge on my lower lid, and the MK primer allowed some annoying transference to my upper lid.  The Shadow Insurance has solved that problem as well.  I&#x27;ve made no touch-ups in the past two weeks of using this product, even during a couple of 18-hour days.</li>
    <li> This product by too faced is very nice.  It does not clump and I do notice that my foundation does not crack as easily as if I didn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> I have super oily eye lids and this is the only thing that makes my eye makeup last all day!</li>
    <li> Great product, will keep buying and its much cheaper then in sephora store, the best eye shadow primer ive ever used.</li>
    <li> I expected Eye Shadow to be brighter over application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product a bit Thin in consistency as well.</li>
    <li> This primer is by far the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used! The bottle is small but you only need a DAB to do the job! I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for almost a year (using it everyday) and have not came close to running out. Your eyeshadow will have no creases and will last for HOURSSS. 5/5 in my book.!</li>
    <li> Did not care for this product in the least.  Typically, I am a fan of Too Faced products. Anyhow, after applying... my eye shadow still creased and wore off by the end of the day.  I found myself scrapping the bottom of the Benefit eye shadow primer sample I had.  \\&quot;Stay Don&#x27;t Stray\\&quot; by Benefit is a much better product.</li>
    <li> The product works really well and you only need to apply a little bit for it to work effectively. It shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Too Faced. What&#x27;s not to love? Wears great. Keeps my shadow in place and looks like I just put it on after a long day. No creasing.</li>
    <li> Really brings out the colors! Even after I get out if the pool...my eyeshadow is still going strong!! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this primer.  I&#x27;ve had a sample of this for quite some time and it&#x27;s second (so far) only to Nars.  The formula is nice and creamy and really does hold my eyeshadows and liners for hours.  The longest I&#x27;ve kept the primer/makeup on was 11 hours and my shadow hadn&#x27;t creased yet.  That is REALLY not bad at all.  The formula is really silky and smooth.  I love it.  It&#x27;s not as pigmented as the urban decay primers, which is why I prefer it, it just covers the eyelid nicely.  You can&#x27;t see where the primer ends if you are just wearing gel liner, whereas you can with UD.  The Nars primer is mattifying, which this one is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also intensifies my shadows, which is promised in the description. I don&#x27;t know how it does this, but I love it and was surprised that it actually did so.  I will continue my search for good primers and continue to report on them.  This one is a great one, and it&#x27;s a good price!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; eyes (for lack of a better term) and this stuff helps my eyeshadow to last throughout the day, without settling in the creases of my eyes.  It may seem pricey, but a little goes a long way and a tube lasts forever.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this stuff actually keeps my eyes shadow on my eyes, in place, literally all day. Or until I wash it off. I love it.</li>
    <li> Always a must, especially for combo skin complexions. Used to use it only for special occasions but its now become an everyday essential. Great for sensitive eyes even</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a week now. I noticed that this primer works with SOME of my eyeshadows, but not all of them stay on all day. I still get creases with a few of them...seems to have dramatically decreased the buildup at least. This is with just eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great if used with a make up setting spray too.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I got some really eyeshadows from NYX. They work the best with this product. I&#x27;ve also noticed my eyeliner never gets messy when I use the primer too! AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely ESSENTIAL!&lt;br /&gt;After years of being irritated that my carefully placed eye makeup was sliding off my greasy eyelids, I found this!&lt;br /&gt;I apply it right after I get out of the shower and it goes on easily and blends right in. I&#x27;ve even worn this all by itself when I don&#x27;t feel like putting eyeshadow and it will give you a well-rested naturally bright look. Anyway, the real test it that I have slept in my makeup (numerous times, i&#x27;m lazy) woken up the next day and it&#x27;s STILL THERE!&lt;br /&gt;I might have to do a bit of cleanup on my lower lid but essentially I can just roll out of bed (sometimes I do a quick touch-up) and be ready for the day. Dream product for lazy people and those that want their makeup to stay put for a long nght</li>
    <li> my daughter had a tube of this which lasted her two years-  she loves that it keeps her eye makeup where she put it-</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1A57D6S3V5PTO]]In the accompanying video, I put Nyx&#x27;s Eye Shadow Base and the Too Faced Shadow Insurance to a head-to-head test, using one product on each eye. I much preferred the creamy texture of the Nyx product to the thin, liquid texture of the Shadow Insurance. I also much preferred the Nyx pot to the Shadow Insurance tube. I felt that the Nyx cream in the pot allowed me better control of how much product I was putting on and where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using shadow over each base, it appeared that Shadow Insurance provided a more intense, pigmented appearance to the shadow, but it wasn&#x27;t a landslide victory over the Nyx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelids are super sensitive to a lot of cosmetics, and neither product bothered me very much. I am also very fragrance sensitive and neither product bothered me in terms of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of adjusting my makeup during or after application (if I made a mistake or wanted to adjust something), I found this very very difficult to do with Shadow Insurance and a bit easier to do with the Nyx Shadow Base. I know a lot of people love Shadow Insurance for its long-lasting properties, but I would rather be able to have a little wiggle room in adjusting my look than have a long-lasting look--that&#x27;s just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find a huge difference in the staying power of these products, but I think the Shadow Insurance had the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of price comparison, the Nyx Eye Shadow Base is nearly half the cost of Too Faced&#x27;s Shadow Insurance, though the amount of product you get is not different enough to warrant the cost, in my opinion (the Nyx product is .21 ounces and the Too Faced product is .35 ounces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if what is most important to you is that your makeup stay in place for many hours after you apply it and you&#x27;re expert enough to not have to make many adjustments to your look, the Too Faced Shadow Insurance is probably your best bet. If, like me, you prefer a creamier, easier to use product that is more forgiving of making adjustments, I&#x27;d recommend the Nyx Eye Shadow Base. If I would buy either product again, it would be the Nyx Eye Shadow Base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have amended my rating from 2 to 3 stars as I realized that it was unfair and misleading to give the product 2 stars; it&#x27;s not that the product is bad (obviously not, as many people rave about it), but it just isn&#x27;t my preference.r, easier to use product that is more forgiving of making adjustments, I&#x27;d recommend the Nyx Eye Shadow Base.

    <li> Use to use UD and moved to this product. It is much cheaper and it really, really does its job !! Lasts at least 12 hours and that is a good thing. No touch ups needed during the day. I have tried ALOT of these eyes primers and must say it works as good as UD !!</li>
    <li> I love urban decay primer potion, but with when I would add the very creamy and &amp;#34;creasible&amp;#34; ( I know that is not a word lol) NYX jumbo eye pencil as a base it would still crease in the crevices of my eye lid. So after hearing so much about too faced, I decided to purchase it for a cheaper price of 9.99 and about 2.00 shipping. I tested the product with the NYX jumbo eye pencil and it did NOT crease at all, I love this stuff! I would recommend this to any one with oily eyelids (like me) and be amazed how well this product works.</li>
    <li> The best product to keep your shadow looking great all day!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my clients because of all the rave reviews I saw online and I can say that this product truly lives up to the hype. A little goes a long way and the bottle design makes for a sanitary practice where you are not having to dip a doe foot applicator into your product and introduce bacteria to your product.</li>
    <li> All you need is a little dab on your finger for each eyelid and your eyeshadow will be set for hours! The primer will also help brighten your colors.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an eye shadow primer and bought a Bobbi Brown product that was thick and cakey.  This product is just what I wanted.  It goes on very smoothly and you just use a small amount.  My eyeliner and shadow looked much better with this product and it stayed on without creasing all day.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Do my morning routine, apply the primer, let it dry, apply eyeshadow (by 8am). By lunch (11pm) there are the godforsaken crease lines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Nars or Urban decay eye shadow primers.. They were both very good, about the same as far as how well they work.  Decided to try this one because I like &#x27;two faced&amp;#34; products and this stuff is WAY better!! eye shadow stays put for over 14 hours...SUPER impressed with this one!! Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Great primer for eye shadow, eye shadows goes on much smoother, oily lids will last for awhile at least 8 hours</li>
    <li> well i wanted a good eye shadow primer and read so many good reviews about it so I bought it and now I&#x27;ve been using it for months and I&#x27;m so in love with it .. it&#x27;s perfect even if u have a greasy lids</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve noticed less creasing and displacement of my eyeliner with this product. You think it&#x27;s a small amount when you buy it but it may take nearly a year for it to run out.</li>
    <li> Top 5 make up item of all time. I have used this for years and could never go without it.  I use it under foundation to brighten my eyes and and I always look fresh and alive.  It last all day and night. I see women with creases in their eye shadow and think they look so sloppy.  Get this.</li>
    <li> Received item in no time! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I will NOT put eye shadow on without it. I&#x27;ve tried urban decay but it was too greasy for me. The too faced is greasy but thats why you have to shake it up and it comes out whole. Thank you very much seller! I will definitely buy from you again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my eye shadow last all day and doesn&#x27;t crease, even if I need to reapply a darker color before going out.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes sure that your eyeshadow stays on all day long, it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch, and it&#x27;s decently priced for a primer. Love it :)</li>
    <li> I had been using another, more expensive brand of eye shadow primer, but decided to try this one, primarily based on the reviews. I followed the directions faithfully, but it just didn&#x27;t measure up for me.  By the end of the day, my shadow was gone.  I kept using it just to give it the benefit of the doubt, but have since decided it is not for me.  I guess you really do get what you paid for.  I&#x27;m going back to my old faithful, reliable brand.</li>
    <li> This eye primer is amazing.  I am very picky about eye primer.  My favorite in the past has been Mary Kay&#x27;s eye primer, but I think this one might beat it.  It&#x27;s a neutral color so you can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s on your eye like some other primers.  It dries quickly and man does it hold the eye shadow in place!  By the end of the day my eye makeup looks exactly the same.  The only warning is that it holds it in place so well you need to be careful because blending isn&#x27;t easy once it sets.  I make sure to cover the entire lid with a neutral shadow first to make blending easier later.</li>
    <li> This product used to be awesome and then they must have changed the formula because the consistency is totally different. (Please change it back!) If you are looking for the old formula, check out Palladio.</li>
    <li> This product is a fake! First of all, mine came only half full. Secondly, the packaging is different and the layout on the front is off center. The consistency of the primer itself is also different. I am in the process of obtaining a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also compared this product with the one I currently have (that is almost gone, hence attempting to order more) and when placed side by side it is obvious that this is a counterfeit product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows what is in this primer!!! This is dangerous.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a fake-- wanted to point this out because of a few other reviews. I found that this works great as a primer, even for my insanely oily lids. I put a little powder on my lid before the primer and after and find that my eyeshadows go on beautifully. NOW the only complaint I have is that it creases on me when I put on NYX jumbo pencil on top of it. I&#x27;m not sure why it does that but I have to be super careful because it&#x27;s very obvious. I would probably give it 4 and 1/2 stars for that but I don&#x27;t have an option to do that :-P. I haven&#x27;t tried UDPP yet, but I do have a bottle which I&#x27;m planning on using soon SO I CAN&#x27;T TELL COMPARISONS YET! Hope to be able to soon. But anyways you get a great price here on Amazon for a REAL product, so might as well get this or the UDPP (which is also cheaper on Amazon).</li>
    <li> Changed from NARS eye shado prime. When I applied first time it sting my eyes, it was little odd but not too terrible. Keep that in mind if have some sensitive skins... It wasnt very impressive because it still gave me smudged eye shadows after 10 hrs of work. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> I work 12 hour days without a crease in my shadow :)  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this product to compare between UDPP and I think it works wonderfully! Both of the primers are quite expensive but if you can get ahold of either is awesome. They have the same consistency and staying power. This one is a little more convenient to get the product out of but I like the cute primer potion bottle better :)&lt;br /&gt;If this is on sale(or cheaper than UDPP) I suggest you get this.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and my eyeshadow lasts all day long. Not sure what I&#x27;d do without this stuff!</li>
    <li> Well, this thing doesn&#x27;t stay long. Within 4 hours or less my eye liner and shadow starts to get in between my lids, if I don&#x27;t continuously clean my lids, I would look like a clown...</li>
    <li> If you only want to prime your lids for shadow and are not concerned about any coverage, this is the primer for you. It dries matte quickly and it does a great job of keeping your shadows on for hours. I do notice some creasing after around 4-5 hours, BUT ...I do have oily lids and I&#x27;m sure that those who don&#x27;t have this problem can get more hours of creaseless wear out of it. After using this up I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t repurchase, I will look for a primer that stands up better against my oily lids and also provides some coverage for discoloration.</li>
    <li> Felt this produce didn&#x27;t do what it claimed to do.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am getting past the twenties and needed some help in keeping my makeup look crisp and clean (while lasting all day at the office and then dinners out).  This was a perfect buy!  Keeps my makeup smooth and on all day.  Washes off easily and a little goes a long ways.  Grab it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as it was a great value. However, I agree with some of the other customers who question whether it is the same product or a fake. My previous tube of Shadow Insurance that I purchased from a beauty store worked well and kept my oily eyelids from creasing and my eyeshadow stayed on. This one is a different color and consistency and after two hours of wear my eyeshadow and eye liner is gone! It is too late to get a full refund (I think) but I am disappointed to say the least and won&#x27;t use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> love this product, i friend recommended me to use this to wear eye shadow all day and this product does the trick, my eyeshadow stayed in place looked vibrant the whole time. love it</li>
    <li> this primer holds my eye shadow in place for about 12 hours. shadow does not crease and blends well over the primer. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I have oily eye lids and even with many primers the oil sops it up and my eye makeup disappears!  If I go out partying and end up drinking a bit too much and fall asleep before washing my eye make-up off, it still looks great in the morning.. some of it is on my pillow but it&#x27;s not smeared all over my face!  This is PERFECT for those who don&#x27;t wear make-up on the rest of their face and probably don&#x27;t use any other skin primers like me..&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample from Ulta and I was HOOKED!  I bought my first tube from them but decided to check on Amazon for it this time... like $6 cheaper!  PLUS since I have prime the shipping was free!  It&#x27;s like getting it for 50%!</li>
    <li> This primer makes your eye shadow stay on all day and night without creasing. It lasts soooo long because it only takes a little bit to do the job. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for or using another primer!!!!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a shadow base before.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  Eye makeup stays in place beautifully and doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear all day.  It also works week under my eyes to minimize dark circles.</li>
    <li> I wanted urban decays eye potion primer,which rocks! But I got this instead since it had good reviews and wasn&#x27;t uber expensive. It works pretty well to keep my shadow on and from creasing or smudging, even when I&#x27;m outside in a hot muggy climate for hours on end. Make sure to wait about a minute after application before putting eye shadow on though. Also its nice that a little tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A few months ago I was in my local Sephora searching for better quality eye shadows.  The shadow I use everyday is from Maybelline - I love the color, but it creases and wears off over the day (it was so cheap, it isn&#x27;t surprising).  So, I decided to upgrade to a better brand.  After walking around Sephora frustrated because I could not find a color that was close to the one I use, one of the sales associates asked if I needed help.  I explained what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of finding a new shadow, she suggested a primer.  I never used one before, so I wasn&#x27;t really interested.  But, she talked so glowingly about \\&quot;Too Faced\\&quot;, even though she worked for another company with their own primer.  After that, I felt pressured to buy it.  I am glad that I did!  It is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my Maybelline shadow and it reduces the creasing, makes it significantly longer lasting, and gives it a much smoother appearance.  It makes my cheap, $3 shadow look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mentioned it to a few friends who used other brand primers and they converted to this one.  Like I said, I never used another primer so I had no comparison point.  But, they did.  Some said it was better than the one they used (mainly, they were impressed that it wasn&#x27;t very oily).  One said it was about the same, but cheaper than the brands that she used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for price, the Amazon price is great.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase it here when my current tube runs out.</li>
    <li> This is the first shadow primer I&#x27;ve ever used so I have nothing to compare it to. I will say though that it&#x27;s easy to apply and the finish is very nice but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that great. It kinda does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I guess. I honestly would rather have my money back though. Not worth the $16. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this after I run out.</li>
    <li> No more creases! I absolutely love this product. I will never have creases on my eyelids again. This works all day long! It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve never been so happy with a random buy. Keeps my eye-makeup where I put it, and it lasts all day and into my nights! Such an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I started out using Urban Decay&#x27;s shadow primer, but got annoyed with how much product was left in the bottle when the wand came out dry.  I switched to this, Too Faced, version and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The squeeze tube lets you get every last drop out and the performance is equal to Urban Decay&#x27;s primer.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. It&#x27;s a nice cheaper solution to the Urban Decay primer potion. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other colored/shimmery primer.</li>
    <li> Living in florida we will try anything once as I did with the Too faced eyelid primer. Well, in short, it sucked ass! After repeated attempts I gave it a 2cnd, 3rd, and 12th chance and not once did it live up to the hype. I looked ridiculous with great lipstick and disappearing eye shadow. Please don&#x27;t waste ur hard earned $$$$ girls!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this with my eye shadow and it works good. I went to a out doors wedding and it was hot and humid, my eye shadow say on, and I did not have to refresh my eye shadow. A little goes a long ways, so you will have the product for a while. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is a great buy only thing I&#x27;ll add is that it is hard to take it off! I had to use two wipes per eye then wash face twice! your eyeshadow isn&#x27;t going anywhere during the day! lol</li>
    <li> Had heard good things about this product but I can&#x27;t share the same thoughts.  It comes out oily ( I have tried storing the tube uspside down, and kneading the tube but it doesnt help).  I have found no difference at all in how long my eyeshadow lasts when using this product.</li>
    <li> I have oily eyelids and I think this product definitely helps to keep my makeup on. I can finally play with eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> got it for my lil sis in law who is a starter in make up, she loves it and says it works great :]</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. No grassy and your eyeshadow remains in place all day. I definetly recomend this product. I have used other primers like Mac,  estee lauder, nars or many moré and this is the best.</li>
    <li> This is the most important thing in my make up bag!! I absolutely love this!!&lt;br /&gt;This arrived so fast and it exactly what I needed!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I use it everyday it keeps my shadow looking fresh all day I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying my eyeshadow</li>
    <li> I work 12 hour days, sweating, running, working hard. This stuff works as hard as me :) It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that works to keep my &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; shadows in place.</li>
    <li> The Too faced cosmetics product was very helpful.  The coverage did last for the entire day with out requiring touch ups.  A little pricy.</li>
    <li> Yay! My eye shadow no longer creases! After a full day with any eye shadow (cheap drugstore or even Clinique and Estée Lauder) it always creased (after even just an hour). Thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t have creases at all!</li>
    <li> great eye lid primer. just wish it came in a bigger package so i wouldn&#x27;t have to keep ordering it</li>
    <li> This primer is cheaper than the primers that I usually buy, but it works just as well.  I also love the tube, I only use as much as I need and it travels better than other packaging that has cracked on me.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product for a long time. My friend strongly recommended this as a eyeshadow primer.. But, I&#x27;m not sure how old this is.. Cuz this primer looks like too old. (The formula started to be separated..) Product is ok,but you should check out how old it is. I just don&#x27;t use it anymore..</li>
    <li> I have the greasiest eyelids, but this stuff actually works!  It doesn&#x27;t keep eyeliner on very well, but my eyeshadow stays on great after a full day of work, so I just touch up my eyeliner and I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye primer to use! It applies smoothly, prevents creasing, and holds eyeshadows in place and for a long duration. The tube is greatl because you can choose how much product to use rather than an applicator tip. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For years I have tried to find something to stop my eyeshadow from creasing.  Finally found a product I can swear by.  SUPER FAST SHIPPING! 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. I have very hooded eyelids and eyeshadow creases within the first 10 minutes. It was a long journey to find a primer that works and this stuff does. You don&#x27;t need to much either and it blends to the skin tone well. The price is great too for what it&#x27;s worth compared to other higher prices brands.</li>
    <li> Mine came in a Too Faced box, this primer stopped my eyelid creasing- Sometimes i use it on my legs Its the Real Brand</li>
    <li> I used to use Urban Decay Primer Potion[[ASIN:B004S9TYH4 Urban Decay Urban Decay Urban Decay Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion Tube - Original Original 0.37 oz 0.37 oz 0.37 oz 0.37 oz]], but I wanted to try another brand. After reading the reviews, I ordered this product. So far it&#x27;s working just as well as the Urban Decay brand. This primer is a little thinner in consistency, but my eyeshadow lasts all day with no creasing nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found this product.  My new moisturizer has a slipperier finish than I was used to, so my shadow was migrating away from my eyes... even into them during my morning commute.  NO GOOD.  When I complained to a more makeup-savvy friend, she ordered me to buy and start using eyeshadow primer.  She recommended either this brand or Urban Decay, and since this was at a somewhat lower price point than UD, I figured I would give it a try first.  I am so glad I did!  Just make sure you apply very sparingly and let it take a moment to set or dry first... I just let it set while I brush my teeth.  The first day, I made the mistake of putting the shadow on too soon after the primer and ended up with the worst eyeshadow creases EVER and even crow&#x27;s feet of shadow at the corners of my eyes!  This primer has even redeemed shadows I stopped using because I felt they were too powdery and drifted down into my lashes and onto the tops of my cheeks... powder looks great and stays put.</li>
    <li> I ought to get my insurance money since my eye makeup melted off my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I guess my eyelids are still too oily that this product won&#x27;t save my eye shadow.  Wicked bummer. I don&#x27;t think this product does anything for my eyes other than making it a light beige and tint my eyelashes that color too (it&#x27;s unpleasant). 2 stars because I like the company&#x27;s ethics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I guess I&#x27;ll go try out Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product. It&#x27;s very thin. Not sure if that&#x27;s a good or bad thing. Might just be I&#x27;m used to mac&#x27;s paint pots or Kat Von d&#x27;s primer. It does work but it creases every now an than.</li>
    <li> A must have for any eyeshadow application. It lasts so all day and maybe even overnight.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t keep my shadow from creasing at all. I have normal to dry skin. I tried using less, I tried using more. It&#x27;s just not for me. I have a full tube sitting in one of my makeup drawers waiting til I pass it on to a friend. I didn&#x27;t feel like my shadow was as vibrant as when I use my MAC paint pot, sad cause this stuff is a wee pricey</li>
    <li> I love this product ♡♡♡♡</li>
    <li> This product prevents you from getting raccoon eyes by the end of the day. You can keep the morning fresh look you applied this morning.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My eyes are very small and crease very easily. I used this product under the NYX jumbo eye pencils (and if you&#x27;ve used those before, you know those are famous for how bad they crease) and my eye shadow lasted ALL DAY with NO creases!!! :O Very pleasantly surprised! Love it and will be buying the glitter glue shortly!</li>
    <li> This product is like glue your eyeshadow will hold until the next day love it love it love it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent eye primer! Made my eye liner and shadow look so much cleaner and better! Would recommend to all women!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. GREAT PRICE. WORKS. DONT CREASE EVEN WHEN SLEPT IN.. THE NEXT MORNING MY MAKEUP LOOKED GREAT .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CREAMY... A LITTLE GREASY IF U DONT USE IT OFTEN BUT IF U PUSH IT AROUND IT GETS ITS CONSISTANCY BACK, I THINKT HATS THE SETTLING OF THE PRODUCT. BUT IT DEF WORKS. FAST FAST FAST SHIPPING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL ORDER AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> Makes eye shadow stay put.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It&#x27;s worth the extra step not to have eye shadow creasing or ending up smudging under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Product actually does as it says! If I fall asleep with my make-up on, my eye make-up looks exactly the same in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It adds a little shimmer, and keeps your eye makeup in place.</li>
    <li> I usually use urban decay eyeshadow primer, and now I know why!! This stuff does not work.  Eyeshadow creases in 6 hrs within having on lids.  Urban decay lasts me through an entire 16hr work shift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy again!</li>
    <li> This primer is the **it.  Staying power is wonderful and it does not crease your shadow over time.  Makes all my shadows pop like I never knew (even with MAC products that are already high in pigment.)  Also, you do not need alot of product to get the desired effect and it is way easier than Urban Decays primer as far as getting the stuff out the bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I first tested it on my hand. On one side I put the primer and then applied the eye shadow and on the other just the eye shadow. The primer side lasted for hours and was much more saturated than the non primer side. The non primer side was nearly gone in less than an hour Even with my cheap eye shadows the primer made them look great! I have nothing but good things to say about this product!</li>
    <li> Glitter glue works better. This is nice if you don&#x27;t need your makeup to stay on all day/night. It is also MUCH easier to wash off than the Glitter Glue. When I go out I usually go dancing, so sweating my make-up off isn&#x27;t an option. If you&#x27;re going dancing or you know you&#x27;ll be sweating, I recommend Glitter Glue. Otherwise, this works just fine. This also has a pale peach tint to it so it would work to show your colors better if you&#x27;re darker skinned.</li>
    <li> I have oily eyelids and this product works well at preventing my eye shadow from creasing.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Had my doubts but this stuff really works. I put it under my eye shadow every morning and my shadow is still in the same place when I go to wash it off at night.</li>
    <li> I was using UD and that was too dry for me, dry skin. But this one totally fixed the problem!!! long-lasting!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup aficionado, but I just started appreciating primers. This primer not only holds my eye-shadow all day without creasing, it also feels nice going on, sort of cooling. I briefly entertained the thought of getting the Urban Decay primer, but I&#x27;m glad I went with the Too Faced since it does a great job at a smaller price tag.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars I would, because this is a complete fake. I thought it looked slightly off when I looked at the tube. And the formula had a different color/texture.  I had purchased this before at a sephora store and loved it. But what I purchased here is definitely not the same. My eyeshadow would crease with the fake. I just ordered a new tube from sephora&#x27;s website. Save yourself the money and purchase from an actual beauty store.</li>
    <li> If you are searching for a product that will make your eye shadow last for more than the night, search no more. You will never try or use anything else again once you purchase this!</li>
    <li> Like others have said, this product has a thin, liquid consistency. I prefer it over cream primers as those tend to dry out after a while and they can be difficult to blend over the eye without getting a cakey spot. I love this primer and wear it even if I&#x27;m not wearing eye shadow, just to even out the color on my eyelids. My only complaint is that it comes in a tube that&#x27;s not very well made. The tapered part of the tube keeps coming off in the lid. It&#x27;s annoying, but not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> The seller was great at getting my product to me in a timely fashion however if I were to have paid full price for the product I would have been extremely disappointed. For me, it doesn&#x27;t prevent creases at all which was the mains reason for my buying the item but I have used it on clients and it works well for a few of them, not all. I would for sure buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> i have oily lids i just use this to control the oil and barely under eye shadow, i use to to uni and this stuff works from 7am-2pm(longest i had it on) dry may occur but my lids are seriously oily!!!</li>
    <li> It works for the most part but it still leaves a crease after a couple of hours. Though, I have very oily eye lids compare to most women but I think this type of eye primer works better on dry to normal skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that makes my eye shadows last without fading or creasing. I had a tube for 2 years, admittedly it was weekly and not daily use. UDPP is nothing compared to this stuff.</li>
    <li> Or Maybe I should say my daughter loves it, if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy so that&#x27;s all there is to it</li>
    <li> You can NEVER go wrong with any Two Faced Cosmetics. I love this primer!  Not ideal for glitters and such but I use it daily for mattes and smokey eyes. It brings out all the colors in a smokey eye and holds the shade down for hours!</li>
    <li> This rates right up there with Urban Decay primer potion. I actually like it better than the UD primer. It works really well maybe even better. You won&#x27;t disappointed in buying this product. I will buy this over and over again!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! It is amazing, I can&#x27;t even do my eye shadow without after using it! It keeps your eye shadow on all day and makes the color of your eye shadow look amazing! Buy this product!</li>
    <li> I heard really good things about this primer and I wanted to find something to help my make up last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this.  It didn&#x27;t work for me. I still get creases in my eye shadow.  It extending the wear of my make up maybe an additional 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does last longer than my make up does without it, but not enough to justify spending money on something that doesn&#x27;t extend my make up for more than 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Cannot attest to the seller, but as far as the product goes, it is the most fabulous eye primer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried several, including Urban Decay. Urban Decay&#x27;s is pretty good, but doesn&#x27;t have the longevity that Too Faced does. I have very oily eyelids so without primer my shadow is done after a few hours, but with this product I literally could sleep overnight (and have, oops!) with my makeup on and the shadow is still totally intact. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;d say buy a travel size version and give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one more thing I&#x27;d like to add is urban decay&#x27;s primer does come out much thicker and SEEMS like it would be the better product compared to too faced&#x27;s more watery primer, but for some reason that doesn&#x27;t really affect it.</li>
    <li> Love it it makes my eyeshadow look awesome and it make it last long but just when you put it on I advise to let it dry a bit befor you apply  your eyeshadow</li>
    <li> I have extremly oil skin on my face, and my eyelids have become just as oily in the last year. I have tried all types and kinds of eye primers with little luck and minimal satisfaction. A coworker suggested I try this and it was pretty expensive in the sotres ($18) and I got lucky to find it on amazon for a few bucks less since this was a test run. almost a month later I would pay over $18 for this product. It is the holu grail of eye primers. My shaodows still look as flawless at 10pm as they did when i first applied them at 6am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING product</li>
    <li> I had many people recommend the Shadow Insurance to me so I finally decided to try it out. I was disappointed. Every time I go to use it a good amount of what looks and feels like oil comes out before any product does. I&#x27;ve tried mixing up the product my rubbing/massaging the tube but the oil always comes out. I hate feeling like I&#x27;m wasting product, and I can&#x27;t even use it without &amp;#34;draining&amp;#34; it first.</li>
    <li> This is the only shadow primer that works for me. I&#x27;ve tried ELF, UD, and Benefit, and none of them cause consistent results. When I apply the Too Faced shadow insurance. I pat it onto the lid, and then with a brush I pat the eye shadow into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will... gives you a good base upon which to apply eye shadow.  The shadow stays put... and I live in a tropical climate.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much&lt;br /&gt;This product is smooth and really helps with a great eyeshadow application. You don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last you for a while.</li>
    <li> I got a little packet of the product when I purchased an eyeshadow collection from this company. I used it on one eye and not the other and applied the eyeshadow as I normally would. The eye with the shadow insurance looked like I&#x27;d just applied the eyeshadow without fading right up until the time I washed my face.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have always wanted to try and finally got it.  It is wonderful, a little goes a long way.  If your thinking about buying this to try. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> At Sephora, this product runs about $20, so I was surprised to see it here for much cheaper.  It works very well and I don&#x27;t get any eyeshadow creasing throughout the day.  The colors stay pretty vibrant at the end of the day, and living in Texas means that makeup meltdown is something I have to deal with daily.  I&#x27;d say is comparable to the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer.</li>
    <li> After using Shadow Insurance, I refuse to use any other eye shadow primer...this stuff really makes shadows blend really well and keeps them on my lid until I wash them off. Love it.</li>
