<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All Avalon Organics give an impression of being organic through the label. But put your glasses on and read the fine print only 70 % organic , which means 30% chemicals.Avalon Organics (30%chemicals) t&#x27;s not nice to fool your customers!!!!</li>
    <li> So happy with this facial gel. It smells great and does a nice job cleansing. I love that it is organic and natural- even my kids use it and it doesn&#x27;t bother their sensitive skin. I have combination acne prone skin and this cleanser has helped keep my skin clear. I use it with a very soft facial brush.</li>
    <li> Gentle, smells good, cleans well I love this brand! I will buy it again when it runs out. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Very strong smell and gives me acne (I&#x27;m in my 30s), but I suppose it would be good for some.</li>
    <li> I used this last night and it hurt my face, this morning my face was very itchy and I used it again tonight and it just burned my face, I look horrible, my face is so red and swollen it hurts, burns and itches so bad.  I only use organic product for everything and I had no problem with beauty juice so I won&#x27;t use this again.  And I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin besides there were some ingredient in it that just don&#x27;t convince me at all.  The shipping was horrible it took forever and the gel was open and the gel was all over the package, horrible shipping someone just put in bag and send it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years and still love it--great fragrance, effective cleansing and gentle on my skin, which doesn&#x27;t feel right or dry afterward.  I&#x27;m over 50 and can skip a moisturizer after using this cleanser and still have beautiful, glowing skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> first off ive heard nd seen this product on and offline but never thought to buy it&lt;br /&gt;so after debaten to buy it, i purshased it, my skin type is very dry/sensitive skin .&lt;br /&gt;so when i tryed it it was okay, nd ma skin didnt agree. felt stingy dry wasent happy, couldnt return it&lt;br /&gt;30 days past personally didnt wrk for me ;( claims to be for sensitive skin, well nt mine lol</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter really loves this product.  The soap is soft and sudsy and does a good job of cleaning. She feels it unblocks pores without  drying out the skin so she can use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for many years. It makes my skin feel soft and clean, especially when paired with the toner and lotion. I formerly purchased it from a health food store that was 40 minutes away from my house.  It became irritating to go that far to get it, so I decided to order online.  The product was promised in 3-4 weeks, not great, but okay.  It came in just a few days!  Needless to say I am very impressed with this seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face wash for about 3 years now and it&#x27;s worked very well for me. I was a serial face product changer- this is the longest I&#x27;ve ever used something. Occasionally, I try out something else, but I always end up buying this again. So, I guess it works for me. I use it about 6 days out of the week, once or twice a week I use a Yes to Blueberries face wipe (this can be a bit harsh on sensitive skin- not for daily use for anyone using Avalon Lavender).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive skin, I break out in the heat and I&#x27;m severely allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide, although I can tolerate Salicyclic Acid for a couple days. I have combination skin as well, oily T- zone. I use the Clarisonic Mia twice a week with this cleanser to exfoliate and the California Baby Calendula Cream regularly (that happened on a whim when I had a scratch on my face, I&#x27;m also allergic to neosporin and bacitracin so I use stuff like that instead... and it does say, \\&quot;for sensitive adults\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I can&#x27;t think of one funky side affect this stuff has given me, my skin does feel a bit tight after cleaning, but I always follow with the Cali Baby (extremely small amounts) and I feel fine.&lt;br /&gt;I find the lavender smell pleasant, but I only use natural and unscented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and reason for deducting one star is the bottle leaks. And leaks. And leaks. Seriously, fix the bottle. It leaks out the pump. It should not leak so much, it&#x27;s annoying to waste who knows how much cleanser and rinsing off the bottle cuz its all sticky on the outside pisses me off.</li>
    <li> THIS stuff is great. It smells amazing, REAL lavender, probably my first time smelling the real thing and not the fake thing. It scrubs away at acne to expose it so that the disgusting stuff can ooze out, and it makes complexion much better. It keeps the oily areas clean and dry, and moisturizes the dry areas. I don&#x27;t know how it does that. WOW this stuff is great. And it smells so good sometimes I squirt a little out of the bottle just so the bathroom will smell like this stuff. I&#x27;m gonna be needing to get the large size next. GREAT.</li>
    <li> Word of caution when using this product.Recently, I purchased this facial wash and on the label it said for sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but thought this would be a mild product.The first night I used it, I felt a mild tingling and stinging sensation, but I thought it was the cleansing agent working. My face felt a bit dry and tight the next day. Day 2 night I used it and stronger burning and pain developed.I Immediately tried to wash my face but the stinging continued.The next morning I awoke to find my eyes swollen shut and my lips swollen.  I am not a sensitive or allergic type person.. I don&#x27;t have any allergies or skin problems. Be careful if you are going to use this stuff. I would not recommend it to ANYONE!I am on day two of swollen eyes and my skins feels like it is on fire with a bad sunburn. Eyes are watering and painful.</li>
    <li> have tried lots of other cleansers but this one really works and is organic.  i wear mineral make up and it removes it and all my eye make up with no problem at all. my skin really feels clean with this product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived half-opened, so gel spread all across the rest of my shipments inside the box. Not sure whose fault that is, but it  seems an easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is great for washing hypoallergenic oily skin.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this stuff. I am using it with my Clarisonic . Gets my skin very clean. I wear make up everyday but i was simpered with how truelt clean my skin was I skipped the makeup! Lovely smell. I bought this because I love Lavender If it helps, I have dry to normal skin with lots of black heads and minor acne and I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s. A little goes a long way with this stuff as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial cleansers and this is by far my favorite and the best. It takes off your make up, cleans your face and leaves moisture on your skin.  It does not strip it.</li>
    <li> Great scent, but not the best cleanser! Don&#x27;t waste your money! I would go with alba botanica cleansers!</li>
    <li> I like Avon Organics and had expected to like it based on other products I use. It delivered. I like it!</li>
    <li> This product work amazingly since the first time you use it you can see the difference, your face feels amazing and it glows!</li>
    <li> I love using this facial cleanser with the sweet lavender scent first thing every morning. try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. the only negative was shipping as it was tipped a leaked a bit in the box.</li>
    <li> Has been very effective at reducing acne and redness from rosacea.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful non-irritating cleanser that does exactly what It says.  I have sensitive skin, and it is doing a great job of cleansing and leaving my skin glowing.  It is 70% organic which I really like.  Some cleansers OTC irritate my skin and cause it to itch, but not this one!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this facial wash daily. It has a clean and fresh scent and rinses clean. The cleanser is quite thin and has a tendency to run through your fingers before it reaches your face. Overall I have enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of my skin after using the cleanser and rinsing my face.  It feels so much better on my face than drying soap and it also feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Great for your skin, not too harsh and helps keep skin beautiful: nice smell too.</li>
    <li> I have used several products from this line and loved them. This, however, has a smell that is so overwhelming, it instantly gives me a headache. I&#x27;m also still peeling 3 days after using it twice.</li>
    <li> Takes off everything I don&#x27;t want- dirt, makeup and excess oil- but doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its essential oils and keeps my skin looking bright and hydrated. I have very sensitive and allergic skin, this is the only face wash I use.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the past and it smelled SO good. This time it did not. Smelled soapy and almost a chemical smell. I won&#x27;t purchase this product again</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s smells good, and is a smooth, silky cleanser to my face.  My face feels refreshed, and it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a natural cleanser that is gentle on my skin.  This is perfect for removing my makeup at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love!  I&#x27;ve use this product for years and will probably continue to use it for years to come.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality.  Keeps my face moist and supple.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cleanser. Smells great, gentle on my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
    <li> This Cleanser is a good partner for the Avalon Organics Lavender Scrub. It has a gentle and therapeutic lavender smell (not overpowering), and seems to be a good quality cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip the face of moisture which can lead to a greasy face later in the day. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is okay, nothing special</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I have been using it for 4 months now. It leaves my skin soft and feeling very clean. I also have acne-prone skin and this stuff keeps me from having break outs. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Smells great but it  is not as deep cleaning as I had hoped.  Arrived on time and as promised.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this would&#x27;ve worked when I was in high school. But using this daily has been great.. No greasiness.. No burning.. I have not been disappointed with avalon organics</li>
    <li> The products gave me serious skin irritation that wouldn&#x27;t go away for a few hours.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this cleanser, my face BURNS. I&#x27;ve been using the night cream from the same company and never had an issue. I needed to get more cleanser (my old cleanser raised their prices) so I decided to try this one. Big mistake! I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m allergic to (if anything), but I cannot use this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not allergic to any of the ingredients, try it. I like the smell and the price is decent. This product does not lather up like you would expect a soap would (should?), but my face did feel clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Super gentle and smells great. Leaves face feeling clean, moisturized and calm, especially if you have redness. It&#x27;s simple stuff.</li>
    <li> i purchased this item and it had no smell and was a different consistency then the one i buy from the stores</li>
    <li> Skin feels totally clean without stripping it of moisture. Light beautiful and natural fragrance is therapeutic.I highly recommend this product for those looking for organic ingredients. I favor this brand of products over all of the others that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I used the Orange before and can not decide between the two. They are both awesome. The lavender is calming and the orange invigorating.</li>
    <li> just love the way my skin looks and feels when I use this...I even had a sore on my upper neck which I couldn&#x27;t find anything to heal it and after 2 washings with this it is gone and has been since I started using this about 2 weeks ago.  love this product.  I have oily skin and like how my skin looks and feels now</li>
    <li> No irritation at all.  Been using for years.  I&#x27;m African American and in my 30s by the way.</li>
    <li> I thought it could have been creamy and more cleansing for me. I have sensitive skin so it was okay but not as much of a cleaner for my skin.</li>
    <li> Products cap was not screwed shut all the way. Delivered with only half of the bottles contents. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this. essential oils, natural, no animal testing.  great way to start the day!</li>
    <li> My husband is the oily type. He gets large pimples on his scalp even though he showers every morning. He thought to borrow my face soap and try it. It made the pimples go away on his scalp. So now he basically uses this as shampoo. As for me, I have very dry and sensitive skin with numerous allergies to products, even organic ones. I rarely get a pimple or blemish. This product does not make my face red or irritated. I use this and then use the matching face lotion afterwards. Very soft skin and not irritated at all.</li>
