      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have short hair, perfect stuff.</li>
      <li>If you need something more durable for longer hair, try the Got2B Hair Glue products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Super strong hair gel that&#x27;ll hold for more than 24 hours if needed; don&#x27;t forget to shower&lt;</li>
      <li>dont mind a light smell, but theres no reason that your hair gel should be stronger than your cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>require a handful of gel to create your unique hair style</li>
      <li>and I ordered several to keep a good supply on hand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great and one thing that really surprised me, ITS HUGE, I did NOT expect a bottle of gel that big</li>
      <li>i like this gel very much.</li>
      <li>Really!</li>
      <li>Works great on thick hair.</li>
      <li>: Strong hold,long lasting,</li>
      <li>I use this stuff and it really does work, except if your hair is longer than 1.5-2 inches.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
      <li>If you use too much, it&#x27;ll flake.</li>
      <li>This worked really well when I do my finger coils and twist.</li>
      <li>Those have a very sticky feeling, but they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The gel is clear and has a very nice smell to it compared to Garnier&#x27;s other hair gel that is cloudy white.  </li>
      <li>Like some of the other products better.</li>
      <li>I have thick, coarse, short hair and this works perfectly for me!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much as directed on the bottle itself to only use dime-size amount; I use a little more than a quarter-size worth.  </li>
      <li>I do use a little bit of hairspray on top of this product so that may be a factor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>I have tried several different types of hair gels, and found most of them to work okay, but did not last very long.</li>
      <li>but this hair gel allows me to spike my hair in a way that makes me look like a normal person rather than from some cartoon show.  </li>
      <li>to this product, it smells nice (like a fruit concoction) and it&#x27;s not too sticky or thick.</li>
      <li>but if they could thin it out just a little its perfect.</li>
      <li>: Takes a little while to dry, The smell is really strong at first</li>
      <li>Put a little more product if you need to, but water (or damp hands) is key to getting it spread evenly and not clump together in globs.</li>
      <li>The power level is at a max of 10 with a 24 hour extreme hold written in bold directly on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>No one wants globs on the back that you couldn&#x27;t mix into your hair</li>
      <li>Comes out easy though it is tougher getting the last half of the gel out.</li>
      <li>I just got my hair cut short enough to spike for the first time</li>
      <li>This stuff holds better than anything else I have ever used for my naturally curly, thick hair without drying it out!</li>
      <li>If you use it on wet or even damp hair, you can get classic 90s spikes.</li>
      <li>I have extremely thick hair which makes me look like a Super Saiyan from Dragon Ball Z every waking morning.  </li>

<li> This is one of the few that actually works.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not sticky or flaky like other brands.</li>
<li> I usually have it in for 10+ hours before washing it out and the hold is solid.</li>
<li> The only negative is that if you use a lot, after it dries, it begins to flake, looking on my shirt like dandruff.</li>
<li> Then it starts to bow down to the weight of the strands.</li>
<li> I need to put hair gel in my hair if I have slightly longer hair, in order for it to be weighed down and not as puffy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product does not cause your hair to flake. It is just a tad too hard/thick. I thought maybe going to level 9 was the fix to that but it isn&#x27;t. The #9 is a paste like product and dries before you get it thru your hair. This product is almost perfect but if they could thin it out just a little its perfect. Oh by the way #8 is too thin.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of hair gels, and found most of them to work okay, but did not last very long. This stuff really does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It holds all day, and even into the next day. The only negative is that if you use a lot, after it dries, it begins to flake, looking on my shirt like dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Most stores have stopped carrying it and so thankful that Amazon does. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I have really thick, heavy hair. I used to use Got2B hair glue to keep my messy spike look up all day, but that stuff was sticky and my hair was gross if I didn&#x27;t wash it out within 10 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this gel since I generally like Garnier products, and it is the best product I have used yet. I love the smell (my girlfriend does, too!), it holds all day, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I have a rat&#x27;s nest on top of my head after extended use.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other products better.</li>
    <li> This gel is my husband&#x27;s preferred hair gel. It&#x27;s not sticky or flaky like other brands. It holds well throughout the day and has a nice smell. We have purchased this product multiple times.</li>
    <li> But have shopped everywhere for it and can not find it in any stores.  When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled.  Don&#x27;t know why it stopped being offered in Walmarts, Walgreens and CVS, but thank God for Amazon, arrived on time, and I ordered several to keep a good supply on hand.  It does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t give the grandson the spike the hairdresser received. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very well. Bottle with the number 9 on it holds stronger.</li>
    <li> Rock hard spikes !!! Lasts all day !!!</li>
    <li> The best gel for my husband - a level 10 - works great holding style for up to 3 days!  Really!</li>
    <li> Great stuff that does what it says.  I&#x27;m a guy that doesn&#x27;t spike my hair, I just like to have a gel that is durable and won&#x27;t flake.&lt;br /&gt;Even after wrestling with my kids and going to sleep, the stuff doesn&#x27;t flake and still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;Great job Garnier!</li>
    <li> This stuff holds better than anything else I have ever used for my naturally curly, thick hair without drying it out!</li>
    <li> This worked really well when I do my finger coils and twist. I am natural and my hair come out awesome. The hold is great and there is not residue or flakes.</li>
    <li> the hold is great, but they put an extremely heavy smell in it and when you wear it all you can smell is the perfume and its annoying. The smell is like a very heavy tangerine rind.&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt take it anymore, I had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont mind a light smell, but theres no reason that your hair gel should be stronger than your cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Just awful.</li>
    <li> I just got my hair cut short enough to spike for the first time so it was a trial and error with different products but once I found this stuff i stuck with it. It Holds for a long time. I usually have it in for 10+ hours before washing it out and the hold is solid. My Spikes stay in place even when I mess with it and touch the spikes.I do use a little bit of hairspray on top of this product so that may be a factor as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Strong hold,long lasting, Nice Smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Takes a little while to dry, The smell is really strong at first but it fades after like 30 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I love this product and i will definitely continue to use it every day</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Comes out easy though it is tougher getting the last half of the gel out. Just sit the bottle (as pictured) and it will come out easier.  The hold is excellent.  Your hair will not move or waiver one bit!.  Lasts all day and into the next.  Great price and great product.  Smells good, not foul like some of the others</li>
    <li> Works great on thick hair. I need to put hair gel in my hair if I have slightly longer hair, in order for it to be weighed down and not as puffy. I use this stuff and it really does work, except if your hair is longer than 1.5-2 inches. Then it starts to bow down to the weight of the strands. If you need something more durable for longer hair, try the Got2B Hair Glue products. Those have a very sticky feeling, but they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product, it smells nice (like a fruit concoction) and it&#x27;s not too sticky or thick. you don&#x27;t need a lot of product. Just put a quarter size on palm of hands, rub together, and then put through your hair. Damp your hands and run them through your hair again. Put a little more product if you need to, but water (or damp hands) is key to getting it spread evenly and not clump together in globs. No one wants globs on the back that you couldn&#x27;t mix into your hair lol</li>
    <li> My hair stays up for the whole day, and even the next morning (though I usually take a shower and reapply) It&#x27;s great and one thing that really surprised me, ITS HUGE, I did NOT expect a bottle of gel that big but man :) it&#x27;s nice to know I won&#x27;t need to re-buy for a while!</li>
    <li> My son &amp; I are hooked on this stuff. I have long curly hair &amp; like the hold, my son loves it for the hold on his preppy Harry Stiles hair. They stopped carrying this in the stores so now we buy this on Amazon, stocking up 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> Great spike gel.  Could not find in the stores so this was a good find.  Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked through about 30 different hair products now in the search for product that can tame my thick hair. I&#x27;ve been using this constantly for a few years now, still trying out other products along the way. This is one of the few that actually works. Using a dime-sized amount on dry hair is enough to style my hair in a way that actually holds up to humidity and activity. If you use too much, it&#x27;ll flake. If you use it on wet or even damp hair, you can get classic 90s spikes. If you pair it with a blow dryer, you can get it to hold quicker and get the style you want.</li>
    <li> The thickest gel ever! I have thick, coarse, short hair and this works perfectly for me! It doesn&#x27;t flake like some brands and comes at a great price! Another Subscribe &amp; Save winner!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> i like this gel very much. it holds my hair in place all day yet its not to messy</li>
    <li> Serious Review; Puns Intended:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give yourself an anime hairstyle with this hair gel.  Garnier Fructis Style Spike Explosion Power Gel will give any short hair the spikes it deserves.  The power level is at a max of 10 with a 24 hour extreme hold written in bold directly on the bottle.  I have extremely thick hair which makes me look like a Super Saiyan from Dragon Ball Z every waking morning.  It&#x27;s practically impossible to get rid of my bedhead but this hair gel allows me to spike my hair in a way that makes me look like a normal person rather than from some cartoon show.  The hold last all day including the next day, that is if you don&#x27;t shower...  The gel is clear and has a very nice smell to it compared to Garnier&#x27;s other hair gel that is cloudy white.  Don&#x27;t use too much as directed on the bottle itself to only use dime-size amount; I use a little more than a quarter-size worth.  Allow some time for the hair gel to settle and hold before heading out or else the wind will ruin your hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr Summary List:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super strong hair gel that&#x27;ll hold for more than 24 hours if needed; don&#x27;t forget to shower&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t require a handful of gel to create your unique hair style&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice and easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;Allow a minute or so for the hair gel to hold before heading out</li>
    <li> It keeps your hair stiff all day. It does flake slightly but not noticeable and nothing a little water won&#x27;t fix. its the best stuff I&#x27;ve​ used.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have short hair, perfect stuff.</li>
