      <li>it&#x27;s now my favorite body wash from now on!</li>
      <li>I was happy to find out that it had quite a nice and pleasing rose/berry smell, probably a bit more berry than rose when applied to the skin.</li>
      <li>This sounds wonderful but after my shower the first day I had an appointment with my doctor and then went to have my hair cut.</li>
      <li>I like Caress because they seem more pleasant to the nose, so to speak.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;This lathers up well and has a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>They lather well and rinse out nicely.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice lather that I remember</li>
      <li>To be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t have picked up this bottle with a picture of a rose on the front for a smell test at the store for that reason alone.</li>
      <li>This smells so nice.  </li>
      <li>My husband said it smelled nice,</li>
      <li>A good price, great lather, and a refreshing clean feeling</li>
      <li>but I brushed my arm mid-day and surprisingly smelled the wonderful scent.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the strong scent - it does smell good -</li>
      <li>I do like it, and it&#x27;s very, very strong.</li>
      <li>By far the best Caress product I have ever used!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a nice wash, however, and the name, Caress, is quite appropriate.</li>
      <li>It smells ok, it suds up nicely</li>
      <li>Rinses off easily too!</li>
      <li>Reminds me of some Valentine&#x27;s Day special that I loved as a high-schooler and could never find again.</li>
      <li>However, this is the First time I&#x27;ve experienced this problem with any Caress product.</li>
      <li>Great scent, very gentle on my skin, love it.</li>
      <li>The scent is kind of strong and could have allergic reactions for people with asthma.</li>
      <li>The Crimson color and wonderful smell were a welcome change to most body washes I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>I thought surely my hair dresser would say something but then</li>
      <li>You do get a hilarious scratch and sniff benefit from the time release aspect.</li>
      <li>This body wash is okay, but I&#x27;m sticking with my Olay and Dove body washes.</li>
      <li>many soaps,</li>
      <li>but when you are using it it smells even better.</li>
      <li>I love this body wash.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed that, but it is enjoyable to use.</li>
      <li>what more could you ask for ?</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s now my favorite caress product.</li>
      <li>Upon using this, noticed Caress Love</li>
      <li>reference sake, some of my favorite body washes are Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, Seventh Generation and Dove products...</li>
      <li>, my wife just finished the bottle of soap and has sent me to find more..  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is just OK</li>
      <li>The scent, described as &amp;#34;floriental,&amp;#34; sounds appealing but to me came across as much more fruity than floral.  </li>
      <li>Aesthetically, it&#x27;s a lovely mauve color and produces plenty of sudsy foam when applied in the bath.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what they put in this, but I&#x27;ve never smelled better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be giving my bottle of Caress Love Forever to my niece.</li>
      <li>A wonderful scent arose from the bottle, although quite red in color which was a bit freaky.</li>
      <li>It is ok.  </li>
      <li>Caress Body Wash in Love</li>
      <li>Overall very happy with the Caress Body Wash, Love Forever.  </li>
      <li>And it does make a lovely</li>
      <li>I am glad I did not smell t every time I touched my skin, though.</li>
      <li>This one lathers up very nicely and doesn&#x27;t require more than about 2 tablespoons for the whole wash.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a new user to Caress, this is a good one to start with (most are, to be honest).  </li>
      <li>The smell was pretty good</li>
      <li>It has a strong fragrance which i love.</li>
      <li>This is a smooth and gentle body wash with a very nice scent.</li>
      <li>While this may work &amp; be fine for many others, people who are super-sensitive with allergies may have a reaction.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit like catching a whiff of fresh laundry, though the fragrance is sweeter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s floral, but clean and not at all overwhelming.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve had bottles of shampoo that have flimsy tops which easily detach.)</li>
      <li>The bottle is well made to use in the shower, doesn&#x27;t slide out of slippery hands easily.</li>
      <li>The sent is strong but it does stay on all day.</li>
      <li>The odor was awful-so strong it burned my eyes-</li>
      <li>but I find it a bit strong.</li>
      <li>Some people that can&#x27;t stand strong smells will not like this at all</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great scent, very gentle on my skin, love it.</li>
    <li> This body wash is absolutely amazing! The Crimson color and wonderful smell were a welcome change to most body washes I have used in the past. The product lathers well, no need to use a large amount. Rinses off easily too! The aroma of this body wash lasts all day. Great product in general. By far the best Caress product I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> Some of the features and pros are as follows:- 1) The body wash is made with fragrance release pearls. 2) The fragrance is of scarlet roses and berries. 3) It moisturizes my skin considerably well.  Cons:- 1) The fragrance last for a few hours and then wears off. It does not last all day long as claimed. 2) The scent is kind of strong and could have allergic reactions for people with asthma. 3) The color of the body wash is burgundy red which is not very pleasant for the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash, it&#x27;s like no other.</li>
    <li> This has a nice smell but I find it a bit strong. My husband likes it. It has a nice lather that I remember Caress having probably a decade ago, if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t dry out my dry skin, but it definitely didn&#x27;t help it, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many soaps, it just a matter of your likes. While this is fine probably for most people, I need something for my winter skin, that&#x27;s a little less smelly as I prefer to have my perfume be the star, not clash.</li>
    <li> This is a smooth and gentle body wash with a very nice scent. I remove one star for the blood red color, mentioned by a few others, and the product&#x27;s failure to maintain a lasting scent, as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice wash, however, and the name, Caress, is quite appropriate. It feels like silk, going on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loving Caress body washes lately, and this one was no exception. While I have crazy dry skin and prefer creamier cleanser, this gel one never dried me out. It comes out RED, you can pretend you&#x27;re in a Hitchcock movie! Always a bonus. It&#x27;s a light, &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; scent that&#x27;s perfect for those who want a great-smelling body wash but hate super florals or fruit scents.</li>
    <li> I really like this body wash. It smells wonderful in the bottle but when you are using it it smells even better. It leaves your skin so soft. It has a strong fragrance which i love. Some people that can&#x27;t stand strong smells will not like this at all so keep that in mind. Thank you Influenster for letting me try it out. &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a nice body wash by Caress and the beautiful purple foam that came out was a surprise.  That was the first time I used a purple body wash but it smelled great.  I thought it was going to stain my skin but it went on smooth and silky.  I thought this would be great to do as they say that anytime someone touches my skin it will release a great fragrance.  This sounds wonderful but after my shower the first day I had an appointment with my doctor and then went to have my hair cut. None of them remarked about any fragrance on my skin.  I thought surely my hair dresser would say something but then from the whiff of the shampoo it is no wonder she did  not smell the fragrance from my body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great body wash after the shock of the color but is foams up nice and lathers up great. A great product so give it a try.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the strong scent - it does smell good - but I don&#x27;t think it lasts on you for as long as it says. You can smell it a couple hours maybe, if that. I am not sure what they are talking about when they say the fragrance is &amp;#34;released on touch,&amp;#34; because it doesn&#x27;t seem like you can smell it on you if you touch your skin or if anyone else touches you. It lathers up really nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel overly dry or tight. I like the scent, but prefer my perfumes if I want to smell good all day long. The scent of the body wash will interfere with your perfumes for the first couple hours until the scent of it wears off. I like this for bathing at night when I want to smell good, but don&#x27;t want to waste my perfumes just to go to sleep. If the scent lasted longer or if there were signs of the &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; claim, I would have given it 5 stars for living up to its claims, but I give 4 stars instead since I don&#x27;t see any of that.</li>
    <li> Upon using this, noticed Caress Love Forever body wash resembles very thick clotted blood.  Obviously, Caress would have been wiser to stay in the pink family.  The fragrance is just OK, perhaps a mango/rose combo?  The wash cleans fine, but is not moisturizing at ALL.  Have very dry skin so that&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the touch scent feature, can&#x27;t say that it exists.  After my shower, did not detect that the fragrance lingered at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an extremely average product.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice, and not strong. I don&#x27;t see that it lasts for 12 hours, though. (Not that I care about that--I don&#x27;t need to smell *like* something, I just want to be clean and not smell bad.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well, isn&#x27;t drying, but isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is really pretty. A deep, pearly burgundy. Of course, you only see that for a few seconds until you lather up. And I&#x27;m not crazy about coating myself in artificial coloring. I&#x27;d really rather it not be so loaded with dye. (I was actually worried at first that it would stain my washcloths, but it didn&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I didn&#x27;t find it any better or any worse than most body washes out there.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I really did not expect it to work but I brushed my arm mid-day and surprisingly smelled the wonderful scent.  I took my shower at around 5am in the morning and could still smell the scent in the evening.  It was subtle but still was pretty and did not interfere with my perfume.</li>
    <li> Lovely product had to buy extra for family who keeps pinching it from my shower.The scent is soothing and yummy.</li>
    <li> I never buy products tested on animals-this was most likely poured into some poor animals eyes or throat, as all Unilever products are-this arrived as a sample in the mail. Out of curiosity, I put some on my hand . The odor was awful-so strong it burned my eyes-( poor rabbits or beagles they use )-the products looks like menstrual blood-and it stained my hand- I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough. yuck.</li>
    <li> Smooth and creamy lather with a rich scent. Caress body wash in Love Forever scent really gives a lot of lather and feels heavenly over my skin. You only need use a little of this body wash to get the right amount to cleanse your entire body. The scent was a little stronger than I would prefer and I didn&#x27;t really feel it lasts as long as they say. If you like a strong perfume scent, this is a great body wash. If you prefer something lighter, skip it and stick to the regular Caress body washes.</li>
    <li> I really like this body was and its scent. The scent smells exactly the way it&#x27;s described on the bottle: &amp;#34;rich sweetness of scarlet roses and dark, lush berries.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a very lovely rose scent that doesn&#x27;t seem cloying like some similar fragrances -- this one&#x27;s more like fresh roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I&#x27;m not a huge fan of body washes because they seem to require too much product to get lather going on your scrubby. This one lathers up very nicely and doesn&#x27;t require more than about 2 tablespoons for the whole wash. I&#x27;ve been using the bottle for about a month and I still have 2/3 of it left. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry afterward either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you, though, the product is BLOOD RED. The first time I used it I thought I&#x27;d found a cut on my arm but it was just the unlathered body wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it claims to have something called &amp;#34;touch technology&amp;#34; which they claim means that every time you touch your skin you can smell the aroma again. I found this claim to be untrue. I really like the scent of this body wash but the only time I smell it is while I&#x27;m actually showering or for about an hour thereafter -- and I have a very sensitive nose.</li>
    <li> The scent is good but for me it&#x27;s a little overpowering. I am glad I did not smell t every time I touched my skin, though. The bottle is well made to use in the shower, doesn&#x27;t slide out of slippery hands easily. And it does make a lovely lather.&lt;br /&gt;But, unfortunately about 6 hours after I used this product on my skin, I got itchy. Really itchy. I decided not to use this for a few days to actually test if  Caress Body Wash caused this problem. After my skin healed, I tried the product again. Again, within 6 hours of using the product, my skin was itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I will say upfront my skin tends to be sensitive and this product was probably not a good match for me. Between the scent and the itch, I won&#x27;t buy use this again and I won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else. Your experience and skin may be totally different.</li>
    <li> Overall very happy with the Caress Body Wash, Love Forever.  The color was lovely, a deep red color and it lathered up very nicely and the smell was great as well.  My skin did have a lingering smell of this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;Product claims to be the Words first body wash with Fragrance touch technology - Touch your skin to release fine fragrance up to 12 hours.  I do not know if this really worked, however when I smelled my skin I could defiantly still smell the body wash, so perhaps it was working</li>
    <li> First of all, I love all Caress products, just not this one. A wonderful scent arose from the bottle, although quite red in color which was a bit freaky. I was going on a plane trip and I washed some of my scarves in it, but when I got there the scent was simply awful..I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out. Fortunately, my host washed my clothes and added Lenor fabric softener...I&#x27;ll be giving my bottle of Caress Love Forever to my niece. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> This Caress Body Wash pretty much lives up to its product description.  It&#x27;s supposed to smell like roses and berries and definitely has a strong, floral scent, though for some reason, I thought I detected notes of lilac, too.  Aesthetically, it&#x27;s a lovely mauve color and produces plenty of sudsy foam when applied in the bath.  It&#x27;s also supposed to release a scent when touched, which I did not really notice, but I did see a consistently strong scent after using, though perhaps not quite for the length of time specified in the description.  In late winter/early spring, which is when I tried the product, I tend to have dry, flaky skin, and this seemed to have a positive effect, with no itching after application (though my skin can be sensitive).  Finally, although this is a minor point, the bottle is nice and compact, and the top stayed on after removing the tape.  (I&#x27;ve had bottles of shampoo that have flimsy tops which easily detach.)</li>
    <li> Looks like blood...I scared my husband when he came into bathroom while I was taking a bath...lol...but it does smell good and lasted about 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> It smells ok, it suds up nicely but I do not notice the smell for 12 hours after I get out of the shower....  Maybe for an hour, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product and was interested to see if my finicky skin could take it (I liked the fragrance). Usually, even the mildest products make my skin do strange things. So, to stay cautious, I tried it on a small patch on the inside of my arm. After 24 hours, no reaction. So, the next step was to wash with it. I must say that this product far exceeded my expectations. It lathered up nicely and the fragrance was delightful. My skin does not retain a scent for a long period of time, maybe 1-2 hours on a good day. This lasted an amazing 6 hours. Lots of compliments and inquiries as to what I was wearing. I noticed that various other comments state that their skin reacted to the product and that is why I would recommend everyone to never, never try out any new product without a patch test and wait 24 hours before you &amp;#34;read&amp;#34; the test.</li>
    <li> I have used Caress Body Washes before and have enjoyed the fragrance.  The  Caress Body Wash Love Forever is certainly a different fragrance than previous Caress washes.  I found the fragrance to be nice but not very lasting, it is not overpowering when it suds up either.  It has a slightly floral smell.  This suds well and has a thick consistency when squeezed from the bottle.  You don&#x27;t need much.  My skin did not have a dry feeling after using it but it wasn&#x27;t as moisturized as other body washes like Dove.  This is a red color and you will know where soap has spilled in the shower.  Overall a nice fragrance with good sudsing action but not as moisturizing as I would like.</li>
    <li> Probably the slickest looking bottle of body wash I&#x27;ve ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;Ordinarily I don&#x27;t care or notice such things but this made a good impression from the start! Once I opened it up I was even more surprised by the shiny and sparkly blood red body wash that flowed out. I was happy to find out that it had quite a nice and pleasing rose/berry smell, probably a bit more berry than rose when applied to the skin. Just as it says one the bottle the smell lingered on my skin for quite some time after getting out of the shower and drying myself. It lasted probably around two hours and not nearly the much longer time claimed on the bottle. It might have lingered longer but not noticeable by me so most likely not noticeable to anyone else around me either. That&#x27;s the only think I can really find fault with since otherwise it&#x27;s now my favorite body wash from now on!</li>
    <li> The product was not bad but not really anything to rave about. Go checkout my full review on my youtube channel at Lifeintheskye.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally like heavily perfumed products, especially ones that advertise a floral scent. To be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t have picked up this bottle with a picture of a rose on the front for a smell test at the store for that reason alone. Even if I would&#x27;ve smelled it, I never would have bought it. The smell of this body wash in the bottle, and even while lathering up in the shower, is so super strong and overpowering (and to me, yuck). Since I received a free sample I decided to give it a try. After using it for a week, I&#x27;m quite happy with it and buying a bottle to keep using it on days when I&#x27;ll be sweaty/stinky (running, yard work, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shower, and throughout the rest of the day, the scent is mild but noticeable and not at all like it smells in the bottle. It&#x27;s a bit like catching a whiff of fresh laundry, though the fragrance is sweeter. If I physically rub my arm and then smell it, the scent is slightly stronger and somewhat more like the smell &amp;#34;in the bottle,&amp;#34; but I still don&#x27;t think it would bother the noses of sensitive people nearby. I can definitely smell it on me during post-workout stretching. If you&#x27;re expecting to get an all-day perfume-strength scent, I&#x27;d try something else--probably perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for a very cheap body wash you can get at a big-box store, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Caress Body Washes before, but they are not as moisturizing as Olay and Dove&#x27;s.  This one is no exception.  It does have a very strong tropical scent right out of the bottle.  However, the scent is way less subtle after you try off.  The scent (while subtle) does last over 12 hours.  If I put my nose directly on my arm, I could smell the scent (even 12 hours later).  There are 2 things that I didn&#x27;t like about this body wash ... the dark red color and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize (and is slightly drying).  This body wash is okay, but I&#x27;m sticking with my Olay and Dove body washes.</li>
    <li> The smell is initially too strong for me. Well, I think it isn&#x27;t the strength of the smell but the smell itself that I&#x27;m not overly fond of. I like it better as the day goes by and the smell wears off almost completely. You do get a hilarious scratch and sniff benefit from the time release aspect. I entertained my team at work as I sniffed my arms, rubbed them, and sniffed them again the first day I used this body wash. I was a walking, talking, scratch and sniff sticker.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and lather of this wash but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it says it does.</li>
    <li> Zulily sent me this sample with my $80 order. It smells amazing! I have sensitive skin but I havent had an allergic reaction. The sent is strong but it does stay on all day. Its a great price as well.&lt;br /&gt;Pro/ Con: a little goes a long way, it stays on my rag and takes a thorough washing to get out.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing to happen to me. I ran out of my regular soap and picked this up at Duane Reade, bc pretty much everything else was sold out. My skin has never felt so soft and I can literally smell myself all day. It doesn&#x27;t overpower or compete with my perfume. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this, but I&#x27;ve never smelled better.</li>
    <li> So I got this one day after seeing the commercial for it on Tv. Cool, I thought, after finally finding a body wash that was nicely scented and what not. I like the smell, and it is pretty strong. I did my thing in the shower, and put a little on a loofah just to lather it up. My shower kind of sucks and drains really slowly, so it looked like a murder scene in my bathtub. About 5 minutes later, after I washed out whatever the hell was in my hair, my chest started to get red. Not itchy, but very red. I got out of the shower and noticed I was breaking out in hives. Funny, because I&#x27;m not allergic to anything of my knowledge. It was then that my breathing started to go, and it physically hurt to breathe in. I had to use my emergency inhaler to solve the problem, plus some Benadryl to slow it down. I avoided an ER visit because SCREW THAT.&lt;br /&gt;I used a different soap the next day and was fine, and decided to try the Caress again today with a different loofah before I went to work. Same thing happened: bloody scene in my non-draining bathtub, hives on my chest, and my boyfriend pity-patting my back because I was whining so much.&lt;br /&gt;I dunno. Hives suck.  2 stars because it smells nice</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long but good smell as far as it lasts</li>
    <li> Love IS forever, thanks to this product. Not only does it make my skin smell good, it allows me to rub the blood of my victims all over myself. Yup. It&#x27;s a murder scene body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geezus. Caress? Is it any wonder this product is in limited supply? Have you SEEN what it looks like? So sad, because it&#x27;s really a good body wash. I just don&#x27;t want to wash blood all over myself to smell this good and feel so soft. Because ... ew. I saw that movie.</li>
    <li> Great smell! the body wash is actually red and I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first but I absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> Smells like roses, but sweeter. The scent is for someone who&#x27;s sexy, but very sweet looking at the same time.</li>
    <li> This smells so nice.  I like the way it&#x27;s described as a slight rose with berries because that description is spot on.  I tend to use body washes over soaps because of the variety that has come out.  I like Caress because they seem more pleasant to the nose, so to speak.  They lather well and rinse out nicely.  I feel soft and clean after using Caress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a new user to Caress, this is a good one to start with (most are, to be honest).  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to open this body wash because the bottle looks so nice.  It&#x27;s very sleek and looks very fancy.  The scent is very nice.  The advertisement for this wash says that there is a time release scent throughout the day.  I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed that, but it is enjoyable to use.</li>
    <li> The whole point of this product is a body wash that has the floral fragrance that it promises, that will last longer than most other body washes.&lt;br /&gt;One can hardly complain about a heavier than normal floral scent when that is exactly what the product description claims. And that is what it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star taken away for the unnecessary colorants, and a slight &#x27;plastic&#x27; smell that is lurking just under the floral and amber notes.&lt;br /&gt;Slick, sexy packaging and lush scent make this a nice fit an often forgotten demographic...the mature woman that is as sensual and lush as the product packaging.  Black fishnet over red roses make for a rather provocative label on this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;This is for the confident woman with a knowing smile, not a giggling girl. This is red dress and black stilettos.</li>
    <li> So let&#x27;s start by talking about the fragrance. I do like it, and it&#x27;s very, very strong. This would not likely be a product for anyone who has sensitive skin or reacts to strong scents. As for the scent lasting 12 hours, well I am not sure about that. Now I habitually shower at night instead of the morning, so maybe if I didn&#x27;t cover myself in sheets and blankets, it would last that long. I will say that i can still smell this fragrance some time out of the shower though. It lathers very well, and I should note that I did not have a reaction to the product at all. I do not have especially sensitive skin, but there are times when i do react, like some pools I cannot enter at all because of the chemicals in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference sake, some of my favorite body washes are Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Body Wash, Seventh Generation and Dove products... but I also like the Almond oil Jafra line for a strong fragrance on occasion, and I would put this next to the Jafra products as in something to use when you want that strong feminine scent and to relax, not with the clean feel all day as the other products offer</li>
    <li> Reminds me of some Valentine&#x27;s Day special that I loved as a high-schooler and could never find again. Kind of has a candy scent. Does what it says. The color takes some getting used to, as others have noted.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:89265635977e2d0f173a4d74fb922b8a]] My wife loves it and I like it on her but as for me, even though I tried it, it smells waaayyy too feminine.  My grandmother loved the scent of roses so it reminds me of her a bit.  There&#x27;s not much else to say except the bottle is large enough to last about two weeks depending on how much acreage you have. The scent does last quite a while so make sure that is what you want because it may clash with perfumes and other such scented acutroments.  I created this short video to let you see the color and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for women.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing,  until my entire body broke out in horrible rashes to the point where it left what looks like &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; and scaring . I&#x27;ve never ever had this problem with anything in my 29years of existence.</li>
    <li> The smell was pretty good but I didn&#x27;t find that it lasted very long. Also, the color is very DARK RED, so the whole shower is full of pink bubbles when using it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but one star off for the blood red color that gets all over my shower.</li>
    <li> First you have to get your mind right. No, that&#x27;s not grape jelly you&#x27;re pouring on your shower pouf. This is not a good joke to try on someone at 5 O&#x27;clock in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash foams up very well once you add enough water and get it started. It left my skin feeling clean and moisturized. However there is no scent of flowers that I could detect.  It smells like a combination of blackberry jam and burnt matches to me.  Fortunately it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.  You might want to try it, for the first time, when you&#x27;re going to be home alone.  Since lots of people seem to like the scent maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this works alright as a body wash. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy it for the scent.</li>
    <li> First, I love the scent of this body wash. It&#x27;s floral, but clean and not at all overwhelming. I worried that it being a &#x27;fine fragrance&#x27; would leave me smelling like I showered in a bottle of perfume, but thankfully this is not the case. It&#x27;s not as concentrated as you&#x27;d imagine, but smells beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get any sticky skin, or dry skin feeling after using. I simply felt clean and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;However, I got no &#x27;touch technology&#x27; scent after. I mean, I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all. Nor could my kids, or any co-workers that I made sniff me, (it was a weird day at the office.)&lt;br /&gt;But, don&#x27;t let the sad letdown of the no touch and smell deter you, if you like a silky body wash, that lathers well, smells amazing and is less than many pricier brands, get this. You will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;I will be picking up another bottle when I run out!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve tried different fragrance body washes by Caress over the years, this is the First one I&#x27;ve tried where the Fragrance is too strong, and over-powering. Shortly after testing it, my eyes began to tear, and I developed a skin reaction. However, this is the First time I&#x27;ve experienced this problem with any Caress product. While this may work &amp; be fine for many others, people who are super-sensitive with allergies may have a reaction. This is also the Only body wash I&#x27;ve tried with fragrance-release Pearls, and while many would be able to indulge, this one is not for me. Not recommended for anyone with sensitive skin, and those who suffer from allergies!</li>
    <li> Caress Body Wash in Love Forever scent is your basic body wash in many ways.  It lathers up nicely with the use of a shower poof and leaves behind a scent that does seem to last for most of the day without being overpowering.  Does the scent release when your skin is touched as advertised?  I couldn&#x27;t tell, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues with the body wash started when I first dispensed some onto my shower poof.  The color of the soap really threw me.  I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be a romantic shade of pinkish purple, but it honestly looks like gore from a horror movie.  Who at the Caress factory decided that was an attractive color?  Once worked into a lather, you get a slightly pink foam, which is fine.  The scent, described as &amp;#34;floriental,&amp;#34; sounds appealing but to me came across as much more fruity than floral.  In fact, it reminded me of Bubbalicious bubble gum.  After my shower, the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong or fruity and was more pleasant that I expected.  My husband said it smelled nice, so that&#x27;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The saving grace of this body wash is that it rinses away feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t seem to be excessively drying or to cause any skin discomfort for me.  I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.  I will definitely use up this bottle, but doubt I&#x27;ll buy another when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this distributer, my bottles were not put in any plastic when I received my packaged it was opened and spilled in the box.</li>
    <li> My product came in a padded envelope with the tops taped down so I had no issues with spillage.  The product is a beet red, sort like blood.  The lather is very creamy with a powery back drop.  I also use all natural soaps for showers and bathing (6-8 a bar) so I will not use this product everyday for bathing.  I did like using it for shaving though because of the rich and creamy lather.  As for the smell, in the bottle the smell is very loud.  On the person, it fades after a few hours.  I can&#x27;t say it smells like roses or anything beautiful; it smells like all the generic perfumes and bodywashes they sell at Walmart and other retail locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Other reviews said they had a bad skin reaction, which included excessive itching.  Having used a VINE shampoo that caused my hair to fall out from excessive shedding, I am now about to go take another shower and remove this product from my body.</li>
    <li> Smell awsome doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I love using a body wash, they are scented, and they lather up very well.  This one is no exception.  This says it is perfumed, it is, but it fades quickly.  I find that if you put perfume on after you aren&#x27;t going to be bothered by competing scents later.  The color of this is red.  So be warmed ahead of time.  I think it is a fun color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lathers up well and has a nice scent.  I think these are far better priced than say Bath and Body Works.  A good price, great lather, and a refreshing clean feeling what more could you ask for ?</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It smells so good. It&#x27;s now my favorite caress product. Wish it came in a bigger bottle. The smell stays quite a long time. Very addictive...</li>
    <li> Love it, what else could I say. Dreamy smell and your skin feels real soft after.</li>
    <li> It is ok.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it smelled like roses much at all.  If you want that I&#x27;d spend extra and go for Anna Sui body wash and shampoo.  I really don&#x27;t like this smell much and lucky for me the touch activated aspect didn&#x27;t work for me.  I love the smell of roses so when I want to smell like one all day I&#x27;ll use Anna Sui.  The price here right now is ridiculous so if you must try it I wouldn&#x27;t get it here at the current price.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome. Left my skin super soft and smell lasted longer than any bodu wasj I have ever used. Will certainly buy more.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers great.  A fine high quality body wash.  Not to harsh.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife,she likes to have a variety of soaps (fragrances) in the shower. This was a good addition. I tried it, so I could compare it to my stand by Dove.  To my surprise, I did like the effects of the soap, though not the fragrance, not on me anyway. Have a nice day.  Update, my wife just finished the bottle of soap and has sent me to find more..  that should give some insight...</li>
