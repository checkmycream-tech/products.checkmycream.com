<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not happy w/this item, it takes too long to dry my nails w/the expensive gel polish. Wish I could sell it back to you!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom ordered this for me as a Christmas present along with the Gelish Basix Kit and WOW am I pleased!!! I am not one to spend $70 at the salon on a gel manicure so I though I would give this a try. The lamp was bigger than I expected and I love it cuz I can fit my whole hand in there.  The lamp cured the Gelish products without any problems.  I love the timer function and hope this lamp lasts a long time.  But, if it only lasts a year, I would say it is totally worth it as other lamps go for as much as $300.  I am willing to take a chance on this one for around $30 and hopefully, I will not have any disappointments!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and how fast I recived it!!</li>
    <li> This light is easy to use and works like a charm. Ive had it for about 3 months and cant imagine painting my nails with out it.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken, the LED indicator light on the back wouldn&#x27;t turn on no matter how many outlets we tried.  The fuse was fine so that was not my problem, the bulbs brand new.  Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Use it often. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly. I used with Shellac and had a great 2 week manicure!!!</li>
    <li> Everything works really good! My clients love walking out with dry nails now! Well worth adding this to my nail services!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is the machine or the gel polishes I used with it, but none of them have lasted for more than a day or two, and I stopped using this machine. Waste of money for me, but not sure if it is the fault of the machine, or the gel polishes I used.</li>
    <li> I purchased the UV Nail Lamp for my personal use at home.   This lamp was reasonably priced and it save me money by not having to get my nails done in a salon.  I&#x27;m not sure that the timer works. It doesn&#x27;t go off when the alloted time runs out. No problem, it can be manually turned off.</li>
    <li> I liked this when I first got it, but within two or three uses, it stopped working.  It would turn the lamps on only if you held in the button, and would turn it off as soon as you let it go.  I&#x27;m going to trash it and order a better one, so I can do both hands at the same time, rather than one hand on the button and one hand under the UV lamps.  Amazon came through, as usual, offering to refund my money.  It is important to me that the gel polish works, as I am trying to let my nails grow out, and the gel has really helped.  I ordered another lamp, paying about twice as much, but I think it will work better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this UV lamp on August 19 and received it August 23, well packaged with no damage. I&#x27;ve used it once.  This Amazon listing does not name the brand name or size of the unit.  My package is labled as Rapidcure by PNI USA 36-Watt Tunnel Lamp. My lamp has the light control buttons on top of the unit, not as pictured in the listing, although the ASIN number matches the product details.  There was no manual in the packaging.  I discovered that the lamp setting 1 is a two minute timer. I set the right-side button on 1 and then pushed the other button to start the lamps.  I haven&#x27;t timed the other settings, one of which I think is just \\&quot;on\\&quot; with no timer (has a little infinity symbol).  I really appreciate the reflective interior with the lamps on top and sides of the \\&quot;tunnel\\&quot;.  I was able to do all five digits instead of having to cure my thumbs separately from fingers. The outside dimensions are approx. 9.5\\&quot; x 9\\&quot; x 4\\&quot;.  The opening for your hand is approx 6\\&quot; wide by 2\\&quot; high. There is a bit more than 5.5\\&quot; between the two side lamps. I used this lamp to cure Gelish Soak off Polish. I used their recommendations for 2 minute cures of each paint layer. Great results!  I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for six weeks.  Then in the middle of doing nails it just died.  It will not come back on.  In the six weeks it was only used about 7 times.  Even for the low price it is not a good deal.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this lamp and of course placed the bulbs in it imm. It did not turn on at all. I triple checked the directions, placement of bulbs and also tried different outlits in my house. Still no luck. This is my first return to Amazon in all my many yrs of purchasing from the site. Very bummed:(:( Buying another brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great lamp. It works great for gel nail polish.  I shopped around and could not find anything else in this price range.  I don&#x27;t see any reason to waste money on larger unit if you are doing your own nails because it is easier to complete one hand then the other so you don&#x27;t have any reason to put both hands in unit at same time.  Would recommend:) this for anyone wanting to save money and do your own gel manicures.</li>
    <li> Did anyone recieve random beads with this? I opened the box and tucked inside of the light were 4 bags that contain 50 beads each.... the beads all have different disigns on them but they are huge and can&#x27;t have anything to do with nails... nowhere on the box or anything are these beads mentioned... very strange!</li>
    <li> I have already completed 3 gel manicures using this lamp, why buy the expensive CND lamp when for less money you get the same wattage for curing nails.  Whatever time you do for CND you will do with this one also...basecoat through topcoat.  With the 3 polishes...myself, my niece and her friend I&#x27;ve already got my money&#x27;s worth by not having to pay at the Nail Salon.</li>
    <li> My only issue with this product is that it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions on how to install the bulbs, but it was nothing too hard to figure out. But instructions on the different settings &amp; just basic directions would be helpful. This lamp seems to be able to do the job with the Gelish Soak Off Nails system. Well worth the price and  it pays for itself compared to one trip to a nail salon.</li>
    <li> 01/15/2013 - UPDATE - I&#x27;m still using this light and do my nails regularly every 10 - 14 days and I have not babied it--I keep it in a tote bag upside down and sideways with all my other nail stuff.  Still works great with the exception of the timer button...that has stopped working so I have to use a clock to keep track of 2 minutes.  No big deal. Think of how much money I&#x27;ve saved by not going to the salon.  YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/2/2011&lt;br /&gt;Used six times now over about two months. Perfect for gelish nails!  Very big and roomy for my hand, including thumbs (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and have large hands for a woman). The product image showing today is not what I received. The image now appears to have two vents or something on the top of the light casing near the back.  The one that arrived has no vents and just a black button for on/off and a blue timer button. However, I don&#x27;t have problems with it getting too hot.  Everything seems very sturdy.  The bulbs go in with a solid click. I wonder if fans would just be more parts to worry about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to operate but no directions included for timer (just bulb inserting). The timer switch works by setting the black power toggle forward and pressing the blue button to turn the light on...it goes off in about 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve transported it with me a few times for weekends away (R&amp;R with pedi/mani) and it travels fine wrapped in a towel in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could have a longer cord (is apx 6&#x27;), I often find a comfortable spot in the sun to do my nails (need bright light) so I have to get out an extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with your new sassy nails! I love DIY to save $$ (sorry nail pros)!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works amazing!  Great product</li>
    <li> this nail dryer gives my nails at home.  I like the 120 second timer.  It dries/cures my nails in 4 minutes so I don&#x27;t have to wait a long time or mess them up while drying. It was one of the least expensive I found too.  The only things I don&#x27;t like about it is one of the bulbs comes loose periodically and it has no instruction book.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this product,I do realize it is inexpensive so therefor I don&#x27;t expect top quality but the light WONT EVEN TURN ON. It doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL I am pissed off. I want my money back!</li>
    <li> It does not do what other tools in this category do.  I have had my nails done professionally and they dry quickly under the UV light.  I have to stay under this light for each hand 30 minutes for just 1 coat of polish and the nails still feel sticky.  I will go and buy some more lights elsewhere and maybe they will fit into the machine and do the job right.</li>
    <li> When i receive my uv lamp i was so excited to use it, but as i bought in NY and i leave in SP , it takes me some days to test it, in the beginning was amazing but when  i was using for the second time, the timer broke down, I am so sad because as i am from Brasil I dont know what to do !!!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and fair priced.  I ordered this from a beauty nail supply store and tried to order spare bulbs for later which were out of stock. So, I decided to just put 2 bulbs in my unit and save the other two for later. This is working just fine for me and saving money at the same time. It is bigger than I had thought it would be, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there really. A good product.</li>
    <li> I got this in January and it worked great for 5 months then suddenly, halfway through doing my nails, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. I tried replacing the bulbs, I tried taking it apart looking for a fuse to fix and couldn&#x27;t find anything. I messaged the seller about common problems or where to repair it and never got a response. I had to buy another one from someone else. The new one has a place to access and change the fuse on the back- in case it shorts out. I loved it while it worked but it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid to have it just die after several months of only light in home use...</li>
    <li> I just used this light for the first time last night and was happy with the ease of use and the price. What I was not happy with was the fact is was missing the manual and the \\&quot;gift\\&quot; file. The unit is pretty self explanatory but would have been nice to have everything I was supposed to get in the package.</li>
    <li> I used this with my mom and after I did the color coat I noticed that it didnt stay lit for the complete two minutes only for one minute.. I am not sure if it was me not knowing exactly what to do(although it seems pretty self explanatory). Once I turned it off and back on it didnt do that again. So I guess I will see what happens when I do her toes tomorrow. On a good note it did great with the Shellac nail products from CND.</li>
    <li> Ordered this light; got it days BEFORE it was actually due....has worked amazingly well, no problems with installing the bulbs.  2 minute timer works light it should.  Had some confusion with getting the lights to come on @ first; but then realized it was operator error....helps if you switch it to on.  :D  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The lamp I received did not work. The power light activated, but not the curing lights. Amazon was kind enough to accept a return with no questions, but I would not trust this manufacturer again.</li>
    <li> This UV nail light is GREAT!!  I have purchased other name brnds over the years and this \\&quot;generic\\&quot; UV light works EXACTLY THE SAME as the name brand lights which retail between $150 - $200.  This light has the exact same wattage and uses the same replacement bulbs and the name brands!  INCREDIBLE SAVINGS &amp; FANTASTIC VALUE!!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking cheap would be fine, but even though it says it is 36 watts, I have sat with my nails under this for 15-20 minutes and they still will not cure.  I did not even try it til March when it was out of return time limits or it would go back. I just bought a cnd dryer and hopefully that will work.  so my money went down the drain.</li>
    <li> The timer never really worked correctly on this item but I was okay with that.  I was really pleased with the performance for the 8 times that I was able to use it (had it for two months)before all the lights stopped working at the same time.  The unit still turns on, indicated by the light on the \\&quot;timer,\\&quot; but the UV lights will not turn on.  :(  Asking for a refund, we&#x27;ll see.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just opened this package today after getting it in Nov. One of the bulbs does not work already. I don&#x27;t want to return the whole lamp for one bulb but Amazon does not give you the option to ask for the defective part, only to return the whole thing. I really don&#x27;t think I should have to pay for a new bulb either. Annoyed.....</li>
    <li> The lamp arrived quickly from seller. It cures the Gellish, Shellac, and Gelac nail polish gel in several minutes. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> 1st one came to me defective but after getting in contact with seller they sent me another one at no extra charge.&lt;br /&gt;Ok nail dryer. Can&#x27;t really complain about it. It gets the job done and has a built in 2-minute timer where it shuts off after the 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> This UV light is great! I use Gelish product and get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Love being able to adjust the curing time</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble that was a plus but not real good when it comes to drying.  After that it is big and bulky.</li>
    <li> If you are trying do it yourself gel nails this UV lamp is perfect. Works great, not to big not to small and great price to try it yourself.</li>
    <li> After getting a couple of gel manis in nail salons, I decided to invest the money on the equipment and do them at home.  Boy, am I glad I did so.  So easy!  This lamp arrived with four bulbs packed along in the box, two of them which I carelessly dropped immediately upon opening the package, so be careful!  The lamp works well, but I wish it came with instructions.  It&#x27;s supposed to have two timers, but I haven&#x27;t figured out how to.  I have managed to operate the two-minute timer, but not the other one.  All in all, the lamp feels heavy and very delicate, so I&#x27;ll be extra careful handling it, and always store it back in its padded box.</li>
    <li> Lamp works great with my Gelish nail system and cured my polish perfectly. It has an automatic shut off timer with two options that turns the lamp off after two or three minutes. Timer was accurate. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of five is because in my opinion it would be worthy of 5 stars if it also offered a 1 minute timer option and was a little bit smaller. This was much bigger than I expected and as of this date no measurements are given in the item description. It is approximately 10\\&quot;d X 8\\&quot;w X 4\\&quot;h. But overall a quality unit.</li>
    <li> Hi! I just got this lamp and it has no instruction or number to call for it. I try to use it for my Shellac manicure, but it didn&#x27;t work. I fallowed all instructions, thin layers, 10 seconds for base, 2 minutes for other coats, alcohol in the end... but it didn&#x27;t dry... now i&#x27;m wondering if this is because I do something wrong with my lamp or the lamp does not work for Shellac. Sad, but I&#x27;m thinking to return it...</li>
    <li> I got this light because I also got a starter kit for Gelish gel polish. I chose this one because it was the less expensive one ($39.99) and had decent reviews. Some reviews said it was big but I didn&#x27;t realize just how big. I guess it&#x27;s good because you can fit your whole hand or foot in it. The lightbulbs were packaged separately in the box and were not broken as some reviewers said. I screwed them right in and it was ready to use. A nice feature on this is the timer. You have to cure the polish for at least 2 minutes and this has a 2 and 3 minute timer.   Overall this is a good product. A little bit on the large side, but works so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Really goo product.  It even works well with the newer gel polishes that don&#x27;t have to have an Ultra violet light like Revlon and Sally Hansen.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Heavy duty unit.  Gel polish actually stays on much longer when dried with this unit then when they are done at the nail spa.</li>
    <li> What a great light. It&#x27;s simple, works well, and was super cheap! I was able to use my Gelish nail polish with this and it turned out awesome. This is going to save me a lot of money!! BUY THIS LIGHT if you&#x27;re thinking about it! All I did was have clean nails, used a UV Base and cured it for about a minute, painted the color, cured for two minutes, added a top coat, cured for two minutes, and then wiped off the tacky top with 91% alcohol. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item almost 3 years ago and still functions as it did the first day I purchased. I own it to use personally and have only actually used it 10 times but works great and bulbs have not yet burned out and work great for at home shellec manicures! I use the &amp;#34;Gelish&amp;#34; line from Sallys.</li>
    <li> the unit seems much smaller the I expected it, or as you see it in the salon. My nails are in very good condition, I followed all steps necessary to apply the gelish nail polish, but every time for the first 3 seconds I feel this burning sensation as soon as i put my nails in the uv lamp timer.  I also find the timing buttons not to be working to good. But I guess it just takes some getting used to.  Next time I probably would order a slightly more expensive unit.  Anyone having any feedback about the burning and also it seems way to long , even with a thin layer of foundation gelish , the 2 min max. time to dry seems not enough.   I did contact the seller, who was very willing to issue a refund as the unit indeed seemed to have been not functioning 100% . The correspondance was quick and efficient.   Overall just an investment (together with learning and willing to experiment on how to apply the gel nails yourself) that I would adivse for you to make sure you have the time for.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to do gelish manicures at home.  I got thru 1 hand, then smoke started coming up thru the vents in the back.  When I went to start the other hand, it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.  I waited 30 min then an hour to see if maybe it just overheated, but no, it still won&#x27;t work.  I am very disappointed and now only have 1 hand of my gel manicure done!</li>
    <li> Does a great job with my gelish nail set! Timer has 90 and 120 second options, as well as an \\&quot;on\\&quot; option that stays on til you shut it off!</li>
    <li> WORTH EVERY PENNY WORKS GREAT ,HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I choose this lamp because it was the most inexpensive and I wanted to see how easy gel nail polish was to use before I invested a lot in a lamp.     I can fit 2 hands in at a time or 2 feet one on top of the other. (carefully that is!)   The only problem is that after using it 5 times the timer switch broke. It still works, only now it won&#x27;t automatically shut off after 2 minutes. which is annoying because I have to use a timer on my phone. other than that it works great for the price!  But it still beats $50 a pop at the nail salon!  I didn&#x27;t contact the seller about returning it, because it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.   Also in case you were wondering I use harmony gleish products. and I am a DIY convert!</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for??  This UV lamp came to me broken, the lights didn&#x27;t work and I even tried different outlets! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  I visited many websites and products and many stated to not get anything less than 36 watts.  This one is strong (it burns a bit when you first put your hand under) but it works!  I just hope these lamps don&#x27;t cause cancer. I&#x27;ll have to research that more. In the mean time, I try to limit exposure just in case.</li>
    <li> This lamp is the perfect lamp! The timer on this lamp is an added plus! Bummer was there were no instructions inside the package.  Large size will definitely allow for pedicures!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my uv dryer! I read the reviews, mostly good and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve used it three times so far, and it works great! I have small hands and the opening is big enough for me to dry both hands at same time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lamp for just over a year. I thought at first that my bulbs were going out because I wasn&#x27;t getting a proper cure. Then I timed it once and it wasn&#x27;t staying on as long as it was programed to (120 seconds) and then it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. After replacing the bulbs and finding I have the same issue, I&#x27;m really annoyed. I can get the light to come on sometimes by wiggling the cord at the back of the lamp... but I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t electrically safe to do long-term. It should be added that I only use this lamp for myself... so in a year it has only been used about 40 times. I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth not paying $30-40 at the salon each time... but I&#x27;m still disappointed this isn&#x27;t more of a permanent purchase. I&#x27;m considering buying the CND lamp next time, from a reputable company (like a local beauty supply store) where I can more easily return things. ** this is not a negative review of the seller, just the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item late in November and it worked great until the end of January.  It seems that the timer has broken.  The light will go on but it goes off again in about 30 seconds.  I have only used this for myself so in two months it has only been used about 5 - 6 times.  I sure expected this to last a lot longer than this!!  I would not recommend this product, spend a little more and get a better unit.</li>
    <li> Although this product is offered at a competetive price and is boxed with the necessary bulbs to cure any gel manicure, the instructions are poorly written and are obviously translated electronically from another language.  I struggled to create meaning from the written warnings and user guide only to never actually be able to make the product operational even though I replaced and rotated the position of all 4 of the bulbs, flipped every switch and pushed every button tirelessly.  The instructions offer no troubleshooting suggestions but rather issue multiple warnings such as \\&quot;The apparatus is not ready for the physically weak, slow response, etc....\\&quot;  I give up, back it goes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or anticipation on this one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! I was so excited to get this lamp until I opened the box and it looked like it had been used. As soon as I took the bubble wrap off pieces started falling out. Come to find out the fuse is broken and the shiny part blocker is broken. Very disapointed! It&#x27;s getting RETURNED!!!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to do my nails as soon as I got this and when I plugged it in it didn&#x27;t work at all. bummer.</li>
    <li> I was excited to do my very first shellac manicure last night at home. I bought all the necessary items here on Amazon.com (protein bond, base coat, top coat, colors and this lamp)and it was a compelte success! I love doing my nails and I&#x27;m already excited to do them the next time. This lamp gets the job done. I think the timer goes off 7-10 seconds too early so I just don&#x27;t use the timer option, I use the timer on my phone instead just to be safe.</li>
    <li> We bought this lamp, hoping to be able to do our own gel nails at home with the Shellac line. It took a little bit to get the system down, but now it works great. You need to cure the base coat for 10 seconds, the color and top coats for 2 minutes. Then rub the nails with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball to get the sticky film off. Be careful not to get the products on your skin, as it will cause it to all peel off. It lasts 2-3 weeks, depending on how quickly your nails grow!</li>
    <li> I used gelish products with this lamp and it&#x27;s perfect.  They last around 14 days.  It takes just a little time and I can do them when I want rather than have to make an appointment and pay way more than necessary.  I have had this for about a year now and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curing lamp almost 2 YEARS ago.  It has not disappointed! I was a little hesitant when I initially bought it due to some negative reviews about the timer and bulbs.  I must say for me however, that the timer still works perfectly and I have yet to replace the bulbs!  I use it for curing shellac, and I&#x27;m doing nails at least once a week, so it is most certainly getting used!  Cute, compact, sturdy, and gets the job done. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! This product stopped working after very minimal use. I read this on the other reviews and chose to ignore it. Do not make the same mistake. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an acrylic nail wearer and silk wrap nail wearer for about 13 years or more.  I took them off because I was tired of the upkeep.  When I took them off, my nails were so thin, brittle, weak, and in such awful condition that I was determined not to put artificial nails on again!  I loved my nails short and after a solid year my nails were finally not paper thin.  Once I got them in good condition, I wanted to paint them but as with any natural nail - the polish would chip or peel after a day or so and then my nails looked awful!  I used to manage a salon and knew about gels, but they were always used on artificial nails.  Then I started hearing about gel nail polish and began to look into the systems.  The lamps were SO expensive, even when purchasing them through a beauty supply store at cost.  I decided to have mine done to see if they really did last weeks as professed.  They did!  They were awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately went to Amazon to look for gel uv lamps.  USpicy came up.  I read all of the reviews and 98% were excellent.  The price was outstanding ($34.99 is incredible for this machine!)!  I decided to buy the USpicy 36W Nail UV Lamp.  BEST PURCHASE!!!!!  It takes about 2 minutes to cure each coat.  The lamp is fantastic!  Easy to set up!  Durable!  Perfect!  I&#x27;ve had it for well over a month and done my nails twice!  The gel absolutely lasts 2-3 weeks without peeling, chipping, or dulling!  My nails look wet-shiny all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use alcohol on your nails before beginning (don&#x27;t spend money on gel \\&quot;primers\\&quot; - Rubbing alcohol does the exact same thing!), and use alcohol on a cotton ball after you cure the top coat.  It will be sticky, and you&#x27;ll be afraid that you&#x27;ll ruin the nail, YOU WON&#x27;T.  Wet the cotton ball with alcohol and rub each nail after you cure the top coat.  Your nails will be gorgeous, shiny, and NOT sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed my girlfriend and she bought one as we sat there talking!  She LOVES hers too!!!!  Best purchase if you like your nails to be painted but hate the chipping and peeling!!!  Best purchase if you like your nails to be painted but hate the chipping and peeling!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product; it works as indicated.  I&#x27;m looking foward to the money I&#x27;ll save using this rather than paying for gel manicures at the salon.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as it should - and not just for the gel polishes.  I used it to give myself a full set of artificial gel nails.  Cured them perfectly!  Meets and exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> My lamp arrived in no time at all, and unlike other reviews, all my bulbs were working, and my timer has been just fine so far (through 3 applications).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Gelish products, I&#x27;ve found that base coat (1 min), color (2 mins), top coat (2 mins) has worked the best for creating a great manicure that lasts 2-3 weeks.  This light is particularly handy because its cord is a decent length so I can sit at the kitchen counter and use an outlet below on the wall.  Also, the bottom portion of the light slides in and out, so you can place your hand on the tray, and slide it in.  This helps blindly sticking your hand in and possibly smudging your polish before it begins to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision to purchase supplies to do gel manicures at home.  The only drawbacks are that manicures take twice as long since you can only paint/cure one hand at a time (but your nails are dry instantly when you&#x27;re finished), and this particular light doesn&#x27;t have a 1-minute timer setting, so I just have to watch the clock when I do my base coat.</li>
    <li> I so happened to run into this item while looking at other UV lights for shellac nails. I found this at a great price with a few extra items including gloves and purchased it! I love it and so do my clients!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost 4 years now.  Works great and I do my nails about every 2-3 weeks.  Only minus was the timer button broke after a couple uses but I just use the constant on button. Even with that &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; this investment is well worth it.  How much do you pay for the salon to wreck your nails doing gel? $50? more perhaps.  Well I don&#x27;t have to scuff my nails and with what I paid for this, it was more than worth it even if I had to buy a new one every year. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the best decision I&#x27;ve made for my nails! Going to the nail salon is nice. But for me to go every 2 weeks and spend over $80 is a bit much. This is a decent priced UV lamp and the polishes aren&#x27;t that expensive. For the long run, all this seems very worth it. Instead of falling asleep while your nails are getting done, you can do your own nails at home watching the TV shows that you need to catch up on!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my UV Dryer so I could try out my gelish nail system. I opened the dryer (it was well packaged) and installed the four bulbs. As I went to plug it in, i realized it would not fit into a standard US 120 socket. I am not sure if it was a shipping error or not, but I returned it. I never got to see if it worked properly or not.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! The timer switch is broken. It flicks off and on, therefore the bulbs won&#x27;t turn on. Piece of junk!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time, and was easy to assemble. Only difficulty I had at first was learning how to work the timer. Other than that it was a breeze. Machine only large enough for one hand at a time.</li>
    <li> This product works as it is advertised. My husband bought it for me cause I hate the nail salon. Works well saves me money and time</li>
    <li> Just got my UV lamp in the other night and I opened it immediately. No damage in the shipping, boxed and wrapped nicely. I used it to do my own Gelish gel nail polish manicure at home. It worked perfectly. It has a timer with a switch 120 seconds or 180 seconds. That makes it easy because for Gelish the top coat and dark polish colors need two minute cure times, so that was really convenient. I paid about $30 for this lamp and now I can do my own gel nails at home. It would normally cost $30 per visit to get it done at the salon. Now I have perfect salon quality gel nails and I don&#x27;t have to make appointments. I love my nails, and now I love this lamp.</li>
    <li> So I do not have much experience with uv lamps but as far as this  product goes it does exactly what it is I bought it for, cure gel nail polish. Now my only experience in the salon with gels was using harmony&#x27;s gelish so when I decided to do them myself that&#x27;s what I bought, maybe my results are a little better than others because of the products I use? I don&#x27;t know but I am completely satisfied. The only reason why I did not give 5 stars is because of the timer. This lamps options are 2 or 3 min, but gelish&#x27;s foundation is only cured for 60 seconds so I have to use the timer app on my phone.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughters birthday her and her daughter loved it and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> this item has everything my dauther needs to do his nails and every one she like, comfortable and very handy</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  Very good quality and easy to put together and utilize.  Look forward to reducing my out of pocket expense.</li>
    <li> I used it twice and each time the polish was chipping the very next day.  I get better results with just a regular top coat.  I was really disappointed because I was looking forward with this investment paying off with less visits to the salon, less time doing my nails and savings on polish.  I was told that my nails would not chip for two weeks and this is the reason that I purchased the lamp in the first place.  We are sending it back</li>
    <li> This is a really good light for the price I paid. It came delivered in excellent condition. I&#x27;m very happy with this light.</li>
    <li> I got this for at-home shellac manicures (trying to avoid paying at a salon 2x a month) but this dryer never properly cured the polish.  The quality was terrible, the bulbs frequently came loose (so I was constantly pushing them firmly back in the socket).  The bulbs supplied were also not very strong, I had to cure each hand for 10 minutes apiece (they never got warm / hot).  I used the name-brand shellac polishes, as well as bonding agent (by OPI) and wiped my nails with alcohol after each manicure. Despite all this, the polish chipped and peeled off within just a few days.  I complained to Shellac and they confirmed that polish peeling off was due to a poor UV nail dryer. I also asked at my nail salon and they confirmed that low quality UV dryers  (such as this one) will never properly cure the manicure.&lt;br /&gt;  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  I was trying to save a few bucks and get an off brand, but there&#x27;s no customer support.  I ended up purchasing a name-brand shellac dryer which worked much better!</li>
    <li> This is the second of these units that I have purchased. They work great. Just like the expensive salon units. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> The item was received very fast.  The product was exactly as advertised.  It is actually nicer than the one that was used in the nail salon I \\&quot;used to go to\\&quot;. The lamp is much stronger than the ones included in sets, it is professional.</li>
    <li> USpicy® MACARON USND-3603 Professional UV Acrylic Gel &amp; Shellac Curing Nail Dryer / Lamp / Light (White, 36W), Upgraded with Sliding Tray + SPA Equipment Is Very Good</li>
    <li> Nice kit, however the motored burned out after using it for less than 8 months. Only used it once every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> great service! the product is exactly what I wanted: working fine and looking good! using it right now! :)  :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved it. She sent me pictures of her nails and they looked pretty and shiny.</li>
    <li> I tried it with some gel polish I bought at the drug store...my manicure lasted no longer than just polishing.</li>
    <li> I have this for doing my own gel nails....  So far, it works great!  Very light and portable.  Fits one hand at a time...</li>
    <li> Received product, however one bulb socket consistently does not work. Bulb hangs down and does not work. Everything else is in working order. Guess it will just be a 3 bulb machine, and will have to spend more time curing polish</li>
    <li> I love it cures awesome</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She used it wright away and was very pleased with the results. I have bought her some other gel and shellac from you for her birthday that is on Feb. 2. I know she will be happy for more colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years back and it is still working. It works great for shellac polish. It has a 60 and 120 second setting, very easy to use and sturdy. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This UV lamp was reasonably priced, easy to assemble and came as advertised. I have only ever used shellac brand nail polish with it and have not had any problems. My nails looked great! I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> My daughter sent me the link and I got it for her! This was a great price for a great lamp. Now she&#x27;s back to doing nails and very happy with this lamp!</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to do Gelish manicures at home.  Worked perfectly.  I cured my nails for 2 minutes with the base coat and 3 minutes with the color and top coat, just in case.  Came out perfect!  Nice sleek design too, not that it would matter, but still it&#x27;s nice to look at. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I started getting gel manicures about 6 months ago.  I really liked the results, but just couldn&#x27;t justify the $35 (plus $5 tip) that went with my bi-weekly appointments to get them redone.  Granted, the manicure actually lasted the entire two weeks and it was really nice to have my hands look nice through all my activities (gardening has a unique way of ruining a manicure).  Well, I&#x27;m a smart girl and did some research to figure out if I could do this on my own.  Amazon had the exact products my manicurist was using (including this lamp).  In the end, it cost me around $150 to get the lamp and the ph bond and top and bottom coating, the white for the tips and a color or two, but I figure it will pay for itself in less than 4 manicures if I can do this myself.  GOOD NEWS!  It&#x27;s not very difficult.  I purchased the \\&quot;Gellish\\&quot; line of gel stuff and this lamp.  For the money, this is a fantastic lamp at a great price.  Mine arrived with all working bulbs (I had heard others hadn&#x27;t had this luck) AND the timer works beautifully (so far).  I&#x27;ve given myself a regular full-color polish job, and then two days later decided to do the French tips myself.  It worked wonderfully!  The gels do not gel until cured under the lamp, so can easily be manipulated. They are also, self-leveling, so the mess I made adding the white and cleaning the excess was covered up after the next coat of clear.  I have been using regular acetone nail polish remover to soak off the gels and I don&#x27;t think that is right (in other words, it took too long and didn&#x27;t work all that well).  I think I need to get straight acetone.  I will do the research and find out. The bottom line is that this lamp cures the \\&quot;Gellish\\&quot; gels just fine. My nails look beautiful today.  (I will caution you about getting it on your fingers.  The stuff cures to them just fine and I have needed to use my nippers to get it off.  Clean any excess before curing.  I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;...) So, take your time and use good lighting.  You DIYers will enjoy the savings.</li>
    <li> Got the lamp and used it for a shellac manicure. Worked great! The only problem is that my lamp didn&#x27;t have a manual with it, so I don&#x27;t know how to set the timer properly.</li>
    <li> I am a nail tech and was looking for a set to get for shellac manis at work. I have had this for over a year and have 0 complaints !!! works great and has held up beautiful. and for that price you cant beat it !!</li>
    <li> It came broken.  I had to return it.  It was looked very cheap.  I would not recommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> I see they use these same ones in the salon! much cheaper than paying for gel nails at the salon as long as you know what you are doing.  I am not very good so my nails look a little goupy sometimes but if you are good at doing your nails this is a great tool so you can do gel nails at home!</li>
    <li> Works great! I like that you can remove the bulbs to replace them when they eventually go bad. Thumbs up</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used this for over a year without a problem.  I never have to use extra time or anything!  It has saved me so much money!  I am going to get a LED one once this one quits working just because you don&#x27;t have to cure it for as long.  But this is a great and fairly inexpensive product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years. Still works great and for an incredible price!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for. Set up is very easy and it does the job well. I love this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting solar nails put on since I was 13. Recently due to damage I switched to shellac. Of course I got tired of paying the $55 every two weeks for my nails and toes so I bought this! I&#x27;ve never done my own nails but it seems to cure the polish very well and stays for a long time. It gets a little hot, but other than that there are no other complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail dryer two years ago and it has worked perfectly for me since. They added the packaging and logo on the dryer since I bought it because mine came in a plain box and doesn&#x27;t have a pink logo on it, but it is the exact same nail dryer. I have acrylics done on my nails so I only use this to do the at home gel kits on my toes. I just was sick of my toenail polish coming off after wearing shoes once or in the shower so I bought this. The polish lasts 2-3 weeks and the dryer is super easy to use.</li>
    <li> OMG I AM SO LOVING MY NEW UV LAMP IT DRIES MY NAILS REALLY FAST AND I CAN CHANGE MY NAILS MORE OFTEN.</li>
    <li> I ordered this UV lamp when I ordered my Harmony Gelish starter kit.  I read all the reviews available, some good, some not so good.  I love this lamp.  It worked right out of the box after installing the 4 lightbulbs that came with it.  The timer is wonderful.  You can fit either one hand or one foot in at a time which is perfect for me since I only do my nails and my mom&#x27;s.  So far I have used this lamp 4 times with no problems.  It is inexpensive if you compare it to others out there and it works just great with the Harmony Gelish products.  I could not see spending hundreds of dollars on and LED lamp when this one works.</li>
    <li> I love this light. Its been over a year and it still works great and I do my nails once a week. I also love that if the light does ever go out, I can just slide the old light out and put the new one in.</li>
    <li> This machine is fantastic.  I love to do my nails, but can not afford to go to the salon on a regular basis, but this machine allows me to do them and my nails remain looking nice anywhere from 5-7 days.  I feel they would last longer, but I wash my hands a lot.</li>
    <li> This USPICY 36 WATT UV Lamp works GREAT with REGULAR nail polish.  Just make sure you use ONE coat of \\&quot;Sally Hansen CLEAR Hard as Wraps\\&quot; OVER your completed nail enamel FOR SMOOTHNESS,  AND TOP OFF WITH ONE COAT OF HIGH GLOSS FAST DRY \\&quot;Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat\\&quot; or a similar product, all available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the Shellac polishes and they were very expensive, sticky to work with, and had a limited selection of shades.  I later decided to use my favorite REGULAR nail polishes, topping off with \\&quot;Clear Hard as Wraps\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Dry Fast Top Coat\\&quot;.  I get the GLOSSY MIRROR SHINE and chip-resistant manicure I&#x27;ve always loved.  Now my home manicures normally last ABOUT 2 WEEKS without having to redo my entire nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS 36 WATT UV LAMP !!!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter as a Christmas gift.  She has only used it 6 times and now it will not work.  There timer light comes on but the lights do not turn on.  I bought a replacement bulb to see if it was the bulbs and the new one wouldn&#x27;t work either.  There is a fuse at the back of the machine but it is not blown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great - when it works.</li>
    <li> Beware! I purchased this UV lamp in March, I have only gotten around to open up and use this UV lamp today. The lamp is not turning on. Since my return time has expired, I just wasted money this useless product. This is robbery! I haven&#x27;t even gotten a chaance to try it out Once. The lamp will just not turn on. After reading the other reviews on this product, IT IS TRUE THIS PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE, IT WILL NOT TURN ON! Please Help if you had this problem resolved.</li>
    <li> It does what it is meant to do. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I do find it a bit bulky but I don&#x27;t know if there even are smaller versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first set it up one light flashed on and off... my husband switched them around and it is perfect now. I would say that was my fault.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, but each time it has worked great. I also ordered the protective gloves.</li>
    <li> Works well and I transport it around all the time.  Can put two hands in there.  I use with the Gelish nail system.</li>
    <li> i bought this so i could do a gelish manicure at home. works great and dried/cured my nails properly. it came in a product box with manual (instructions and safety info)</li>
    <li> I have only used this five time but so far this is really nice and works great! I do recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using my USpicy machine for 2 years now, every two weeks for my Mom and I.  We LOVE it!  It is inexpensive but gives salon manicure results for all the different uv gel nail polishes that we have tried!  I just got a second one so we each have one at our own homes.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how easy this machine is to use.  I have the same bulbs in my first one since I got it and it&#x27;s still going strong.  You literally make your money back after the second use!  Most people are amazed that I can get such quality results at home - and I have no background in manicures.  The polish results last about 2 weeks but only because the nail grows out from the cuticle.  One of the best investments that I have made, would highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works like a dream! I still can&#x27;t believe I can take my hand out after the final coat, wipe off the sticky residue and have COMPLETELY dried nails! Even if I only get a few months&#x27; usage out of it, it is well worth the cost to do your own gel nails at home. And the multi-setting timer is awesome - no guessing or having to watch the clock. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> not a problem at all with mine. Use it almost weekly for my gel nails. Great price for this product.</li>
    <li> Excited to use my lamp for the first time. It worked perfectly. Well worth the price. This product was recommended to me and I too will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Have had this for over two years and still works just fine.  Price was great when compared to comparable products.  You can only do one hand at a time.</li>
    <li> I love this UV light. It works well with the Shellac. It has three different timer settings and it came with UV protectant gloves and nail file. I thought that was pretty cool.</li>
    <li> Works as it should and is salon quality. Delivery and service were great as expected.&lt;br /&gt;(This Amazon word count requirement for reviews is so annoying!)</li>
    <li> I have had this lamp for about 1 1/2 years now. I love it!  Just wish I would have got one of the faster lamps though.</li>
    <li> I love my curing lamp.  This works very well. It was very easy to assemble and I compared it to all the other lamps out on the market and for the price that I paid, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works like the salons ones, it will save me hundreds of&lt;br /&gt;Dollars a year on salon visits.  The price was excellent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank so much</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that some people got it with broken bulbs or that it only worked once. Mine arrived in great condition and was wrapped with care. The bulbs were individually wrapped and it was boxes in boxes in boxes. I appreciate that. Mine is still working in great condition. The salon I work at now uses the same one too, so this is good quality.</li>
    <li> After reading multiple reviews I bought this light as a gift. It  had great reviews and a few bad but for the price I thought it would be worth it. Unfortunately the light was broken when we got it and the light bulbs could not be installed. I returned it and spent a few dollars more for a better 45 watt light.</li>
    <li> I have saved money and time . This is a great product for busy people who hate to wait to get there nails done at the salon . I can have salon perfect when ever i want .</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was lower priced than other UV lamps and I am just trying out the Shellac products. However, this lamp never even turned on! I placed the bulbs in the machine until they clicked and I plugged it in. I switched it on and I could tell it was getting power because the red light by the timer came on. But no matter how I tried the different switches, I could not get the bulbs to light. I am unable to tell if it is a problem with the bulbs or the machine, and I have not been able to get a hold of anyone who can help me. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this UV nail lamp all the time...it is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; if you like to paint your nails with \\&quot;Gel Polish\\&quot;. It was easy to assemble, it has a timer on it but it also has an option to keep the light on without shutting off. I priced several lamps online and in local beauty supply&#x27;s and found this one to be worth every penny! There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a UV lamp to dry your nail polish...I say buy this one. I&#x27;ve been using mine 6 months already with no problems!</li>
    <li> Love it! This uv light is exactly what I needed, and for a great price as well! It&#x27;s also cute and stylish too!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t get warm or even cure gel polish. Major disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is meant to cure UV gels or UV gel polish.  I have had this lamp for nearly a year (I purchased it in November 2011) and have not had a single problem with the unit.  It has more than paid for itself in saved trips to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just looking around for replacement bulbs and realized I had not yet given a review for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews that state the polish chips or doesn&#x27;t cure but, if you follow the directions of the product you are using you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this lamp has done precisely what I&#x27;ve needed it to do for nearly a year.</li>
    <li> This lamp worked great for 5 months.  (Read similar reviews and you&#x27;ll see a pattern.)  I replaced the expensive bulbs and fuse but it&#x27;s completely dead.  I always research PROFUSELY before buying so this really bummed me out.  Opt for a better, high-quality brand.  I ended up spending that much in buying bulbs I can&#x27;t use.  ;(</li>
    <li> Product was received when indicated.  Very easy to use and very happy with this product. This product came recommended to me by a friend.</li>
    <li> This light works great. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years now and am still using it a couple times a month to do my home manicures with gel polish.  I work as a nurse and my patients are always commenting on how great my nails look, they are in shock when I tell them I do my nail myself at my home with my own curing light.  The best things is I save a lot of money doing my manicures at home.</li>
    <li> DOESNT WORK! WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this lamp for more than a year now, and using it twice monthly, the bulbs are still good. The cord is a little short, and it is designed for one hand, but I have small hands and can squeeze all my fingers in there when curing my gel or shellac manicure. This lamp works perfectly for curing the gel or shellac manicures, no need to buy the really expensive ones as indicated by CND or Harmony.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product over a month ago.  Some said their bulbs were broken but mine were fine and it doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to put the bulbs in so don&#x27;t let reviews that say no instructions on doing this sway you.  I love being able to change my polish anytime I want and can do my toes as well because the unit is big enough.  Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> At first it was kinda complicated to open and put the lights in. Took me a while but I figured it out after watching some youtube videos. This is my first and my only uv lap so i don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s better out there but i like it</li>
    <li> Affordable and good quality...i am Very pleased. I can&#x27;t think of anything negative about this product. Would definitely recommend.works well to cure my gel nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came promptly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gets a little too warm sometimes, so I have to sit under the fan to keep cool. Othr than that, it works great!!</li>
    <li> Great lamp. Came in quick, has gloves for protection. Works great, big enough to fit your whole hand or foot</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do Shellac at home because this nail dryer doesn&#x27;t dry my nails like the ones in the salons. I put my nails under numerous times and they still smudge and can&#x27;t add additional layers. I&#x27;ve tried a few times and just gave up. It&#x27;s easier and quicker to pay someone money to do it for me or to use regular old nail polish.</li>
    <li> Great lamp! product works very well and I am very happy with the results that I have experienced from using it. thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great, inexpensive little lamp, works great with my CND and Gelish products, have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> as described - thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help save money instead of paying the salon every few weeks and I love it! So far it&#x27;s paid for its self</li>
    <li> The USpicy is a wonderful machine.. there are a couple settings and it is easy to use. The machine is built very well and my wife has used it several times. I would recomend to anyone. A+</li>
    <li> I use this lamp at home with my Gelish or OPI gel nail polish system. It works great and seems to be well made. It was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  Don&#x27;t bother with a lamp with less than 36 watts but don&#x27;t think you need an expensive LED lamp.</li>
    <li> I use this product with Gellish polish. It&#x27;s made for one hand, but if in a rush, I can fit both hands in with one on top of another. Quick 2 minute curing is convenient, and the reset and timing feature makes it a no-brainer. Simple to use, and I&#x27;ve had it for months without any bulbs going out yet.</li>
    <li> No nonsense piece of equipment - easy to use and works great.  Saves me a ton from having to go to the nail salon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lamp to cure Shellac polish and it does the job perfectly. It cures the polish in the time noted on the bottles (2 mins average) and the timer(s) really are convenient. I use the 3 min setting on the top coat just to make sure it cures completely and it works every time! I&#x27;ve also used it on regular polish and it helps them dry quicker as well!</li>
    <li> I have used this light several times it takes forever to dry. regular polish drys faster.  With that said not sure if its the light or polish but it takes at least double what it should. Very disappointed. It wont last even a week.</li>
    <li> Works very well with epoxy curing for jewelry making. Nice quality. Light is even and strong.</li>
    <li> very disappointed, when i switched it came a burnt smell, this machine doesn&#x27;t works , I had never such situation with &amp;#34;amazons&amp;#34; order , also I placed for about 12 $ for transporting . give me full refund.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as a gift, Christmas 2012. I love it. It works well and you can fit your hand into it. I&#x27;ve had it 11 months now. I liked it so much that I bought one for my daughter for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for manicure addicts!</li>
    <li> Its a great product. I think this was a great deal and a hood product foe my first UV light for nails. Thank you</li>
    <li> got this for someone and 3 of the for bulbs stopped working after being used 3 times. now i have to order bulbs to make it right</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but it worked perfectly both times. I trust it will continue to work well for a long time.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again in a heart beat. It is a very high quality UV lamp. I am very satisfy!</li>
    <li> Have been using this UV light and I LOVE gel nails. My nails and hands look fantastic and it is so easy and affordable. Just get the quality shellac so the gel stays on. I can do anything, garden, rake, pull weeds, clean, scrub, everything without these nails coming off. Sometimes I forget to wear gloves, and they still stay on. I recommend gel nails for anyone who wants a beautiful manicured look - in just minutes. PS, my nail beds are very shallow and my nails are super thing and NO other type of product would stick or work, so this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> which was next to never. I ended up throwing it away. It only worked if I beat it to the extreme. Figured out this method after I dropped it and it FINALLY started to work.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product and use it, however, when it arrived, I put the bulbs in it, turned it on, and nothing happened! Broken. Had to return it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had my lamp for over a year and it works perfectly. I have not had a light bulb burn yet and I use it probably twice a month!</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use. Don&#x27;t pay to have a salon do it for you.</li>
    <li> So glad I got this from Amazon and not from the retail nail store, the price is much better on-line.  I am using it from my gel nails.  I like that it has a timer and turns off when it&#x27;s done.  Only used it once, but so far, I&#x27;m glad with the result. I save money and time doing my nails at home.</li>
    <li> Worked great and is exactly as show in picture (few small dings in metal tray)</li>
    <li> Just like everyone who ordered this product, I was extremely excited to receive my package...&lt;br /&gt;Box was brand spanking new, even with clear tape covering the lamp and new bulbs, individually wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately installed the bulbs and plugged it in and pressed the on button....&lt;br /&gt;nothing....&lt;br /&gt;So I tried pressing other buttons, on and off, checking every plug in the house, and still nothing....&lt;br /&gt;Then realized that the red LED light wasn&#x27;t even lit up (MAKE SURE TO CHECK FOR THE LIGHT)&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed, I was getting ready to pack it up and return the item but my boyfriend decides to open it up and see what the problem might be and there it was....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE WIRE CONNECTING TO THE FUSE WAS BROKEN OFF!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The most ridiculous thing I have ever seen! Why would anyone pack a product that hasn&#x27;t been properly assembled or even at that, defective!! Luckily, he knew how to fix it and was completely functional.&lt;br /&gt;Still debating if I want to keep the product or return it - having paid for a defective product that we had to fix and still not sure if it even works properly BUT FOR OTHERS, be careful when you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE ON REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I had bought this item used it 3 times and then it stopped working.  I wrote a negative review and then within a couple days a very nice customer service representative contacted me via email and asked if I would like a new product or refund.  I happily took the new product.  I was sent a new machine within the week and it was amazing customer service.  Thank you Dava for your great service.</li>
    <li> These lights do very well for setting up gel nails, even dark colors. The bulbs are expensive to replace so I just buy new lights each time.</li>
    <li> I got this lamp on sale, and it came with a free set of UV Gloves. LOVE IT!!! The packaging was great, came new with the wrapping on it! All of the bulbs were wrapped very well, and when no issues putting the bulbs in. It also came with instructions. I plugged the Lamp in and it has a choice for 120s no timer or 180s. The lights come on right away, and the lamp is VERY QUIET. Shipping was VERY FAST! This lamp came with free shipping, and it came with in 2 days via UPS! I&#x27;m super impressed and please with this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not hard to forget that name.  I get tons of complements on my gel nails, and I always tell them, once you&#x27;ve gone gel, you&#x27;ll never go back.  Then I tell them to get a USpicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used lots of lights, all of which lasted a long time, but I wasn&#x27;t getting the hard cure I really wanted and knew was possible.  My nails are indestructible, they don&#x27;t lift, and last until it&#x27;s time for a fill. It has a timer function, which I like, and it works perfect.  Ii&#x27;ve only put about an hour on the light, so I can&#x27;t talk about longevity, but seriously, the money I save, it won&#x27;t matter if I have to replace it.  Functional obsolescence is something consumers have to accept. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel Tips:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t soak off, I file it down and treat it like acrylic nails and recoat.  Much less chemical exposure and stress on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I incorporate a lot of glitter into my designs (RockStar nails) and get stopped all the time.  Just layer the glitter in before you cure,  lots of tutorials online.  Sky&#x27;s the limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the long sleeve tipless gloves, if they are not offering it as an add on when you buy, BUY some.  Who wants aged hands...not me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to beautiful nails, ladies!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t get great reviews. I however have not had a problem with it. I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times and thought it did as advertised.</li>
    <li> The uv light works fine, but the sellers description indicated that it included the uv gloves.  There were no gloves in my shipment.</li>
    <li> originally I reviewed this product out one star because I could not get it to properly care of my nails. I contacted customer support through Amazon as well as through the company and we couldn&#x27;t figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working. They were willing to resend me a new one, but I thought I would look at the use spicy lamp cure one last time to make sure everything was right. As I pulled out the trade, I noticed that one of the sides of the trait was pealing back. Apparently, there is a protective cover on the tray that has to come off in order for it to cure. It is a blue thin sticker that covers the metal tray base.  I don&#x27;t know if I missed that in the instructions or if they&#x27;re not there but I saw the corner and pulled it back to discover that underneath it&#x27;s a silver metal finish. That finish, I am assuming, allows the heat to reflect onto your nails that then cures them. Once I took it off, it worked fine!   Here are the steps I found it necessary to cure gel nails: 1-Prep your nails properly. Use fingernail polish remover to wipe down your nails, pushback your cuticles and clip them, get your nails to the desired length and shape, etc.  2-put your gel polish on your nails in a thin coat. It is important that it is a thin coat, or they just won&#x27;t cure properly.  3-Place your nails in the lamp for a few minutes (your nails are done when they are solid). There will still be a sticky film on the top of your nails, that&#x27;s normal!  4- Using A cotton ball, or a cotton pad, put rubbing alcohol on it and gently wipe that sticky coating off.  5-Repeat steps 2-4 for more coats or other colors.  And there you go! A good product, with a great price! Have fun, do it right, and enjoy the results 😄.</li>
    <li> amazing product. works amazing. very happy. i use it 5 month now (i think). never had a problem</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly.  It will dry your nails in one cycle, but I have been using 2 cycles.  A great buy</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Purchased it to use with Gelish nail polish - I use it as a top coat over normal polish. It is awesome. I love that you can slide out the tray and clean it, just in case. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this uv lamp so I could do my own shellac nails at home.  This has worked great.  It is easy to put together and clean and store.  It has a timer so there is no guessing how long you need to cure your nails for.  I love and recommend it to professional salons or home use.</li>
    <li> I finally opened the box and unpacked everything to use and the whole housing unit inside is broken.  Should have had better packaging.  Very dissapointed and now I have to pay to have it returned, no thanks.  Open it right away!</li>
    <li> I got this for an ex-girlfriend...she gave me a pen....</li>
    <li> we love this it will do both nails and toes easy to use also I would suggest that you buy this</li>
    <li> Just like the salon! I got tired of spendong 40-50 $ every 2-3 weeks. The technique is simple. You can just go on you tube for Gelish directions. However I find that it works best with Gelish polish rather than other off brands.</li>
    <li> I chose this item because I wanted to start doing gel nails for my friends and family.  As a professional, I can say that this product was certainly worth the money and I would definitely recommend this seller.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> This works perfectly and for a fraction of what they cost in the beauty product stores---what a find and arrived perfectly!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product, but I was immediately disappointed. The gloves that were offered for free were not sent as promised. Then when I tried the product the first layer dried perfectly. The next layer took longer then the directions said that it would. By the time the top coat was going on it wasn&#x27;t drying at all. It took longer then an hour to get completely done because the dry times were (180 sec x3) nine minutes by the 2ed coat of nail polish went on. The polish still was not completely dry because it was running into the clear top coat. (I was using a dark pink gelish polish). The top coat didn&#x27;t dry at all. I had to go to bed with my nails still wet. When I got up I had to remove gels cause they were so messed up. I would not recommend this product at all. Save your money for a better product.</li>
    <li> This is a really good UV Lamp.  I received it in no time and it worked exactly as described.  Easy to install bulbs and no issues with operation.</li>
    <li> This product was just what I needed and exactally what I orded. I appreciate the quick shipping and I recommend this to anyone. Thank you and God Bless.</li>
    <li> I found one for $15 less. Should also tell customers they have to finish with alcohol to get hardness &amp; shine. Otherwise polish will stay gummy.</li>
    <li> I do my nails at home, using gel and this works beautiful. I love the timer button on it. It works like a charm. I definitely would recommend this to nail techs or for home use.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I do my own shellac now and it is much cheaper than going out and doing my own nails</li>
