      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>My friends all say it is amazing too.</li>
      <li>It glides on smoothly and does a great job with odor.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works amazingly, for over 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>but I found that on its own it still doesn&#x27;t give 100% protection.  </li>
      <li>We all kind of take for granted</li>
      <li>I read so many good reviews on it that I decided to give it a try, even thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
      <li>But to get any kind of coverage, you need to apply a lot of this stuff, dab it all over, then try to work it</li>
      <li>This is AMAZINGLY effective.</li>
      <li>I did not feel it was as effective as it could be.</li>
      <li>When I came across this product, and it&#x27;s many good reviews I decided I would run out to the store and test a stick before I committed to amazons $12 subscription, and boy was</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if that part of the product is effective</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
      <li>and it does not seem as effective if you put it on in the morning</li>
      <li>By far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried; and I have tried them all from organics, to pricey department store brands.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this comes in great scents and is very, very effective.</li>
      <li>Then I decided to try this deoderant because it sounded too good to be true.</li>
      <li>and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>but it is nice to wear a deoderant that works but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to get on your clothing, since it&#x27;s the kind of deodorant where you twist the bottom</li>
      <li>It does everything it says and more .</li>
      <li>and on days when I wear more form-fitting shirts.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I opened the package, raised the product to the top, and used it once.</li>
      <li>I will be reordering it for sure for some time.</li>
      <li>even more so that I have two sticks and have to continue my search.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, for those of us who shower in the morning, do we apply more?</li>
      <li>I am allergic to many things and while I was not allergic to it</li>
      <li>it would actually be more $16x2 &#x3D;</li>
      <li>I got this as a Vine product and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I glad i did this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I am perfect through the next night when I shower!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this product</li>
      <li>couldnt find it in the germans store, so i was glad i could get it over amazon.  </li>
      <li>For some reason (no matter how cute I try to be), I have always had an underarm sweat problem.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands &amp; kinds of deodorant but nothing has helped (I haven&#x27;t tried prescription, however).  </li>
      <li>I love this deoderant.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m always sent the regular clinical strength, which doesn&#x27;t make me very happy.</li>
      <li>Love the Clinical Strength</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a list of the ones that fall into that category.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s made with better ingredients then maybe we all should be looking at using it.</li>
      <li>So I love that this doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  </li>
      <li>more than the click up solids,</li>
      <li>I sweat - more than I would like to -</li>
      <li>One of the best ones out there actually.  </li>
      <li>and I work in an environment that sometimes makes me think I&#x27;m in a sauna.  :-)  </li>
      <li>And buying it here, I&#x27;m able to save money.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> only deodorant I use now. It does everything it says and more .</li>
    <li> Secret Clinical Strength Sensitive Skin Advanced Solid has a pleasant scent and does its job, no moisture. Would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> Strong enough for a man...so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, ok, I know this has a pretty package and is clearly marketed towards women.  But truth be told, I am a man and I can&#x27;t take fragrances, at all.  The slightest hint will make my head spin and eventually give me a headache.  No matter what product you pick up on men&#x27;s side, even the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products all, if you read the label, the forth or fifth item is...fragrance.  Weird.  And forget abut getting any clinical strength product that is unscented, they all try to outdo the Axe body spray - sorry college was too long ago.  I just want something to do exactly what I need it to do, nothing more and nothing less.  I read the label very carefully, the ingredients are the same &amp;#34;stoppers&amp;#34; as would be in a clinical strength men&#x27;s deodorant but then of course we need to add...fragrance and a roll on or gel or something else.  I just want something that works and trust me this does the job.  I have used it for over year and it has never, not once let me down.  Of course I have to put it under the sink so nobody asks questions, but it really does the job.  Not sure how this review would help anyone coming to look at this product, wrong market, wrong product but I believe in giving credit where credit is due.</li>
    <li> I have never had an issue with BO until after having my second child. I am two months post partum and breastfeeding, I don&#x27;t know if it is the constant having a little heater attached or what but It has been awful. My normal Secret expressions pear deodorant was no longer cutting it so after reading the roaring reviews on the clinical strength deodorant I had high hopes. I&#x27;ve used it for two days and stink mid day. Granted I live in Florida and it is in the 90&#x27;s, I am very disappointed in this deodorant, even more so that I have two sticks and have to continue my search.</li>
    <li> Gotta Say that my thought on this was, well it&#x27;s just another underarm deoderant. I was wrong, This underarm kept me dry, no stains, no break though, no over powering scent, nothing.  I&#x27;m really pleased with this product would recommend with high marks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often that a product doing exactly what it says and nothing more is a compliment, but Secret&#x27;s clinical strength \\&quot;Hypoallergenic Advanced Solid Antiperspirant\\&quot; fits the bill.  It&#x27;s completely scent free and keeps the underarms odorless all day long.  Anyone with a tendency to get rashes from regular or scented deodorant won&#x27;t need to worry, as it&#x27;s incredibly mild and won&#x27;t irritate the armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not exactly a deal breaker, it is worth noting that this deodorant isn&#x27;t quite as much of a solid as it&#x27;s advertised to be. The deodorant actually comes out as a gel, but it isn&#x27;t sticky or gooey and essentially works just like a solid would. For anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind the gel, the only potential problems are the size and price. Besides being smaller than the average stick of deodorant, it&#x27;s almost nearly twice as much in the cost department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size and cost aside, Secret&#x27;s hypoallergenic antiperspirant does exactly what it should and is well worth it for anyone with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she commented with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hypoallergenic antiperspirant it works well and without skin irritation issues.  But... my complaint is with the substance itself not the purpose it serves.  The deodorant says in the title description - solid - which is probably a matter of opinion.  Instead, the substance is more like the consistency of lotion pretty much.  The substance is silky soft but still sticky against the skin surface, so oddly enough the substance doesn&#x27;t cause irritation but it does cause the discomfort you wouldn&#x27;t expect from a deodorant.  You have to definitely wait a little while after putting it on, so it can dry and not be all over your clothing.  Like I said before, I don&#x27;t have any issues with the hypoallergenic claims, but I do think the term \\&quot;solid\\&quot; should be applied to a less messy &amp; less liquid-like substance.</li>
    <li> By far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve tried; and I have tried them all from organics, to pricey department store brands.  I have very sensitive skin, and if there is any scent or chemical I end up with a problem - sticky, stinky, and just plain uncomfortable.  Honestly very embarrassing and I was super self-conscientious.  So when I found this I was very excited, and so far no problems.  I do what the directions says...shower at night and apply only one click since two clicks seems excessive and makes me wonder if they want to use it up faster so you&#x27;ll buy more....but I am perfect through the next night when I shower!  When I showered two times a day I used it twice a day and still had the same results.  Give this a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I never used to have BO until I started using Nuvaring and it became very embarrassing to have anyone come near me. I tried everything and every type of deodorant and NOTHING worked. I was a bit skeptical because I had used Dove clinical strength (DOESN&#x27;T WORK BY THE WAY) and I wasn&#x27;t sure if Secret&#x27;s clinical strength was up to the challenge (I bought the hypoallergenic version). The first time I used it I was floored. There was absolutely NO SMELL! I used it before I went to bed and woke up still smelling fresh. I swipe it on in the morning and when I come home after a long day I kid you not, still no scent or odor! I can&#x27;t tell you how relieved I am to not have to be embarrassed anymore!</li>
    <li> After ruining numerous white tops to excessive perspiration, I tried the prescription Drysol.  While effective in targeting my perspiration issue, I found the burning and itching that accompanied the product to be enough of a reason to try to identify another option so picked up Secret Clinical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product applied smoothly and does not have an overly strong perfume scent.  The substance applied white, not clear.  I experienced no itching or burning with its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using the product, it was in winter and I found the product to be fairly effective at combating excessive perspiration.  However, I eventually found the product&#x27;s effectiveness to be directly proportional to the season.  As might be expected, I tend to perspire less during the winter months.  Once temperatures begin to hit sixty, however, I had to return to my use of Drysol or Certain Dry (a strong antiperspirant that does not require a prescription).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, this product only works about five-six months out of the year for me.  I will continue to hold out hope that a product that does not itch, burn, or require a prescription will be created.</li>
    <li> I always had to choose between unscented, hypoallergenic deodorants that didn&#x27;t really protect me from sweating (especially in the summer) or harsh, strong products that took care of the sweat but irritated my skin. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve found a product that combines great efficacy and a gentle formula. My only complaint is that it can leave white traces on the clothes, so one has to be careful when putting on a dark t-shirt. If only they made it clear! But anyway, this is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> I run and I sweat a lot so I thought I&#x27;d try this (and also to use when not running.)  It seems average at best.  I went through an entire container of it and it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  It did not keep me dry and it is difficult for me to wash off in the shower.  It leaves my skin \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; and \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; feeling and soap doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate the film in order to wash it off.  Also, for the price, there seems to be so little in the tube.  Usually, deodorants last me a long time but this one was finished much sooner.  If it had worked well to keep me dry then the tacky film wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me so much but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my daughter-in-law for review since she has a problem with perspiration and has delicate skin. Fortunately, the product did not irritate her skin, masked any odor well, and performed well against perspiration in general, but unfortunately it did not work well in the most difficult circumstances -- i.e. under stress in the heat. For someone with average perspiration, the product would probably be excellent, as I found with another scent that I reviewed.</li>
    <li> The trick of this (who knew that deodorant came with a &#x27;trick&#x27;, right?) is that you put this on the night before, if you follow directions.  Which is fine...unless you&#x27;re one of those people who takes morning showers, I think.  And if you remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, once you get that set, it works wonderfully. I teach so I&#x27;m often standing in front of a crowd of people where sweat...really noticeable and very unattractive.  It&#x27;s not quite as good as Certain Dri, but is easier to find, and much, much better than standard stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If even regular stuff gives you sweaty circles, give this stuff a shot, just remember--before bedtime!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Keeps me dry all day...even in the sweltering Texas heat. The scent is light and subtle. It also doesn&#x27;t sting/burn my skin like some of the other &#x27;prescription streangth&#x27; anti-persperants have. Even thought the bottle is small it last a long time since I only need a very small amount. The directions say to use &#x27;two clicks&#x27; but I only use one click worth of product and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Vine product and fell in love. It works really well, and I even dab it on my forehead to stop sweating. I&#x27;ve never had a prescription strength deodorant so not sure if this is as strong or not. It does seem to be a bit stronger than regular Secret, and perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> This product works as it claims, but I did have to call Secret to clarify the directions as you are supposed to apply it at night.  Given this, I wondered if I was to re-apply after showering in the morning, and they said yes, put it on in the morning too.  It has a pleasant smell, and its nice to know that I can actually have a product which will work, especially for a special occasion.  Would definitely recommend Secret Clinical.</li>
    <li> I love this deoderant.  I have been using the clinical strength for a few years, but I had to put up with the different scents because a non-scented version was never offered.  But this is wonderful - I&#x27;ve had less ingrown hairs and sore areas from shaving since I started using the Sensitive Skin unscented, and it is wonderful.  It&#x27;s a plus, plus, plus!+++++++</li>
    <li> Reduces odor.  Reduces perspiration.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.  Lasts a long time.  On the downside, it can leave white streaks on your clothing, but they can be easily removed with a bit of water and gentle rubbing.  But the white streaks can be annoying if you&#x27;re in a hurry to get out the door and get this stuff on your clothing by accident,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good product.  One of the best ones out there actually.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I like the way that this deodorant feels on my skin.  It definitely lasts all day and then some when I&#x27;m working...and I work in an environment that sometimes makes me think I&#x27;m in a sauna.  :-)  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Okay, a couple of things up front.  I have used Secret deodorant for over 50 years.  Up to now, it has been totally consistent insofar as being gentle on my skin and stopping odor, if not perspiration, which is just something I thought I just had to put up with.  Second, testing this product in 30 to 60 degree weather obviously isn&#x27;t like doing it in the dead of summer.  That said, I gave this product a workout because I used it over the past two weeks getting through the Thanksgiving dinner saga.  Some of you know what I mean.  The house has to be cleaned, top to bottom, the outside yard has to be spruced up, and then there&#x27;s the all day cooking marathon (which I do the day before).  Guess what?  No sweat, literally.  In that respect this deodorant is truly like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before.  Because I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin all my life, I&#x27;ve been very picky about deodorants, and this one honors Secret&#x27;s legacy of being gentle and non-irritating.  (By the way, don&#x27;t even think about shaving your underarms and then using deodorant immediately afterward; separate those two activities by at least eight hours.)  Also, there is no fragrance whatsoever, a real plus in my book because fragrances sometimes bother my allergies.  The only real problem is having to retrain myself to follow the directions to use it at night instead of first thing in the morning.</li>
    <li> It seems to work about as well as regular Secret with two odd differences: you apply it at night, and though it it labeled as a solid, it is a white gel.  I can&#x27;t say it works any differently than ordinary anti-perspirant, but that may be because I don&#x27;t have problem perspiration.  If it has any \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; properties, it lives up to its hypo-allergenic label by not irritating my skin, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t see any protection difference, I REALLY dislike extruded gel anti-perspirant, and it costs quite a bit more than my regular Secret product, I do not foresee purchasing this product in the future.  I&#x27;m glad the Vine program allowed me to try it free of charge, as I was curious about the product.</li>
    <li> Has the three holes to push out the deodorant and I prefer a true solid.  Otherwise product is great.</li>
    <li> Many of us who used to use Mitchums until the unfortunate change of active ingredients, have gone looking for products that still have the former effective Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly. One thing about Mitchums was that when they formulated an antiperspirant/deodorant for those of us who have sensitive skin, they actually managed to leave out the stupid fragrance to which so many are allergic. (Well, that WAS true until they marketed this last stuff which goes back to the AZTG but contains fragrance in a formulation marked &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this Secret Clinical Strength is also marked &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; but has &amp;#34;masking fragrance&amp;#34;. What part of allergic and sensitive don&#x27;t they understand? And sure enough, there&#x27;s a stench so you&#x27;ll be allergic to yourself if you use it. Please be warned. (You might check out Gillette Extra Strength to see whether it is truly free of these troublesome scents.)</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to wax on poetically about deodorant so let&#x27;s keep it short and sweet: It does the job and does it well.</li>
    <li> While this deodorant doesn&#x27;t replace my go-to favorite Certain Dri, it does take the place of the other deodorant I was using during the day to go along with Certain Dri on the hot days of summer.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin which is a major bonus and it smells great.  It works really well as a companion to Certain Dri but I found that on its own it still doesn&#x27;t give 100% protection.  I am also a bit of a sweater so this may be perfect for the girls out there that perspire and don&#x27;t sweat ;)</li>
    <li> My wife complains that no typical deodorant works well enough for her desire.  She complains that they either do not smell nice enough or that they do not last long enough.  However, that is not the case with the entire Secret Clinical Strength line.  She loves them all and has so much positive to say about it.    The only thing I would like to mention, is that if you are satisfied with non clinical strength versions I would advise you to stick with them as there are some preliminary medical studies linking strong antiperspirants to an increase in breast cancer.  The assumption is that the bad things your body is trying to expel get locked in and cause a build up of cancer causing agents.  No definitive studies have occurred from what I have read, but it is something to consider.</li>
    <li> As an antiperspirant/deoderant this product seems to work fine.  I don&#x27;t have allegies so I don&#x27;t know if that part of the product is effective but it is nice to wear a deoderant that works but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  The one thing I am not crazy about is the way the applicator works.  There is a plastic grill with slots in it and you turn the dial at the bottom until some oozes out.  If too much oozes out, there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it.  I really don&#x27;t like running the plastic grills under my arms.  I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want or need to spend this much on a deoderant.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Secret Sensitive Skin Hypoallergenic after the Mitchum (that I&#x27;d used for over 10 years) started giving me a rash. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. This stuff works even better than Mitchum and no rash whatsoever. Plus, it stays on the skin--no residue to get on my shirts. And, no added perfume, so I don&#x27;t smell like a lady. Luckily, I&#x27;m secure enough in my manhood not to worry about using a woman&#x27;s deoderant. It works for me and that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
    <li> The Secret Clinic Strength deodorants are awesome. They are very effective! I used to have a lot of issues with pit stains but that is now a thing of the past (except maybe when it&#x27;s 90 outside and I&#x27;m running around or something). It is easy to get on your clothing, since it&#x27;s the kind of deodorant where you twist the bottom and it pushes it up through the top. It dries fairly quickly but I&#x27;ve gotten it on clothing accidentally before! Overall, this comes in great scents and is very, very effective.</li>
    <li> It is very effective, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and has never given me any allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> Love the sensitive version as it has no scent and works very well. I do not have any allergies so I cannot review it from that perspective. My reason for buying this one is lack of scent as I prefer to use scented moisturizer or perfume. It performs very well through workouts and hot weather.</li>
    <li> works as advertised for me.  have ordered 2X so far.  i didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; version of this at all (it is smelly)</li>
    <li> I think this product is fake or was mishandled.  Dries over and turns black in between every use and after applying I sweat profusely.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this deodorant was unscented and would not have purchased it if I did.  I prefer clinical with a scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the sweatiest person in the world, but then again a lot of natural(organic)deodorants don&#x27;t cut it for me. Recently my husband and I started cycling and I wore this deodorant out on a 2 hour 40 minute trail ride in 85 degree weather in which we cycled 30 miles. I think it held up pretty well. I could kinda smell myself sweat just lightly but my husband gave me a thorough sniff and said I smelled fresh as a daisy which I think is pretty good for those conditions!    I have also worn this for everyday with no problems. I just wish that the ingredients were a little better for you. The main ingredient cyclopentasiloxane is a silicone that is found to reach the blood stream in small amounts, dimethicone is a silicone derived emollient which is a known tumor promoter and is non-biodegradable, and tribehenin can cause allergies or cancer. It makes you think twice about a cosmetic when you find out it might make you sick in the future.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed other Clinical Strength products before this so I will make it short and sweet.  I was surprised to confirm that there was actually not a scent even though Amazon had advertised otherwise.  You can now apply this product not only at bedtime but in the morning for extra protection which works so much better for me.  This was my first Sensitive Skin Hypo Clinical Strength and I have to admit that I like it better than the other products.  I found that the non-scented worked beautifully with my body chemistry since I struggle with odor rather than wetness.  Usually the \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; transform into an offensive scent.  Shaving was not an issue because of the sensitive skin formula so there were not any bumps.  I was able to go about 2 days without reapplying; I realize that you should reapply every night but since I was staying at home there wasn&#x27;t any need.  Companies: please provide more product!  This isn&#x27;t cheap and receiving a 1/4 of product is just not fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend because this particular version worked wonderfully for me and any other individuals that \\&quot;regular\\&quot; anti/deodorants just don&#x27;t cut it any longer!</li>
    <li> This product works and is very efrective at blocking odor and sweat, the only minor complaint is the chalky feeling. Overall recommended.</li>
    <li> Yeah, so I sweat - more than I would like to - I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorants/anti-perspirants over the years, and Secret just always makes a great line of products!  I can&#x27;t say that I didn&#x27;t sweat when I used this, I still did, but the deodorant stayed on and I felt fresh after a long work day including lots of walking, and lots of walking in intense, humid heat - it&#x27;s been in the mid to high 90&#x27;s lately with high humidity!  I&#x27;ve been using this all day sensitive skin Deodorant/anti-Perspirant for about 2+ weeks, and I really am a fan - usually I like solids more than the click up solids, but I must say, I really do like this one...it has a nice smell and ACTUALLY STAYED ON thru some good sweating - and didn&#x27;t irritate my more sensitive skin at all!  I put this on even right after shaving, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all (and I do have sensitive skin - I tend to react to things) - I was impressed with this new product from Secret, but I&#x27;ve always been a fan of their lines - they tend to be superior to many others in actually living up to their claims - from someone who has tried probably 1/2 of the women&#x27;s deodorants on the market at one time or another, this is one that works and works well - I would buy this one again &amp; again!</li>
    <li> I got this because a family member has recently come to have rather difficult times finding a Antiperspirant/deodorant that doesn&#x27;t cause rashes or irritation in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product over to her to use and I&#x27;ve heard some good things and now she&#x27;s only purchasing this product. I took my time in this review due to the fact that we thought it best to give it time, just in case something developed after prolonged use. So far, it&#x27;s been a good product. There haven&#x27;t been any irritation issues at all and the all needed Antiperspirant portion of the product has done it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone is blessed with tolerances to everything out there and it&#x27;s great that some companies make it a point to put out products that are made a little better for those that have issues with the cheaper product. I&#x27;m also wondering if it would be a smart idea for the rest of us to consider a product like this. If it&#x27;s made with better ingredients then maybe we all should be looking at using it. It&#x27;s not that big of a price difference and if the products in it are better for those with allergies it could possibly be better for those without allergic skin reactions. I&#x27;ll have to do some more digging into the contents of the product and weight out if it would be a smart decision for more people to use it than those that have the bad reactions to the normal stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did come across some articles that say that some brands use borderline dangerous ingredients but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a list of the ones that fall into that category. We all kind of take for granted that Antiperspirant/deodorant is what it is and we don&#x27;t pay attention to what is actually in the product.</li>
    <li> When I tried to open it, it broke, What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> As a professional musician, I really perspire &amp; smell quite bad whenever I perform &amp; have ruined so much clothing and am so embarrassed to be near people after performances! I&#x27;ve tried so many brands &amp; kinds of deodorant but nothing has helped (I haven&#x27;t tried prescription, however).  Perfumes &amp; other scents really bother me &amp; give me bad headaches ... I DO NOT like scent in deodorants either so my options have been few.  This product has solved all of my problems -- I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.  Everyone is different but this product has saved my clothes and my fear of being around others.</li>
    <li> As a man, I just want a deodorant that blocks sweat and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like I&#x27;m going to a high school dance. This is great: it blocks sweat and has no smell, so my shirt has no sweat stains and you can smell my cologne. Why is there no deodorant for men that does this?</li>
    <li> used it first time in the US while i visited family over there.  couldnt find it in the germans store, so i was glad i could get it over amazon.  its perfect for people who are sensitive and its the only deodorant that keeps smell away- and thats ALL day long!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> 1 star review given based on product effectiveness VS price charged in relation to other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this product after my Arm and Hammer deodorant started to give me rashes. I was beyond depressed when I realized my $2 salvation from sweat could no longer protect me. I immediately began a search for hypoallergenic deodorants assuming that I would now develop rashes from all standard ones. When I came across this product, and it&#x27;s many good reviews I decided I would run out to the store and test a stick before I committed to amazons $12 subscription, and boy was I glad i did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I brought his home, the package which it came in was standard sized, however, when I opened it half of the packaging was just for show. What I really pulled out of the box... was half the size of an actual deodorant stick. At this point I knew that this was just the beginning of my disappointment. At $8 a stick..... I received half of my $2 stick.... I now would be spending $8x2 &#x3D; $16 a month on the same amount of deodorant.... to make things worse... this deodorant was not as effective at sweat control and fails at around 4-6 hour periods. So where a $2 stick could protect me for about 8-12 hours with one application, the $8 stick could not. I now had to apply it at least twice a day to get the same level of protection. Calculating further I realized not only was I going to spend $16.. it would actually be more $16x2 &#x3D; $32 a month...... After all the calculations I realized this was a mistake... I had no desire to spend close to $32 a month on just deodorant. I went back to the store and started testing other $2/$3 sticks to see their effectiveness. Seeing how I spent $8 on 1 stick, that gave me enough money to test 4 sticks at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I have found Arm and Hammer natural deodorant which only has baking soda and plant extracts, but the best part is, it&#x27;s only costing me $2 a pop. So far no allergic reactions have developed, but I have found that it is also not as affective as the regular sticks. Applying it about 2 times a day, but at a much cheaper cost. Sorry secret, I just don&#x27;t understand how they can give you half of their original product and charge 4 times as much for it..... at this point it just feels like I was taken advantage of, just because I was allergic. No active ingredient in this product costs an absurd amount of money to justify the final price.t as affective as the regular sticks. Applying it about 2 times a day, but at a much cheaper cost.

    <li> I love that this unscented deodorant IS ACTUALLY UNSCENTED.  I apply at night after a shower and it lasts 24 hours.  On the pricey end for a drugstore product but totally worth it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing and no crusty globby bits left under my arm; my pet peeve.  The packaging is deceptively large for the amount of product you get, but I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to many things and while I was not allergic to it I did not feel it was as effective as it could be.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive and in a smaller container, but it does the job.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> This product from Secret was top-notch and really stopped the perspiration and did not aggravate sensitive skin.  The scent was reasonable and not too overpowering like some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product performed exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the perfumed overpowering sent of all the deodorants/antiperspirants out there.  This does the job with no added smells.</li>
    <li> A very decent antiperspirant. I liked being able to use it directly after having shaved and not getting any irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;It lost a star for me as the fragrance was somewhat lacking.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this exact product in my local stores. Works well on sensitive skin, reduces itching.</li>
    <li> The deodorant I used for 10 years simply became ineffective of late.  I tried this and am just delighted.  It has no scent, is creamy and goes on like a non-greasy lotion, and works!  I will be reordering it for sure for some time.</li>
    <li> This is the best D.O. I found for strength and sensitive skin. I have extremely sensitive skin &amp; am allergic to metal. I can shave and use this without having allergic outbreaks.</li>
    <li> This deodorant worked fine for sensitive skin, no irritation. It just didn&#x27;t seem to do a lot better than any other deodorant for keeping me dry or odor free.  I wasn&#x27;t happy about using it due to the high level of aluminum, but needed something for a special occasion that would work well. --Just similar to other deodorant. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with underarm sweat.  This product is the first that actually helped me.  Even though it is made for women, it helps me a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect solution for a person who is sensitive to or allergic to other anti-perspirants.  Works great for us.</li>
    <li> I did not want the gel.  It was supposed to be the same item as my previous order for the same item, only in a cream form.</li>
    <li> Today (last night) as the first time i have used this deodorant, and so far its the best purchase i have made for a deodorant! I say last night because you use it only at night, and that is what i did, i applied a total of two clicks to my underarms, went to sleep, and woke up and so far I&#x27;ve been dry! I think i have purchased one of these but a different scent and turns out i was using it wrong! It totally makes a difference if you only apply it at night, and maybe one application in the morning and you are good to go! I get overheated very easily, so during the night i can get overheated sometimes, and i guess this deodorant is working because i haven&#x27;t been sweating all day so far, and it is quite humid over here lately where i live. The fragrance free is a plus! When you first apply it, there might be a little itching or irritation, but i was using a deodorant the day before that was causing irruption:( so maybe its just adjusting to that. Overall, i am very exciting and pleased to use this, i was worried about buying this in bulk without using just one to try it before  but I&#x27;m so glad i did because now i dont need to buy these for a while because it is a double purchase:) I wish the packaging was a little different, because the deodorant stick isn&#x27;t at the very bottom, it comes with the stick at the middle, and you twist it up and its at the very top and thats at the very first application you use it, which is kind of frustrating, i wish it was made where its at the very bottom and not hallway, but otherwise, i am very happy with this, and people with sensitive skin will love this!</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that i have ever used that actually works for my sensitive skin and excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> What the heck?  This says smooth solid but I have to tell you that &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; is not the right word!  Upon looking closer at the description (now that I purchased and am not happy, oops!) I see that &amp;#34;smooth solid&amp;#34; is white creamy stuff that comes out the little holes when you turn the wheel.  It is my fault for not reading the description in it&#x27;s entirety but Secret shouldn&#x27;t be misleading with what they call their product either.  I&#x27;m a little frustrated.  As for how it works, I&#x27;m not sure.  My daughter (who for some unfortunate and annoying reason is allergic to all sorts of hygenic products (even the ones without scent)) is trying it out and we will report back.  I just wanted to alert people to the &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; issue so they can not make the same mistake I did.  By the way, anyone know of a hypo-allergenic sanitary pad option?  Comment if you do!</li>
    <li> Found it here.  Love the no scent.  Even though it says &amp;#34;Advanced Solid&amp;#34; it is the &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; that I was looking for.</li>
    <li> You always thought your sweat was particularly pungent and you were right! Get this, it&#x27;s awesome. And grab the Neutrogena clear sunscreen for your sweaty, acne-prone skin. A very good combo.</li>
    <li> Mother used to say \\&quot;Horses sweat, men perspire, and ladies feel the heat.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me a little of Certain-Dri, the old standby for those that sweat like a racehorse after winning the Kentucky Derby. Unlike Certain-Dri, this product is sticky and messy. However, it does not irritate the skin as Certain-Dri can. Put it on after a morning shower and it remains sticky. Using as directed, at night, solves this problem, that is if you wait until it is fully dry before putting your arms to your sides.  It will keep you drier than most antiperspirants but use as directed, and it may take a few applications before you see the result you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve also learned that it works by blocking the pores, and it&#x27;s easier for the product to do that when we are in sleep mode, another reason to use at night.</li>
    <li> Due to my tendency to develop allergic reactions to everything I come in contact with both natural and manmade (Yeah, I&#x27;m fun to shop for!), I&#x27;m often forced to choose between something that works and something that doesn&#x27;t hurt.  In an effort to improve my odds, I&#x27;ve taken to trying out women&#x27;s products on the theory, not that women are necessarily more sensitive, but rather that women are more likely to mention problems to somebody while we men descend into macho-chistic idiocy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This?  Nah, this doesn&#x27;t hurt!  You can barely see the blisters now.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried and found effective but somewhat painful both [[ASIN:B000052X8R Certain Dri Antiperspirant Roll-On for Excessive Perspiration 1.2 oz (35.5 ml)]] and [[ASIN:B001ECQ56Q Dove Clinical Protection Original Clean, 1.7 oz Stick]], continuous use resulting in slight but noticeable pain and redness.  However this product: [[ASIN:B003FXTYEW Secret Clinical Strength Sensitive Skin Hypoallergenic Advanced Solid Antiperspirant / Deodorant, 1.6 oz Boxes]] and the similar product: [[ASIN:B001F51VS4 Secret Clinical Strength, Light and Fresh Scent-Advanced Solid Antiperspirant / Deodorant, 1.6 oz Boxes]] control my excessive perspiration WITHOUT hurting, and this man&#x27;s man will be PROUD to continue using this women&#x27;s product,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but if you see me buying it in the store, I&#x27;ll tell you I&#x27;m buying it for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: A couple of nice things about an apply at night antiperspirant like this are speeding up your morning routine and no longer having to worry about those difficult to remove antiperspirant stains on your daytime clothes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome to find a product that works as hard as Mitchum but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Not strong scent either. It&#x27;s a soft creamy powder that dries fast. I like the metered application by clicks too. That way I never dispense too much. I recommend it for a change of pace and a softer more feminine product that doesn&#x27;t irritate or overpower you with fake scents.</li>
    <li> The areas where you put it on feel sticky in the shower or bath. You would have to scrub the residue.  After a week of using th hypoallergenic one both at night and day, noticed there was still sweat odor.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  I wish it cost less.</li>
    <li> Love this, wish there was more in the container.  There is very little.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this deodorant within the subscribe and save program.  Why not pay less for a great deodorant?  First, I used to use Mitchum unscented roll-on, but recently haven&#x27;t found it in stock at either my grocery store or local drug store, and even in spotty selection at Target.  So after some consternation, I found the Clinical Strength Secret for Sensitive Skin.  It is also unscented, which I prefer.  It glides on smoothly and does a great job with odor.  I can use it right after shaving which was a real problem with the Mitchum, so this is a huge plus.  And buying it here, I&#x27;m able to save money.  Talk about a winning situation!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for years despite the price because it works great for me. however, I always order the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; product but I&#x27;m always sent the regular clinical strength, which doesn&#x27;t make me very happy. it still works good but at times it makes my underarms itchy. plus like many products today, the container is only 3/4 full and costs the same as always, trying to make the consumer think they&#x27;re still getting the same bang for their buck. I find that insulting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this two stars because it does work against heavy sweat and it does not make me break out.  However, it is DEFINITELY NOT FRAGRANCE FREE!  It has a very strong scent that actually turns my stomach, and the one-click dispenser puts out way more stuff than I want to use.</li>
    <li> The box of this product makes it sound like it is better/stronger than regular deodorants/ antiperspirants--\\&quot;clinical strength,\\&quot; \\&quot;prescription strength wetness protection\\&quot; so I expected it to out-perform the deodorant I was already using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test this, I used the Secret Clinical Strength on my left underarm and my usual deodorant (Lady Speed Stick 24/7 Fresh Fusion Gel) under my right arm for about two weeks. Even in cases when I was out in the heat all day or a day when I didn&#x27;t shower, I noticed NO difference between the two products in either wetness protection or odor control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I didn&#x27;t realize until I was ready to write this review and was reviewing all of the claims on the packaging that it is intended only to be used at night. Well I don&#x27;t like to shower at night (my hair doesn&#x27;t sleep well so I end up having to redo it in the morning if I shower at night)...I shower in the morning...and I&#x27;m not about to put deodorant on dirty armpits at bedtime. So, while I did test the product for 2 weeks before writing the review, I did not (I am just finding out now) use the product as directed. Do I think it would make a substantial difference? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving the product 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 is it definitely had some benefits. For one, it is specifically intended for women with sensitive skin and is marked hypoallergenic. The package does not indicate that it is fragrance-free, but it has no discernable fragrance to me, and I am VERY fragrance-sensitive. This gave it a huge advantage over my usual deodorant, which is very heavily fragranced (to me). Also, while this is called a solid, it is not like any solid deodorant I have ever used--I have hated every solid I have tried. It is more of a thick cream than a solid. It goes on very smooth and creamy. I did not care for the applicator because the holes were very large, but I guess perhaps with this product it would clog too easily if they made the holes small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again? Yes. Not necessarily because it WORKS any better than what I already use, but because it has almost no fragrance, is formulated for sensitive skin and goes on smooth./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again?

    <li> Gave this to my son&#x27;s longtime girlfriend to try. She says it works great, although it does leave white marks in the armpits...the reason it has only 4 stars. I didn&#x27;t personally use this because I try to avoid most synthetic chemicals and try to go all organic, or at least all natural, and avoid aluminum at all costs (have 8 great uncles and 1 grandfather...4 moved from Virginia to WA State. The 4 who moved to WA all died from alzheimer&#x27;s while the 5 who remained in Virginia did not...you tell me why...perhaps the Manhattan Project???)</li>
    <li> I dislike unnecessarily scented products, and that includes antiperspirant/deoderants.  This Secret Clinical Strength for Sensitive Skin is very nice, with the absence of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the same brand of regular solid antiperspirant/deoderant for years, Arid XXX, though I&#x27;ve also tried Ban solid.  Both have worked fine for me.  In a month-long test of this new Secret, which is also a combined antiperspirant/deoderant, I used my old regular on one underarm, and this new Secret on the other arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short and sweet conclusion is that the Secret Clinical Strength is just a bit better at keeping me dry.  At the beginning of the day, there was no difference noted, but by the end of the day, I was just a little bit \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; on the Secret side. However, after a 40-minute brisk walk (getting my exercise with a friend) in hot weather, both sides were about the same freshness - such as it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the box calls this a \\&quot;solid\\&quot; deoderant, it is not the same kind of solid that I&#x27;m used to. With Secret, you turn a dial one notch, and one application of cream-like deoderant is pushed out of the applicator. You apply it to one arm, turn the dial one more notch, and apply to the other arm.  However, the cream/solid dries very very fast, and I did not have any wet feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to Secret Clinical Strength is it&#x27;s price. It goes for about $10 a pop.  This is more than twice the price of my usual solid. As my regular solid is 2.7 oz and the Secret I received is 1.6 oz, the price difference is quite large.  In addition, the Secret doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I got about 130 applications, or 65 days worth with two arms/applications done a day.  (If you&#x27;re wondering about timing, I used Secret on both arms after the initial month trial.)  My standard solid lasts longer than that. So that makes the Secret more expensive in that you&#x27;ll have to purchase it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE stars how it works&lt;br /&gt;FOUR stars on the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the bit more protection afforded by Secret is worth it to you, then the price is not an objection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Readerbit more protection afforded by Secret is worth it to you, then the price is not an objection.    Happy Reader</li>
    <li> This is AMAZINGLY effective. Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. The problem is it gave me an itchy rash on one armpit and I can&#x27;t use it  . I&#x27;m trying it in &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; which is what I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude. I know this stuff is for women, but I needed a hypoallergenic deodorant, and there weren&#x27;t many choices available, so I bought this. In doing so, I have gained access to the arcane world of women&#x27;s hygiene and learned much from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, in the world of women&#x27;s hygiene, \\&quot;advanced solid\\&quot; actually means a paste that&#x27;s the consistency of wet spackle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, applicators for women&#x27;s advanced solid deodorant do not work on hairy armpits. They consist of a slick plastic surface with four large holes through which the spackle is squeezed, which then you are supposed to magically spread around. You can spend a good five minutes trying to spread this paste around with the applicator, but it&#x27;s not going anywhere. Yeah, your armpit hairs will get ripped out because they&#x27;ll get stuck in the holes. But to get any kind of coverage, you need to apply a lot of this stuff, dab it all over, then try to work it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my final point: There is very little of this goo to begin with. The applicator ships half full. You&#x27;ll go through this thing in a couple weeks tops. That&#x27;s pretty fast for what this junk costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant itself was slightly less adequate than my previous non-clinical non-hypoallergenic brand, Degree. Which is to say, it was just okay. It didn&#x27;t stop me from sweating any more than regular deodorant. It kept me smelling neutral over the course of a day, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin except for the ripping out of the hairs, which stopped when I stopped trying to use the applicator as an applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I never need a hypoallergenic deodorant again. If I do, it won&#x27;t be this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product and cannot live without it. No other product even comes close- and for such a great price on Amazon.com is even better. I have very sensitive skin and this product is advertised as hypoallergenic and I have never had a problem with it whereas I have had problems with other deodorants marked hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> I have tried several clinical strength items. This one was okay, nothing I would get again. I did the job but it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long and other anti perspiration also it took a while to dry. This may have only been me as it seems that others have had great success. Worth a shot to try if you are looking for something to do the job just may not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater but I do have very sensitive skin so I was skeptical about this \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; antiperspirant. There wasn&#x27;t a huge difference to me in the way that this worked compared to all the other products out there that say they&#x27;re clinical strength, and if you&#x27;re not a heavy sweater then the regular stuff would work just as well also. My problem with other products though is that I would tend to start itching under my arms so I would buy the sensitive version of most products. This actually worked. Not sure what they put in there but I was able to use it an entire day without any negative effects. Would I buy it at this price, probably not. I&#x27;ll use the sensitive version of their regular product and get as good protection.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this deodorant (as we both have really sensitive skin) and this is hard to find in our local Walmart (which is an hour away from where we live). It&#x27;s a plus that I get it automatically from Subscribe and Save and is considerably cheaper!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive underarms and this keeps me dry and keeps my sensitive skin from getting huge rashes! Double win.</li>
    <li> Works, but leaves white marks. I&#x27;ve since switched to something that leaves no trace.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It works and I&#x27;m not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Great price for good deodorant.</li>
    <li> this did not keep the odor away, i was not doing strenuous activity, just going to work, walking around at work and going home. what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this deodorant. It is so expensive in stores. This is a great, easy way to get it for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This year I got stinkiest and no other deodorant seemed to help. Gave this a try and it worked! It is difficult to get it off in the shower so I have since had to buy a body scrub to help remove it, but hey better that than to stink.</li>
    <li> I have had this product auto-shipped for years. The only antiperspirant/deodorant that has ever worked for me over the long haul through stressful situations and physical exertion.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant that i don&#x27;t react too. Thanks for keeping me smelling good.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve liked this a lot and think it&#x27;s worth the extra money. It kept me confident on vacation in Africa this summer and I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
    <li> Doesnt do what i needed to do...disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> My teenager is a clean kid, but nothing stopped the odor like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely tried my fair share of deodorants, from Mitchum to Degree and even Old Spice Fiji (thinking men&#x27;s deodorant will work because it would be stronger). Tried this, and it definitely works, probably also because it is scentless (I find that I tend to smell worse with scented deodorants).  I sometimes feel a bit self-conscious and apply a swipe of normal deodorant in the morning anyway, but I really don&#x27;t have to with this and I just do it out of habit. This deodorant is definitely a keeper. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the sensitive skin, waterproof, light and fresh, and marathon versions of the Secret Clinical and I love all of them. However, the only issue I have is the price of 7 dollars each (at least, it&#x27;s 7 dollars here in Philadelphia, PA where I live). Despite the price, it really holds the sweat (it would always stain my clothes) and the smell. I get the best results after I&#x27;ve shaved with a 5-blade razor and I use EOS shaving cream to make sure I get the best shave dry. I do have issues with the turning knob at the bottom of some of my deodorants, hopefully it&#x27;ll be easier to use someday. Perhaps Secret can alter it in the future? Since I&#x27;m a recent college grad, I find the 7 dollars is expensive for a deodorant but I try to get 2-packs from amazon and stock up. I think I have 5 in my medicine drawer. I switch between Waterproof and sensitive skin the most, I prefer Secret than Dove because I used Dove&#x27;s deodorant&#x27;s when they first came out, and they did nothing for me. I&#x27;ve even used men&#x27;s deodorants, but I felt that the scent of the deodorant was too overpowering for me. Thank God for Secret Clinical Protection, I&#x27;ve even gotten my aunt and grandmother hooked because our family perspires more in the underarm area. One warning though, you really have to scrub it off in the shower or bath...it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
    <li> the only deodorant that keeps me dry and stink free under my arms. Apply it after you put a shirt o because it can rub off on your shirt if it has just been applied.&lt;br /&gt;the solid is great, too.</li>
    <li> It works really well to preventing underarm odor and wetness. The package came on time and in great condition. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> We used this for an overseas trip in heat, where you need to try to preserve your clothes.  It worked great in every way!  I prefer the unscented but the scents are not bad.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well. No underarm irritation and no strong smell. First time we tried it and are very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda weird to write a review about deodorant but this time I&#x27;m going out on a limb because this just happens to be the ONLY deodorant I buy.  I have tried just about all of them over the years and never felt like I was &amp;#34;odor-free&amp;#34;.  I can honestly say that this product does work!  I was uneasy at first about putting this on at night before bedtime but I got used to it and it does not seem as effective if you put it on in the morning (although once in a while I forget to do it at night and I&#x27;ll still use it in the morning).  I am amazed at how this really prevents wetness and I kid you not... even by the end of the day I do not smell.  Hallelujah!  I personally only get the fragrance free/sensitive skin formula because I hate those stinky fragrances they use on deodorants.  If you have been looking for something that really stops wetness and odor - look no further.</li>
    <li> Strong enough for the 18 hour day, no irritation.  Benign scent.  Does not seem to stain clothing.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It feels nice going on and it really works. The best part is that there&#x27;s no scent so my deodorant and perfume don&#x27;t compete.</li>
    <li> I buy this deodorant for my sister and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> My whole family has been using this deodorant for years...from my 48 year old hubby to my 78 year old mom.....unscented, non -irritating and amazingly effective in our hot Atlanta weather.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with body odor since I was a 7 year old little girl. My mother gave me my first anti-perspirant/deodorant product then not knowing, as most didn&#x27;t, it was very toxic. The active ingredient is normally some form of aluminum- in this product, Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Glycine shows strong evidence of human neurotoxicity as well as other serious illnesses (potentially cancer, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease). Along with that, every day these products plug our pores causing toxins to stay our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;Please, do not use this!&lt;br /&gt;From my own experience, I&#x27;ve used actual prescription deodorant with a high percentage of aluminum-based compounds- it didn&#x27;t even work compared to what I use now. I was considering any and every way of preventing body odor- no matter the cost. But I found the most effective to be a natural solution!&lt;br /&gt;INSTEAD, I use coconut oil right out of the jar, rub it in and add a few drops of bacteria-fighting essential oil (tea tree oil) and I am good all day. Why coconut oil and essential oils? They are anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. Remember, it&#x27;s the bacteria- not the sweat- that&#x27;s the body odor culprit. Sometimes I reapply the essential oil if I&#x27;m really active later in the day and absolutely no odor. I&#x27;m so happy :)&lt;br /&gt;We need these products off the shelves. Stop using toxic antiperspirant/deodorant- they are hurting us!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have solved the problem of having to put up with allergic itching when I wanted to keep myself dry. Secret&#x27;s hypoallergenic version of their product does the trick nicely for me. It took a little bit to get used to the more liquid form of the product, but now that I&#x27;ve gotten the knack of it, I like it very well.</li>
    <li> Great unscented product...it has no scent and it works!</li>
    <li> When I first started using Secret Clinical Strength, I bought a product (numerous times) that was labelled &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; but NOT labelled as &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;. I recently found an old one I still have kicking around, and sure-enough, on the list of ingredients is a masking fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved, loved, LOVED that deodorant. &amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34; deodorants always are super smelly. They might not smell like armpit or like flowers, but there is a smell...and whenever I wear them (I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands) it&#x27;s like the smell haunts me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was absolutely delighted to find a deodorant that actually didn&#x27;t smell. Whenever I&#x27;d sniff my pits, if I smelled anything at all, it just smelled like me. Not offensively body-odery me...but just a hint of my normal human smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I noticed that where that deodorant was previously stocked on the shelf, was now a similar-looking product that was labelled &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34; Ironically, this newer version has more of a smell to it, which has taken this from being the perfect deodorant to simply being the least-bad option I&#x27;ve found on the market. Additionally, the newer kind has some weird problem with drying out. Even though I use it every day, a crust forms quickly on the top, which clogs the vents through which the deodorant comes up. Dried bits on the surface are abrasive to my underarms, and I spend a silly amount of time trying to unclog the darn thing each morning. (note: at first, I thought maybe I just had a weird one, but I&#x27;ve had the same issue with several of the same product that I&#x27;ve used over the past few months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems that the wetness protection has diminished...but perhaps my memory is just rosy, or the current weather more challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now looking for a source of the old version to stock up on because I really miss my un-smelly &amp;#34;fragranced&amp;#34; version of the sensitive Secret Clinical Strength deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY deodorant that protects me all day long.  I work ten hours shift, and I need to feel assure that I am dry and odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This solves both problem.  It is the only product I use for underarm protection!!!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is a gigantic waste of money. Sure, it works, but I would say that the $4 that you spend on each ounce could go into a different deodorant that works just as well. I have NO idea why they call it a &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; when in reality it has an annoying paste-like consistency. The picture shown here is different from the real product because the deodorant itself is not in stick-form. Oh, and guess what? According to the product, for full protection, you must apply TWO clicks&#x27; worth under each arm every night. That means if you take a shower in the morning, then you will likely have to reapply. This means that you would end up spending over $8 for each ounce. As you can see, this product is simply not worth the pricetag, and if this product were cheaper then I may have recommended it. However, at this price I simply cannot, and I would advise you to just stay away from this product and try out another one such as Dry Idea. There absolutely has to be a cheaper solution than this.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product/transaction. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My armpits decided out of no where that they were allergic to any deoderant I wanted to try out. I had been using the same stuff for years but I just had an outbreak. Then I decided to try this deoderant because it sounded too good to be true. I love this so much I cleared up right away, I never smell it, and I never stink! It works like a charm and I don&#x27;t even use that much of it! I even have some days when I forget to put it on and I don&#x27;t stink all day because this stuff lasts so long. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, my underarms got dark.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant!  No more sticky situations in the summer.  Goes on easily and works well.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried, and does not have a strong scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday.  Rather, I use it on particularly hot days, days that I know are going to be really long (i.e. travel involving planes), and on days when I wear more form-fitting shirts.  Strange, yes, but I&#x27;ve found that the more tailored the shirt, the more I sweat or perhaps I just notice it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people who hate perfume.  It may smell great to you, but not necessarily the person who has to sit next to you.  So I love that this doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  The first one I used was too smelly that I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I don&#x27;t love about this is that it takes a while for it to dry.  I never read the directions and use this in the morning when I&#x27;m usually rushed.  I have to make sure it&#x27;s really, really dry before putting a top over my head, otherwise, I end up with white streaks on my clothes where it got caught under my arms.  I also dislike how difficult it is to wash this off.  Which, is probably a sign of its staying power, but I do find it hard to wash off.  In fact, despite several passes with the washcloth and plain soap, I know that I haven&#x27;t gotten it all off.  It&#x27;s usually not too much of a problem since I don&#x27;t use this everyday.  If I did, then I would worry about all the build-up because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever managed to really wash it off.</li>
    <li> I was struggling to find a deodorant for sensitive skin which didn&#x27;t further irritate my skin after shaving.  Even the unscented, supposedly moisturizing ones from Dove caused issues for me - burning, eczema, itchiness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; that this offers, but it&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of skin reaction.  For those who are looking for completely fragrance-free deodorant, this one does list a \\&quot;masking fragrance\\&quot; (it smells very faintly like cucumber).  However, I found that even completely fragrance-free deodorants caused issues for me, while this one definitely does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant recommends application at night (likely because if you use the recommended amount - 1 click per underarm - that&#x27;s a lot of product).  However, I use less than recommended (again, not needing the clinical strength) - I click the wheel once and apply half of what&#x27;s dispensed to each armpit.  I still find it lasts for quite a while (over 24 hours), making it almost *too* good!</li>
    <li> This is m absolute all time favorite skin safe deodorant.  No fragrance, works really well, and perfect for people with sensitive skin. This is also a Great Way to buy it... anytime I Don&#x27;t go into a store just to buy one product I save $$.  Love having it delivered regularly.</li>
    <li> I always used clinical strength deodorant.. and let me tell you they are expensive. I bought these because I have sensitive skin and it was cheaper then when I bought it at the drug store. I usually spend 8-10 dollars in the drugstore for one.. so this is a steal. (especially when they have coupons!)</li>
    <li> OK - this is a little embarrassing.  Maybe I&#x27;m a little funkier than the average woman.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t mean funky in a good way.  I used to purchase scented deodorant - typically powder scent.  And by the end of the day, my pits reeked.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why, but I soldiered on, convinced that I just needed stronger scented deodorant.  When these clinical strength deodorants started to be sold, I didn&#x27;t hesitate.  I continued to purchase the powder scent.  Even though I didn&#x27;t noticeably sweat, I still smelled!  One time, the drugstore was out of the powder scent, so I purchased the fragrance-free sensitive skin version.  My world changed - no more odor!  I don&#x27;t know what my problem is - maybe different body chemistry reacts differently to various smells.  Whatever the case, I will no longer used scented products under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes out of the container in a creamy, white formation.  Two clicks is sufficient for me.  A little rubbing gets the whiteness to fade, although it is still capable of getting on your clothes.  This is an acceptable trade-off for a product that works so well.  I&#x27;ve used lots of deodorants/anti-perspirants, and from a sweat-stopping perspective, Secret Clinical is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moWIUGO3BHZOJ6]]The packaging states, \\&quot;apply two clicks of product to underarms at bedtime.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for those of us who shower in the morning, do we apply more? Or use another deodorant in addition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the description clearly states that this is 1.6 ounces. I was just taken back as to how little product there is - as you can see in my video. I opened the package, raised the product to the top, and used it once. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot there and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to buy another very soon - especially if I&#x27;m applying it twice a day.  ??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note - the Sensitive Skin Hypoallergenic product contains a masking fragrance.  I doubt I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Good product and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin</li>
    <li> Does not make me itch like other deodorants.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a bit crystallized--old merchandise??</li>
    <li> This product only makes me itch a very little bit and is much better than anything else I have found.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive to deodorant (makes me itch). This is the best I&#x27;ve found. AND IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I am allergic to most antiperspirant and was afraid to try something new, however, Almay left me no choice when they stopped making it.  I have no problems with this and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Work issues prompted renewed &amp;#34;stress sweat&amp;#34;.  The good antipers. I used for years with no problems was no longer working a couple hours into my shift.  I remembered using this product a few years ago for the same issue and it worked great!!  I still had a smidge left of the product and put it to work.  I was no longer burning through my protection.  I found that it stayed active through the night and into the next day even though I would shower as usual.  Hope they never change the formula or quit making it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I didn&#x27;t even know I needed a clinical strength until I got a free sample of the regular kind in our toilet paper from Costco.  I mean, I was never over-stinky, but I did have damp under-arms, and thought that&#x27;s just the way it was.  This stuff works amazingly, for over 24 hours.  I love that the sensitive skin version doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin even after  I&#x27;ve just shaved.  Plus, I can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price locally at stores, so Hooray for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Well, this product was a great surprise. I read so many good reviews on it that I decided to give it a try, even thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work for me... I come from (and live in) a tropical country. I have a very, very sensitive nose, and I have always noticed any smell or scent around me. Sensitivity to smells is one of the causes of migraine headaches I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager. Not always do people notice the smells as I do, and some of them even call me crazy for thinking I have BO. Well, I&#x27;ve tried almost all deodorants and antiperspirants anybody prescribed or indicated as being good for body odor, including crazy homemade stuff, like spreading on my underarms alcohol and talc; bicarbonate; half a lime; and others I can&#x27;t even remember. Well, for the first time I can say a deodorant really works for me; I can work all day and still come back home not sensing any odor. It is such an achievement and such a relief! Good luck new buyers!</li>
    <li> I tried this deodorant after the manufacturer changed the formula on my previous brand.  Unfortunately, I have learned that not all \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products are truly such - and this is one of those.  After buying it, I noticed that the label states \\&quot;masking fragrance\\&quot;, and indeed this deodorant has a very faint (not unpleasant) fragrance.  It is discernible if you live in an \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; environment, as I largely try to do due to significant allergies to perfumes and fragrances.  Despite the masking fragrance, I gave it a try as the product advertised that it was \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; and the scent was quite faint.  Unfortunately, it did set off my fragrance allergies, so it has been tossed after one use.  This was an expensive experiment.  As another user noted, it was difficult to wash this product off and I had to really scrub to remove it.  I am posting this to forewarn those with fragrance allergies to be careful with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like scented deodorant but this light scent is just right. This deodorant works so well. I can&#x27;t use anything else now that I have tried the Secret clinical strength. My friends all say it is amazing too. Please, Secret, don&#x27;t ever discontinue this line. I only wish it came in a bigger size that lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I only buy clinical strength and it continues to work for me; it usually keeps odors under control; however, it will transfer some of its odor to clothes and leave a white residue, which washes out.</li>
    <li> not as strong as I had hoped</li>
    <li> Expensive, but no allergic reactions!</li>
    <li> For some reason (no matter how cute I try to be), I have always had an underarm sweat problem. I sweat if I&#x27;m too cold, too hot, etc. This product has been wonderful! I tried a clinical strength product before and I broke out in a HORRIBLE rash. No bueno. This product is VERY gentle AND scent free. I use it right after I get out of the shower. And then, just to be safe, I top it off with a smidge of Secret invisible solid. Just for kicks. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review about deodorant.  But this stuff is great; its a life saver!  I don&#x27;t even sweat a ton, but most deodorants I have used over the years I found in the end didn&#x27;t help much.  This stuff is amazing and now I NEVER have sweat marks! I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> Love the Clinical Strength</li>
    <li> I works and never irritates my skin.</li>
