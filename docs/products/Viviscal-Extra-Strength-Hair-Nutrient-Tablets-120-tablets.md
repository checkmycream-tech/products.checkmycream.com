    <li> For years I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to grow just past my shoulders. It would frizz and fray, then break off. From August of 2014 to December 2014, I had about 1 1/4 inch of hair growth, and my hair is healthier. It&#x27;s getting down to the middle of my back now and I see so much less breakage. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it really does stop hair thinning now yo9u must have some hair to begin with it is not a cure for alopecia.  I reorder it all the the time and try not to ever be without it.</li>
    <li> A VERY NEEDED PRODUCT BY ME. THIS PRODUCT DOES IT&#x27;S JOB.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair. Even though I have been taking it religiously.</li>
    <li> my hair has never looked so healthy and long. I damaged my hair with coloring it and it was in bad shape. Thes vitamins real do what they say they will do. My hair is long and sexy.</li>
    <li> This product made sick to my stomach and made me very shaky.</li>
    <li> Hair still getting thin on top.  But I don&#x27;t expect miracles.  Have a leaf for hair strips?</li>
    <li> It is hard to tell the day to day progress, but I think that overall, I am not loosing more hair.  There are certain areas such as my temples that still are problematic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and WOW - it&#x27;s actually weird to run fingers through hair and know it feels ..well-like more hair&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but this truly does work - I have told my friends about this product and they GOTTA get some ! Cause I&#x27;m not sharing ;)</li>
    <li> I am trying this for my hair growth.  I will wait for results</li>
    <li> At first I was very skeptical to try this. 6 months seemed like a long commitment to even see it this product worked. However I decided to try it anyway. Before my hair was thin and dull and didn&#x27;t grow.. At all! My nails were weak and broke a lot. 7 months after taking viviscal I feel like a new person. My hair is growing like crazy! I used to dye my roots once every two months. I now have to dye them twice a month! Huge difference. Also it is much thicker and so shiny! My nails grow really fast and are very strong. I have had tons of people ask if I&#x27;m wearing acrylics! And last but not least my eyelashes. They have grown longer and gotten thicker. They look amazing. Overall this is worth the money and the time spent. I call it my miracle pill.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the ones I bought out of the store.</li>
    <li> I just began using this product on January 2015.</li>
    <li> I used this for 6 months straight and didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all :(</li>
    <li> Last 2 months bad imitation of Viviscal, do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been taking the tablets for about 3 weeks and I have noticed a reduction in shedding.  That is half the hair loss battle for me.  I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any regrowth yet, but again, it has only been 3 weeks.  I would recommend, it has helped me so far and for the price it is surely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I will never give up these tablets.  I can see a difference when I run out of them.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!! As far as I can tell my hair is growing like a weed. Oh and my nails are great too!</li>
    <li> Not sure yet, it says it takes 3 mos so we will see. More to come!</li>
    <li> These work GREAT. My hair stylist can&#x27;t believe how my hair grows.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Will order again from them soon.</li>
    <li> Great quality &amp; fast delivery! We are very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> fI habe been taking Viviscal for 4 months and I am noticing that my hair is stronger and healthier. My hairdresser tells me she can see and feel the difference. I would recommend it to anyone who is battling with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 1 month so far my hair seems stronger without much sheading and nails seem stronger! Can&#x27;t wait till a few more months of use!</li>
    <li> Slow process for hair growth but it is beginning to work after four months of use.</li>
    <li> Its been 3 weeks an I am seeing a difference already... my stylist brought it my attention too.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have only been taking Vivascal for a little more than a week but I believe I am already seeming improvement in less hair fallout.  That could be coincidental as It is probably too soon to really tell if the product is effective.  I give Viviscal 4 stars because of the price.  Seems costly but if it works I will be happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Viviscal for years. Whenever I want to grow my hair out, this is my go to product. It gives me faster growth than just taking vitamins, and I love the results!</li>
    <li> Due to illness I had significant hair loss. I&#x27;m well now and after 1 month the results are spectacular! My confidence is growing - I not only feel well, I&#x27;m starting to look well.</li>
