      <li>It goes on so smoothly and gives me a dewy but not oily finish!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a medium coverage BB cream at most.</li>

      <li>I am absolutely in love with this cream.</li>
      <li>Ok so I read an article about all of the BB Creams out there and this one caught my eye.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this item.  </li>
      <li>I personally love this product, it has SPF27</li>
      <li>This is a great light foundation for summer, it definitly requires a powder finish but the color is very versitle.</li>
      <li>this one seems a bit watery when I open it, but it blends beautifully using a makeup sponge.</li>
      <li>This is also great if you don&#x27;t feel like applying foundation because it&#x27;s light and feels like it&#x27;s barely there.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as light as a tinted moisturizer though.</li>
      <li>It definitely feels hydrating on my skin and the sunscreen component is great.</li>
      <li>The coverage is light, but you can build it up by putting on two coats, I like to keep mine to one, because my skin isn&#x27;t acne prone.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this for people who want light coverage without drying out their skin.</li>
      <li>When shaken this BB Cream comes out as a light mousse, perfect for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>The coverage is light and the formula is really smooth, and SUPER hydrating without being at all oily.  </li>

      <li>I love that it provides great coverage without being so heavy.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so far the best bb cream for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>If you have a dry skin and want something to tone your skin and look natural, this is a wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>you want a good coverage, this is clearly not a BB cream to get.  </li>
      <li>much sooner then they anticipated which was a huge bonus.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite bb cream so far.</li>
      <li>This is effective and natural looking without adding too much coverage.  </li>
      <li>I just ordered this BB cream, it took a while to come but was well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>This packaging pictured is old, but the new one is just as cute!</li>
      <li>It came right on time, so no problems there and</li>
      <li>the price is about right.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light coverage, but can&#x27;t easily be built if necessary.</li>
      <li>I just HOPE it doesn&#x27;t have whitening agents like a lot of asian cosmetics, but so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>However, it did blend slight skin blemishes fairly well.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I prefer having my actual skin show through, because it looks far more natural.</li>
      <li>I originally thought it&#x27;d be too light (I have lightly-tanned skin), but it goes on sheer.</li>
      <li>First it came well before the stated shipment time.  </li>
      <li>This feels really good on your skin and gives the coverage I like for everyday work or play.</li>
      <li>My skin color is usually pretty light, although I do get a little more color during the summertime.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for light coverage and just a fantastic overall BB cream.</li>
      <li>but I really like it is a light coverage not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>This BB cream pretty much follows me throughout the season, though I might be pushing it when I have a tan.</li>
      <li>at first I thought that was because I had only put on a light layer</li>
      <li>Also, it has a fairly strong fragrance which I personally don&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>Okay, this has been my BB cream of choice for the past two years, which is pretty incredible because I spent the last four years before</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, not too heavy on the face and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t cover very well (like the Misha BB cream.)</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it, but I don&#x27;t mind makeup products with a scent to it.</li>
      <li>My skin is medium toned but this looked really chalky.</li>
      <li>I really like the cooling effect it gives while rubbing it on my face.</li>
      <li>The first thing is, sometimes when I first open it, I&#x27;ll get a stream of water before any BB cream comes out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other bb creams and this by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the skin79 hot pink, skin79 oriental gold plus, and tony moly goddess aura and this bb cream is definitely the most natural looking and feeling.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice delicate smell to it.</li>
      <li>Relatively new to using bb</li>
      <li>After I put this on my face, I apply a light layer of Bare Minerals loose face powder</li>
      <li>I like using this mixed in with my foundation to give me a little more moisture and coverage.</li>
      <li>Most BB creams that claim they are moisturizing were still too dry, mostly due to the matte finish they provide.</li>
      <li>Also, you&#x27;ll definitely need to set this with a powder because it has a very dewy finish to it.</li>
      <li>It covers up minor spots and scars pretty well while evening out your skin tone.</li>
      <li>it allows for the natural pinks in my skin to come through and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least a couple dozen different BB creams, and with the exception of one that I can&#x27;t find anywhere outside of Hong Kong, they&#x27;ve all been kind of lackluster compared to Lioele Water Drop BB</li>
      <li>What I was searching for: light coverage, very moisturizing, sun protection, and a dewy finish for my very dry, very pale skin.</li>
      <li>but after 3 hours in direct sunlight with no sunscreen, my face the next morning didn&#x27;t have a hint of sunburn.</li>
      <li>Awhile back I bought about 12 different samples of various bb creams, and this was the clear winner for me.</li>
      <li>Second, I&#x27;ve noticed that with certain moisturizers, the BB cream will gunk up a little bit on my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok so I read an article about all of the BB Creams out there and this one caught my eye. I wore it on my 4 hour drive to the beach and found that in the car, it wasn&#x27;t rubbing off on my clothes and it wasn&#x27;t making my face feel sticky like some other products. it allows for the natural pinks in my skin to come through and at first I thought that was because I had only put on a light layer but after 3 hours in direct sunlight with no sunscreen, my face the next morning didn&#x27;t have a hint of sunburn. My arms on the other hand... Let&#x27;s put it this way, I have very fair skin and I NEVER avoid a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try not to use it too often because it did take a little bit of time to arrive but much sooner then they anticipated which was a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> The coverage of this product was very light. I ended up buying Etude House Baby Skin Base in green to wear under this BB cream. It felt like wearing just sunscreeen. However, it did blend slight skin blemishes fairly well. I&#x27;ll try to upload pictures later.</li>
    <li> This BB cream was disappointing.  My skin is medium toned but this looked really chalky. Also, it has a fairly strong fragrance which I personally don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that this doesn&#x27;t have a lot of coverage. If you have scarring or a couple redish pimples here and there...It won&#x27;t cover very well (like the Misha BB cream.) So if you&#x27;re looking for a thicker coverage, this isn&#x27;t the product you&#x27;re looking for. This product has a lighter coverage. It isn&#x27;t as light as a tinted moisturizer though. Also, you&#x27;ll definitely need to set this with a powder because it has a very dewy finish to it. I like using this mixed in with my foundation to give me a little more moisture and coverage. This is also great if you don&#x27;t feel like applying foundation because it&#x27;s light and feels like it&#x27;s barely there. This BB cream has sort of a scent. I can&#x27;t really describe it, but I don&#x27;t mind makeup products with a scent to it. Well I hope this review was helpful for those looking to buy it (:</li>
    <li> This is a great light foundation for summer, it definitly requires a powder finish but the color is very versitle.</li>
    <li> This brightens up my skin, even out my skin tone, and hydrated my skin. It really does feel incredibly cooling when applying. It also has a nice delicate smell to it. As a lazy girl when it comes to makeup, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was not Shure I would have liked it before I bought it. I heard mixed reviews but I really like it is a light coverage not heavy at all. I really like the cooling effect it gives while rubbing it on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this item.  First it came well before the stated shipment time.  I love that it provides great coverage without being so heavy.  I would definitely recommend this product to someone else.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bb cream so far. I&#x27;ve tried the skin79 hot pink, skin79 oriental gold plus, and tony moly goddess aura and this bb cream is definitely the most natural looking and feeling. It is very light and evens out the skin tone well. I would recommend this for people who want light coverage without drying out their skin.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this cream at the airport in Korea for me try. I am absolutely in love with this cream. It&#x27;s light, not too heavy on the face and goes on smoothly. I&#x27;ve tried other bb creams and this by far my favorite. After I put this on my face, I apply a light layer of Bare Minerals loose face powder and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Okay, this has been my BB cream of choice for the past two years, which is pretty incredible because I spent the last four years before that being completely unable to commit to one. I&#x27;ve tried at least a couple dozen different BB creams, and with the exception of one that I can&#x27;t find anywhere outside of Hong Kong, they&#x27;ve all been kind of lackluster compared to Lioele Water Drop BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a medium coverage BB cream at most.

The BB cream feels really great on, too, because it&#x27;s very light and pretty moisturizing. My skin color is usually pretty light, although I do get a little more color during the summertime. This BB cream pretty much follows me throughout the season, though I might be pushing it when I have a tan. Oh, and the finish on this is dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually do have a few complaints about this BB cream. The first thing is, sometimes when I first open it, I&#x27;ll get a stream of water before any BB cream comes out. It&#x27;s like when you get that first annoying squirt of ketchup water before the real stuff. Not an issue unless I am putting makeup on in the car and the water just gets everywhere. Second, I&#x27;ve noticed that with certain moisturizers, the BB cream will gunk up a little bit on my skin. From my experience so far, this is usually the case with heavier creams. Not sure if this is due to a certain ingredient or something. To fix that problem, I usually just put on my moisturizer 10-15 minutes before my makeup, and that seems to be enough time for the moisturizer to fully absorb and not interfere with the BB cream.</li>
    <li> i have tried many bb creams. Some have ben &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and some had outright NEGATIVE effects, causing cystic boils and blemishes that took weeks to recover.  (name brand, expensive)  This product does what it claims. Coverage is light and creamy and is effective in moisturizing and &amp;#34;lightly&amp;#34; covering imperfections.  I usually use a medium color in other products.  This is effective and natural looking without adding too much coverage.  Gave it a 4 out of 5 simply for the color, hoping i can still use it during summer months.</li>
    <li> SHAKE BEFORE USE! Cannot stress this enough. You must shake thoroughly before every use to get the proper affect. If you don&#x27;t shake the water comes out before the color and all you get is a mess. When shaken this BB Cream comes out as a light mousse, perfect for everyday wear. I personally love this product, it has SPF27 and it matches my skin perfectly (NC15/20) without any grey cast. It&#x27;s light coverage, but can&#x27;t easily be built if necessary. The finish is dewey, but doesn&#x27;t leave me looking greasy, even in humidity.</li>
    <li> Relatively new to using bb cream-- this one seems a bit watery when I open it, but it blends beautifully using a makeup sponge. I originally thought it&#x27;d be too light (I have lightly-tanned skin), but it goes on sheer. Plus it&#x27;s moisturizing!</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is simply magical! It goes on flawlessly and leaves my skin feeling dewy and soft! I would reccomend this Cream to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this BB cream, it took a while to come but was well worth the wait. It goes on so smoothly and gives me a dewy but not oily finish! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for light coverage and just a fantastic overall BB cream. Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Awhile back I bought about 12 different samples of various bb creams, and this was the clear winner for me. What I was searching for: light coverage, very moisturizing, sun protection, and a dewy finish for my very dry, very pale skin. This also tones down the rosiness of my complexion just a bit, which I like. If this is your quest as well, go ahead and get this stuff. Most BB creams that claim they are moisturizing were still too dry, mostly due to the matte finish they provide. Those always made me look flakey and chalky. This is not a matte finish, so if you have oily skin or want a matte finish, look for something else.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I like using it on days when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing foundation. It definitely feels hydrating on my skin and the sunscreen component is great.</li>
    <li> If you have a dry skin and want something to tone your skin and look natural, this is a wonderful product.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and very light.  It will make your complexion look better without looking like you have any makeup on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want a good coverage, this is clearly not a BB cream to get.  Also, if you have oily skin/clogged pores, this will actually bring out your pores on your nose if they&#x27;re oily. So be careful.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this bb cream.  However, all the good reviews and beautiful packaging won me over, so I ordered it.  It came right on time, so no problems there and the price is about right.  This packaging pictured is old, but the new one is just as cute! (I&#x27;ll put up a photo).  The coverage is light and the formula is really smooth, and SUPER hydrating without being at all oily.  It also smells great.  The coverage is light, but you can build it up by putting on two coats, I like to keep mine to one, because my skin isn&#x27;t acne prone.  I love it, it&#x27;s so far the best bb cream for my dry skin.  I just HOPE it doesn&#x27;t have whitening agents like a lot of asian cosmetics, but so far, so good.  Also, with an SPF of 27, it makes me feel like I am fighting against skin damage.</li>
    <li> This feels really good on your skin and gives the coverage I like for everyday work or play. Just love it!</li>
