      <li>This brush is perfect for its intended purpose: distributing the natural oil on your scalp throughout your hair.</li>
      <li>I compared the amount of static to the brush I currently own, which needs to be replaced.  </li>

      <li>This brush is okay, but I wish it had stiffer bristles.  </li>

      <li>I love this brush.</li>

      <li>Been using these brushes for more years one can count.</li>
      <li>more can you say?  </li>
      <li>Expect many years of use from this brush.</li>
      <li>The Fuller brush creates quite a bit of static electricity.  </li>
      <li>What I like most about this brush is that it leaves your hair feeling silky and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I love being able to brush through my hair with the boar bristles;&lt;br /&gt;nylon</li>
      <li>I had a brush like this for many many years.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it</li>
      <li>so I was able to pry it out of his hands without a fight.</li>
      <li>but this brush is more than satisfactory.  </li>
      <li>So be sure to buy for your hair type.</li>
      <li>So much static electricity that I cannot use the brush.  </li>
      <li>I used it 3 times and a dozen or more bristles would fall out each time scattering on the bathroom counter and the floor.  </li>
      <li>ben using this type of brush many many years</li>
      <li>They last forever and make your hair beautiful -- what more can I say, except I love mine.  </li>

      <li>I have had this design Fuller brush before and liked it very much.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine: cleans up easily, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
      <li>They are as good today as when they were new.</li>
      <li>Fuller brushes are fine tools.  </li>

      <li>Thanks so much for the great service .</li>
      <li>I end up with smooth shiny hair.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective, massages without scratching.</li>
      <li>This brush is nice for straight hair, I think.  </li>
      <li>Mom loves it and in happy to give an 82 y/o the same quality they remember in America.</li>
      <li>Fantastic</li>
      <li>This brush grabs my bangs and holds them securely while I blowdry.</li>
      <li>Perfect for just plain brushing or for styling.  </li>
      <li>I own a older version of this brush that is far superior.</li>
      <li>After reviewing a few I found on Amazon, which I was thrilled about, and asking my aging mother who had given me my first one, which over 4 moves is misplaced, she recommened the Fuller Brush Co, as most of us have heard of them, as they have been in business for so many years - be assured the product I bought would lead me to believe their great reputation is still as good as ever!</li>
      <li>, I do not notice it pulling out alot of extra hairs, which is nice!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been looking for a brush like this for years I had one that I got from Avon BUT they no longer have them.&lt;br /&gt;All the stores have are the plastic vent brushes SO if you want to really brush your hair this one is for you.</li>
    <li> I just love my Fuller brush! Hair brush! Try it! You&#x27;ll love it I love the fact it has natural bBore Bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.K Tucson:</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are just the right amount of stiffness to get through my very full head of shoulder length hair.  I was excite to own a Fuller Brush  Big problem -the brush creates quite a large amount of static electricity.  I compared the amount of static to the brush I currently own, which needs to be replaced.  My brush (which has natural bristles and a wooden handle) creates no static electricity EVER.  The Fuller brush creates quite a bit of static electricity.  So much static electricity that I cannot use the brush.  The only thing I can imagine is the amount of static electricity is creates is because the Fuller brush appears to have a plastic handle, rather than a wooden one.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After checking the Fuller Brush website, I see the handle is, in fact plastic.  That information should have been included in Amazon&#x27;s description.  I would never buy a brush with a plastic handle - that is a recipe for static!  I am now stuck with a hairbrush I cannot use.  The only reason I gave this brush two stars, rather than one, is because the bristles are nice and stiff, which was another concern when purchasing.</li>
    <li> I have used this fuller brush style for almost 50 years. They are wonderful! I replace it when needed. Each one has lasted years and years. Maintain by regularly cleaning.</li>
    <li> Have been using one of these for at least 20yrs or more before replacing it.They really last a super long time.Would highly reccommend it to everyone.Love this product and how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairbrush for my granddaughter.  I actually have 2 brushes exactly like this one and love them.  She had borrowed my hairbrush while I was visiting her and her family,  in Texas.  She has very long hair and really liked the brush.  It will be a present to her when she comes to visit us and stay a week this summer.</li>
    <li> Perfect for just plain brushing or for styling.  Very lightweight.</li>
    <li> The bristles in this brush were so limp that I couldn&#x27;t get them to go through my hair. also, the bristles kept shedding, A real diappointment!&lt;br /&gt;I finally threw it away.</li>
    <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t long or stiff enough that it reaches your scalp or go through your hair.  I have very short hair and medium thickness.  It sure is not like the brushes used to be when you brushed your hair 100 times a night.  This brush just goes over the top of your hair and not through it.</li>
    <li> This replaced my previous Fuller brush which lasted at least 15 years before the handle broke.  I had the nylon bristle brush but over the years my hair has gotten grayer and thinner so decided to try the natural bristles.  It&#x27;s perfect for my needs but I don&#x27;t think someone with long, course or very thick hair would like it as it may not go through that type of hair. I expect this will last me at least another 15 years.</li>
    <li> I have owned this same brush for 50 some years and it is still as perfect as it was the day I purchased it.  Fuller brushes make your hair shine.  I can truly say I have never found another brush to compare with a Fuller Brush.  They last forever and make your hair beautiful -- what more can I say, except I love mine.  I just purchased three more of this same brush to give to my children and also, have an additional back-up for me.  I highly recommend Fuller Brushes to anyone who wants their hair to be lustrous and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered - I received a flat brush with slight concavity that seems to be designed to form to a head but I was hoping for a half round brush to use for styling.  Bristles seem firm enough - I have alot of thick hair and I can barely feel the bristles on my scalp but with continued brushing it seems to be dispersing the oils etc.</li>
    <li> This brush does not work well in hair that has much thickness.  It is too weak for my hair.  I did not keep it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband. He had his last Fuller Brush hairbrush for more than 30 years. The poor hairbrush the bristles were falling out and it had a large bald spot where bristles were gone. Time for the good wife to step in and replace his brush. Thankfully Amazon had an exact style replacement so I was able to pry it out of his hands without a fight. Husband is thrilled to have a new hairbrush and with the Fuller Brush name it will probably last another 30 years.</li>
    <li> The brush I received is a standard rectangular one with close bristles..  I use it, but not for the blow dryer as wanted.  The handle has uncomfortable &#x27;cut-out&#x27; to apparently allow for a thumb to rest but the edges are too square.  It was too expensive and to realize it was the company and not my goof that brought the wrong brush flusters me.  I should have come back and verified what I ordered and insisted the correct brush.  Time is money and this time, I lost.</li>
    <li> Fuller brushes are the only brush I &#x27;ve used since I was a child, and I was born in 1947.</li>
    <li> Have used fuller brush since I was a child.  Expect many years of use from this brush.</li>
    <li> I have used Fuller Brushes for years.  There is no better brush on the market in my opinion.  Both for quality, function and wear~~&lt;br /&gt;I receive fast and quality service from this Amazon provider.</li>
    <li> This is not the Fuller Brush I remember from long time ago. You cannot even tell this is going through your hair.Horrible wate of money!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this type of brush and couldn&#x27;t find it for repurchase when it wore out. Excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> This was ordered to replace my last one which was about 10+ years old.  Once in a while I go wild and try another brand, but come back to Fuller every time!  Love their brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have used this brand of brush for close to 60 years.  I lost the last brush and had to purchase a new brush.  I love the way my hair looks after using the brush.</li>
    <li> Finally my search is over! This brush Is actually a Half-Round brush. I&#x27;ve been trying to replace my old one for several years.  I&#x27;ve found every version of round except for one that was a Full half-round. I have really curly hair with multiple cowlicks on my forehead. This brush grabs my bangs and holds them securely while I blowdry. I end up with smooth shiny hair. This brush is very well made, and I definitely recommend it. And at less than half the amount I expected to pay it&#x27;s a great deal too.</li>
    <li> I love the fuller  half round Fuller Brush. It is great for fine hair! I bought 2 more of them after trying the first one. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> It is an adequate bristle brush.  However, the quality of the product is far inferior to Fuller products of bye gone years.</li>
    <li> It is awful- you cannot find a half-round hair brush anywhere, I even tried the hair professional store as I am a licensed hair dresser.  After reviewing a few I found on Amazon, which I was thrilled about, and asking my aging mother who had given me my first one, which over 4 moves is misplaced, she recommened the Fuller Brush Co, as most of us have heard of them, as they have been in business for so many years - be assured the product I bought would lead me to believe their great reputation is still as good as ever!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this brush thinking it would be like the old Fuller Brush products I remember.  This brush is nice for straight hair, I think.  If used properly, it should bring shine to the hair.  For my wavy, frizzy, color treated hair, it takes a lot of patience to get this brush through the layers without snagging.  I do use it on days I do not shampoo to carefully smooth the outer layers.</li>
    <li> I have had this style Fuller hair brush for years, and this looked to be identical, and it is except that the bristles do not penetrate to my scalp as the others did.  I don&#x27;t know whether it is the bristle itself or the angle at which they are set.  I&#x27;m learning to use this one, but I would have preferred an exact duplicate of the ones I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife and she likes it.</li>
    <li> I own a older version of this brush that is far superior. This one is much softer and simply doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gee, how hard can it be for a company to produce a hairbrush?</li>
    <li> Perfect for someone with thin hair; the elderly, young children, balding men and women. The bristles are soft and easy on the scalp.  It does NOT work for people with medium to thick hair.  The bristles are to soft to get through it.  So be sure to buy for your hair type.</li>
    <li> i was vey excited to finally find a half round hair brush, since avon does not make them any longer. however when i received my brushes the bristles were very soft &amp;wont even go through my hair, which is short and still too soft to go through my hair .  I am considering returning them</li>
    <li> Again, I bought this brush for my 9 year old granddaughter. Brushes that are not natural bristles are so bad on long hair. I like this for styling her hair.</li>
    <li> Too soft of bristles.  I have a Fuller brush that is identical and have used it for 30 years, believe it or not.  This one was a disappointment because it didn&#x27;t work well on my hair.</li>
    <li> Hair brush is not recommended for anyone with thick curly hair, but should be fine for other types of hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush but my hair is too thick for it.  i&#x27;m giving this one to my daughter. If you know of a different style for very thick hair, please let me know.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it.  She needs a brush that doesn&#x27;t pull her hair and has found it in this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for its intended purpose: distributing the natural oil on your scalp throughout your hair. This brush is not what you use to de-tangle your hair after showering. The natural bristles will feel way too soft at first but with a little practice you will learn the correct angle to use to pull it through your hair. I have learned there is great truth in the old adage of our grandmothers to brush your hair 100 strokes at night. With enough use, you may find you no longer need to use conditioner. I love this brush. It is the exact same one I had as a kid in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Glad I can actually buy a half-round brush again. The best was an Avon half-round but they discontinued it, though I ask them to recreate it every year. This is the second fuller brush one I&#x27;ve bought because the one I bought last year has lost bristles already.</li>
    <li> This product has been my favorite brush for over 30 years.  I remember my mother would always buy this brush from the Fuller Brush Rep in the day the rep would sell the products door to door.  I was delighted to find that I can now purchase it through Amazon since there is no Fuller Brush stors in my area.  What I like most about this brush is that it leaves your hair feeling silky and shiny.  Keep up the good work Fuller Brush.  Also, received excellent delivery on the product.</li>
    <li> They were a gift and they were loved.</li>
    <li> This brush is okay, but I wish it had stiffer bristles.  I have thick hair and this just doesn&#x27;t get a good hold on my hair.  It is more like it skims over the top.  Thank God I found my old Avon half round. ( I misplaced it while moving.)  finding my old stiff brush made me realize that I really don&#x27;t like this one.  Anyone know where I can get a good stiff boar bristle half round brush?</li>
    <li> Brush is just as described, and perfect in every way!</li>
    <li> My mother had me purchase this for her. She used to buy the Avon ones. She has bought others here on amazon that she said the bristles wore down really fast, although THESE she is VERY please with!</li>
    <li> the handle broke off after a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;sad.&lt;br /&gt;not the fuller brush of years past.</li>
    <li> This is exactly like the brush my father gave me when I was like 13 years old.  He had kept that brush since he was a fuller brush salesman back on the 60&#x27;s, and that brush lasted until I was 30.  By then any if the bristles were broken off.  This one is an exact replica of that, and has been working great for about a year now.</li>
    <li> Boar bristle brush for medium thick hair. My hair is very straight, very thick and brush doesn&#x27;t quite go to scalp, but I think it is the best brush for the money; i have very dry hair and the brush is usful to help distribute any natural oils and stimulate scalp. Some of us may remember being told to nightly brush our hair 100 strokes to maintain sheen - this is the brush to do just that. Nothing can beat Fuller brush, a brand that has been around for decades, for quality and price. Only 4-stars as I could use a brush for ultra-thick hair!.NOT to be used as detangler.</li>
    <li> Great brush need to buy another one ... My mom took mine and loves it !!!</li>
    <li> PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU BUY:  I bought this hairbrush a few months ago and at first I absolutely LOVED it.  I didn&#x27;t read what the bristles are made out of but just washed it in warm water and mild soap, and now the bristles LITERALLY smell like cow manure.  I would never recommend this brush to anyone because of this.</li>
    <li> It was delivered promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> I have had this design Fuller brush before and liked it very much.  This one does not have the same bristle strength as those I used in the past.  It is alright, but not something I think is great.  I have long thick hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t get through to the scalp.  The design is good, but I think the bristles could be much better.  If your hair is on the thinner side, this brush would probably rate a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> It is perfect!!,the best brush.</li>
    <li> Just as I thought it would be - Excellent</li>
    <li> This is the type of brush I grew up using but could no longer find anywhere. So happy I found it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;This is what a real hairbrush should be.</li>
    <li> bristles are too soft!</li>
    <li> Great brush. My mother used to buy Fuller brushes all the time. Great for your hair.</li>
    <li> The brush was a gift for my Mother. My Mom has always used a Fuller Brush brushes. I remember as a child the Fuller Brush man coming to the house. Brushes, vegetable brushes, and Fullsol cleaner. Best degreaser on the market.</li>
    <li> Good brush, just wish the bristles were a bit stiffer.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a half round hairbrush but could not find one locally. Luv it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this brush would be an adeguate replacement for a half round brush that I needed to replace.  This brush is too flimsy to do any styling or even brush through my hair and believe me, I don&#x27;t have thick course hair.  I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003AU7GQS Fuller Brush Pro Hair Care - Half Round Curler]] My husband Jim and I both have the  fuller brush half round brush an we love them. I have had mine for 40yrs and he has his about 15yrs. They are as good today as when they were new. My grandson loved my husbands and wanted the same one. He just started college and I know he will never need another brush. He has very thick hair and this was the only brush that does the trick. We had to get it for him, and once you have it you will never part with it.</li>
    <li> I was not able to return it because I would have to pay the shipping and it would have cost me almost as much as the brush. This makes a fair brush for the grandsons now that they are small, but won&#x27;t be of any use later because the bristles are much too soft to use in my own hair. Not only that, but the bristles break and pull out very easily. Big waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought &amp;#34;Fuller Brush&amp;#34; products for many, many years, and I was really disappointed that they are now selling such trash. I won&#x27;t ever try to get another one.</li>
    <li> This would be a great brush for someone with thin hair. The bristles are soft and quite flexible. Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine: cleans up easily, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> My family has never been able to use standard hairbrushes that you can buy in stores, the plastic bristles are just too painful. This brush is great and my 6yr old daughter never complains when I get the tangles out with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do not notice it pulling out alot of extra hairs, which is nice!  It has shed some bristles since we started using it, but hopefully it will not continue to do that.</li>
    <li> All the other items were gifts and I have no knowledge of satisfaction.The Fuller brush is mine and rated as above. It&#x27;s certainly not like the old Fuller brushes but is adequate.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and is OK for final stroking for shine but for deep scalp brushing not firm enough to get to the roots of my fine partly grey hair.  Much perfert the Lady Catherine Hair brush that I intend to buy again.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to get natural boars head bristle brushes at a reasonable price nowadays, but this is worth it...it is a bit smaller that I expected but this brush is more than satisfactory.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> The bristle aren&#x27;t stiff enough.  It doesn&#x27;t go through my hair.  It may be suitable for someone with very fine hair.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the hair brush. After the very first use the brush bristles were falling out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hair brush and I brush my hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;What more can you say?  So far it works well.</li>
    <li> Everyone should own this basic necessity.  It works so well, you hardly know it is there.  At a great price, too!</li>
    <li> It is like the brushes I used growing up and I&#x27;m glad to have one in my possession again after all these years of not being able to find one in local stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and this hairbrush is worth having. Especially if you have a child that hates having their hair brushed. It&#x27;s great for every hair type to promote healthy shiny hair.</li>
    <li> At least I think my wife does. I&#x27;m bald, so I don&#x27;t use if much. I asked my wife how she liked it but she&#x27;s not talking to me since her birthday when I bought her a hairbrush.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Fibers are so soft they slide off my fine hair.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Disappointed!  Bristles are so soft that even after repeated strokes in same place you do not reach the scalp.  My hair is not coarse.  I&#x27;m 87 and slowly thining.</li>
    <li> ben using this type of brush many many years</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who has very long hair. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Shipping was a bit slow. I used this brush for years growing up. However the changed to boar bristles, and now it is too soft and won&#x27;t go through my hair. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love being able to brush through my hair with the boar bristles;&lt;br /&gt;nylon bristles just can&#x27;t compete.  Only drawback is that I wish the&lt;br /&gt;handle were heftier, which would make it easier to brush it backwards or against the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Everything about this brush seems &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; to me: its size, curvature, density and stiffness of the bristles, overall clean design...and it&#x27;s a Fuller! (I prefer brushes that get well into my hair vs. skimming the surface as some do.)</li>
    <li> Excellent brush very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Fuller Brush products. This is the only style hairbrush I like to use in my hair. When my current (another brand) of hairbrush broke off of its handle, I went searching for a Fuller Brush product. I was not let down by Amazon. There was the exact brush I love.</li>
    <li> I used to use these brushes years ago.  Somehow stopped.  Been thinking about buying another for years.  I still love this brush.  Just the right stiffenss to the bristles.  Feels really good against the scalp.</li>
    <li> Been using these brushes for more years one can count. I will always use these brushes.  They are the best there is.</li>
    <li> works just like a hairbrush</li>
    <li> Softer tan I expected</li>
    <li> good half-round brush.  good again for Fuller Brush</li>
    <li> Our old half round brush is over 40 years and needed to be replaced.  I could never find a replacement brush that looked even similar until I found this one on Amazon.  I was worried that it might be too soft but it is just right for my taste.  I have thick, medium length, straight hair.  It is a bigger brush than the old one (but that could be because our old bristles were getting flatter) and the handle is a little thicker and shorter but I think it&#x27;s a good replacement and the price is right!!</li>
    <li> Not good for thick hair!</li>
    <li> My mother owned an &amp;#34;heirloom&amp;#34; Fuller Brush that her mom had passed down to her.  I saw my mother brush her beautiful, thick hair with that brush for years.  It is the only brush I ever saw her use, and it must have been 50 years old.  I saw this Fuller brush and I just had to have it for the memories.  But I will use it for the quality.  The handle is tough but the boar bristles aren&#x27;t.  They are pliable and the true half round shape is perfect for a root lift as I blow my hair dry.  Great quality, excellent price.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I had a Fuller brush this style years ago.  I have enjoyed this replacement and find it effective in keeping hair well cared for.&lt;br /&gt;Leigh</li>
    <li> I thought &#x27;fuller brush&#x27;....right!  Fantastic....love the on piece construction.  Most brushed I&#x27;ve used in the past attach together (by the manufacturer) at the base of the bristles.  My hair was constantly getting caught up - besides the fact it hurt, my hair was breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are not aggressive, but grip the hair and I can brush through my long hair without hang ups.  This is the brush I grab to throw in my purse and the one I use to brush out my hair before styling.  Sometimes I use it for styling, but I still prefer a round brush for that.  I still think it deserves 5 starts because it has performed perfectly when it comes to the reason I purchased the brush...just a basic go to - no hassle brush.</li>
    <li> While this brush looks exactly like the 40 year old brush it replaced, it is not of the same quality.  The bristles are not as abundant and lush.  Some things get better with technology, but I&#x27;m afraid to keep the price in line the product has suffered.  It is still, however, a good brush and better than others I shopped.</li>
    <li> I had a brush like this for many many years. This one is the right shape, but the bristles don&#x27;t go through my hair as well as the other one. Also, my hair gets static electricity pretty bad using it!  Wish they made them like they used to!  I also ordered the acrylic one at the same time. Those bristles do seem a little bit stiffer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of brush, once I used a Fuller half round, I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Brush is quality all the way and is better than the very old one it replaced. Mom loves it and in happy to give an 82 y/o the same quality they remember in America. Price was great and delivery time awesome. Thanks so much for the great service .</li>
    <li> I bought this brush hoping it would be the same quality as the one I had years ago ... I find the bristles are not&lt;br /&gt;stiff enough to really get down to the scalp ... I&#x27;m keeping the brush however.</li>
    <li> I like this hair brush.  It&#x27;s gentle and effective, massages without scratching. I especially  like the ivory plastic handle.  It reminds me of the brushes we used to have, but it doesn&#x27;t kill elephants.</li>
    <li> This item is likely my ninth or tenth ~ the earlier versions having been purchased by my mother, who loved Fuller products. If you have long and/or thick hair, this is simply the best brush on the market. (Bought one for my husband as well.)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality item.  The bristles are rather soft though so it works better as a &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; than for a deep scalp brush.  I love the shape and the fit of the handle.</li>
    <li> Really nice brush.  My hair is partially grey and using this brush has very much improved the shine.</li>
    <li> Good quality - little different than I expected, but works fine.</li>
    <li> Ordered this style brush 3 times and each time I was sent a different model (not the half round).  Number on the box was different then the number on the brush.  Last time I received the replacement I just kept the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Well now it&#x27;s 2.5 years later and the brush just broke in half.  I&#x27;ve used Fuller Brush for years and I&#x27;m NOT a happy customer.  I&#x27;m not sure I even want to try to order a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
    <li> If you have long hair, or if you&#x27;re looking for a brush to use on your children who have long hair, this is the brush for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The half circle shape is perfect for working out knots in your children&#x27;s hair, and it&#x27;s a great brush for daily maintenance for yourself or your children.</li>
    <li> The brush does not get through to my scalp and my hair is medium thickness. It is not the fuller brush we bought as kids from door to door salesmen! Not happy with it and does nothing to brush my hair! I just bought this within the last week</li>
    <li> I like natural bristles and the Kent brush I received as a gift years ago lasted many years, but they are quite expensive now and thought that this Fuller brush would be a good alternative.  On a personal likes and dislikes note I found the handle to be too short and didn&#x27;t like the feel and on the more important quality issue I found it not to be well made.  I used it 3 times and a dozen or more bristles would fall out each time scattering on the bathroom counter and the floor.  The company that sold it shipped it on time, so no complaints there, but I&#x27;m sending the brush back for credit.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush in the world.  I have had two in my lifetime of 64 years. I&#x27;m so glad I found my second one on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just got the brush so I cannot comment to highlly of it until further use,its a Stanley brush I know it will last me a long,long time,it will do right by my hair...I recommend stanley products they do last!!</li>
    <li> Handle is a bit short, and my hands are not large. I adjusted my grip onto the back of the brush to keep the flared end of the handle from digging into my palm.&lt;br /&gt;It is a full half-round brush with 8 rows of bristles. It brushes well on my short hair.</li>
    <li> do not like this brush, too soft and doesn&#x27;t grab hair when blow drying, again not more words to add.</li>
    <li> My old Fuller lasted many years... like over 20. This one looks and feels like the original but it is quickly losing its bristles. I know it will never live 20 years but then neither will I.</li>
    <li> Fuller brushes are fine tools.  This one does not feel quite as sturdy in the handle as the brush my mother had for a lifetime, but I like it a lot and use it everyday for brushing my hair when it is dry.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush but I was looking for firmer bristles.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!!!</li>
