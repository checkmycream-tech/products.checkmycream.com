      <li>or so i will as i have trips to go on from the reviews i should be a happy camper thanks</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cover my grays any better</li>
      <li>Well, after using it as directed, there were my wiry gray hairs standing out on top of my head--taunting me and thumbing their nose at No Gray.</li>
      <li>glad it was cheep.</li>
      <li>It made it looks more luxurious.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to see this item available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Mix in with root touch up or full package and all the grays are gone!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy</li>
      <li>me, it&#x27;s a great product that helps color adhere overall much better.</li>
      <li>It worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>Plus the dye was absorbed better into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
      <li>/&gt;Apply hair color on the most stubborn gray areas FIRST.  </li>
      <li>I have stubborn grays and this product gave me full coverage.</li>
      <li>love this, does a great job of covering hard to cover gray</li>
      <li>The dye also faded quickly from the resistent area.  </li>
      <li>I color my hair at home using Superior Preference Dark Soft Mahogany, and all that grows back is full gray!!!!</li>
      <li>So, I came across this No Gray Hair Color Additive, and carefully read the reviews on this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try because it says it provides good gray coverage and it lasts awhile.  </li>
      <li>I cannot say yet how effective it will be after several weeks.</li>
      <li>This is a fine product that I can highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I use light blonde hair dye and have light gray hair, so maybe that is the cause of no change.  </li>
      <li>It also helps my color stay better overall.</li>
      <li>Love this and definitely will purchase again!</li>
      <li>i pour the hair color first, then mix with the No Gray booster.  </li>
      <li>I used No Gray for the first time about one week ago.   </li>
      <li>Second time ive ordered more so i don&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>It also causes the dye to take more quickly, so don&#x27;t leave it on as long as you normally would when you need to cover a lot of gray</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t completely help with covering the grey but using it has helped cover more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>it works really well.  </li>
      <li>This absolutely works.  </li>
      <li>It really helps cover my gray.</li>
      <li>The color holds much longer.</li>
      <li>Fast service too.</li>
      <li>It is also reasonably priced as I buy 2 or 4 pack.</li>
      <li>Now, the reason I gave this product three stars instead of a lower score is that the package says that you can use two applications in your hair color instead of one if you have very resistant gray.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive, considering the cost of hair color applications and it really does help it cover the gray.</li>
      <li>So far the color is still on those hard to color areas - good product.</li>
      <li>It completely covered my resistant gray hair better than any other product I have tried.</li>
      <li>One or a few of the geniuses who make the product, decided to no longer manufacture the No Gray in a paper bottle, for lack of better term.  </li>
      <li>than my normal coloring process does at all.</li>
      <li>My bangs always lost their color before anything else, showing gray in (of course) the most obvious fashion possible, so I grabbed a box, not really expecting much.  </li>
      <li>the grey hair Pink.&lt;br /&gt;It works great on course grey hair where the color is hard to grab.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I only used one vial even though it says you can use two for very resistant gray.  </li>
      <li>I just poured 1/3 of a package in a plastic bowl with some of my premixed hair color (saved the rest in a container) - brushed it on the hard to color areas (around the face mostly) then colored the rest of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Definitely kept the color from sliding off the grays, &amp; helped my color overall stay vibrant longer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product works well.  So you ask, why two stars?  One or a few of the geniuses who make the product, decided to no longer manufacture the No Gray in a paper bottle, for lack of better term.  You cut away the top and place it in the color.  It worked just fine.  Now you have a little plastic thing.  It is hard to get the solution out.  It is difficult to get all of the solution out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make the color last as long as I&#x27;d hoped when adding one of the packets....I probably need to try both packets next time!</li>
    <li> I used No Gray for the first time about one week ago.   I think the product has helped.  I usually see some grey showing through by this time and I don&#x27;t see any yet.  I wash my hair daily so this is really a good test of the product.  I cannot say yet how effective it will be after several weeks.</li>
    <li> I love using this product! I color my hair at home using Superior Preference Dark Soft Mahogany, and all that grows back is full gray!!!! I was having a difficult time covering my gray until I found this product! My hairdresser recommended that I add this to my color to help with gray coverage! I will never color my hair without this product ever again!!!</li>
    <li> This absolutely works.  Tried it thinking it wouldn&#x27;t as I have been coloring my hair for over 20 years, have gray hair since childhood.  Lately, the grays at hairline were impossible to completely cover.  No Gray worked better than I ever imagined.  I only used one vial even though it says you can use two for very resistant gray.  I thought I qualified for that, but I only needed the one. I never want to color my hair again without it.</li>
    <li> After finding this product through an internet search, I decided to try it despite my misgivings that at worst it might alter my Level 3 haircolor or at the very least not live up to its claim of providing complete gray coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needn&#x27;t have worried.  Not only did No Gray make my color deeper and richer (I use Dark Brown, Level 4) but that dreaded line of demarcation that would often occur where my gray roots had grown in was nowhere to be seen.  I had brilliant, full coverage from roots to tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using No Gray has become a permanent part of my hair coloring routine.  This is a fine product that I can highly recommend.  I can&#x27;t imagine coloring my hair at home without it!</li>
    <li> I just poured 1/3 of a package in a plastic bowl with some of my premixed hair color (saved the rest in a container) - brushed it on the hard to color areas (around the face mostly) then colored the rest of my hair.  So far the color is still on those hard to color areas - good product.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m 47 and I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray, but it is coming in--The thing is, when I dye my hair, which isn&#x27;t often, the dye never covers all my gray and then my gray is back within a couple weeks!!!  So, I stopped dying it altogether because I was disappointed with the results. So, I came across this No Gray Hair Color Additive, and carefully read the reviews on this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try because it says it provides good gray coverage and it lasts awhile.  I have to tell you ladies, this is the ticket!!!  I am now going on almost 2 months and no gray.  Not only do I NOT have gray, but when I added this to my hair dye, it even covered those gray hairs that NEVER seemed to take the dye before -- so I got great gray coverage and it lasts!! What more could you ask for!! I&#x27;ve been telling my friends about this-- it truly is great and I will be a loyal customer because when you find something that works you stick with it!</li>
    <li> Even though I used hair coloring meant for covering gray, I had an extremely resistent patch that never came out as dark as the rest of my hair.  The dye also faded quickly from the resistent area.  I use the same dye I used before, but adding \\&quot;No Gray\\&quot; to it makes it color evenly and causes the resistent area to hold the color as long as the rest of my hair.  It also causes the dye to take more quickly, so don&#x27;t leave it on as long as you normally would when you need to cover a lot of gray -- it will cause the color to come out darker.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product no stars I would. It did nothing for my gray hairs. What it did do is darken the ends of my hair a very dull color. My hair is light brown and the beautiful golden color was now muddy. Never again will I use a product like this and go to the salon for proper color.</li>
    <li> My gray hairs grow in a lot coarser than the rest of my hair, and I have always had a problem getting them to accept hair color. The reason I color my hair is because of the gray, so you can understand my frustration. When I found out about this product, I thought \\&quot;GREAT!\\&quot; and ran out and purchased it. Well, after using it as directed, there were my wiry gray hairs standing out on top of my head--taunting me and thumbing their nose at No Gray. It had no effect at all.  Now, the reason I gave this product three stars instead of a lower score is that the package says that you can use two applications in your hair color instead of one if you have very resistant gray. Unfortunately I only have one application left, so if I want to try it again, I have to go purchase another box. (There&#x27;s only 2 applications in the box) and I&#x27;m not sure if I want to bother with this product again.  The other aspect about this product is that it claims to make your hair color last longer. My color tends to fade out after a couple of weeks, especially toward the ends. Since I just used it, I don&#x27;t have a good idea if this claim is valid or not. I hope it is, because that alone would make the product earn it&#x27;s three star rating that I gave it. So we shall see...If it makes my hair color last longer, I may purchase it again and try using 2 tubes instead of one. That might do the trick.</li>
    <li> this product is no help whatso ever i have as much grey as before i used it . i put 2 applications because i have stubborn grey i wasted my money glad it was cheep. well if it&#x27;s too good to be true it usually is.[[ASIN:B001QOP2KM No Gray Hair Color Additive 2 applications]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been adding this to my John Frieda foam color, 3VR for over a year. I have a lot of gray (25%+) and this helps the color sick to the gray amazingly well. It also helps my color stay better overall. My grays are admittedly, a little lighter than the rest of my color, but it looks like natural highlights. My color stays true until it&#x27;s time to color again, which is difficult for red shades, I know. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my &#x27;red&#x27; when I&#x27;m due to hit my roots, so I can tell the color remains true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I went to color and realized I was out of this. I colored anyway, and was not happy that the color did not take as well at all. My grays were &#x27;pinkish&#x27; and the rest of my roots didn&#x27;t have the richness I was used to (I have an ashy dark brown natural color) so I&#x27;ll have to redo them soon. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one packet in the bottle before I add the developer, then mix it according to the package directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s a great product that helps color adhere overall much better.</li>
    <li> it works really well.  i pour the hair color first, then mix with the No Gray booster.  after that, i then add in the developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply hair color on the most stubborn gray areas FIRST.  for me, its my crown and around my face.  then go back and apply to the remaining hair.</li>
    <li> Works Great, helps hair color more evenly. Used to buy locally, however getting harder to find in stores</li>
    <li> I was glad to see this item available on Amazon.  I had bought it from Walmart for years but they stopped carrying it.  I ordered 4 boxes. One of the boxes only had one application in it instead of two, but since I stocked up, I let it go.  It&#x27;s not very expensive, considering the cost of hair color applications and it really does help it cover the gray.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive, but product works well to target grey hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Best advice for hard to dye grey hair is to do that part of your hairline first. Leave dye on there for 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;then do the rest of the hair. This product made the hair dye work about 2 weeks longer than&lt;br /&gt;the dye usually works. Plus the dye was absorbed better into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Did not make my hair brittle or dry. Very Good Product.</li>
    <li> I have been  using this product for a couple years now and am very happy with how well it covers the gray.</li>
    <li> Using this product didn&#x27;t help my gray hair absorb color ( I have about 30% gray) anymore than my normal coloring process does at all. Save your money &amp; reduce even more chemical exposure.</li>
    <li> I used it once, but it didn&#x27;t work. So, buying this product was a complete waste of money. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this product for about 2 years. It really helps cover my gray. It&#x27;s so easy you just add it to your regular hair color. I was out of it once when I colored my hair and the color alone did not even begin to cover the gray. I definitely recommend this. It covers all the gray, including the dreaded gray patches that don&#x27;t take color well.</li>
    <li> i Brought this product i have not used it yet maybe another week or so i will as i have trips to go on from the reviews i should be a happy camper thanks</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair for years and recently have had trouble covering my gray, whether I color at home or at the beauty salon. After giving this product a try along with some cheap permanent dye (about $2.99), I was very pleased with the results. It completely covered my resistant gray hair better than any other product I have tried. Love this and definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> So-so on stubborn grays.</li>
    <li> If you color your hair you should definately try this product. I see a big difference in the amount of time in between having to color my hair. The color holds much longer.</li>
    <li> Was hopeful based on reviews however did not really work.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I saw it on a store shelf, but thought it worth a try.  My bangs always lost their color before anything else, showing gray in (of course) the most obvious fashion possible, so I grabbed a box, not really expecting much.  To my pleasant surprise, it worked!  My bangs held their color and I was able to stop fretting between dyes about whether or not it had worn off already.  Yay!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t completely help with covering the grey but using it has helped cover more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I have stubborn grays and this product gave me full coverage. I would recommend it to anyone who has trouble coloring their gray hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best additive for home hair color ever!!! Gray hair around hairline was impossible to cover no matter what but this fixes that problem. Mix in with root touch up or full package and all the grays are gone! It is also reasonably priced as I buy 2 or 4 pack. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This works so well, when you have grays to cover, it helps the color grab those little resistant wirey grays</li>
    <li> Seems to keep the color longer.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out. I opened up the box and tried like heck to squeeze something out. Whatever was in the tube was as hard as a rock. Perhaps it&#x27;s not in the best packaging? Then I read some of the reviews about how it makes hair hard too. I can see why.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Truly does work like they say. Second time ive ordered more so i don&#x27;t run out. Fast service too.</li>
    <li> No Gray Hair Color Additive worked well on stubborn gray when added to hair color.  I recommend to anyone who has problems covering gray hair.</li>
    <li> Used one application with hair dye.  No result.  Will try 2 next time and see what happens,.  I use light blonde hair dye and have light gray hair, so maybe that is the cause of no change.  If this is the cause, might be nice if literature said so.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cover my grays any better BUT it did improve the overall color.  It made it looks more luxurious.  To me, it&#x27;s not worth paying the extra money.</li>
    <li> Definitely kept the color from sliding off the grays, &amp; helped my color overall stay vibrant longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it will work with the hair color, and allow my gray to blend in so that it would not be noticeable.  --did not work!!!!!!!  Plus, it made my hair \\&quot;hard\\&quot;; this has never happened before!</li>
    <li> This is best product out to cover Grey.&lt;br /&gt;You mix it with your hair color and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;It helps Reds not turn the grey hair Pink.&lt;br /&gt;It works great on course grey hair where the color is hard to grab.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts till the next time you need to do your roots.&lt;br /&gt;Great price as well !</li>
    <li> love this, does a great job of covering hard to cover gray</li>
