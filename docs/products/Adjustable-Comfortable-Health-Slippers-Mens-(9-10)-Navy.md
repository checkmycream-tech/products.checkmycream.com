      <li>but within 30 min of wearing them, they stretched in all the right places for me</li>
      <li>If I was 5 foot tall and lived in Beijing, that slipper might have been a large; as it is, I couldn&#x27;t even close the velcro on my size ten foot ( which is on the lower spectrum of the &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; spec).</li>
      <li>Yeah, they do look a little/feel a little cheap.</li>
      <li>They work very well for him and the cost is within our means as we are seniors with a low income.</li>
      <li>I thought the whole tongue peeled back with the velcro on each side, but its only on one side</li>

    <li> The Velcro strips are very narrow. There is no way to adjust the tightness across the instep, and the shoe is very wide.</li>

    <li> initially i thought they were gonna be too tight but within 30 min of wearing them, they stretched in all the right places for me</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005GRNJ78 Adjustable Comfortable Health Slippers]] When I open the bag I said,\\&quot;yes this is it\\&quot;, then I took a closer look and saw how small they were. I ordered a man size large (10-11)but got a boys 10-11. cannot get my foot in the thing. I like the slipper but I need a man size.</li>
    <li> Poorly constructed for a health slipper. Improper stitching left a very rough edge of the velcro exposed at a pressure area where the instep of the foot would rub and no doubtably leave skin suceptible to tissue breakdown. Plus and addition $6.95 in return shipping.</li>
    <li> These slippers are  so warm and comfortable. Fits well. My husband loves them. They would  make a nice inexpensive gift</li>
    <li> These slippers were for my husband, who has a lot or problems purchasing slippers.  They work very well for him and the cost is within our means as we are seniors with a low income.</li>
    <li> Gave these to my honey whose feet swell from time to time and he loves them</li>
    <li> I have neuropathy in my feet and need extra comfort to walk around in at home. These work perfect for me and at the right price, this is my second pair and I will continue to buy them. The velcro comes undone fairly often (which would seem normal considering all the movement of walking etc., but they still work great for me.</li>

It&#x27;s my fault, and a well learned $16 lesson.</li>

    <li> Yeah, they do look a little/feel a little cheap. But my grandmother saw these in a magazine a few years ago and I have been ordering her a pair every year. She wears them everywhere, everyday. She&#x27;s 87 years old, not very active and suffers from gout. its a good deal for something that she can easily put on, especially when her feet swell up.</li>
    <li> Lousy slippers - got a refund and threw them away</li>
    <li> Good buy.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my Dad who has gout and arthritis in his feet.  The slippers were advertised in a magazine for arthritis sufferers.  They are very comfortable and have given him a lot of relief.  I had noticed that some of the negative remarks about these slippers were related to the sizing.  After placing the order through Amazon, I noticed the size was not listed on my online receipt.  I emailed Dream Products through Amazon to specify the size.  The company confirmed immediately.  I plan on ordering more of these slippers.</li>
