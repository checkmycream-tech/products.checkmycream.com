      <li>Very soothing, leaves the scalp clean.  </li>

      <li>and after the first time I used it</li>
      <li>Helps him maintain a quick early morning routine.</li>
      <li>I purchased it because I liked the addition of eucalyptus, and felt it would address any itchy scalp problems better, since I was suspecting maybe some type of weird, microscopic fungus infection might spark it.  </li>
      <li>This 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner has really stopped the itch.</li>
      <li>Works well we both use it once or twice a week to stop Itchiness and leaves hair nice smells ok too not strong like other Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo does.</li>

      <li>and it came right back</li>
      <li>First time I had a similar product was in Taiwan on a family trip, this brought me right back.</li>
      <li>I had such compliments the next day on how smooth and shiny my hair looked (I had been using 2-1 pert plus with garnier fructis conditioner and then garnier fructis leave in conditioner so it replaced</li>
      <li>He does not suffer from dandruff, just a really itchy scalp, with no other symptoms.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if its the eucalyptus or a different formula for the conditioner, but this product seems to tame my husband&#x27;s dry (tending towards frizzy) hair better than the others.</li>
      <li>I used the original, the one for men, a few other different scents, and this itchy scalp care.</li>

    <li> I only gave this four stars because I&#x27;ve used this for just one week. I love the way it makes my pores open and my scalp feels clean.</li>
    <li> Left hair feeling greasy after shampooing.</li>
    <li> No dandruff for my daughter this product is really effective I&#x27;m happy my daughter happy and I highly recommend it thanks for the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Doesn&#x27;t stop the itching but reduces it -- a little.</li>
    <li> I was having a terrible reaction after dying my hair last weekend. Couldn&#x27;t sleep because of the constant itch. Stopped by the grocery store yesterday looking for anything that would stop my itch that would not turn me into a total grease ball. Decided to give H&amp;S Itchy Scalp Care a shot. Haven&#x27;t itched since!!! SOOO HAPPY! It is cooling and refreshing and really works! Thank you so much H&amp;S!</li>
    <li> My husband has a perpetual itchy scalp.  And he has tried everything.  He hoped this product would help, but alas, it did not help at all.</li>
    <li> Good smell, we like them!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m slightly less itchy throughout the day</li>
    <li> Works well we both use it once or twice a week to stop Itchiness and leaves hair nice smells ok too not strong like other Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo does.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, leaves the scalp clean.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> First time I had a similar product was in Taiwan on a family trip, this brought me right back. Some may hate the feeling of their scalp tingling but it only made me feel more awake and after the first time I used it I had such compliments the next day on how smooth and shiny my hair looked (I had been using 2-1 pert plus with garnier fructis conditioner and then garnier fructis leave in conditioner so it replaced the pert-plus). Love it! :)</li>
    <li> I was desperate ,then I found it at Wal-Mart 12 dollars cheaper.and it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff at an excellent price. Have been a long time user of the regular Head &amp; Shoulders dry scalp 2in1 shampoo with conditioner, and its ***mart store brand counterpart. They performed well. I don&#x27;t know if its the eucalyptus or a different formula for the conditioner, but this product seems to tame my husband&#x27;s dry (tending towards frizzy) hair better than the others. I purchased it because I liked the addition of eucalyptus, and felt it would address any itchy scalp problems better, since I was suspecting maybe some type of weird, microscopic fungus infection might spark it.  He does not suffer from dandruff, just a really itchy scalp, with no other symptoms. Highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Although I do not suffer from dandruff, I do have an itchy scalp. This 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner has really stopped the itch. Leaves my hair feeling and smelling great. Some other itch relief shampoos have a bad medicinal smell, not this one. This is now my shampoo/conditioner of choice.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to grow my hair for a few years and have been using some shampoo that has helped it grow but it has sulfate and different kinds of sodium in it which are two things that causes itchiness!! Just today I used this after I applied my shampoo, and not once have I itched my scalp. I am very impressed!! I also love the smell, it smells like granny smith apples (long lasting smell).</li>
    <li> The only shampoo I use.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff I only have a problem with itchy scalp.  Every since I started using this my itchy scalp has gone away.  I stopped using it for a little and it came right back, it was so unbearable but this helped me. No more itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know yet but will let you know.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Product is as described. Very good price, good smell and good for daily use. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> After I used it for more than a month, my hair becomes very oily and I have to wash it everyday and it is very itchy!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because my head has been extremely itchy and dry with flakes for the past two months. I&#x27;ve used head and shoulders for years because of my dry and itchy scalp to see if it helps, but for years it&#x27;s been the same. I used the original, the one for men, a few other different scents, and this itchy scalp care. Nothing is helping. The other day I talked to my barber and he said that I should try to stay away from head and shoulders because they usually make things worse. He said that&#x27;s what he tells most of his customers and their problem goes away. He told me to try a shampoo with tea tree oil and a good conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using herbal essences with tea tree and nexus humectress ultimate conditioner. My scalp is no longer itchy, dry, and no more flakes!!!</li>
