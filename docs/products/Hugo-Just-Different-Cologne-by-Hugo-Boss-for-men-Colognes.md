    <li> This Hugo Boss is a scent that I like very much. A personal choice some may not like it.</li>
    <li> My husband always had the original cologne, but my son discovered this.  I got them each one, and they LOVE it.  I have 2 other sons at home who have been \\&quot;borrowing\\&quot; from their father and brother.  Looks like I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I think it is a replica. smells good but not for a long time as my other boss fragrances bought in shop.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Colonge I´ve purchased. I am very satisfated and I would definitly buy again.. 100% guarantee...</li>
    <li> The product is perfect, it&#x27;s such a good scent. On the other hand, don&#x27;t buy from this buyer. Ever. And if you must buy from this buyer, don&#x27;t choose the 5 oz, for heaven&#x27;s sake. You WILL be sent a 3.3 oz if you pay for the 5. Don&#x27;t fall for it. Just order the smaller size.</li>
    <li> My son really loves this cologne, it has a great smell, it last for all day long!! :D&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
    <li> Frankly, I thought the black bottle will make it different from the transparent bottle that I used to use. Basically, it&#x27;s the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance satisfies my daily need. the price is okay also.</li>
    <li> Very good presentation and smell  very good, amazing product for this price. And my wife loved I&#x27;m very happy for this</li>
    <li> They say it&#x27;s 5 ounces but I receives a 2.5 ounces only. Its a good perfume smells great but trully disapointed that amazon don&#x27;t verify what they sell.</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume, it&#x27;s not too soft or strong, it&#x27;s perfect for a night out or for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you smell this good ladies will want to stay close, great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I owned this perfume before, but this one just last about an hour. I am sure this is original, but just it must be very old stock and may be result of bad warehousing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend to buy, don&#x27;t go with the low price. Product is not worth of spending.</li>
    <li> the fragrance does not last long enough</li>
