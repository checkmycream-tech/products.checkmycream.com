### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are the blades I&#x27;ve found that works best for me.</li>
      <li>Great Service!</li>
      <li>Awesome razors.</li>
      <li>For me, they are the perfect match for an adjustable fat boy razor.</li>
      <li>Great quality and sharpness.</li>
      <li>Great Product.  </li>
      <li>They seem to be of good quality so good luck if you decide to go with these.</li>
      <li>I tried them three times and never got a good shave from them.  </li>
      <li>Works good for shaving my arms but wouldn&#x27;t dare use these on my face.</li>
      <li>The Merkur and Feather blades ... and others too ... seem to provide good performance but can&#x27;t match the Astra and Dorco cost wise.</li>
      <li>I thought, &amp;#34;How could the company that makes cheap pens make a good razor blade?&amp;#34; Well, they do!</li>
      <li>Great bkade with a smooth glide.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s got the Homer Simpson kind-</li>
      <li>To each their own.  </li>
      <li>Best I found so far!</li>
      <li>BIC razors have been the best ones I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>but compared to feather blades they tug quite a bit more, but to each their own.</li>
      <li>So originally I didn&#x27;t have anything particularly encouraging to say about the Bic blade as I was finding that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get more than about two weeks of shaves out of them (and performance wise I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed either).  </li>
      <li>but, surprisingly,  it may be with this Bic blade that the shave you get (quality wise and service time wise) might actually depend on your razor.  </li>
      <li>These came relatively quickly and are good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>At his price you can change blades every day and still save a ton of money over cartridges... with a better shave.</li>
      <li>both give me better</li>
      <li>For the back of my neck, they work wonderfully.</li>
      <li>They tugged more than they cut.</li>
      <li>I read on a website that these were a writers favorite blades.  </li>
      <li>was a gift for someone that said it was ok ..but wanted a more than 5 in a pak</li>
      <li>was ok ..</li>
      <li>but I seem to get more life out of another manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>Either way, I&#x27;m more than happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying from this seller again.</li>
      <li>I just got ten as I&#x27;m sampling blades to find out which one is best for me, so far the Feather is the best and the BIC is second.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed getting my product so quickly.</li>
      <li>I would say they&#x27;re even fun to use because you shave faster and more recklessly than you can with, say, a Feather blade.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have found the Personna lab blues to be pretty good inexpensive blades but found the Gillette Silver Blues and Permasharp blades give me best shaves for my tough beard.</li>
      <li>Platinum coated chrome steel holds a better edge than stainless steel ever can!</li>
      <li>You have to be very careful with the Feather, I own a 58 fatboy(my favorite) and a 68 slim, but the BIC is more forgiving, and I can get 5-6 shaves from one blade.</li>
      <li>, So far I&#x27;ve tried about 15 different  brands of blades and these blades are the ones that work the best for me.</li>
      <li>This has somewhat surprised me as I haven &#x27;t experienced not getting a good shave in one razor but getting a good shave in the other using the same blade before.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and the seller even gave me a free 5-pack of Zorrik razor blades!</li>
      <li>I had been using Derby blades and wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with a real close shave.</li>
      <li>these blades pinch too much, i thought theyd be better than the derby</li>
      <li>Not bad razor blades</li>
      <li>not bad buy</li>
      <li>Just got the blades and used them for 3 days, very smooth shave so far.</li>
      <li>While these cut the hair cleanly, my handle is pretty aggressive, and combined with the sharpness of these blades, I have a lot of irritation.</li>
      <li>They work GREAT and are not so harsh in my slants.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve found that my favorite two blades are the Astra and the Dorco</li>
      <li>It was an exciting discovery.  </li>
      <li>Almost as good as &amp;#34;Feathers&amp;#34; for a lot less money.  </li>
      <li>will have more to say later.</li>
      <li>And they both do well in either razor (whereas the Bic evidently doesn&#x27;t).</li>
      <li>I think I used the first four Bic blades in the EJ Razor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using a Lord razor, which is economical, less aggressive, and suits my purposes nicely.  </li>
      <li>Then I disposed of the whole pack of Bic Chrome Platinums.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for your product.</li>
      <li>Though I didn&#x27;t get to try the blades yet, my opinion doesn&#x27;t really matter considering that&#x27;s all subjective anyways.</li>
      <li>I tried these and got a much closer, smoother shave.</li>
      <li>A number of decades ago I discovered the Platinum Plus blade and ended up using that blade exclusively for decades  (and learned from that experience the importance of a blade being platinum coated and stainless steel).  </li>
      <li>Tugs on my fur too much.  </li>
      <li>Though there are several brands of blade I still have to try, so far my favorite is the Astra.</li>
      <li>And I mean good shaves I ususally lather up twice, shave with the grain and then against the grain</li>
      <li>They are a mainstay for my razor along with other top tier blades.</li>
      <li>I had read several good reviews that talked about these blades being very sharp yet forgiving, but that wasn&#x27;t my experience.  </li>
      <li>I later tried one more blade from the second box</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing any additional Bic blades as I find that the Astra particularly (and the Dorco too)</li>
      <li>I honestly have to say that I find these blades sharper and longer lasting than Feather blades, but as I said on my review of the Feather blades, they are too sharp for me.</li>
      <li>I normally use Feather brand blades in my safety razors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to safety blades and these seemed to be highly rated wherever I looked.</li>
      <li>(at least that&#x27;s certainly true of the first four blades of the five pack I purchased) ... and its a good deal more expensive than the Astra (and especially the Dorco).  </li>
      <li>But back early in the 2000s I found that the Platinum Plus blades apparently were no longer available.  </li>
      <li>I even tried switching razors, using with my Gillette NEW, my Gillette Tech, and my Merkur 34C.</li>
      <li>So my common experience over many decades has been that a stainless steel platinum coated blade could provide two months of acceptable shaves.   </li>
      <li>which i but in hot water rusted on second use.</li>
      <li>They did not appear to be nearly as sharp as Crystals or Feathers, and they were far from smooth.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; a number of the different stainless steel platinum coated blades.  </li>
      <li>These blades surprised me.</li>
      <li>I had been shaving exclusively with my father&#x27;s two old Gillette razors.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always wet shaved, but the cheap plastic multiple blade razors were tearing my face all too hell, started old school saving about a year ago and have no idea why I ever stopped.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m finding something lately that might be worth mentioning onthe positive side.  </li>
      <li>It was only early last year that I discovered that Amazon provided access to all these different manufacturer&#x27;s stainless steel platinum coated DE blades.  </li>
      <li>The blades are sharp, smooth, efficient, and fairly long lasting.</li>
      <li>This blade is seriously dull and drags across your face like a cheap rake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I went through an entire pack of ten with the same experience, spanned over three separate occasions, and yet still consistently had the same experience.</li>
      <li>THESE ARE COMPLETE &amp; UTTER GARBAGE.</li>
      <li>I can use each side maybe twice if I&#x27;m lucky, but usually, each double-sided razor gets used twice, then it goes into the blade bank.  </li>
      <li>After a desperate search  I was able to find another blade that was stainless and platinum/chrome coated (though I don&#x27;t know who the manufacturer of this blade is ...</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve got similar genetics steer clear of these and try Astra (comparably priced) or Feather (more expensive) instead.</li>
      <li>I am new into wet shaving and decided to give them a try.  </li>
      <li>I know every person&#x27;s face is different and with that being said I found these to be not sharp enough for my facial hair.</li>
      <li>shaves (and both can last two months) and are both a good deal less expensive than the Bic.  </li>
      <li>you want nearly the polar opposite experience, try Feather.</li>
      <li>and a dull knife causes more trouble than a sharpened one.  </li>
      <li>I did not think they were very sharp and certainly did not last long.</li>

<li> only thing that makes me a little wary is that people say when they buy them in bulk (100-packs), they don&#x27;t seem to be the same quality blades you get in the sampler pack, but they&#x27;re so cheap who cares?</li>
<li> I have coarse hair and shave every other day.</li>
<li> I nicked myself several times with these due to the amount of pressure needed in order to get them to cut through my beard.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m 60 yrs old tough beard and sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Recently, I went to a slant safety razor and found the Feathers were a bit harsh on my third pass.</li>
<li> These are fairly sharp razors, but are still not as sharp, and don&#x27;t hold their edge as well as Feather brand razors (my personal preference).  </li>

    <li> These blades surprised me. I thought, &amp;#34;How could the company that makes cheap pens make a good razor blade?&amp;#34; Well, they do! The blades are sharp, smooth, efficient, and fairly long lasting. I would say they&#x27;re even fun to use because you shave faster and more recklessly than you can with, say, a Feather blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that makes me a little wary is that people say when they buy them in bulk (100-packs), they don&#x27;t seem to be the same quality blades you get in the sampler pack, but they&#x27;re so cheap who cares? You can use them once and throw away if you want.</li>
    <li> was ok ..was a gift for someone that said it was ok ..but wanted a more than 5 in a pak</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to safety blades and these seemed to be highly rated wherever I looked. I know every person&#x27;s face is different and with that being said I found these to be not sharp enough for my facial hair. They tugged more than they cut. I&#x27;ve tried Merkur, Wilkinson Sword, and Astra. These Bic blades were 3rd on my list. I have coarse hair and shave every other day. They seem to be of good quality so good luck if you decide to go with these.</li>
    <li> Just got the blades and used them for 3 days, very smooth shave so far. will have more to say later.</li>
    <li> This is my blade of choice. Almost as sharp as a Feather blade but, IMO not as harsh plus in my experience they shave longer then Feather blades</li>
    <li> Great bkade with a smooth glide.</li>
    <li> These are the worst blades I have ever tried, changed them out before I even finished a shave.</li>
    <li> Tugs on my fur too much.  Works good for shaving my arms but wouldn&#x27;t dare use these on my face.</li>
    <li> Tugs at my hubby&#x27;s thick beard, nicks his skin easily, only gets one shave out of each double sided blade.  He&#x27;s got the Homer Simpson kind- 30 seconds after shaving the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow appears.  If you&#x27;ve got similar genetics steer clear of these and try Astra (comparably priced) or Feather (more expensive) instead.</li>
    <li> These are fairly sharp razors, but are still not as sharp, and don&#x27;t hold their edge as well as Feather brand razors (my personal preference).  I can use each side maybe twice if I&#x27;m lucky, but usually, each double-sided razor gets used twice, then it goes into the blade bank.  However, they&#x27;re also a lot cheaper than the feathers, and should work well for all but the coarsest facial hair.</li>
    <li> I read on a website that these were a writers favorite blades.  I am new into wet shaving and decided to give them a try.  They are very sharp and well made but I seem to get more life out of another manufacturer.  I will be buying something else in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome razors. They are in the same category as Feather, Shark, etc (IMHO). They are a mainstay for my razor along with other top tier blades.</li>
    <li> Of all of the razor blades I have tried, these were the worst.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but the first blade I tried felt dull and did not shave well.  I later tried one more blade from the second box but it was no better.  I have found the Personna lab blues to be pretty good inexpensive blades but found the Gillette Silver Blues and Permasharp blades give me best shaves for my tough beard.</li>
    <li> I just got ten as I&#x27;m sampling blades to find out which one is best for me, so far the Feather is the best and the BIC is second. You have to be very careful with the Feather, I own a 58 fatboy(my favorite) and a 68 slim, but the BIC is more forgiving, and I can get 5-6 shaves from one blade. And I mean good shaves I ususally lather up twice, shave with the grain and then against the grain and my face is as slick as a babies butt, So far I&#x27;ve tried about 15 different  brands of blades and these blades are the ones that work the best for me. I&#x27;m 60 yrs old tough beard and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve always wet shaved, but the cheap plastic multiple blade razors were tearing my face all too hell, started old school saving about a year ago and have no idea why I ever stopped. Haven&#x27;t got my 50 feather blades yet, they must be coming on a very slow boat for GOD knows where</li>
    <li> Best I found so far! Platinum coated chrome steel holds a better edge than stainless steel ever can!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch, but when I tried using these blades, they tugged at my face as if they were dull. I tried with several of these blades and decided to throw them in the trash.</li>
    <li> While not the worst double edge blade ever, these are certainly very low on my list.  I had read several good reviews that talked about these blades being very sharp yet forgiving, but that wasn&#x27;t my experience.  They did not appear to be nearly as sharp as Crystals or Feathers, and they were far from smooth.  I nicked myself several times with these due to the amount of pressure needed in order to get them to cut through my beard.  I tried them three times and never got a good shave from them.  I will never purchase these blades again.</li>
    <li> these razors were too dull and would pull my whiskers instead of cutting them</li>
    <li> Got this in a sampler. Simply WORST blades i have ever used.</li>
    <li> I honestly have to say that I find these blades sharper and longer lasting than Feather blades, but as I said on my review of the Feather blades, they are too sharp for me. While these cut the hair cleanly, my handle is pretty aggressive, and combined with the sharpness of these blades, I have a lot of irritation. For the back of my neck, they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I had been using Derby blades and wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with a real close shave. I tried these and got a much closer, smoother shave. They seem to also keep an sharp edge longer than the Derby blades.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wish to appear to opinionated here.  To each their own.  I&#x27;ve just returned to de shaving, but it seems these blades aren&#x27;t sharp as others. and a dull knife causes more trouble than a sharpened one.  I&#x27;m using a Lord razor, which is economical, less aggressive, and suits my purposes nicely.  Though there are several brands of blade I still have to try, so far my favorite is the Astra.</li>
    <li> Great quality and sharpness. I&#x27;ll never go back to cartridge razors. These are the blades I&#x27;ve found that works best for me.</li>
    <li> these blades pinch too much, i thought theyd be better than the derby but no.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used probably two-dozen different brands of DE blades in the last few years, and these are the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried -- by far. I nearly cried out in pain with the first swipe because it pulled and tugged so hard without cutting any hairs. Thinking it was just a manufacturing flaw, I tried two other blades in the same pack, but they were all the same. I even tried switching razors, using with my Gillette NEW, my Gillette Tech, and my Merkur 34C. Awful all around; I never made it through one pass on one cheek. I&#x27;m not kidding, I actually retrieved from the trash a Gillette Silver Blue blade which I&#x27;d used for four previous shaves and used it instead of these. Then I disposed of the whole pack of Bic Chrome Platinums.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed getting my product so quickly. I hope my boyfriend likes these blades. Thank you so much for your product.</li>
    <li> A number of decades ago I discovered the Platinum Plus blade and ended up using that blade exclusively for decades  (and learned from that experience the importance of a blade being platinum coated and stainless steel).  But back early in the 2000s I found that the Platinum Plus blades apparently were no longer available.  After a desperate search  I was able to find another blade that was stainless and platinum/chrome coated (though I don&#x27;t know who the manufacturer of this blade is ... it doesn&#x27;t say on the packs).  I&#x27;ve been using that blade for about 6 or 7 years (and it was an equal to the Platinum Plus blade).  I could get 2 months of &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34; shaves from either of those two blades.  So my common experience over many decades has been that a stainless steel platinum coated blade could provide two months of acceptable shaves.   It was only early last year that I discovered that Amazon provided access to all these different manufacturer&#x27;s stainless steel platinum coated DE blades.  It was an exciting discovery.  So I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; a number of the different stainless steel platinum coated blades.  So far I&#x27;ve found that my favorite two blades are the Astra and the Dorco (but that&#x27;s based on both performance and cost ... not just performance).  The Merkur and Feather blades ... and others too ... seem to provide good performance but can&#x27;t match the Astra and Dorco cost wise. Of all the blades I&#x27;ve tried this past year this Bic has been the most disappointing actually (at least that&#x27;s certainly true of the first four blades of the five pack I purchased) ... and its a good deal more expensive than the Astra (and especially the Dorco).  So originally I didn&#x27;t have anything particularly encouraging to say about the Bic blade as I was finding that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get more than about two weeks of shaves out of them (and performance wise I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed either).  But I&#x27;m finding something lately that might be worth mentioning onthe positive side.  Prior to last April (and back to 1960) I had been shaving exclusively with my father&#x27;s two old Gillette razors.  Along with the blades I discovered the razors on Amazon last year as well.  I now shave with Edwin Jagger and Maggard razors (and I seem to switch off from one to the other ever few months or so).  I think I used the first four Bic blades in the EJ Razor.  But this last Bic blade I&#x27;m using in my Maggard MR18 razor.  And after three weeks this last blade is still in service and isn&#x27;t doing a bad job.  This has somewhat surprised me as I haven &#x27;t experienced not getting a good shave in one razor but getting a good shave in the other using the same blade before.  But that may be the case with this Bic blade ... why I don&#x27;t know ... and whether it will last two months in the Maggard razor, I don&#x27;t know that yet either.  But so far (in these past three weeks) it hasn&#x27;t been doing a bad job.  Though I don&#x27;t know why (since the EJ and the Maggard both have the same 0.030&amp;#34; blade gap) ... but, surprisingly,  it may be with this Bic blade that the shave you get (quality wise and service time wise) might actually depend on your razor.  Again ... I don&#x27;t know why as I&#x27;ve never experienced that before.  However, I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing any additional Bic blades as I find that the Astra particularly (and the Dorco too) both give me better shaves (and both can last two months) and are both a good deal less expensive than the Bic.  And they both do well in either razor (whereas the Bic evidently doesn&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> These came relatively quickly and are good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Not bad razor blades but compared to feather blades they tug quite a bit more, but to each their own.</li>
    <li> BIC razors have been the best ones I&#x27;ve found so far. Gives a close shave without pulling.</li>
    <li> Bought these to try out.  I did not think they were very sharp and certainly did not last long.</li>
    <li> I normally use Feather brand blades in my safety razors. Recently, I went to a slant safety razor and found the Feathers were a bit harsh on my third pass. I would rank them as a 5 on a sharpness scale of 1 to 5. I bought these BIC blades because they are a 4 on the sharpness scale. They work GREAT and are not so harsh in my slants.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Great Service!</li>
    <li> Very thin and flimsy. Have to be carefully blade is sharp will cut you real bad. Price not bad buy</li>
    <li> Not as aggressive as feather but close enough. they are a bit forgiving but are more expensive. I have used them and one o the blades which i but in hot water rusted on second use. I dont know if it was just that blade or all the blades have that problem.</li>
    <li> This blade is seriously dull and drags across your face like a cheap rake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Bic should stick to making throwaway pens.</li>
    <li> For me, they are the perfect match for an adjustable fat boy razor.</li>
    <li> I have a rough beard. To say that these blades are of poor quality is an understatement. First of all, they come pre-sharpened with the edge of a spoon, and second, they don&#x27;t hold even this pathetic edge beyond one downward stroke (one-half stroke for the way I shave) on my face. I went through an entire pack of ten with the same experience, spanned over three separate occasions, and yet still consistently had the same experience. So, I can&#x27;t say this strongly enough: THESE ARE COMPLETE &amp; UTTER GARBAGE. DO NOT BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want nearly the polar opposite experience, try Feather.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as &amp;#34;Feathers&amp;#34; for a lot less money.  At his price you can change blades every day and still save a ton of money over cartridges... with a better shave.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the seller even gave me a free 5-pack of Zorrik razor blades! But this may have been because I purchased 15 blades from this seller. These blades came in two packs of 5 blades. Though I didn&#x27;t get to try the blades yet, my opinion doesn&#x27;t really matter considering that&#x27;s all subjective anyways. Either way, I&#x27;m more than happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying from this seller again.</li>
