      <li>Loved the colors.</li>
      <li>This is a great deal i fell in love with these eyeliners</li>
      <li>the price alone is a steal, very satisfied with this purchase..</li>
      <li>I love them all &amp; can&#x27;t wait to try them on!</li>
      <li>But, most of all you can get a good 6 - 8 hour wear out of these before having to freshen up.</li>
      <li>theres sooo many colors to try and I&#x27;m in love! :-)</li>
      <li>The colors are great, its pretty liquidy, so if you want a lot of sparkle you need to build it up, its not pigmented</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really love it, exactly what i wanted for my eyeliner, and looks great.</li>
      <li>Beautiful, vibrant colors.</li>
      <li>It gives the glitter something to stick to and the colors pop a lot more.</li>
      <li>I love the versatility of having more than one color.  </li>
      <li>However, these are sooo cute.</li>
      <li>but i wish there where more glittery but almost all glitter liners are like this anyway</li>
      <li>You can dip the brush many times, but nothing remains in the eyelid.  </li>
      <li>Great-fantastic and fun!!</li>
      <li>They where shipped super fasted packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>the liners are very opaque in color, and apply very smoothly and easily!!</li>
      <li>THESE TUBES OF SPARKLE WERE LARGE, COLORFUL, AND VERY NICE.</li>
      <li>These glitter liners go on smooth and sparkle away after applied.  </li>
      <li>They are more vibrant and sparkly in person which I love.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m excited about that.</li>
      <li>So I got super excited when I saw that 12 colors of this stuff was available for under $20.  </li>
      <li>I will do an in-depth research on a good quality eyeliner with glitter effect in the future.</li>
      <li>So far these have gone on nice</li>
      <li>The picture does not show the liners true colors.</li>
      <li>that is the same color as the glitter and then apply these over top to make them stand out better.</li>
      <li>I rarely wear eyeliner, but these were still pretty easy to apply.</li>
      <li>really ?!?!  </li>
      <li>Since they are glitter, I found they look better over my black eye liners rather than just on their own.</li>
      <li>These wear well and are a lot of fun to experiment with</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get more glitter eye liners only to find you can&#x27;t see it when it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
      <li>but you will get the sparkle you need with the right</li>
      <li>But with soap and water, it melts right off.  </li>
      <li>especially compared to other higher end brands which would have costed much more then this...very pleased!!</li>
      <li>the different colors makes it great for different occasions.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I bought this for my teen, they were a great price, but very low quality.</li>
      <li>All these liners are good for are for adding a little sparkle&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
      <li>When I got to the turquoise color (one of the prettiest in the bunch and one of the reasons I ordered the set in the first place)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found they work better if you first line with a regular eye liner first.</li>
      <li>GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU LIKE SPARKLY EYELINERS AND WANT YOUR EYES TO REALLY POP!</li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED, SHIPPING WAS QUICK.</li>
      <li>Even just to work it didn&#x27;t seem like too much.</li>
      <li>But i was really surprised at the fun i had with some of the brighter colors.</li>
      <li>I really like these alot and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
      <li>A couple of the tubes where very waterery and could not be used...</li>
      <li>For the price, i really didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
      <li>I got these yesterday and the shipping was fast because I have AMAZON PRIME.</li>
      <li>still decent</li>
      <li>Lots of fun colors and enough to share with a friend!</li>
      <li>It is so sporadic when you apply it, I&#x27;m throwing mine out, not even worth sending back.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bunch of color glitter in this clear solution that you can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;put</li>
      <li>you can only really see the glitter.</li>
      <li>The only thig is that they are all pretty sheer when applied alone...</li>
      <li>The seller put them in their own little black box and thats how i keep them.</li>
      <li>The package came squished and i was afraid the liners were damaged, but NO they were in good shape.</li>
      <li>and these are super watery less glitter &amp; dry like kid glitter glue....</li>

<li> and these are super watery less glitter &amp; dry like kid glitter glue....</li>
<li> When I pulled the brush out, it was damaged, like someone had pulled it out, possibly used it, and stuffed it back in really rough causing the bristles to poke out in every direction instead of in a smooth, thin point like the rest.  </li>
<li> This made me sad because it was on the two black ones which are the ones I was hoping to wear most often.</li>
<li> Like some of the reviews I read, you do have to add a second coat - only on a few of the colors.</li>
<li> I sat down and began to open and swipe each of them on my hand.  </li>
<li> I notice it&#x27;s not a very dense amount of glitter.  </li>
<li> You can just put a little for a subtle sparkle, or layer for something more dramatic.</li>
<li> So, that felt a little strange.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors.</li>
<li> Since I&#x27;m a beginner, I&#x27;m still in practice mode and don&#x27;t want to spend high-end prices until I get it down.  </li>
<li> And i also thought i&#x27;d probably just use the black.</li>
<li> Today i used the black and layered with the teal and green to match my outfit.</li>
<li> For instance, I didn&#x27;t get a purple one or a lime green one.  </li>
<li> package came a few days late due to it being &#x27;lost or misplaced&#x27; during the delivery.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
<li> She had a hard time getting them to show up when applied.</li>
<li> the glitter was thick an dryed with out cracking</li>
<li> Too watery, can not see the color of the glitter on your eyes at all, very poor quality, should not have wasted my money on it!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to eye make-up and one of the cosmetics that seem to give eyes a dramatic look without the effort is glitter eye liner.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m afraid to use two of them as the seal was completely broken when I received them.</li>
<li> So that was disappointing.  </li>
<li> When you put it on your eye you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s glitter from the water base that is in it.  </li>
<li> These glittered eyeliners are the worst ever.  </li>
<li> Horrible experience.  </li>
<li> I hate it!</li>

    <li> I got these yesterday and the shipping was fast because I have AMAZON PRIME. I&#x27;m 15, and LOVEEEEE GLITTER EYELINER..this definitely brought a lot of attention to my eyes..theres sooo many colors to try and I&#x27;m in love! :-) GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU LIKE SPARKLY EYELINERS AND WANT YOUR EYES TO REALLY POP!</li>
    <li> So I order these eye liners because iv purchased two at my local Wal-Mart an loved them but these ones all though they are the same brand an same image they are not the same glitter type...the ones I bought at the store the glitter was thick an dryed with out cracking and these are super watery less glitter &amp; dry like kid glitter glue....still decent I guess I use them on my daughter for dress up I dont use them often.</li>
    <li> The picture does not show the liners true colors. They are more vibrant and sparkly in person which I love. The only thig is that they are all pretty sheer when applied alone...you can only really see the glitter. I usually line my eyes with a solid pencil liner first that is the same color as the glitter and then apply these over top to make them stand out better.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal i fell in love with these eyeliners so i just had to buy them. They where shipped super fasted packaged nicely. The colors are awesome but i wish there where more glittery but almost all glitter liners are like this anyway so i dont mind and everyone else seems to like them as well so im happy with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible experience.  These glittered eyeliners are the worst ever.  You can dip the brush many times, but nothing remains in the eyelid.  I contact the seller and they told me this is an issue of preference…… really ?!?!  Save your money!  DO NOT BUY this product.  I will do an in-depth research on a good quality eyeliner with glitter effect in the future.</li>
    <li> A couple of the tubes where very waterery and could not be used...The ones that could where great!!</li>
    <li> The colors are great, its pretty liquidy, so if you want a lot of sparkle you need to build it up, its not pigmented but you will get the sparkle you need with the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;Really love it, exactly what i wanted for my eyeliner, and looks great. It puts a sparkle in your eyes lol and makes your eyes pop.&lt;br /&gt;All the different colors makes it great for different occasions.&lt;br /&gt;The package came a few days late due to it being &#x27;lost or misplaced&#x27; during the delivery. The package came squished and i was afraid the liners were damaged, but NO they were in good shape. The seller put them in their own little black box and thats how i keep them.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter LOVES these!</li>
    <li> Great-fantastic and fun!! This is a great way to sparkle up your eyes! Lots of fun colors and enough to share with a friend!</li>
    <li> These glitter liners go on smooth and sparkle away after applied.  I love the versatility of having more than one color.  I really like these alot and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> For the price, i really didn&#x27;t expect much. And i also thought i&#x27;d probably just use the black. But i was really surprised at the fun i had with some of the brighter colors. I rarely wear eyeliner, but these were still pretty easy to apply. You can just put a little for a subtle sparkle, or layer for something more dramatic. Today i used the black and layered with the teal and green to match my outfit. Even just to work it didn&#x27;t seem like too much. And hours later it&#x27;s still visible. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors. I&#x27;ve found they work better if you first line with a regular eye liner first. It gives the glitter something to stick to and the colors pop a lot more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to eye make-up and one of the cosmetics that seem to give eyes a dramatic look without the effort is glitter eye liner.  So I got super excited when I saw that 12 colors of this stuff was available for under $20.  Since I&#x27;m a beginner, I&#x27;m still in practice mode and don&#x27;t want to spend high-end prices until I get it down.  The eyeliners got here in the mail today.  Great delivery time.  Package was in good shape.  There were 12 different colors just like the description says, but not necessarily all the colors shown in the picture.  For instance, I didn&#x27;t get a purple one or a lime green one.  But all the colors are different.  They came delivered in a brown envelope all thrown in together.  They weren&#x27;t in a display box or anything.  So, that felt a little strange.  I sat down and began to open and swipe each of them on my hand.  I notice it&#x27;s not a very dense amount of glitter.  It took about 3+ strokes to get a solid line of glitter.  When I got to the turquoise color (one of the prettiest in the bunch and one of the reasons I ordered the set in the first place) I saw that the outer protective plastic was already removed, unlike the others.  When I pulled the brush out, it was damaged, like someone had pulled it out, possibly used it, and stuffed it back in really rough causing the bristles to poke out in every direction instead of in a smooth, thin point like the rest.  So that was disappointing.  But I must say, I am impressed how the glitter stays in place when it dries.  You can run your fingers across it several times, not one piece of glitter comes off.  But with soap and water, it melts right off.  So I&#x27;m excited about that.</li>
    <li> I just got these and they look awesome but I&#x27;m afraid to use two of them as the seal was completely broken when I received them. This made me sad because it was on the two black ones which are the ones I was hoping to wear most often.</li>
    <li> Just got these in the mail &amp; each one is amazing! I love them all &amp; can&#x27;t wait to try them on!</li>
    <li> So far these have gone on nice</li>
    <li> the liners are very opaque in color, and apply very smoothly and easily!! great colors and quantity, the colors are great, and the stay put power of the liners is very good as well!! the price alone is a steal, very satisfied with this purchase..especially compared to other higher end brands which would have costed much more then this...very pleased!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product!!!  All these liners are good for are for adding a little sparkle&lt;br /&gt;to your eyelashes.  It&#x27;s a bunch of color glitter in this clear solution that you can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;put on your eye cause the glitter gets in your eye and hurts something terrible!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product, because you can&#x27;t even use it as eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Like some of the reviews I read, you do have to add a second coat - only on a few of the colors. However, these are sooo cute. Since they are glitter, I found they look better over my black eye liners rather than just on their own. I work 12 hours days and these things last all day!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, vibrant colors. You can actually see it after one application.  But, most of all you can get a good 6 - 8 hour wear out of these before having to freshen up.</li>
    <li> THESE TUBES OF SPARKLE WERE LARGE, COLORFUL, AND VERY NICE. THE PRODUCT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED, SHIPPING WAS QUICK. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY CHOICE.</li>
    <li> This eye liner is aweful!! It&#x27;s basically water with some glitter in it .. When you put it on your eye you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s glitter from the water base that is in it.  I hate it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen, they were a great price, but very low quality. She had a hard time getting them to show up when applied.</li>
    <li> This does NOT work!  I was so excited to get more glitter eye liners only to find you can&#x27;t see it when it&#x27;s applied.  It is so sporadic when you apply it, I&#x27;m throwing mine out, not even worth sending back.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
    <li> These wear well and are a lot of fun to experiment with</li>
    <li> Deceiving! Too watery, can not see the color of the glitter on your eyes at all, very poor quality, should not have wasted my money on it! When you try to put it on, it feels like glue on your eye lids!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves all the glitter eyeliner, good quality. . . . . . . . . . .  .</li>
    <li> These suck...  Watery..</li>
    <li> Good bargain.  Loved the colors.</li>
