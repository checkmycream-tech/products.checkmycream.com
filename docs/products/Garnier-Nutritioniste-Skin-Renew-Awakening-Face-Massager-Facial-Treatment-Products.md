      <li>I am very happy with the product I am planning on ordering two more bottles by end of month....</li>
      <li>Like many of Garnier&#x27;s products, it has a wonderful smell.  </li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Garnier&#x27;s Hair &amp; Skin products</li>
      <li>This stuff feels really good on your skin, I love how you roll it on.</li>
      <li>It is very nice roll on the skin and leaves me Garnier skin smooth and not sticky</li>
      <li>But a suggestion: try using this handy, easily portable Skin Renew product on the backs of your hands.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and feels nice when you are rolling it, but does not absorb well.</li>
      <li>It also smells good, not too strong but really light.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this awakening face treatment, I put it as a foundation before makeup</li>
      <li>i hope i love it</li>
      <li>The product itself, does an appropriate amount of what it claims...not something the seller has any control over.</li>
      <li>Makes it look healthier and more radiant.</li>
      <li>I also bought Garnier Skin Renew for eyes, and I love both of the products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my complexion since I started using this ...</li>
      <li>this product is ok.</li>
      <li>Love how it makes my face feel....cool and soothing</li>
      <li>I used to love Oil of Olay.</li>
      <li>I hope this doesn&#x27;t go off the market, it is one of my most favorite face creams.</li>
      <li>It was okay, being as I had ordered it for myself, but as a gift for someone....</li>
      <li>, just okay.</li>
      <li>and it truly makes my face lift up and look vibrant and great.</li>
      <li>I love this product light , non- greasy.  </li>
      <li>The Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Awaken Face Massager is an easy way to apply lotion.  </li>
      <li>My mom gave me a bottle of this product to try out, and the first thing I noticed was the nice smell.  </li>
      <li>Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Awaken Face Massager is another in Garnier&#x27;s fine line of renewing moisturizers for the face.  </li>
      <li>While the roller ball applicator is a handy way for this particular serum-like liquid, I wouldn&#x27;t say it really massages my face--- it does feel good on my cheeks, though.  </li>
      <li>Skip this one - until a fragrance free version comes around (which may be never....)</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy and can go anywhere.</li>
      <li>Goes on cool and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Is an excellent product, my skin is tight, it looks fresh, my make up lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>great product for young and old !!</li>
      <li>but i cant tell a difference yet, maybe after the full bottle is used.</li>
      <li>Well this product come really secure the delivery was on time I like this brand just because it worth it for me.</li>
      <li>not a bad product, it smooths the skin</li>
      <li>It does massage your face and for the most part the roller ball rolls steadily when applying the lotion.  </li>
      <li>My neck looks firmer, &amp; that&#x27;s exactly the result I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
      <li>I like it so far - but need more time to tell if it really helps.</li>
      <li>Its not really what I wanted but, for those looking for something to rub on their face its ok!</li>
      <li>The lotion is a wonderfully light liquid that just seems to hydrate my skin better than other lotions.  </li>
      <li>most likely would not buy it again and instead try another product on the market.  </li>
      <li>It is more like a strong perfume, not suitable for the face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems to work fine although it is necessary to spread the lotion on your face after applying.  </li>
      <li>This has REALLY reduced the bags under my eyes.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>For those of you who have ever used roll-on deodorant the ball applicator will be very reminiscent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are looking for really noticeable results, I would try something else.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and just a tiny bit moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Just kidding about the face on fire but really does give you that awak sensation to your skin as if it is a hint of menthol to rejuvenate your skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my puffy eyes either.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>But if your looking for a light and subtle skin refresher with a lovely scent, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
      <li>I mainly like it because it is light and refreshing and does have a subtle awakening effect on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I used to buy it frequently at the pharmacy and cannot find anymore, very thankful that Amazon sells it!</li>
      <li>I just hope I will be able to get the same product in the future!  </li>
      <li>okay, not bad, not good</li>
      <li>Definitely not suitable for people with even mild sensitivities or mild allergies.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
      <li>My face is sensitive got some break out.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It did moisturize my face - but as far as awakening my skin ?</li>
      <li>Besides the slight burning sensation I say it&#x27;s a pretty decent moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t just buy anything to put on my face &amp; neck---it has to deliver results, be affordable, &amp; make sense as a daily use or frequent use product.</li>
      <li>I have normal to oily skin, and I found that I can use it alone after I wash my face and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles</li>
      <li>For those whose hand skin is aging and is blemished by age spots, frequent use (several times a day) of this product simply rolled on the backs of hands and then smoothed/massaged into the skin to encourage absorption will result in much younger appearing hands.  </li>

<li> Good product but does not moisturize that well when the weather is very cold.</li>
<li> Basically left me face wet, smelling like citrus and then a bit sticky.</li>
<li> Left my face wet.</li>
<li> Refreshes and hydrates my dry skin.  </li>
<li> This does nothing for my face at all but dry it out.</li>
<li> I have had to supplement with an additional moisturizer because my skin feels dry.</li>
<li> Also I use it over and over to get more results during the day if my eyes are particularly bad.</li>
<li> , I&#x27;m guessing not really.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s wet, really wet---</li>
<li> This was the reason I got it, based on other reviews that said it helped with that.</li>
<li> It massages and puts a thin layer of lotion on my face at the same time.</li>
<li> Given this it does require your hands to get a bit messy.  </li>
<li> I am not sure what this product was supposed to do for me, but I stopped using it after giving it a week trial.</li>
<li> its not good just a waist of money</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with it just not quite what I was expecting.</li>
<li> Not a cure all, but especially in cold weather it does seem to retard the appearance of aging hand skin!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and have not seen any improvement for the bags under my eyes.  This was the reason I got it, based on other reviews that said it helped with that. But, I give it 3 stars for how it brightens up your skin on your face! Makes it look healthier and more radiant. I&#x27;d probably buy it again for that reason.</li>
    <li> Good product but does not moisturize that well when the weather is very cold. I have had to supplement with an additional moisturizer because my skin feels dry.</li>
    <li> Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Awaken Face Massager is another in Garnier&#x27;s fine line of renewing moisturizers for the face.  But a suggestion: try using this handy, easily portable Skin Renew product on the backs of your hands.  For those whose hand skin is aging and is blemished by age spots, frequent use (several times a day) of this product simply rolled on the backs of hands and then smoothed/massaged into the skin to encourage absorption will result in much younger appearing hands.  Yes, it works well on puffy eyes, but keep an extra container around (pocket/purse/glove compartment) and use it regularly on the hands.  Not a cure all, but especially in cold weather it does seem to retard the appearance of aging hand skin! Grady Harp, December 11</li>
    <li> its not good just a waist of money</li>
    <li> The Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Awaken Face Massager is an easy way to apply lotion.  It does massage your face and for the most part the roller ball rolls steadily when applying the lotion.  Every so often, the ball gets a bit stuck.  For those of you who have ever used roll-on deodorant the ball applicator will be very reminiscent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work fine although it is necessary to spread the lotion on your face after applying.  Given this it does require your hands to get a bit messy.  Does my face understand it is getting a massage, I&#x27;m guessing not really.  Not seeing any different results to the lotion I was wearing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most likely would not buy it again and instead try another product on the market.  Nothing wrong with it just not quite what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> My face is sensitive got some break out.  But still use it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Might not order this again.  But will finish it.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, fragrance of this product.  I have actually worn only this product without lotion on my face.</li>
    <li> have been looking for this ! it is wonderful and easy to apply ! great product for young and old !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wet, really wet---so when rolling this onto your face, remember that it suggest doing so for one minute...I use it on my neck, too, &amp; give that a 5 star rating because it&#x27;s easier to handle all the wetness, &amp; it works: My neck looks firmer, &amp; that&#x27;s exactly the result I&#x27;m looking for! I don&#x27;t just buy anything to put on my face &amp; neck---it has to deliver results, be affordable, &amp; make sense as a daily use or frequent use product. This product exceeded my expectations because I didn&#x27;t know it existed,  &amp; was looking for an under eye-roller when I found this.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles but I would not be without it for eye puffiness. It is quick and easy and can go anywhere. Also I use it over and over to get more results during the day if my eyes are particularly bad.</li>
    <li> This does nothing for my face at all but dry it out. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this awakening face treatment, I put it as a foundation before makeup and it truly makes my face lift up and look vibrant and great. I used to buy it frequently at the pharmacy and cannot find anymore, very thankful that Amazon sells it!</li>
    <li> This has REALLY reduced the bags under my eyes. I just hope I will be able to get the same product in the future!  Pam</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  All the Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew products are terrific!</li>
    <li> Does as advertised.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My mom gave me a bottle of this product to try out, and the first thing I noticed was the nice smell.  Like many of Garnier&#x27;s products, it has a wonderful smell.  While the roller ball applicator is a handy way for this particular serum-like liquid, I wouldn&#x27;t say it really massages my face--- it does feel good on my cheeks, though.  I mainly like it because it is light and refreshing and does have a subtle awakening effect on my skin.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and just a tiny bit moisturized.  I have normal to oily skin, and I found that I can use it alone after I wash my face and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  I have only applied it in the morning and in the evening after I wash my face, but if I were traveling, perhaps I&#x27;d try it throughout the day.  If you are looking for really noticeable results, I would try something else. But if your looking for a light and subtle skin refresher with a lovely scent, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> not a bad product, it smooths the skin but i cant tell a difference yet, maybe after the full bottle is used.</li>
    <li> I like it so far - but need more time to tell if it really helps.</li>
    <li> The reason I came to this website today was to see if I could find this product.  I am almost out, so I want to order another bottle.  The lotion is a wonderfully light liquid that just seems to hydrate my skin better than other lotions.  I like the fragrance, too.</li>
    <li> It is very nice roll on the skin and leaves me Garnier skin smooth and not sticky</li>
    <li> I love this product light , non- greasy.  The ball massager is an added plus and glides on product smoother.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my face feel....cool and soothing</li>
    <li> i never your this befor i will try it to night  i hope i love it</li>
    <li> Is an excellent product, my skin is tight, it looks fresh, my make up lasts all day.  I am very happy with the product I am planning on ordering two more bottles by end of month....thanks</li>
    <li> this is a product that just works okay, not bad, not good, just okay. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it once.</li>
    <li> I hope this doesn&#x27;t go off the market, it is one of my most favorite face creams. I used to love Oil of Olay. But im so glad I have found another great product, I love this!</li>
    <li> Just kidding about the face on fire but really does give you that awak sensation to your skin as if it is a hint of menthol to rejuvenate your skin. Def will buy again in the future to come.</li>
    <li> Well this product come really secure the delivery was on time I like this brand just because it worth it for me. Thanks</li>
    <li> I also bought Garnier Skin Renew for eyes, and I love both of the products.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product igen.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns. I have sensitive skin so it might just be me, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve always liked Garnier&#x27;s Hair &amp; Skin products but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still use it occasionally, mind you. I like how it applies and makes my skin look. Besides the slight burning sensation I say it&#x27;s a pretty decent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Meh--- this product is ok. It did moisturize my face - but as far as awakening my skin ? No--- I do not think so.</li>
    <li> Basically left me face wet, smelling like citrus and then a bit sticky. I am not sure what this product was supposed to do for me, but I stopped using it after giving it a week trial.</li>
    <li> The box arrived damaged for the actual package. It seems as if someone had opened it and then stuffed this product back into it. It was okay, being as I had ordered it for myself, but as a gift for someone....no. The product itself, does an appropriate amount of what it claims...not something the seller has any control over.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels really good on your skin, I love how you roll it on. It has a nice smell &amp; makes your makeup look really good too!</li>
    <li> Goes on cool and smooth.  Refreshes and hydrates my dry skin.  Does not clog pores.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It massages and puts a thin layer of lotion on my face at the same time. It also smells good, not too strong but really light.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and feels nice when you are rolling it, but does not absorb well. Left my face wet. I am going to try it on my hands as another customer suggested to see if that has any effect. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my puffy eyes either.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon, but paid 7 bucks for this.  It is more like a strong perfume, not suitable for the face.  Definitely not suitable for people with even mild sensitivities or mild allergies.  Skip this one - until a fragrance free version comes around (which may be never....)</li>
    <li> Twice a day and it helps some</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change sine I&#x27;ve been using it.  But try it for your self it might work for you.</li>
    <li> Its not really what I wanted but, for those looking for something to rub on their face its ok!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  So happy to find it on amazon .</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my complexion since I started using this ... it feels great on my skin and is not greasy</li>
</ol>
