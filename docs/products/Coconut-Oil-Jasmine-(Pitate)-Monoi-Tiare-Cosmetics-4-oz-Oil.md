      <li>Delivery was great.</li>
      <li>I use it for Indian Head massages and it works great and my clients love it too!!</li>
      <li>It smells so good and is great to work with.</li>
      <li>it should smell wonderfully and of strong Jasmine but</li>
      <li>Had to shake it up well because the oils and plant ferrels become colloidal and need a good shake to get them flowing.</li>
      <li>Smells good</li>
      <li>This wonderfully smelling oil is light yet emollient on the skin.</li>
      <li>Anyway, still smells good, and still works like coconut oil and vitamin e oil do.</li>
      <li>Had to have more...Smells so good</li>
      <li>I like the oil for my hair but the smell isn&#x27;t as good as I thought.</li>
      <li>Amazing smell</li>
      <li>Oil will melt upon touch since your hands can warm it too.</li>
      <li>and you just need to run it under warm water</li>
      <li>Plus my skin gets so supple and smells nice too.</li>
      <li>It does harden under 70 degrees but get a cup full of hot sink water and put the bottle in it for about a minute or 2 and its perfect consistancy.</li>
      <li>Nice light floral.</li>
      <li>but perhaps it was meant for a more tropical climate.</li>
      <li>This smells fantastic !</li>
      <li>The vanilla scent is way better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is liquid in temps of 80 or more.</li>
      <li>they should be able to return it.</li>
      <li>The results are immediate and I am extremely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I am now using the Sandalwood which I love.</li>
      <li>I really love using Monoi oil on my skin and hair.</li>
      <li>and I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It is ok</li>
      <li>will definitly make this a summer staple, and buy this product from this seller again :)</li>
      <li>I love this lightly scented oil for my hair, and body.</li>
      <li>yes I&#x27;m back in the P.I. with a beautiful sunset on the beach and the china sea breeze wafting up  fragrance of flowers and tropical fruits.</li>
      <li>Their vanilla one is a much better option in comparison to being true to smell</li>
      <li>Lightly scented.</li>
      <li>This smells really nice and makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much oil because it is so very rich in emolients.</li>
      <li>This product is very moisturizing and easily absorbs into the skin an hair..</li>
      <li>These are the best oils for the body and so affordable the only way to go for those cracked dry heels and feet.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found a skin regimen that&#x27;s kept things calm.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
      <li>It is coconut oil, if it becomes cloudy or solid, just warm up.</li>
      <li>and still I have a bottle of lotion, they said they will not refund my order because they sent the right item.</li>
      <li>Put in hot water it returns to oil form.  </li>
      <li>, this was exactly what Id hoped for.</li>
      <li>I preferred the Sandalwood and decided to use this one first since it wasn&#x27;t my favourite.</li>
      <li>I usually drop mine in a sink with warm water in the winter, by the time I&#x27;m ready for it, it is smooth and yummy</li>
      <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like this one much because I thought the smell too sweet/floral.</li>
      <li>I just want to clarify that pure coconut oil solidifies at room temperature</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It is a creamy oil that doesn&#x27;t leave a high shine.</li>
      <li>My skin and hair feel very soft after using.</li>
      <li>wow !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered Monoi oil many times (from other websites) and I&#x27;ve received actual clear oil...not opaque lotion.</li>
      <li>I ordered the item from and the picture clearly showed a clear bottle of oil....</li>
      <li>Its all natural too.</li>
      <li>the bottle i received smelled like rancid old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>I thought this was literally going to just be coconut oil and and some natural jasmine scent.</li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Light oil that really sinks into my skin and is absorbed well.</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t smell like jasmine at all, so that was pretty disappointing!</li>
<li> then they said it is due to the extreme cold conditions while shipping that turned the oil into lotion</li>
<li> Needless to say I was disappointed in the amount of money I spent on a poor quality product , not a happy customer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff smells awesome. Nice light floral. Moisturizes just like coconut oil and vitamin E tend to do. I don&#x27;t know why there is &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; as an ingredient, because I thought the fragrance was supposed to come from the jasmine. Anyway, still smells good, and still works like coconut oil and vitamin e oil do.</li>
    <li> I like the oil for my hair but the smell isn&#x27;t as good as I thought. The vanilla scent is way better. Delivery was great.</li>
    <li> Smells good and I love how it makes my hair feel. A lil pricey for such a small bottle but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this lightly scented oil for my hair, and body. It has also helped my nails. It is coconut oil, if it becomes cloudy or solid, just warm up. I usually drop mine in a sink with warm water in the winter, by the time I&#x27;m ready for it, it is smooth and yummy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light oil that really sinks into my skin and is absorbed well. Lightly scented.</li>
    <li> Needless to say I was disappointed in the amount of money I spent on a poor quality product , not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> These are the best oils for the body and so affordable the only way to go for those cracked dry heels and feet.  Plus my skin gets so supple and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> My skin and hair feel very soft after using.</li>
    <li> Very nice, fragrance is wonderful. Mixes well with my lotions and potions!</li>
    <li> I will be a regular for this product I it in my hair and for my skin .I like mix it in my lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this and and along with the Sandalwood one. At first, I didn&#x27;t like this one much because I thought the smell too sweet/floral. I preferred the Sandalwood and decided to use this one first since it wasn&#x27;t my favourite. I got used to the scent after a while and have since finished the bottle. I am now using the Sandalwood which I love. I will repurchase both and maybe try out a few other scents.</li>
    <li> This wonderfully smelling oil is light yet emollient on the skin. Use it after bathing and you skin remains supple throughout the day. keeps the scalp nourished without the heavy grease feel.</li>
    <li> Had to shake it up well because the oils and plant ferrels become colloidal and need a good shake to get them flowing. You don&#x27;t need much oil because it is so very rich in emolients. Ahhhh yes I&#x27;m back in the P.I. with a beautiful sunset on the beach and the china sea breeze wafting up  fragrance of flowers and tropical fruits. Very Lovely!</li>
    <li> I may look like lotion in cooler temps.  Put in hot water it returns to oil form.  I take it in the shower by the time I am done it is liquid.  Awesome and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like jasmine at all, so that was pretty disappointing! Their vanilla one is a much better option in comparison to being true to smell</li>
    <li> The photo AmericanRX had on their Amazon page was that of a bottle of oil, the title of the product says, &amp;#34;Coconut Oil Jasmine (Pitate) Monoi Tiare Cosmetics 4 oz Oil&amp;#34;, what I received was a bottle of lotion. I asked them why I received lotion instead of the oil, they wanted to see pictures of the barcode, item, etc. which I sent, I even sent them the picture of the Amazon web page I ordered the item from and the picture clearly showed a clear bottle of oil....then they said it is due to the extreme cold conditions while shipping that turned the oil into lotion and if I wait it will melt back to oil....it&#x27;s been two weeks and still I have a bottle of lotion, they said they will not refund my order because they sent the right item. I&#x27;ve ordered Monoi oil many times (from other websites) and I&#x27;ve received actual clear oil...not opaque lotion. I think if a customer is not satisfied with the products they receive they should be able to return it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a treatment for my hair and also as a skin moisturizer. The key is, a little goes a long way!!! Love it</li>
    <li> I thought this was literally going to just be coconut oil and and some natural jasmine scent. However, it has &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; added which I think is what made me break out in little pustules wherever I put it....gross. I do have sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve found a skin regimen that&#x27;s kept things calm. It&#x27;s not like I slathered this on my face or anything. Just put a little on my wrists and clavicle. Big mistake. Use with caution!</li>
    <li> Have used this product before but had never purchased it on amazon.  it should smell wonderfully and of strong Jasmine but the bottle i received smelled like rancid old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> I really love using Monoi oil on my skin and hair. This product is very moisturizing and easily absorbs into the skin an hair.. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the smell. The smell reminds me of a perfume my great-grandma use to wear.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this when I went to Tahiti back in 2000. Had to have more...Smells so good</li>
    <li> I just want to clarify that pure coconut oil solidifies at room temperature and you just need to run it under warm water and it will be fluid again. Alternatively, empty it in a jar and you can just scoop it out. Oil will melt upon touch since your hands can warm it too.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re very happy to receive the product and the packaging was good. It took a bit longer to arrive than we expected but it was still well within the suggested timeframe.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected. It is ok</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells so good and is great to work with. It does harden under 70 degrees but get a cup full of hot sink water and put the bottle in it for about a minute or 2 and its perfect consistancy. I use it for Indian Head massages and it works great and my clients love it too!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> soothing oil and smells great. Needs to be heated up or warmed in the shower before application. I&#x27;m sure it is liquid in temps of 80 or more.</li>
    <li> Luxurious feel.  Love the scent.  It is solid when not in use.  Leave it in the bottom of tub when showering or bathing so it liquefies for using.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, this was exactly what Id hoped for. Smells just like the Nars Monoi oil only without the Nars pricetag! Only drawback is that the day after I had opened it, the oil had solidified and is now permanantly solid. I can still use it but doesnt look like an oil anymore. I live in LA so its not that cold here but perhaps it was meant for a more tropical climate.</li>
    <li> I use to use a Monoi oil when I was younger, and it came to mind one day when I started tanning for summer. This smells fantastic ! Very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I use after my shower while still damp. I sometimes have combined it with in my bottle of Rainbath bath oil, and wow ! The Monoi keeps my skin glowing, hydrated, and my husband loves the fragance and the feel of my skin. I also run my fingers through my hair after applying and my hair is shiney and well managed and I feel a great conditioner for night/bed time. I gave my sister a bottle, and she cannot get enough of it. I have even rubbed a little onto my lips, and into my nails and cuticles. I remember using a type of this oil mixed with my sun tanning oil back in the day.. but since I am indoor tanning bed this summer, I use after tanning and after shower.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitly make this a summer staple, and buy this product from this seller again :)</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, in perfect condition. The quality of the oil is exceptional! The results are immediate and I am extremely satisfied. I plan to purchase their entire hair oil line! Excellent!</li>
    <li> This smells really nice and makes my skin soft and moisturized. It is a creamy oil that doesn&#x27;t leave a high shine. Its all natural too. I use it on my skin and in my hair. It moisturizes my hair without making it greasy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as a solid in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I heated it up and it became oil but once it cooled down it solidified again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how one has time to keep melting this prior to it&#x27;s use  hence I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I use it on skin, in the bath on hair and I even got a scratch out of my kitchen table with it last week.  Plus it smells divine!!</li>
