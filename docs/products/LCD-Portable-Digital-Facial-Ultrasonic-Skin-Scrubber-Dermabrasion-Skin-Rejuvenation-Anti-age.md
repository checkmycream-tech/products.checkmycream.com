### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>Good company!</li>
      <li>I loved leave my face smoth</li>
      <li>but I had to watch YouTube videos to get a better explanation on how to use it!</li>
      <li>I am loving this thing.</li>
      <li>I almost like it better than microdermabrasion</li>
      <li>LOVE  IT.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re considering chancing it anyway in the hopes of better skin, don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I just love this machine.</li>
      <li>I bought this primarily for the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; function to deal with clogged pores.</li>
      <li>Dont like the product it seems cheap, it doesnt work on lifting mode..</li>
      <li>I used it on clean mode with miceller water</li>
      <li>I would definitely say to spend more money on a better quality product that works.</li>
      <li>From my very first use when it arrived yesterday my skin looks perfected.  </li>
      <li>Seemed to be a great little tool</li>
      <li>Then the first setting &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is used with water &amp; is like a power washing to the skin.</li>
      <li>First, when using it, your hands must touch the two metal strips alongside of it.</li>
      <li>I only wish the product comes with more detail instructions.</li>
      <li>first, no directions.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>set to peel or clean: make a back and forth motion on the skin like you would when mopping the floor.</li>
      <li>The seller was very professional and the price was unbeatable.</li>
      <li>This is a replacement for another unit I wore out over 2 years of frequent use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works as well as our professional machine.</li>
      <li>Over all this product sells for so much more in other shopping network but don&#x27;t they all are them same and works just the same.</li>

    <li> Good product! Good company! Thank You!</li>
    <li> You see the crap flick off your face. I almost like it better than microdermabrasion</li>
    <li> first, no directions. then did receive by e mail and it does not work.</li>
    <li> ME GUSTARIA QUE INCLUYERAN LA INFORMACION DEL PEELING ULTROSONICO TRADUCIDA AL ESPAÑOL.</li>
    <li> The power plug will not work with American outlets! Beware!</li>
    <li> I received it and it was all scratched up and when I tried using it it shocked me twice</li>
    <li> Dont like the product it seems cheap, it doesnt work on lifting mode..</li>
    <li> From my very first use when it arrived yesterday my skin looks perfected.  I used it on clean mode with miceller water and I could hardly believe my eyes!  Pores seemed to vanish.  I am loving this thing.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality, and not a cordless version of this product. I would definitely say to spend more money on a better quality product that works.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing on August of this year and 2 months later does not work</li>
    <li> Seemed to be a great little tool but I had to watch YouTube videos to get a better explanation on how to use it!</li>
    <li> This product really works. I was amazed how well it cleans the deep pores and even out the skin. The seller was very professional and the price was unbeatable. I only wish the product comes with more detail instructions. Over all this product sells for so much more in other shopping network but don&#x27;t they all are them same and works just the same. Don&#x27;t over paid just order from this vender and you&#x27;ll be please with your purchase! I just love this machine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skincare instructor and my colleague has one of these. It&#x27;s works as well as our professional machine. BUT The manual is helpful as you have to figure out the LCD screen by trial &amp; error. First, when using it, your hands must touch the two metal strips alongside of it. Then the first setting &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; is used with water &amp; is like a power washing to the skin. The 2nd setting &amp;#34;tone&amp;#34; is used to penetrate at water based serum like hylauronic acid gel. The 3rd setting &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; can be used with a cleaner. The 4th setting is &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; and has to be used over a conductor gel like ultrasound or aloe Vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;When set to peel or clean: make a back and forth motion on the skin like you would when mopping the floor. When set to tone or lift: use the flat part of the wand in an upward motion like if you were frosting a cake. A setting of 3 bars on the power setting should be highest level to use.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for another unit I wore out over 2 years of frequent use.  I&#x27;m hooked and so are family members I&#x27;ve introduced to this device.  My friend, skin spa owner, uses a similar device.  With regular use I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in skin tone.  Compliments from friends/family on FB photo&#x27;s indicate I appear to be aging slowly and well.  That&#x27;s got to be something.</li>
    <li> PROMPT DELIVERY...ITEM AS DESCRIBED...LOVE  IT.  ONLY DRAWBACK...UNCLEAR IF A PROBLEM WITH UNIT ARISES&lt;br /&gt;WHO AND HOW TO CONTACT TO HAVE PROBLEM ADDRESSED.</li>
    <li> It broke the same day I opened it!  Runs but only on one weak speed and intensity.  Piece if junk!</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily for the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; function to deal with clogged pores. It shocked me and burned the skin off my nose. If you&#x27;re considering chancing it anyway in the hopes of better skin, don&#x27;t. Other than the wound I now have on my face (distracts from the blackheads I guess), it made no difference to the areas I went over prior to getting sizzled.</li>
    <li> I loved leave my face smoth</li>
