      <li>My point for buying this im doing exercise want to have better health, shape.</li>
      <li>I love this garment it works wonders for you.  </li>
      <li>I will order more Vedette items.</li>
      <li>I bought this product to help to shape my body in form fitting clothing.</li>
      <li>Now you may be wondering \\&quot;will I be able to use the restroom without taking this off along with all of my clothes?\\</li>
      <li>I wanted something for my post pardum body and ended up using a $10 compression tank which was waaay more comfortable and easy.</li>
      <li>Overall, great control, very comfortable and</li>
      <li>And the removable straps made it easy to wear my one-shoulder design.</li>
      <li>wasnt so easy putting it on</li>
      <li>when wearing this I can fit easily into a size 8.</li>
      <li>But who said it was supposed to be comfortable?</li>
      <li>Smooth talc powder or powder spray over your legs, hip, and mid-driff area before putting on</li>
      <li>It held in everything and it was comfortable, no bones to deal with.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to have an even firmer mid-driff panel to really hold and widdle the waist-line.</li>
      <li>Comfortable fit.</li>
      <li>I have tried other more xpensive body shapers but none has worked as great as this one.</li>
      <li>I am still trying to loose weight after having my second child and can honestly say this girdle is the best!  </li>
      <li>but the price is right!    </li>
      <li>The price is just right!</li>
      <li>i purchased th emedium size of this garment and it was not bad at all&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
      <li>While it does do a pretty good at slimming me and keeping things &#x27;tucked in&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t really make me look too much thinner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many body shapers, very similar to this one, and absolutely love the way it fits.</li>
      <li>Worked very well, very durable and the quality was amazing.</li>
      <li>I am a size 13 after having my son and the first one was a medium, this time I bought a large and it fits much better.  </li>
      <li>It makes everything that is newly flatted even more flatted.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and I really like the feel.  </li>
      <li>I can not express how much I love this product and WOW</li>
      <li>Not the most comfortable thing to get into, I should have gone a size (or 2) larger!</li>
      <li>So this product isn&#x27;t worth it, I&#x27;d say.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 more (both a size larger than the original)</li>
      <li>but I followed the advice of others and ordered the \\&quot;right\\&quot; size according to the chart and the LARGE was just right for me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning on using it daily for a month to see and at this price it was easy to buy two!</li>
      <li>This is one of the best on the market, to me not only brings you down one size, holds you in and I always perspire just a bit, which helps with my weight loss especially in the summer when I love to wear my halter dresses.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping</li>
      <li>Very comfortable, enough for all day wear.</li>
      <li>It has an opening at the gusset area, so just move your regular underwear to one side and cup yourself and bathroom visits should be problem free!</li>
      <li>The first one ripped because I had acrilic nails, but that is my fault.</li>
      <li>Be sure to get a size or two bigger than you.</li>
      <li>I just had my son in Jan and this product gives me my sexy back!</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much that I purchased a second one.</li>
      <li>When I first saw it it looked like something for a child to wear and the fabric was sort of like a stocking but much stronger.</li>
      <li>There is an opening in the personal area for easy use.</li>
      <li>By the way, if you have large thighs, don&#x27;t order the mid-thigh shaper because it will show bulge.</li>
      <li>Purchased a medium and should have gotten a large</li>
      <li>it was  so hard getting it over my hips, but when i did, i loved my figure</li>
      <li>Havent tried on the item yet, however I am a HUGE fan of Vedette especially 136.</li>
      <li>I bought this product probably hyping it up too much.</li>
      <li>I was very satified</li>
      <li>but it did the job very well.</li>
      <li>My problem is I have a big stomach and this garment have me looking all smooth and sleek.</li>
      <li>But overall, the garment was comfortable.</li>
      <li>I measured a Medium and it doesn&#x27;t account for legs or butts very well but trust with a lot of work it will get over them.</li>
      <li>it really does the job, my gut is sucked in.</li>
      <li>Too much hassel.</li>
      <li>After MUCH struggle and thinking I was gonna break my neck &amp; hip twisting and pulling</li>
      <li>I own seven of them I wear one everyday.</li>
      <li>It is a true Girdle and totally supports, hides, and smooths!  </li>
      <li>Splurge a little more and go for something that will really do the job.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it though.</li>
      <li>I am post baby 3 months and wished it had a little more lower tummy control.</li>
      <li>Overall worth the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a lovely bodysuit. I love how it fits. You barely feel that it is there. Plus, it does it job as well as the  [[ASIN:B00BQ94KLY Spanx Slimplicity Open-Bust Mid-Thigh Bodysuit for Women (Style#991)]]. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item. Especially if you are into using bodysuits.</li>
    <li> I bought this product probably hyping it up too much. While it does do a pretty good at slimming me and keeping things &#x27;tucked in&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t really make me look too much thinner and it&#x27;s actually a bit uncomfortable to wear. So this product isn&#x27;t worth it, I&#x27;d say. Splurge a little more and go for something that will really do the job.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I purchased a second one. The first one ripped because I had acrilic nails, but that is my fault. I just had my son in Jan and this product gives me my sexy back! I am a size 13 after having my son and the first one was a medium, this time I bought a large and it fits much better.  It really gives you great curves. Unlike those shapers that flatten your breast this one lifts thems. This product gives you the little waist you want and helps you define your hips. It flattens your tummy and I love love love that this product does not give you any rolls! The first time getting into this shaper can be a little tricky, but do not get frustrated or give up. Go slowly. Now you may be wondering \\&quot;will I be able to use the restroom without taking this off along with all of my clothes?\\&quot; Yes you can, there is an opening at the bottom, you just have to move your panties to the side!! I can not express how much I love this product and WOW what a great price!! Thank you Vedette you are now my best frien!! LOL</li>
    <li> This is probably the best shaper you can get of its&#x27; kind for the price. It works pretty well. My only complaint is that it rolls up in the thigh area and can pinch and dig into your leg pretty badly. But who said it was supposed to be comfortable? 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I buy small size clothes but ordered Medium girdle and still couldn&#x27;t put it on. It would not fit me. and can&#x27;t return it. waste of money :-(</li>
    <li> Havent tried on the item yet, however I am a HUGE fan of Vedette especially 136. It fits well, so I will guestimate that this one will be just as good.  This is one of the best on the market, to me not only brings you down one size, holds you in and I always perspire just a bit, which helps with my weight loss especially in the summer when I love to wear my halter dresses. I am a size 10-12 and when wearing this I can fit easily into a size 8. Love, Love Love it.</li>
    <li> I used this product as soon as I gave birth  after gaining 50 lbs and most of it was swelling for water retention. It helped me slim down my stomach and shaped my curves. Without It i had no shape. The only cons is the thick straps you cant really wear with everything especially in the summer, it gets really hot and is very difficult to put on and take off. but its a price to pay to try to slim down and hiding your side rolls. lol! I still wear it if I want to wear a nice dress every once in a while tho!</li>
    <li> I was not sure about the size to get for my size 10-12, 170 lb. frame, but I followed the advice of others and ordered the \\&quot;right\\&quot; size according to the chart and the LARGE was just right for me! I heard about all the trouble everyone had getting it on..so I took my time and worked it up very slowly. A trick to getting it up ...talcum powder. Smooth talc powder or powder spray over your legs, hip, and mid-driff area before putting on and it goes on a lot easier!  Worked for me.  I would have liked to have an even firmer mid-driff panel to really hold and widdle the waist-line. But overall, the garment was comfortable. It smoothed out, held in, and allowed me to breathe, eat a meal, and dance the night away with no complications. An extra plus is the open crotch! I will order more Vedette items. By the way, if you have large thighs, don&#x27;t order the mid-thigh shaper because it will show bulge. The mid-thigh was perfect for my knee-length dress. And the removable straps made it easy to wear my one-shoulder design. Kudos to Vedette for the packaging of the garment.  It comes \\&quot;sealed\\&quot; in its own foil packet.  I was impressed. I am a happy customer, and I&#x27;m working toward the size MEDIUM.</li>
    <li> Not the most comfortable thing to get into, I should have gone a size (or 2) larger! In fact it was quite a struggle and I broke a sweat!! But, DANG!!! Where does it all go?!! If I had tried this on before I purchased Spanx... There is no question, I would and should have bought these! I ordered 2 more (both a size larger than the original) as soon as I saw myself in the mirror!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help to shape my body in form fitting clothing. I received it in good time. When I first saw it it looked like something for a child to wear and the fabric was sort of like a stocking but much stronger. I tried it on and my nails mad a tear in one of the legs but it did the job very well. It held in everything and it was comfortable, no bones to deal with. I then wore it to an event and everyone told me how great I looked and it did not show at all. When I told people that I was wearing one they also wanted one too, so I&#x27;ll be making a couple more orders for them.    Overall, great control, very comfortable and the only downside is the strength of the fabric but the price is right!    P.S If you are wearing this and will need to go to the bathroom, you will need a plastic cup. It has an opening at the gusset area, so just move your regular underwear to one side and cup yourself and bathroom visits should be problem free!</li>
    <li> It works good, but starts to stretch out after a while.</li>
    <li> Nice.. good product.. I will buy mores.. All cames at medium sizes.. at a small sizes.. thank you guy regards!</li>
    <li> This is suposse to be a postpartum girle so i assumed it would be way firmer and tighter than it was. It is good for everyday but not for that little black dress you purchased before you found out your were expecting ;-/</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am 5,2 125 pds give or take. The item came on time. My point for buying this im doing exercise want to have better health, shape. Just my opinion... I did not like this product used it twice. Way to restrictive did not like having my body feel that way. It was uncomfortable. Maybe because im not use to having this type of this on, I felt this way but its not for me. I have naturally a big chest, medium posterior everything average. Everybody is different I just felt it bothered my breathing my body was uncomfortable that&#x27;s more important to me then looking a few inches thinner..</li>
    <li> not happy with product too small&lt;br /&gt;and size said medium and it is not elastic don&#x27;t like  I donr recommend it</li>
    <li> It does the job and it feels great! I will buy another one. I wash it every 2 days and it still has the support.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve tried so many body shapers, very similar to this one, and absolutely love the way it fits. It&#x27;s snug and fits like a glove. I love the way my figure looks. The price is just right! There is an opening in the personal area for easy use.</li>
    <li> Sizing is off. Extremely to tight!</li>
    <li> This is a nice garment that I will use all the time.  It is comfortable and I really like the feel.  I can move nicely.</li>
    <li> Great!!! Worked very well, very durable and the quality was amazing. Would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a little tucked away.</li>
    <li> i purchased th emedium size of this garment and it was not bad at all&lt;br /&gt;it wasnt so easy putting it on but once i did it was beautiful.</li>
    <li> when I first got it I thought that it was too small because it looked real tiny but when I actually tried It and stretched it out it really does the job, my gut is sucked in. I got a medium i am 5&#x27;4 and weigh 140. I was very satified</li>
    <li> Im a very small person (5&#x27;2&amp;#34; 105 lbs) and could barely get the medium on! Too much hassel. I wanted something for my post pardum body and ended up using a $10 compression tank which was waaay more comfortable and easy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this it was hard getting into but once it was on it was awesome!  Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it had a hole in it but other than that I loved it</li>
    <li> I have tried other more xpensive body shapers but none has worked as great as this one. Yes it is a little bit difficult to get into but after using it for 4 days ive gotten used to it. And the best part is that it is virtually unnoticable. As aoon as i put it on all humps and bumps were gone.I hope every women out there learns about Vedette products because they are the best. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I usually buy things medium size and fits perfect but this one was too tight like an xxs i want to know how do i return it to get a refund, plus i dont want the mid thigh, i want the thong one..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all!! It don&#x27;t make me look any smaller..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a Tan color fan, wish u had it in black color</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, enough for all day wear. A bit small for size. Maybe order a size up next time.  Would highly recommend it though.</li>
    <li> Good shapewear. A little tricky to get on. Comfortable fit. I am post baby 3 months and wished it had a little more lower tummy control. Overall worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this garment it works wonders for you.  I am a size 4 and something I can wear a size 2 jeans,  My problem is I have a big stomach and this garment have me looking all smooth and sleek. I hated wearing dress until i bought my first Vedette garment. I own seven of them I wear one everyday. I can see the change in my shape. what i dislike is the size are a little on the small side and takes effort to get on.</li>
    <li> I have paid lots of money on SPANX and have been disappointed everytime!  I took a chance on the VEDETTE Total Compression Mid-Thigh Body Shaper and I have to say I am so happy I did! It is a true Girdle and totally supports, hides, and smooths!  I am still trying to loose weight after having my second child and can honestly say this girdle is the best!  I love it and strongly recomend it over SPANX any day!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping~they said it would be here Monday and it came the Saturday before that!&lt;br /&gt;One month out from Mommy make over and wanted compression for tummy tuck and lipo areas. This is a great deal and figured it would cover all the bases. When I pulled it out of the package it looked like a leotard for a 2nd grader. After MUCH struggle and thinking I was gonna break my neck &amp; hip twisting and pulling I got it up. I measured a Medium and it doesn&#x27;t account for legs or butts very well but trust with a lot of work it will get over them. It makes everything that is newly flatted even more flatted. This brand is known to use compression to &amp;#34;train your waist&amp;#34; and it clearly will with regular use.  Read the company info about the measurements and how they used to get your body trained so buying it larger will defeat the purpose of the product. I&#x27;m planning on using it daily for a month to see and at this price it was easy to buy two! Now for the important part-it takes some serious work to line up the &amp;#34;potty&amp;#34; part so its important that you work it up as far as you can.</li>
    <li> I love love love this, i wear it all the time, no one can tell that you have it on. it holds in the stomach and sides, i am 5&amp;#34;2 155 pounds and i orders a small. it was  so hard getting it over my hips, but when i did, i loved my figure&lt;br /&gt;ps there is a split in the crotch.</li>
    <li> Be sure to get a size or two bigger than you. Purchased a medium and should have gotten a large but I&#x27;m medium built had to return it</li>
