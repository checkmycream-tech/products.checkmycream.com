      <li>Goes on creamy and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Its reddish and sparkles in the light.</li>
      <li>, It arrived right on time. :)</li>
      <li>Disco Pink but Fruit Punch is great too.</li>
      <li>You have to layer it on to get a more intense color.</li>
      <li>It feels really good on my lips and the sparkles did not feel gritty.</li>
      <li>best price overall, cheaper than the store, love the color, is red and very shiny on my lips, got it right away, wanted to order again but couldn&#x27;t find the site</li>
      <li>I now own them and will enjoy wearing this lipstick as long as it lasts.  </li>
      <li>The quality is similar to high end lipsticks and it&#x27;s very smooth and soft with great color payoff.</li>
      <li>This is such a sexy color !</li>
      <li>Nice shade but wears too wet and comes off easy.</li>
      <li>The color is just right for my lips and stays longer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also got just the right amount of shine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little darker than Disco but still bright and very pretty.</li>
      <li>very cheaply made case, not worth more than the $2 I spent on it, honestly.</li>
      <li>I really like this line of lipstick and so far my favorite shade has been</li>
      <li>Like the color very much, tend to wear it under something else.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted to order.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that it&#x27;s a bit glittery.</li>
      <li>I encourage y&#x27;all to google the actual color to make sure it is what you want.</li>
      <li>just enough pink tint.. great for the fall colors.  </li>
      <li>This is the second tube of lipstick of that color that I am using, I love it that much.</li>
      <li>The colour reminds of a dusky rose and it stays on very well after a few drinks and kisses.</li>
      <li>Color is absolutely nothing like photo.</li>
      <li>This lipstick goes on smooth and sheer and shiny.</li>
      <li>I really like this color.</li>
      <li>The thumbnail when I ordered was much different.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its great if you like a lighter fruit punch color slight pink to it...</li>
      <li>The Color is fantastic and stay long .</li>
      <li>I just love this color, not to dark...</li>
      <li>I usually use YSL or Chanel, but I bought this because it was super cheap</li>
      <li>This is highly recommended to all my friends.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically a light pink.</li>
      <li>It not only covers the uneven surface, but seems to also be making it more even!</li>
      <li>I really like the color of this lipstick, a red</li>
      <li>I apply my lipsticks lightly so they don&#x27;t look too heavy</li>
      <li>The lipstick on application is soft and creamy with a shiny tone.</li>
      <li>It also has just enough moisture but not so much that it will come off once touched.</li>
      <li>It has light shimmer (not the sparkles or glossy shine, but subtle shimmer) which really pops out the color.</li>
      <li>Love this color and had a hard time finding it in stores since the packaging had changed since I last bought it years ago.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little too much color for me,  </li>
      <li>Color doesn&#x27;t show up, basically like a clear gloss on my lips, Case is so flimsy, can&#x27;t be thrown into purse, afraid the top will come off and lipstick will get all over everything.  </li>

    <li> I encourage y&#x27;all to google the actual color to make sure it is what you want. The thumbnail when I ordered was much different.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely rosey color, i like it! It feels good on and goes on easy. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that it&#x27;s a bit glittery. It&#x27;s not over powering, but i would have preferred no glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, It arrived right on time. :)</li>
    <li> Love this color and had a hard time finding it in stores since the packaging had changed since I last bought it years ago. I kept the empty one that I had dug all of the color out of and drug it around for sometime till I thought to search for the color here, so glad I did! The fruit punch color compliments my light olive complexion quite well.</li>
    <li> This is the second tube of lipstick of that color that I am using, I love it that much. I get compliments all the time! Love it</li>
    <li> Color is absolutely nothing like photo. It&#x27;s basically a light pink. So disappointed and feel very foolish to have been tricked.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice color for Summer.  This line adds moisture to your lips.  You have to layer it on to get a more intense color.</li>
    <li> The lipstick was okay just not the color of fruit punch that I know a darker red.. Its great if you like a lighter fruit punch color slight pink to it...</li>
    <li> I just love this color, not to dark...just enough pink tint.. great for the fall colors.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores lately.</li>
    <li> Superb Maybelline lipstick.  The color is awesome.  Would buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> best price overall, cheaper than the store, love the color, is red and very shiny on my lips, got it right away, wanted to order again but couldn&#x27;t find the site</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t show up, basically like a clear gloss on my lips, Case is so flimsy, can&#x27;t be thrown into purse, afraid the top will come off and lipstick will get all over everything.  very cheaply made case, not worth more than the $2 I spent on it, honestly.</li>
    <li> This is such a sexy color ! One of my favorite lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Very cute color. Fully satisfied. It has a glow and sparkle it is really cute! Would def order more of these.</li>
    <li> I really like the color of this lipstick, a red that&#x27;s neither too blue or too orange. It&#x27;s also got just the right amount of shine.</li>
    <li> So soothing and moisturizing! I pick my lips a lot and was worried how this would look.... Well, my lips look great! It not only covers the uneven surface, but seems to also be making it more even! Now, with regular lip balm, I continue to pick on my lips...but with this one, b/c of the color, I tend to do that a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone and any lip type lols :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted to order. Came quickly and in perfect condition. Very pleased. Price was a great&lt;br /&gt;incentive to order, too</li>
    <li> Nice shade but wears too wet and comes off easy.</li>
    <li> Poor quality and dry,</li>
    <li> Like the color very much, tend to wear it under something else.  It&#x27;s a little too much color for me,  I&#x27;m fair skinned and in my seventies.  It is a great color and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT THE COLOR LOOKS LIKE ON PAGE</li>
    <li> This lipstick goes on smooth and sheer and shiny. The Color is fantastic and stay long . I am pleased with the product .</li>
    <li> I usually use YSL or Chanel, but I bought this because it was super cheap and I was not disappointed! The quality is similar to high end lipsticks and it&#x27;s very smooth and soft with great color payoff.</li>
    <li> I love this brand ever since i started using lipstick. The color is just right for my lips and stays longer.  It arrived on time and as described by the seller. I will order it again. This is highly recommended to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Maybeline did it too me again.  I find something I love in a wonderful color and they decide to discontinue it.  :(  Luckily, I found a seller on Amazon who had three in my favorite color.  I now own them and will enjoy wearing this lipstick as long as it lasts.  The packaging was fine and it arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> La mercancia es de excelente calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo 100 %... Venezuela</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of renewing my lipsticks and searching for colors for my caramel beige  with yellow undertones, or olive tone skintone dk hair. This product is beautiful color on me.  The lipstick on application is soft and creamy with a shiny tone. The image doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
    <li> This is Kay&#x27;s daughter. Mum bought the lipstick at a store for me. The colour reminds of a dusky rose and it stays on very well after a few drinks and kisses. It also has just enough moisture but not so much that it will come off once touched. The boyfriend loved it too. ;)</li>
    <li> I am a pink shade girl all the way. I really like this line of lipstick and so far my favorite shade has been Disco Pink but Fruit Punch is great too. It&#x27;s a little darker than Disco but still bright and very pretty. I apply my lipsticks lightly so they don&#x27;t look too heavy and this goes great with my fair complexion. If you like pinks then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I saw this color at one of my friend&#x27;s place and after trying it on I decided to get the same color. My friend has light color skin tone and this color looked amazing on her and it looked amazing on my brown skin tone too. I was lazy to find it at store, so I ordered online. It has light shimmer (not the sparkles or glossy shine, but subtle shimmer) which really pops out the color. My only complaint is it&#x27;s not very moisturizing, but also it doesn&#x27;t dry out the lips. Again when I say not moisturizing, I am comparing with Makeup Forever, Urban Decay lipsticks which are much more expensive. This lipstick is good value for the money. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice passionate color, perfect color for work:) Plus it shines. Like it very much~ amazing price, I just saved money!!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick!  Goes on creamy and smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t get clumpy or sticky.  Color lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I really like this color. Its reddish and sparkles in the light. It feels really good on my lips and the sparkles did not feel gritty. Just a smooth beautiful color. No smells!buildable but shows up great after one swipe. Leaves a hint of color after it wears of that still looks good and does not have to be reapplied often.</li>
