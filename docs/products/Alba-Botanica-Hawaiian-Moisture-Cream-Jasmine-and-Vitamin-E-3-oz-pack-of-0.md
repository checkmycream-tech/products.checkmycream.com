<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite cream, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Happy to know I can get it much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes very nicely. It goes on very smooth and stays on for awhile. I really wanted to love this cream, but the smell is just so overpowering. I was expecting a soft, light scent, but this is just so strong and overpowering that it almost makes you dizzy. The smell does not diminish the longer you wear it; I put the cream on before bed, and woke up the next morning smelling like I had just put it on. It&#x27;s very unfortunate, in my opinion the smell makes the cream unwearable.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer and it is what I use every day, morning and night. I tend to have dry, sensitive skin. I am not easily prone to breakouts, but I have found with some moisturizers I have had some blemishes pop up, so I stop using them. I started trying Alba Jasmine Moisture years ago because it had natural ingredients. I ended up loving it and I have stuck with it. Alba gives me the moisture my dryer skin needs without causing breakouts. I really like that it&#x27;s light but nourishing.</li>
    <li> This cream moisturizes very well without feeling heavy or greasy. It works well for a night or day lotion. Plus it smells great!</li>
    <li> I like this moisture cream a lot. It feels great on my face and the Jasmine scent is so pleasant. The ingredients are all good too. I don&#x27;t use chemcial laden products and Alba makes great natural products. Alba makes several moisture creams in other scents, but the Jasmine is my absolute favorite and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this one. My husband likes the scent a lot too.</li>
    <li> I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy&#x27;s and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.</li>
    <li> my favorite affordable skin crème.</li>
    <li> I had dark circles and uneven skin before I used this product. It works well. It&#x27;s kind of on the expensive side for something so little though.</li>
    <li> It is all I use for face moisturizer.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 and have had pretty good luck with my skin.  I got lucky with genetics, but I&#x27;ve also tried to take care of it, especially living in Southern California.  I have to admit that the compliments I used to get had dried up for the last few years, which I attributed to the inevitable march of time.  I refuse to get injectables or any of that nonsense.  But recently, I changed both my sunscreen and my nighttime moisturizer, alternating my pricey $60 cream with this one.  And after a few months of this new ritual, plus a good diet and regular exercise, I&#x27;ve been hearing comments like \\&quot;Your skin is glowing.\\&quot;  Who doesn&#x27;t love that?  After the $60 stuff is gone, I&#x27;ll try using this exclusively.  If that doesn&#x27;t do it, I can always spring for another overpriced cream, but at least it will last twice as long!  I will definitely keep buying the Alba cream.  It smells wonderful, too.</li>
    <li> The cream is a little heavy for normal skin, so I don&#x27;t use it daily. The smell is an issue for me, it&#x27;s very perfumed and smells heavily of Jasmine, which can be pretty potent.</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be one of the best facial products I have ever used.  I have bought some products for a much higher price that did not work as well.  It also has a very pleasant smell. I will try more of this manufacturer&#x27;s products in the future.</li>
    <li> Good: It works wonders on skin. Face doesn&#x27;t look oily + skin stays soft for longer period.    Bad: Smells awfully strong and not too pleasant (actually more like incense stick) so one star less.    Again good: That awfully strong smell disappears after first few minutes. (or that is what I think, will have to confirm with my husband on that)</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and wanted a good thick cream to use at night. This cream feels good without being too thick or greasy. I also enjoy the scent. It&#x27;s very nice without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Good product, but I&#x27;d suggest getting the oil-free one, as this one tends to get a little greasy and makes me break out</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for years, very gentle to the skin, high quality, natural ingredients, not greasy, anti-oxidant.  Wears well under makeup, absorbs well.  The price was super good from this seller.  For a healthy product this is a good value, lasting a long time.  Saved $6.00 from my local merchants.  I will probably buy it from this seller again, if the price remains stable.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very nice and creamy and feels great on my skin.  I love the smell (I love the smell of jasmine).  I have only been using it for about a week, so do not know any long term results.  So far, so good</li>
    <li> I have mature very dry skin. I couple this with cetaphil cleanser and I tell you what, wow! Lines are smoothed out, your complexion absolutely is hydrated with a glow and your skin looks healthy and feels that way too! No more dry patches. Wonderful for the woman who likes natural products! I have allergies to scents, This cream does not bother me in the least. I have found that if I couple it with albas cleansers my allergies go through the roof. Cetaphil cleanser with this is the ticket!</li>
    <li> Great for winter on my combo/oily skin. Otherwise great for parched skin or an overnight hydration.</li>
    <li> If you have ever wanted to relive that moment of excitement and anticipation as you step off the plane on your Hawaiian vacation, that precise moment when they place that sweet smelling lei around your neck, this is the face cream for you. It smells sweetly of jasmine, not a hint, not a linger, it is full of amazing Hawaiian jasmine scent.&lt;br /&gt;And, if the scent alone isn&#x27;t enough for you, the actual moisturizing is perfect. It&#x27;s rich, creamy and lush without being heavy or greasy. It doesn&#x27;t make my makeup meltdown. It applies smoothly, and plays well with my face oils as well, when I feel I need a little boost. I use it with the compliment of Alba Botanica&#x27;s skin care, Pineapple Enzyme face wash and hibiscus toner, and my skin feels incredible.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, and the ingredient list boasts an impressive set of botanicals. I&#x27;m completely thrilled with this face moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I tried the other version of Alba Botanica moisturizer first and it was really nice, but didn&#x27;t quite moisturize my dry spots so I tried this one and I like it even better.  A tiny bit goes a long way, so if you are having trouble rubbing it in, you are using too much.  The scent is very pleasant and it has a great feel to it.  I do break out a tiny bit from it on occasion due to having Rosecea, but it isn&#x27;t much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cream for quite some time now but since it&#x27;s always a little pricey in store, I figured I&#x27;d get it on Amazon instead, where it is a solid $4-5 cheaper.  However, the cream that I got in the mail is clearly very old--it has the old cream smell and is also much thicker and not nearly as light and quick absorbing on my face as the store-bought versions in the past have been. Unfortunately, this cream doesn&#x27;t have any expiry date on it so there&#x27;s nothing I can do other than warn others not to repeat my mistake.  This face cream is great--just don&#x27;t buy it online!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic! Using all over!!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like the flower smell then this is not for you but I love it. Smells like gardenia on your face but smells a little different in the jar</li>
    <li> Love this face cream. Been using it for years. Does a great job moisturizing and does not irritate my sensitive skin. Really good value too. My skin feels better than much more expensive creams.</li>
    <li> Holy Smokes WORKS OUT OF THE GATE!  The relief is instant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No funny aftertaste.  Might stain your white dress shirt, but it is clear, so won&#x27;t be hard to dry clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this with the Olba&#x27;s Cough drops. and MAN I really feel better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that sometimes, these kind of dial your use Lip balms can adjust in your pocket and make a mess.  Other then that,  I have no complaints on the product.  Just the package it comes in.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and the consistency. It does moisturize, but not THAT moisturizing. If you&#x27;re skin is really dry and flaky, look for something stronger, but if you&#x27;re just looking for something that is decently priced for everyday use, this might be a good choice.</li>
    <li> Incredible all natural moisture cream. Perfect consistency - not too thick/watery. The smell is light and not overpowering, which is nice for those of us who are sensitive to strong smells, especially around the face. I was cautious before using this moisturizer because my face is sensitive, however my skin looks and feels so much better after using this. I love that this cream leaves my face perfectly moisturized throughout the entire day and not oily. My husband and I just began using Alba Botanica products and we have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok if you have non problem skin. I have very dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
    <li> Excellent face lotion! I use this after using their face wash. It goes on very smooth snd easy. It is moisturizing but not at all greasy. I put my make up on immediately after. Will continue to buy for a long time! :)</li>
    <li> Decent moisturizer, not tested on animals. I will be searching for a different one though because while this one is okay I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy for my sensitive skin. It has a nice jasmine green tea scent though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for normal to combo skin, not for dry or oily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the green tea/aloe moisturizer, and that one was amazing on my skin. I accidentally bought this one when I ran out of the green tea/aloe, and I love it even more! It smells so nice and makes my skin soft and hydrated without becoming oily. I have oily combination skin, and this works great! Extremely impressed! Will definitely buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> So light and fluffy, no greasy feeling. Absorbs easily.</li>
    <li> I used to use Aveeno, but was ready for a change and I love this product. I will buy it for life. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, a nice fresh smell, soaks in quickly, filled to the brim with product, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Although the consistency of this cream is very nice, it is highly scented. It was overpowering for me, and also for my daughter. The scent is very pleasant, it&#x27;s just really strong, especially for a facial product. Neither I or my daughter could use it.</li>
    <li> Great dry skin moisturizer!  I sent my algenist back for this.  But,,,,the jasmine scent is sooo overpowering I cannot stand it! That&#x27;s a shame because it is a deal breaker for me.  Why on earth do companies think women want to smell &amp;#34;strong scents&amp;#34; in makeup?</li>
    <li> Smells so nice like a flower garden. This cream absorbs so well with no breakouts or oily residue. Clean, soft feeling after appling it at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle of this from Whole Foods. Lovely Jasmine fragrance which stays on your face for a while. I like thick, heavy moisturizers. This one is light, good for summer but not for winter, dry skin when there is no humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Would use in the late spring thru summer months, then consider switching to a heavier cream in winter.</li>
    <li> I have this on Subscribe-and-Save. It lasts for two months, using morning and night. My middle-aged skin drinks it up, keeping my skin soft. The fragrance is pleasant, a little fruity-flowery- almost like tanning lotion, but with more subtlety.</li>
    <li> I purchased this through Vitacost. I used it morning and night every day for over 3 months, and it did nothing for me. While it might work for some, it doesn&#x27;t for me. The scent it pleasant and not overwhelming, even though I am &amp;#34;scentsitive&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> One jar will last me a very long time. I use this when I notice dryness on my face. This moisturizer is light and aromatic in a gentle way. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy nor does it make me break out. I love the entire Alba line and this product is a delight to use.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisture cream at a reasonable price.  If you&#x27;re skin is oily you might want to only use it as a night cream.  I especially enjoy the jasmine scent.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in a hospital gift shop for my daughter when she delivered her first child. She said it is the best creme she has ever used...now I get her a new one whenever she runs low. Her sixth child is due in July and she was delighted to get this...it is a fun tradition between us now!</li>
    <li> works really well - keeps my skin looking fresh and not dried out in this  winter weather. Would highly recommend. I also use shisheido products, this is my back up/</li>
    <li> I love this and intend to keep using it as a regular part of my beauty regimen.  Perfect for night use or if you aren&#x27;t planning on wearing any foundation as it is a little shiny on skin.  I like Alba products and this is really good.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect face cream. It is not oily or heavy. However it deeply moisturizes. I have had many days of sun and this cream is always refreshing. I live in the desert and my skin is always dry and this cream ensures I do not break out after applying.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this did not make me break out. Keeps my skin moist in the almost zero humidity montana weather. I always love alba products!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for several months. It is light weight but I use it at night as well. It absorbs quickly and leaves my face and neck feeling soft and moisturized. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I cant wear any heavy lotions.  This is light, smells great, and does leave my skin looking smoother.  My husband uses it sometimes also.  His comment the first time - you smell like the beach.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. It smells fantastic, and it&#x27;s such a thick and smooth lotion that it keeps my face soft all day long.</li>
    <li> I ordered it here and the scent was different.  It seems to work the same, but the jasmine smell is gone... I loved the jasmine smell! I&#x27;ll try it here one more time, but I would pay the extra dollar to go with the other company if the scent is still messed up..</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my dry skin. Its not too heavy but moisture rich. I love the Jasmine scent too.  I use it year round.</li>
    <li> A great feeling face lotion that goes on smooth and feels good all day.</li>
    <li> first time using it and totally love it.  You really do feel the difference when you put natural products on your body, especially your face.&lt;br /&gt;its so silky this moisturizer.  I use it for day and night</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I have dry skin and this moisturizes and makes my skin so soft! I love Alba products and won&#x27;t ever go to another brand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to switch to more of an all natural skin care and saw the list of ingredients on amazon and though that sounds alright when I got this cream there was a TON of ingredients that were not listed on the amazon listing for this cream to name of few AMYLCINNAMALDEHYDE,EUGENOL,HYDROXYCITRONELLAL,GERANIOL,&amp; LILIAL which all have a 7 hazard rating on the skin deep cosmetic database. This moisturizer turned out to be worse for my skin that the high end regular moisturizer I had been using to start with. If you are looking for a moisturizer thats healthy for your skin or all natural this is not the lotion for you. I can&#x27;t believe how green-washed the packaging is for this product. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and creaminess of this moisturizer. Wish they offered the same scent in a body lotion or body wash, it&#x27;s THAT good!</li>
    <li> This product is great, I&#x27;ve used several of Alba&#x27;s products and have not been disappointed. Non-greasy and actual natural ingredients is my big selling point.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for several years and it is one product that does not&lt;br /&gt;cause me to have skin reaction.  A very pleasant fragrance that dissipates quickly and&lt;br /&gt;a clean smooth feeling face!  A favorite for sure!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for a long time. I found it way cheaper here on Amazon than in department stores. It&#x27;s a good cream that smells nice. I love jasmine fragrance anyway.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for a long time and I love it!! Makes your face feel like silk. : )</li>
    <li> I love the cream, but when I got the product, the jar had been cracked in shipment. the lid was broken and did not fit. had to use other options for closing.</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Reminds me of Hawaii.  And it&#x27;s natural.  My face did NOT break out from using this cream..</li>
    <li> Really good cream. Did not get any type of allergies, that what made it good for me</li>
    <li> I found alba botanica products by accident. One day in a beauty supply store saw some on clearance and gave them a try. Never going back. So glad I can order on amazon for reasonable prices. This makes my face look great. Not breaking out anymore and feeling radiant</li>
    <li> Works well on rough calloused areas that would not respond to other quality lotions. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great product, natural and soothing for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. I have a thing for jasmine and she has a thing for the scent free. Which to me has a medical scent. She and I have found a happy medium. This is mellow enough where she does not consider it perfumed. To me it is just strong enough to know it is there when we are close. Perfect. It is very silky and light and though I do not use it on myself she reports it works just as well as any other moisturizers she has used. Happiness</li>
    <li> My favorite creme - I use it for day and night. I have very dry, sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.</li>
    <li> Great product but I prefer the aloe scent over this one. Alba sells wonderful stuff. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was having a horrible time with my face. Dry, flakes, oily and acne. Just wanted something that didn&#x27;t make things worse(like other things I&#x27;ve tried). I love the smell, the feel of it on my face and the results! I had to do some lifestyle changes to fix the issues of the cause of the dry,flaky skin. This product help keep my skin soft and soothed while my face and body healed. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years, and I think it it the best facial moisturizer ever!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is super sensitive. I can&#x27;t use most liquid products, and even have to use solid shampoo, bar soap, powder makeup, and cream type moisturizers. Even expensive brands like Clinique make me itch. Dermatologist says I am probably allergic to emulsifiers.&lt;br /&gt;This facial moisturizer is a lovely cream that is not overly heavy or greasy and absorbs well. It does not cause me any sensitivity issues. My favorite part is the beautiful light jasmine fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I found is that the packaging for the Alba oil free moisturizer is so similar that I have accidentally bought it by mistake, and that kind is not moisturizing enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have started buying this at Amazon because it is much more expensive at big box discount store in our town. Almost $7 cheaper on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I use it day and night, and love the smell!</li>
    <li> The scent is too strong for me to use it as a facial cream.</li>
    <li> okay product ... but for nearly same price and natural product ... Jason C-Effects Creme, 2 Ounces ... infinitely superior ...</li>
    <li> Have bought this product in the past had a great fragrance but this purchase seems to have a different scent, more cosmetic. Lotion is great and I use it both daily if I&#x27;m stating out of the sun and in the evening as a night cream.</li>
    <li> Great product that is natural ingrediants.  Goes on very smooth and provides an excellent surface for applying under eye dark circle highlighter.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too fragrant!  The moisturizer side seems pretty good but the fragrance is so strong I can&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;ll know to look for references of fragrance and ask if I don&#x27;t see a mention of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few years and love it. I&#x27;ve tried a few others and always come back to this one. I have sensitive dry skin. This is definitely a CREAM and may be too thick for some people who are using to a lotion, but I love it. Wears well under makeup too.</li>
    <li> Most of the organic-y creams i&#x27;ve bought seem to fall short. This one is better. It smells good. I feel like I look good. It does sting my eyes a little but maybe I should keep it clear of the eyes.</li>
    <li> If you want botanical and not plastic and chemicals, you must give this moisture cream a try.</li>
    <li> This moisture cream is as good as it gets. I discovered it several years ago when necessity dictated that I no longer indulge in a Clarins moisturizer at $70 per jar ( ! ) In retrospect, what was I thinking?  This is as good as any fancy French cream and even better because the price is so sensible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alba Botanica Hawaiian cream is completely non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling very soft. I use it day and night and it&#x27;s particularly good to use just before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisture cream. It does not make my face feel oily and sinks in easily. I use it for a night cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it&#x27;s too strong and rather unpleasent.</li>
    <li> I bought this out of desperation with this frigid (-10F) winter weather and dryness we&#x27;re experiencing this season. My skin was so dry it is red, burning and flaking. I put it on after washing my make up off. There was a bit of a tingling sensation that concerned me at first, but felt like the tingle of chapstick on very dry chapped lips. It went away within the first minute and my face is not red or irritated. It has all soaked in and now I feel like I should give my poor face another dose before bed. It seems like just what the Dr. ordered. Will update this review after I&#x27;ve been using longer.</li>
    <li> It smells so strongly of something (jasmine?) that I got a headache the first time I put it on. I was looking for something a little more natural, i.e., odorless. I like Canus all natural daily cream better. I would normally give a product a few more times in case it grows on me but I don&#x27;t think I can wear this cream again without getting a headache. It also feels a little greasier than Canus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&gt; Since I was out of my favorite moisturizer for a couple of days I gave this a few more chances. It lasts all day and the slightly greasy feeling went away. My skin did feel soft all day long. I think it is a good quality moisturizer, but people who are sensitive to scents should be aware.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this did not make me break out. Keeps my skin moist in the almost zero humidity montana weather. I always love alba products</li>
    <li> Im a dude and I don&#x27;t use much of any products other than shampoo, conditioner and toothpaste. This item is my caveat, I love the feel, smell and cool skin from using this. You should make me the same product in a black container that just says &amp;#34;Man face stuff&amp;#34; I would love that, thank you.</li>
    <li> My new favorite every day cream for winter. Great for my face in the AM (though not before working out) and in the PM. Love the smell and the feel of it. Not greasy at all, but good moisture for my 50ish skin. Nice product!</li>
    <li> This is my number one face cream.  Clean, smooth, calming, and lasting comfort.</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever had for my skin.  The price is amazing too.  I break out very easily or turn red with other creams and this one is so pure and calming.  I also have very dry patches and this keeps them moisturized.  I love it. I use one jar about every three months.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this cream. Non-greasy and feels great!</li>
    <li> Great product but the smell is a little bit old fashioned but wouldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and love the fragrance and the moisture it provides on skin</li>
    <li> I love jasmine but I was stunned by the aroma it was so fragrant. I had to get used to smelling it on my face for a few minutes. This is way better then the aloe and green tea one I used in the spring, or perhaps it just feels like it because it is summer.</li>
    <li> I like this product! It&#x27;s soft and isn&#x27;t at all oily.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I have struggled over the years to find a moisturizer that really works without being irritating to my skin.  This cream is thick but absorbs well. It has a pleasant but not overpowering smell and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn at all.  I order from Amazon because it is cheaper and my local store doesn&#x27;t always have this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to Alba products. This moisture cream got really good reviews and I can see why. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Love this brand, have been using the same moisture cream for almost 3 years. My skin is very sensitive and gets allergic easily if there is too much artificial/chemicals in the product I&#x27;m using. I have absolutely no issue using this product at all. Also recommend you to try the aloe and green tea oil moisture cream as well.</li>
    <li> alba has a few kinds of moisture creams and i have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this jasmine one is the best. smells great and moisturizes well. i will definitely buy this type again.</li>
    <li> My current favorite face lotion. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, but soaks in well. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;One jar was heavily scented but the others have been ok.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I had used it before, but when I opened it the scent (which end I loved in my first jar when I got it from Ulta) was off. It smelled like it had been sitting in the warehouse too long. Smelled like old lipstick</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and I love it! People always ask me how I have such good looking skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect face cream without insane chemicals, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;My problem with creams is that they are either too greasy or too watery, I need something in the middle because with my combination skin my forehead and nose tend to be oily but my cheeks get really dry.&lt;br /&gt;This winter alba saved my skin, it is so soft and it absorbs perfectly without feeling greasy or leaving a film over it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years. I just wont change it. I goes on without being greasy, it smells really nice and it&#x27;s great under make up. I feel like it really softens my skin and moisturizes without looking oily.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-No need to re-apply later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts&lt;br /&gt;-I used to use higher end OTC products that were advertised to do amazing things like cure cancer and end world hunger.  I have combination skin and have an occasional onezie pimple breakout.  I also work in a fridge so I&#x27;m exposed to extreme cold most of my work day, which dries out my skin.  However, after going through about 10 different types of face lotions over the years, this has to be the ONLY one that&#x27;ll moisturize ALL DAY and not cause me to break out.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing - I wish they would dial back the fragrance a bit though.  It smells nice, but it is strong!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial moisturizer for combination skin (works great for oily, combo. or slightly dry skin).  I prefer the Jasmine &amp; Vitamin E cream over the greentea, and it is easy to mix them up because the packaging is nearly identical.</li>
    <li> Smells good, super emollient, and more natural than other products. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about alba Botanica is that they have changed the formula on two of the products I used to love using. So if you like this, stock up in case they also change this formula!</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive to anything I put on it.  I do have a two or three minute reaction (which for me is amazingly good) but after that, my face feels less tight, and soft again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m through my first bottle and have ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it smells nice, but is not overpowering.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face lotion. I&#x27;ve used it off and on for the past three years, and nothing else I&#x27;ve used comes close to it. I have acne prone skin, so it&#x27;s important for me to use a lightweight lotion that still keeps my skin hydrated. If anything, this lotion decreases my acne by making my skin healthier overall. I use it day and night, after washing my face. Also, it smells really pleasant, like jasmine. I highly recommend this! (Also Amazon has the best price I could find)</li>
    <li> The scent does not smell like Jasmine.  Too expensive for what was received.  Texture is nice and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. It&#x27;s not overly greasy, &amp; it&#x27;s effective. Also very gentle around my eyes.</li>
    <li> As other people have said, this cream is quite strongly perfumed but the smell wears off very fast. It has a nice light texture and absorbs rapidly. I haven&#x27;t used it in winter, when my skin is drier, but so far it&#x27;s doing an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I love alba products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Not greasy like other vitamin E creams because it is made out of sunflower oil.</li>
    <li> I Love to consider putting cream on my face that has ingredients that I would be happy to ingest in my body. We often don&#x27;t think about that lotions and creams we put on our body and the ingredient list that we can&#x27;t even read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> My old moisturizer was expired and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any more, so I started looking at nearly all the small brand names on the shelves and was frustrated that all of them seemed to be distributed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, who, of course, does animal testing.  I finally wandered over to the &#x27;natural&#x27; section and found this.  No animal testing - all vegetarian ingredients.  I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it now for three days (morning and night) and I love it.  I used to have to apply my old moisturizer twice every morning and my skin was still too dry.  I have to be careful with moisturizer though because my skin breaks out very easily.  This is a very light product where a little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve noticed subtle differences in my skin.  Pores seem slightly smaller.  Dry, peeling skin has decreased.  No issues so far (knock on wood) with making my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, the scent was very overpowering and I doubted that I&#x27;d be able to use it everyday, but as with everything else, eventually you get used to it and you don&#x27;t even smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously love this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 35 years old with dry, acne-prone skin, with very visible pores, sensitive skin, and stupid little lines around my eyes already!  My skin is now better moisturized, no problems with acne from this product, pores seem slightly smaller, no issues irritating my skin.  Hoping it will make a difference for the lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Smells great, nice and light. Not very thick and easy to put on. Great under makeup.</li>
    <li> works great, doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
    <li> Smells DIVINE.&lt;br /&gt;Why wouldn&#x27;t you want the stuff ON your face to also smell good while it&#x27;s working IN your skin???&lt;br /&gt;And no creepy chemicals. Just a great product.&lt;br /&gt;If this was a body cream i&#x27;d dunk myself in it...</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s perfect for my dryish, sensitive, early 40&#x27;s skin.  When I first started using it, I absolutely loved the smell.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years now, and I barely notice the aroma anymore.  I think it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, but I wonder if they are putting a bit less fragrance in it?</li>
    <li> I really love this product, I love the light jasmine smell to it that then disappears so as not to compete with your scent.It smoothes right into your skin quickly ,doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.Makes my skin feel lovely afterwards. And most of all I love the natural ingredients and the lack of all &#x27;bad stuff &#x27;. I&#x27;ve been using this face creme for some years now and Amazon has the very best price for it that I have found. Especially when you do the subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I love this facial moisturizer. It softens my skin and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and feels light and non greasy</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the Alba Botanica moisture cream.  I use this on my face nightly and find it to be ultra moisturizing on my dry skin.  The scent is light and fresh, but not overwhelming to me.  I will order this product again and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> An all natural product that moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It is thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t go on too heavy. Moisturizes well and has a great scent. Not too strong, and very pleasant. I have combination skin and it balances well without causing breakouts, etc. I&#x27;m a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check my review of the Sea Moss moisturizer if you&#x27;re interested in that. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but it wasn&#x27;t for me. In a nutshell...</li>
