      <li>I used it for 2 weeks and the best thing I can say about it is that it somewhat soothed the irritation and soreness that comes along with my acne breakouts.</li>

      <li>I have been a Clinique user for many many years and am happy to find something to help my daughter battle her embarrassing breakout problems.</li>
      <li>i decided to buy my own.</li>
      <li>But the first two steps are phenomenal, you start to see results in days :D</li>
      <li>my face always feels very nice and clean.</li>
      <li>Clinique was the first brand that I have try that clears the acne and leaves my skin beautiful.</li>
      <li>I wish i had before and after pictures because my face is clear and wonderful.</li>
      <li>Very mild doesn&#x27;t burn, and helped me control my acne!</li>
      <li>For some reason they just stopped delivering it to me no matter how many times I called customer service and asked them about it.</li>
      <li>love these products.</li>
      <li>This has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>i absoloutely love it....  </li>
      <li>After a months use I had more acne than when I started.</li>
      <li>Also watch out if you go to bed with it on it will bleach your pillow cases, so make sure you put a crappy one on when you go to bed.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s definately not a moisturizer :).</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t always use the clarifying lotion (mostly because i forget -</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I am break-out free!</li>
      <li>I have noticed that doing that takes the edge off and allows the treatment to work better.  </li>
      <li>but it feels better</li>
      <li>I figured though, that I could deal with the oiliness better than the break outs and at the time, there was nothing like ProActiv (which is not the case now)</li>
      <li>This product works better than the one advertised on TV all the time for years.</li>
      <li>To anyone not desiring smooth skin and looking to just occasionally prevent acne breakouts, this product would be your best bet.</li>
      <li>purchased the mini starter kit to see if the product worked better than others I had tried, and I honestly haven&#x27;t seen my skin in such good condition a while.</li>
      <li>My skin never felt smooth and I noticed the more I used this product the bumpier</li>
      <li>it that I&#x27;ve started have very mild breakouts that I hadn&#x27;t seen for months of using this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have some strong medicine in it</li>
      <li>The foaming cleaner is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>There are times without any product I am acne free.</li>
      <li>i have been overall REALLY happy with it.</li>
      <li>I have used Clinique for a number of years and they have some great products including their regular system and their moisturizer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>If you were to search the product&#x27;s reviews on other sites (Sephore, Macy, etc), you&#x27;ll realize many customers are quite happy with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and we are very satisfied so far!</li>
      <li>Clean, smooth skin again.</li>
      <li>For someone who had pimples that lingered i was excited and invested on just buying the wash foam and solution.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for two weeks and have noticed a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>but I can see a significant difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>As stated above, however, individual products are good, particularly the moisturizer which is excellent.</li>
      <li>, I went to a department store in my town, and purchased the Clinque Acne Solutions starter kit for about $25 (it must have been on special).</li>
      <li>The full kit is $50 at the stores I mentioned and the full kit is $73 on here.  </li>
      <li>and finally I said whatever it&#x27;s worth a shot for clear skin best decision of my life!</li>
      <li>The clearing moisturizer (Step 3 of the system) tends to leave small white flakes on the face (unless you master just the perfect amount to apply), which requires some maintenance throughout the day and thus makes applying makeup a bit more challenging.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to be purchasing the full sizes when I&#x27;ve finished this pack (which has lasted me a couple of months!).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but most either didn&#x27;t do much or</li>
      <li>The Extra Strength version is really good for acne prone skin, but the Regular strength is good too.  </li>
      <li>give us your loyal customers a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>give us your loyal customers a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great facial care system that really works.</li>
      <li>this is the first time i&#x27;ve been happy with my complexion in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to be more mindful of touching my face and try to make sure I&#x27;m getting enough rest and see if that doesn&#x27;t help clear up my skin</li>
      <li>all other acne products with salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide, the use of a very good moisturizer is highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for acne, I don&#x27;t use the peroxide lotion everyday, as it dries my skin out.</li>
      <li>Not to sound toooo cliche but after using it for 2days, twice daily, most of my Acne were gone.</li>
      <li>I am almost completely acne free now!</li>
      <li>BUT it is worth a try.</li>
      <li>BUT it is worth a try.</li>
      <li>The pH also isn&#x27;t right so the salycilic acid in the toner won&#x27;t exfoliate.  </li>
      <li>She uses is at home, but also says it is just the right size for traveling.  </li>
      <li>Everything is light enough to wear under makeup, and the moisturizer is light feeling but seems to hydrate the skin extremely quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the harshness and excess of products, or if it&#x27;s just this line in itself, but it really messed up my skin, first by making it over sensitive and then creating more breakouts from my skin over working to restore moisture.</li>
      <li>I am just happy with the product, because is a really easy way to say bye to the acne problems, and also the price is crazy cheap, so i recommend it to all of you guys.</li>
      <li>foaming face wash is exactly what i needed - foaming and medicated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stayed consistent for a month although I did not like the foaming cleanser</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time because my pharmicist said it worked for her.</li>
      <li>The first day I used it, I was amazed at the difference.</li>
      <li>I have been facing acne for years now and have tried so many different solutions.</li>
      <li>It  really works for 4 days!</li>
      <li>Within the first week I noticed a difference in my skin texture and the acne I had was going away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many OTC products, prescribed topical creams and antibiotics</li>
      <li>As a teenager I used Clean and Clear it worked</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another good thing about this product is that after you use up your starter kit, and you want to continue to buy this product, you can buy the bigger sizes individually.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like the wash or toner worked any better if not worse than the regular line of products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had moderate acne since the age of 11. I had started using ProActiv at the age of 15. This cleared up my skin beautifully and evened out my skin tone, but since I have oily skin to start with, it actually made the oiliness worse. I figured though, that I could deal with the oiliness better than the break outs and at the time, there was nothing like ProActiv (which is not the case now) so I continued to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few years of using it, I came across some problems with receiving my order (probably do to the fact that I move around the country a lot and a actually moved several times in one year). For some reason they just stopped delivering it to me no matter how many times I called customer service and asked them about it. They were clueless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went to a department store in my town, and purchased the Clinque Acne Solutions starter kit for about $25 (it must have been on special). The first day I used it, I was amazed at the difference. The oiliness was gone. My skin felt much lighter and fresher than when I used ProActiv. Also, even though it says on the box that the products will make you burn easier, it was no where near as bad as ProActiv. I use to have wear sunscreen at all times or risk burning (I&#x27;m very fair, mind you, but still!) from just a few minutes of sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this product is that after you use up your starter kit, and you want to continue to buy this product, you can buy the bigger sizes individually. I tend to use the lotion faster than the cleanser or the toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem now it that I&#x27;ve started have very mild breakouts that I hadn&#x27;t seen for months of using this product. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve become \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to the product or if its cause I got a new desk job and find my self resting my head in my hands do to boredom, or what. It could be cause of stress, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to be more mindful of touching my face and try to make sure I&#x27;m getting enough rest and see if that doesn&#x27;t help clear up my skin again.p clear up my skin again.</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult acne since my mid 20s. I have also tried numerous brands such as Murad, Neutrogena, Loreal, Clinique basic 3 steps, Oxy, Clean &amp; clear etc. Nothing works for me except this kit. When I just started to use it, I saw my skin is clearer within 3 days. It tamed down all my bumps, white &amp; black head, redness zit, uneven acne marks. May be it just meant to suit my skin type. I love it. The only thing I would say is that my skin gets a bit drier, but I put on oil free Cetaphil moisturiser and everything still looks good for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Clinique for a number of years and they have some great products including their regular system and their moisturizer. Unfortunately, I have had very bad acne since I was a child and it has persisted into my 20s. I tried this acne solution system for a couple of months and it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. The creams are too goopy and feel terrible on my skin. I didn&#x27;t feel like the wash or toner worked any better if not worse than the regular line of products. I would recommend for someone looking to try Clinique to use the regular line of products instead of this.</li>
    <li> this is the first time i&#x27;ve been happy with my complexion in a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m 29 and have suffered from acne throughout my 20&#x27;s. i&#x27;ve tried retinoids &amp; every face wash you can buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this foaming face wash is exactly what i needed - foaming and medicated. i don&#x27;t always use the clarifying lotion (mostly because i forget - i&#x27;ve never used a toner/astringent). i use the moisturizing lotion every night and some days. it&#x27;s a bit too powerful for me to use twice daily - it irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the \\&quot;moisturizing lotion\\&quot; should be called medicated cream... it&#x27;s definately not a moisturizer :). i put my face lotion / night cream on over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i have been overall REALLY happy with it. i went through the &#x27;moisturizing lotion&#x27; the fastest and replaced it after 2 months.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, just to see if it would clear up my skin (I have adult acne &amp; I&#x27;m African-American). I used it for 2 weeks and the best thing I can say about it is that it somewhat soothed the irritation and soreness that comes along with my acne breakouts. I still had a few breakouts though. My skin never felt smooth and I noticed the more I used this product the bumpier my skin became in some areas. Once I discontinued using this treatment it took about a week of using nothing for my skin to completely clear up. To anyone not desiring smooth skin and looking to just occasionally prevent acne breakouts, this product would be your best bet.</li>
    <li> It has only been a week but I can see a significant difference in my skin. I have combination skin that tends to be on the dry side so I only use this 3-step system at night. I also follow-up the third step with an additional intensive hydration night cream. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with adult acne that has tried other acne regimens.</li>
    <li> saw results in 3 days! definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> omg!! this product did work for me!!! i started to use less makeup in just two days after i bought this product... i absoloutely love it....  i fully recomend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for acne, I don&#x27;t use the peroxide lotion everyday, as it dries my skin out. I only use it for spot treatment before I go to bed, and it usually dries out the acne. Also watch out if you go to bed with it on it will bleach your pillow cases, so make sure you put a crappy one on when you go to bed. But the first two steps are phenomenal, you start to see results in days :D</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  She was so happy to get it.  She uses is at home, but also says it is just the right size for traveling.  Really likes it.</li>
    <li> System works great! Foam goes the quickest.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have been using it for the past couple weeks and have noticed a major improvement.  I will say that it is very drying, but I have been mixing olive oil and sugar together and using it before the treatment to get the flaky skin off and to act as a small buffer (although the treatment will eat away the olive oil).  I have noticed that doing that takes the edge off and allows the treatment to work better.  I am almost completely acne free now!</li>
    <li> Well, there&#x27;s not a lot that I can say about this product, besides it made my skin worse. For the amount that I spent on this system, I went and got a real prescription that cleared my skin right up. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the harshness and excess of products, or if it&#x27;s just this line in itself, but it really messed up my skin, first by making it over sensitive and then creating more breakouts from my skin over working to restore moisture. Even though I followed every guideline and every recommendation, it still was awful for me.&lt;br /&gt;I really would only recommend this line to someone who is looking to make their skin worse. And that, I presume, is no one who is looking to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I must have tried over a gazillion acne products before trying clinique.  You name it, I have tried it.  Proactive didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I have oily skin for the last couple of years and must have spent hundreds of dollars on buying face cleaning products.  I use it twice a day (in the morning and at night) and my skin got clear in a week and my face looks and feels like I had a facial just recently.  All my acne, bumps, and some of the scarring has gone away.  I bought the starter kit because I was not sure but now I know I will definitely be buying the bigger set when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything, and I mean EVERYTHING to clear my skin.  I saw results in a little over a week and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I would recommend this to anyone with skin problems! I will continue to buy this even when my acne is completely gone!</li>
    <li> Item was received on time and works very well</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product, I followed the steps as directed and within two weeks that I was suppose to see clear results my acne had actually worsened. I know not every product is for everyone but at the price of this product I thought I was getting a high quality product and I hate to say that it was one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever used. :-/</li>
    <li> This product is over drying.</li>
    <li> I am adult dealing with cystic acne. I have never had acne problems before, but i have them now. I bought this product after trying many other acne solutions. I was hesitant about using a complete system on mu entire face since, my acne was primarily on my jawline. Within the first week I noticed a difference in my skin texture and the acne I had was going away. I did get some new acne, which is to be expected when starting a cleansing regimen.However, It has been an entire week and my face is acne free.I use it morning and night. My blemishes are fading as well. My skin is somewhat dry but after completing the regimen I add the Clinique moisture surge. I hope to switch up the frequency of use soon.</li>
    <li> I bought clinique acne Solutions less than a week ago, and im glad that i did. My face looks flawless, and smoother. I still have a little redness and a few small pimples but keep in mind that ive only been using these products for less than a week. keep in mind that im very mindful of what i eat. do not expect results when your eating oily/fatty foods. You are what you eat! I saw results in a matter of a couple of days. I do recommend these products.</li>
    <li> IT IS FXXKING TINY….. it is very very bad,,,, don&#x27;t buy it..&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m regretting now.&lt;br /&gt;god…… IT IS TOO SMALL SIZE.&lt;br /&gt;IT&amp;#34;S TOO EXPENSIVE.&lt;br /&gt;IT LOOKS LIKE SAMPLER</li>
    <li> At 27 I suffered with acne all my life! I honestly have to see this is a miracle treatment! I even took before and after pictures and in two weeks! I den results! Very mild doesn&#x27;t burn, and helped me control my acne! A must buy!!</li>
    <li> This is the only system that works for my skin. I am 28 and have been battling with acne since my teenage years. If used faithfully you will get good results. Get a moisturizer because it can dry your skin if used twice a day.</li>
    <li> This product works better than the one advertised on TV all the time for years. Use this and in two or three days you are amazed how well it works. I order this for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> It  really works for 4 days!</li>
    <li> love these products. So much more convenient than going to the mall!</li>
    <li> i used clinique assuming it would work well for my delicate skin and it did, for two days!! then my face would itch nonstop and i started breaking out in little red bumps all over my face that itched nonstop and lasted for a week then my skin flaked.  i gave the product to my sister and her face is doing well, her skin is clearing up and she hasn&#x27;t experienced what my skin experienced.</li>
    <li> This did not really work for me, but dried out my skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I am an acne sufferer of ten years and it is hormone based, so topicals won&#x27;t work too well for me. The soap is not very good at cleansing the skin, especially if you have makeup on. The bar soap version is one that I have used in the past and it seemed to work pretty well. Foaming cleanser not so much.&lt;br /&gt;The toner just dried out my skin, and didn&#x27;t really help. The lotion is really good, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought Cetaphil and it works really well at cleansing the skin without drying it out. I also use witch hazel and it evens out my skin tone wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I had never had acne until I had children. I tried everything and sometimes it worked short term, but it would always start up again. This showed results in just a couple days and although I have dry skin, I did not find this over drying. I continued to use Burt&#x27;s bees moisturizer for sensitive skin. This 3 step solution has been nothing short of a skin miracle for me!  Clean, smooth skin again. It takes very little, so well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have had severe acne (including cystic acne) since 7th grade and have tried everything (Proactive, Murad, Differin, MD Formulations&#x27; Adult Anti-Blemish kit, Tea tree oil) the list goes on...) to clear it up. This has been the only thing that has worked for me. I have been using it for two weeks and have noticed a significant improvement in my skin. Everyone else seems to have noticed as well. I have noticed less breakouts, even skin and my hyperpigmentation is slowly fading away. So far so good. Minus one star because it does make my skin dry but it&#x27;s a small price to pay to finally have clearer skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this prodcut because a friend of mine, just recommended. I said this product work very well in you faces</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne sice I hit puberty and I am almost 26. I get blackheads, whiteheads, and cystic acne. I have pretty mild break outs only having a couple pimples at a time however when those pimples go away a new set comes along so my breakouts are pretty back to back. I have tried everything from proactive to drug stores to changing my diet to supplements as well as home remedies. Everyone swore up and down this product would work for me and I have been using it for probably the last 6+ months religiously twice a day. This stuff is no more effective than a 2 dollar bottle of drug store acne  wash. I have wasted so much on this product hoping that it would work if I just waited a little longer. Today I have thrown out my system and will be trying something else. If this works for you great but if you don&#x27;t notice a difference in a few weeks trash it!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and pregnant, and my normally fairly tame skin has been crazy my entire pregnancy. I&#x27;m talking hormonal teenager crazy skin.  I tried several different big name systems to clear up my skin, none of which worked, before someone recommended this to me.  It took a few weeks before I noticed a difference but now, over a month later, my skin has cleared up dramatically with this.  I am happy with the results and will continue using this system.  I do use it with an electric brush which I think helps really get the medicine into my skin.  My only complaint is that the face wash does not last long at all.  It may be worth going ahead and buying another big bottle of it.</li>
    <li> Got it on time and in great shape. This is a nice size for the price so my kids to try it out to see if it works. This is just like anything else, you have to follow the directions and do this routine on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> The 3 step system  didn&#x27;t work for me. In fact it cause me to have an allergic reaction. I washed my face right before bed and woke up the next morning with an extremely itchy face and two red swollen eyes. I tried this product for the first time because my pharmicist said it worked for her.</li>
    <li> At first it broke me out, then started to clear up but it seems as if this contains an ingredient that causes the acne to remain on your face longer than usual. After a months use I had more acne than when I started. Total waste of money and time!</li>
    <li> I am just happy with the product, because is a really easy way to say bye to the acne problems, and also the price is crazy cheap, so i recommend it to all of you guys. Don&#x27;t dude it! I am just a little unhappy about the delivery service, because they said my product was delivered in a date, and it also arrived in a pretty different date.</li>
    <li> Good for, a gift to a teenager with skin.  Gave to my granddaughter as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have been using Clinique for about 3 years now. This is a great facial care system that really works. My skin is extremely sensitive and very reactive so I have to be very careful about the products I use. I have a lot of skin allergies and cannot use a lot of products with harsh chemicals.  I have tried proactive, murad, and lots more and have found that they are to harsh and my skin reacts to all of them. Clinique was the first brand that I have try that clears the acne and leaves my skin beautiful. I do get the occasional hormonal break outs but it&#x27;s only 1-3 zits now instead of a full blown breakout. I would recommend this product line to anyone, especially those of you who have sensitive and reactive skin like me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and really don&#x27;t have many bad things to say about it. It surprises me that it receives just mediocre ratings here on Amazon. If you were to search the product&#x27;s reviews on other sites (Sephore, Macy, etc), you&#x27;ll realize many customers are quite happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from severe acne in high school. I&#x27;ve tried many OTC products, prescribed topical creams and antibiotics but most either didn&#x27;t do much or the results didn&#x27;t last long after I discontinued using the products. One round of Accutane cleared up my skin completely and now I only have to deal with occasional acne, mostly only during the summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy, but I wear tinted moisturizer to even up my skin tone and to soften the look of some old pitted acne scars. The clearing moisturizer (Step 3 of the system) tends to leave small white flakes on the face (unless you master just the perfect amount to apply), which requires some maintenance throughout the day and thus makes applying makeup a bit more challenging. Now I skip step 3 in the morning and only use the moisturizer at night. Other than that, this product works wonder and certainly deserves a better rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all other acne products with salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide, the use of a very good moisturizer is highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit expensive here on Amazon, the retail for the starter kit should only cost $35, and the full bottles are generally cheaper during Xmas season.</li>
    <li> 1390 forest Ave apt 3c 04103 this was the correct address need my order plz sorry my mistakes</li>
    <li> The Box was open. It is difficult to rely if t hey are authentic.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin as well as rosacea and it has taken years of attempts to find a cleansing stem that does not dry me out or make me break out. I was tired of reading \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; only to have it not help at all and make things worse in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this system has finally done what I need I used it twice a day for a week then once a day and know only need to use it every other day to keep my skin clean, clear of acne and it even seems to lessen my rosacea redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have some strong medicine in it and I recommend  using white towels to dry your face as the chemicals did bleach some stains on my colored hand towel. But the results of clear, soft and less reddened skin is so marvelous to finally have.</li>
    <li> I have been facing acne for years now and have tried so many different solutions. I tried Pro-active, topical solutions prescribed by dermatologists, Mary- Kay, Avon, you name it. Nothing ever worked at all. I finally bought this and my skin already looks better and it has only been one week. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this system and within 3 days my face started clearing up. my face always feels very nice and clean. love it! will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and my skin type is extremely combination. I get oily on my t-zone, completely dry near my eyebrows and chin, and everything else is extremely acne prone. After using different acne products from other prestige brands like Murad, they just weren&#x27;t cutting it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the mini starter kit to see if the product worked better than others I had tried, and I honestly haven&#x27;t seen my skin in such good condition a while. Everything is light enough to wear under makeup, and the moisturizer is light feeling but seems to hydrate the skin extremely quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be purchasing the full sizes when I&#x27;ve finished this pack (which has lasted me a couple of months!).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I am break-out free! This product really works!</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m using my BF&#x27;s Account to post my review).....I&#x27;ve had Acne all my life, As a teenager I used Clean and Clear it worked but after some time it stopped clearing up my Acne.....I&#x27;m 24 now and suffer from mild to Moderate Acne, I gave into the hype and purchased Proactive Starter Kit....to my dismay that didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve always known about Clinique but found it to be a bit pricey and it&#x27;s not advertised as much as the other Brands where I live. I decided to give it a try because my wedding is coming up and needed to do something about my Acne.....Not to sound toooo cliche but after using it for 2days, twice daily, most of my Acne were gone. After 2weeks all my Acne have cleared up (I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing the Dark Spot Corrector to clean up old Acne Scars now)....The smell of the product is disgusting but it gives results....The only problem i have is the over-drying of my skin...when this happens i just use it once per day instead of twice.&lt;br /&gt;I can however understand the frustration of the people who used this product and didn&#x27;t get results, My boyfriend uses it as well but he&#x27;s not getting the same results as I am....I guess everyone is different.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that keeps my acne at bay</li>
    <li> I have very oily acne prone skin. I used it at night and in the morning the result was better than I expected. Most of the small pimples that you could see on the surface were almost flat and some were actually gone. I sometimes get acne under my skin so in addition to what is visible if you lightly press my cheeks you would feel small - medium bumps or collections that would soon surface as (sometimes painful) pimples. These were also diminished after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne comes with redness and this product (again after one use) helped even out my skin tone and almost all of the redness was gone and my skin looked and felt smoother. I am not sure if this system was made to clear spots or previous acne scars, but I did get the look of clearer skin with the reduced / removed redness. (The dark spots seemed less dark and skin tone was over all more even).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this over the counter and paid the equivalent of 30.00(USD) for the wash and the toner alone. I was very willing at the time to pay the price (where i live these products are very over price and not available in store for actual retail value) after seeing it cheaper online I was a little disgruntled (especially since i could have gotten the lotion for almost the same price) but in the end I did not mind the cost. The value of clear skin was worth the few extra dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Eastern skin in a medium olive tone. I am an adult and I was told I have acne brought on by stress. There are times without any product I am acne free. I think when i use a new product for too long my skin gets accustomed and it potency decreases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, this may not necessarily work for you but it did for me.</li>
    <li> I bought my Clinique 3 step Acne Solutions from the store at macys. I have had small pimples as a teenager but not a lot. It started to get a lot in my mid 20&#x27;s&#x27;. It just got unbearable. I was getting pimples that left scares almost all the time. I tried a little of a friend&#x27;s Clinique acne solutions in the past but was not diligent and didn&#x27;t see much so i stopped and she stopped. Fast forward years later, i had been suffering from pimples for years and had not seen my friend for years too and it&#x27;s my friends wedding day. I finally see her and her face is totally clear. Like it&#x27;s clear and her acne was worse than mine. She also is 10 years older than i am. I was shocked, I asked her what she was using and she said it was the acne solution 3 step plus the acne bar soap. she said she started it again after she was advised to use it properly with patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i decided to buy my own. It&#x27;s not cheap at all for the average person but i was desperate, Now this is the trick, the lady at macys told me to be patient too; there will be some dryness at first but keep using twice a day, reduce to once a day if it is too dry. I did exactly what she said and i experienced bad dryness so i kept using it but stopped using the lotion because i noticed i got more dry using the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne reduced alright but i got a or two pimple popping out like every other day on my face and then it disappears faster. For someone who had pimples that lingered i was excited and invested on just buying the wash foam and solution. I managed. Then one day i spoke to the clinique personnel and she said to remember that the lotion was a different active ingredient to the foam and solution and i need to use the lotion too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i started the lotion, i used the complete 3 step system twice a day. I wish i had before and after pictures because my face is clear and wonderful. My fiance used to name my pimples but ha! there isn&#x27;t any pimples to name. I forgot to mention, the dryness will reduce with time. BE PATIENT. learn from experience. I took this time to write all this because I know someone experiences what i had. Now i don&#x27;t know if this is for everyone BUT it is worth a try. if you have bad acne, try this before prescription drugs. my one bad thing is that it is a bit pricey. common Clnique!!! give us your loyal customers a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think i&#x27;m gonna post this review also directly on the Clinique website. good luck to you.e dryness will reduce with time. BE PATIENT. learn from experience. I took this time to write all this because I know someone experiences what i had. Now i don&#x27;t know if this is for everyone BUT it is worth a try. if you have bad acne, try this before prescription drugs. my one bad thing is that it is a bit pricey. common Clnique!!! give us your loyal customers a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think i&#x27;m gonna post this review also directly on the Clinique website. good luck to you.</li>
    <li> arrive on time, I can truly say that it is working, I will continue to use it hope it helps my face, as I broke out so bad on this deployment</li>
    <li> The starter kit is $36.00 at all other retailers such as Dillard&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, Clinique&#x27;s website and Sephora, so I don&#x27;t understand how this starter kit is $50!  The full kit is $50 at the stores I mentioned and the full kit is $73 on here.  So I won&#x27;t be buying any of the Clinique products from the Amazon because it&#x27;s way cheaper everywhere else!</li>
    <li> I CANT BELIEVE IT, I have tried everything out there proactive, all the store brands out there, I never write reviews ever but this is so real after finally taking advice from a co worker about this product I tried it and it really works my acne is all gone I&#x27;ve stayed consistent for a month although I did not like the foaming cleanser she recommended the bar soap acne solutions and that last for ever it&#x27;s cheap too about 15$ but it feels better, Iam 22 years old and have had acne forever but I&#x27;m telling you the reason I never tryed this before was because it was expensive and finally I said whatever it&#x27;s worth a shot for clear skin best decision of my life!</li>
    <li> This stuff tore my face up! I would not recommend this product for those with sensitive skin. I liked the face wash, but the other two products were too harsh. Also, once this product is opened you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old recent started using this 3step system and I have seen a big difference in her breakouts. It has not gone completely but is  less noticeable. She also has had no issues with it making her face red, dry or irritated. She started out with a small area to test it and we are very satisfied so far! I have been a Clinique user for many many years and am happy to find something to help my daughter battle her embarrassing breakout problems.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> The acne solution system cleared up my skin within 3 days. This has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It does work but after a week use it started drying my out skin really bad and it doesn&#x27;t come with a moisturizer the lotion has bp which will dry your skin out even more and it&#x27;s also very sensitive to eye area even though I avoided that area it did clear the bumps up but who wants to walk around all day with a dry tight face?? Not me</li>
    <li> I have suffered acne only in my adult life, not even during puberty.  I am 32 y/o and and of Indian(from India) decent.  My skin is very oily on the cheeks, forehead, chin. I would breakout for no reason.  I feel this works for me.  I have been using this product since May 22, 2013. I use it twice a day, once in the morning and then before going to bed.  Now, what I also use is the Origins Charcoal Mask. So for example, I would use the Clinique system in the morning and night, then again in the morning and then, at night I would use the Origins Mask.  You have to use the Mask according to how it says to use it (steam your face to open the pores).  This really helped my skin.  Even my husband noticed.  I hope this review helps someone.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. Ever since I turned 20, I started getting all sorts of acne: cystic, blackheads, whiteheads ...&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 3-step acne solutions under false impressions, and after 1 month of use, no results. My face was actually worse off: dry, uneven (rough) texture, no changes in acne, and a acne rash developed on my forehead. The cleansing foam was not all that bad, my favourite from the trio. The clarifying lotion is VERY drying. I have oily skin so that says a lot! The moisturizer did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30s with extremely oily, breakout prone skin.  I gave this a try last winter and had mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanser:  The foaming cleaner is pretty nice. It cleanses but you do need a separate step to remove makeup.  I found a makeup wipe did the trick.  This has salicylic acid in it, but that won&#x27;t do anything because it just gets washed down the drain.  For the price, I won&#x27;t buy this again.  The Neutrogena Foaming Face Wash in the Blue Pump bottle cleanses better and is a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Toner:  My experience with this product is poor.  It is loaded with alcohol and is VERY drying.  It actually left my skin feeling pretty uncomfortable. The pH also isn&#x27;t right so the salycilic acid in the toner won&#x27;t exfoliate.  Thus, I would not recommend.  I prefer the Paula&#x27;s Choice CLEAR line of exfoliants.  The Extra Strength version is really good for acne prone skin, but the Regular strength is good too.  Paula&#x27;s Choice is similarly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizer:  This is very good.  I buy this on its own.  It delivers benzoil peroxide without being overly drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  This system did clear up by skin.  I experienced fewer breakouts.  However, it is very drying, largely due to the toner.  A toner shouldn&#x27;t dry your skin out like that.  Thus, I can&#x27;t recommend the system.  As stated above, however, individual products are good, particularly the moisturizer which is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have to say this product surpassed my expectations.  I have minor or severe acne and it really has helped clear my skin. I&#x27;ve even noticed my poors are smaller. The only down fall is doesn&#x27;t treat cystic acne. But over all I am happy with the outcome.</li>
</ol>
