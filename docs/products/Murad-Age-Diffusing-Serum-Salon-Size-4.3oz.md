### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I have to say the salon size worked great.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin look better and is great for anti aging!</li>
      <li>Good product for the money</li>
      <li>Murad has produced the best skin products that cannot&lt;br /&gt;be matched by higher priced products.</li>
      <li>my skin bright &amp; healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>In 2009 Murad started putting their own hologram stickers on their boxes.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t be without it, been using this product for months and love it.</li>
      <li>Yes, and that&#x27;s how wide-spread the counter fitting of this brand is.  </li>
      <li>Have used Murad products for many years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love the product and love the price</li>
      <li>I gave it a couple months to adjust to my skin, and all it gave me were more sebaceous ance break-outs and tons of blackheads.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a way to get a sample-size of the serum and day cream as I&#x27;m sure I could tell immediately.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to see this large size at a much cheaper price than buying direct from Murad.</li>
      <li>For me, this product caused more blackheads and acne to my already acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The best way not to get scammed is to go to the link above and read the list of unauthorized dealers, and if you decide to buy from a non authorized dealer then at least refuse to buy anything that does not come in its own individual sealed box with a hologram sticker.  </li>
      <li>Because the real stuff WORKS!  </li>
      <li>What that means is they are aware that there&#x27;s a chance that they could be selling you junk so they won&#x27;t guarantee their product.   </li>
      <li>had tried this product as a sample from Sephora, (selling at 4 times what I spent on Amazon) and really liked how it worked.</li>
      <li>Hope this is the real thing and not a knock off!</li>
      <li>But in the giant, economy size it is far more reasonable than other brands, goes on nicely and is possibly even doing some good.  </li>
      <li>NOT Murad because Murad doesn&#x27;t make large sizes of anything</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t work the same as the genuine product.  </li>
      <li>Buying the salon size really helps the budget.  </li>
      <li>The real stuff is tangy tasting.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much when finances prompted me to stop using it and try a cheaper alternative.  </li>
      <li>This is temporarily effective for a few hours then the effectiveness is gone.</li>
      <li>It felt stronger (sometimes would slightly sting) and my skin really started looking better.  </li>
      <li>The aformentioned shops are not authorized dealers, it says so on Murad&#x27;s site, and there are so many counterfeiters the Market is saturated with more fake stuff than real.  </li>
      <li>I would question highly.  </li>
      <li>And steer clear of salon sizes!</li>
      <li>And we are not talking about real chemists who somehow acquired the real ingredients and have essentially manufactured generic Murad products that works just as well as the real stuff, at a cheaper cost, then generously pass the savings to you.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used murad for years &amp; was excited to find out I could buy bigger containers for the same price as the regular size from my normal suppliers.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
      <li>there is a whole line of salon sized Murad Products all over the net: amazon, ebay, fragrance.net etc.  </li>
      <li>Will continue to buy the professional sizes on all the murad products that I can.</li>
      <li>Do you really think you&#x27;re going to get a 4.3 oz size for the same price as the 1.0 size?  </li>
      <li>This particular seller says ( under the Q &amp; A section) that because they didn&#x27;t personally make the product they can&#x27;t vouch for its authenticity.  </li>
      <li>not sure if it is original</li>
      <li>I am generally suspicious of all these serums and this one is no exception.  </li>
      <li>No, they are people who sell you lotion they may have gotten from the $.99 store and poured it into their own fake containers.</li>

    <li> not sure if it is original</li>
    <li> Have used Murad products for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Murad has produced the best skin products that cannot&lt;br /&gt;be matched by higher priced products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad products for 3 years.  This is one of the products I use.  I have never known Murad to have a size larger than the 1.0 fluid oz. size.  I&#x27;ve never seen it offered in a tube either.  No this product is not authentic.  Do you really think you&#x27;re going to get a 4.3 oz size for the same price as the 1.0 size?  There are deals to be had, but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> I bought both the salon size and the 1.0 size and I have to say the salon size worked great.  It felt stronger (sometimes would slightly sting) and my skin really started looking better.  If its a fake oh well it worked.</li>
    <li> For me, this product caused more blackheads and acne to my already acne prone, sensitive skin. It did not work for me. I gave it a couple months to adjust to my skin, and all it gave me were more sebaceous ance break-outs and tons of blackheads. I am over 40 and have had acne since my 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> had tried this product as a sample from Sephora, (selling at 4 times what I spent on Amazon) and really liked how it worked. Hope this is the real thing and not a knock off!</li>
    <li> I occassionally get pimples underneath the skin. THis product helps control the breakouts.  I havent had any other product control as a well as this one.  I believe it balances the hormones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used murad for years &amp; was excited to find out I could buy bigger containers for the same price as the regular size from my normal suppliers.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my skin bright &amp; healthy looking.  Will continue to buy the professional sizes on all the murad products that I can.</li>
    <li> Buying the salon size really helps the budget.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without it, been using this product for months and love it.</li>
    <li> This is temporarily effective for a few hours then the effectiveness is gone.</li>
    <li> Love the product and love the price</li>
    <li> I use the age diffusing serum morning and night.  It makes my skin look better and is great for anti aging!</li>
    <li> There is no such thing as a &amp;#34;salon size&amp;#34; murad product.  I would know, I purchased this and it didn&#x27;t work the same as the genuine product.  So I squeezed out a little of both products smelled and tasted them.  The real stuff is tangy tasting.  This stuff tastes like lubriderm or some other low cost lotion.  I then began doing a little research.  In 2009 Murad started putting their own hologram stickers on their boxes.  Any product without this decal (or without a box at all) I would question highly.  You can read about it here:  http://www.murad.com/customercare/general-questions/unauthorized-resellers/?mobileredirect&#x3D;no But  If you purchased a murad product that came in a &amp;#34;salon size,&amp;#34; you have been scammed. I promise you it is 100% NOT Murad because Murad doesn&#x27;t make large sizes of anything but their scrubs or cleansing creams which come up to (6.7 oz).  Go on their web sight and look for yourself.  You&#x27;re probably saying, &amp;#34;But there is a whole line of salon sized Murad Products all over the net: amazon, ebay, fragrance.net etc.  Yes, and that&#x27;s how wide-spread the counter fitting of this brand is.  Because the real stuff WORKS!  The aformentioned shops are not authorized dealers, it says so on Murad&#x27;s site, and there are so many counterfeiters the Market is saturated with more fake stuff than real.  And we are not talking about real chemists who somehow acquired the real ingredients and have essentially manufactured generic Murad products that works just as well as the real stuff, at a cheaper cost, then generously pass the savings to you.  If only.  No, they are people who sell you lotion they may have gotten from the $.99 store and poured it into their own fake containers. Anyone who sells &amp;#34;salon size&amp;#34; containers of Murad product is simply stealing your money whether they know they are selling fake stuff or not.  Period.  This particular seller says ( under the Q &amp; A section) that because they didn&#x27;t personally make the product they can&#x27;t vouch for its authenticity.  What that means is they are aware that there&#x27;s a chance that they could be selling you junk so they won&#x27;t guarantee their product.   The best way not to get scammed is to go to the link above and read the list of unauthorized dealers, and if you decide to buy from a non authorized dealer then at least refuse to buy anything that does not come in its own individual sealed box with a hologram sticker.  And steer clear of salon sizes!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much when finances prompted me to stop using it and try a cheaper alternative.  I was very happy to see this large size at a much cheaper price than buying direct from Murad. Received promptly after I ordered too.</li>
    <li> After reading one of the posts, I did buy the salon sizes of both the serum and the day cream a year ago (both four-ounce sizes) and was totally disappointed.  I don&#x27;t think it did a thing for my skin, if not make it worse.  It came in plastic wrap with a hologram on the container, but there was no box.  I also purchased the 1.7 oz night cream, and that one seems to work.  There is no hologram on the night cream container, but I don&#x27;t remember if it came in a box.  I purchased these from all different places.  I truly feel like I was scammed on the larger sizes, and won&#x27;t be purchasing Murad again.  I wish there was a way to get a sample-size of the serum and day cream as I&#x27;m sure I could tell immediately.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, absorbs well and feels like it&#x27;s not there.  Works well!</li>
    <li> I am generally suspicious of all these serums and this one is no exception.  But in the giant, economy size it is far more reasonable than other brands, goes on nicely and is possibly even doing some good.  I intend to finish this tube and then re-assess.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
