    <li> Oh muh gawd! This sleek stylish dye brush is juuuust to die for! Fits beautifully in the hand and slides across your hair like a skier on ice is Spring time. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but, when I took this gem out of it&#x27;s envelope it was loooove. My world would end if we were ever seperated.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a dye brush, it&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s bendy and you use it on hair. What more is there to say about this? Would I buy another one? Well, yeah.</li>
    <li> Too large for me. It was clunky and the bristles where bad quality and already frayed</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s not too spendy but it&#x27;s really good about coating the hair precisely and evenly.</li>
    <li> Not much to be excited about. It&#x27;s only a dye brush. It served and continue to serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> This was product came at a great price and shipped really fast. Great quality, i&#x27;m so Impressed.</li>
