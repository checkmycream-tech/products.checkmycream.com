      <li>It&#x27;s easy to follow instructions and it doesn&#x27;t hurt you if you follow the instructions.</li>

      <li>This product is great, but I am new to peels so my expectations were a bit high.</li>
      <li>This peel did not give me a true peel.  </li>
      <li>Keep a wash rag on standby under the faucet and soak it with cool water.  </li>
      <li>I am working my way up to the full 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>This was delivered in 3 days which was extremely quick.</li>

      <li>Very nice quality and works very well for line reduction as well as treatment of mild skin issues on my arms due to sun damage in my youth.  </li>
      <li>As of right now,it&#x27;s not working for me.</li>
      <li>88% would seem very strong to me logically, and I know it is the more gentle of the hyaluronic acids, but I certainly expected some change with 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Its better to start off your regimen with a major peel like TCA 15%</li>
      <li>Comes with precise directions extremely helpful and made the product very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t rub your face with the cloth, soak it with cool water then press it against your skin gently.</li>
      <li>I had used a glycolic and lactic acid peel combo on a previous occasion with good results.</li>
      <li>directions said a minute to three minutes the first time.</li>
      <li>It stings, but not uncomfortably.</li>
      <li>I did a lot of research, and watched a lot of Youtube videos before using these for the first time</li>
      <li>Fantastic value --  professional strength and results at this price instead of hundreds.</li>
      <li>The only redeeming quality about this kid is the cream it comes with</li>
      <li>I am definitely seeing more results than with the 40% solution.  </li>
      <li>does have a bit of a bite to it, dilute it for first time use.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s possible.  </li>
      <li>Will most definitely order it again !</li>
      <li>good strength helps remove dead skin</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s an extremely effective peel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m nearing 40, have fair, freckled skin, grew up in the sun, and am fighting hard to remain fresh looking.  </li>
      <li>I used a clean, old ceramic cup.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, only burns a bit</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to add to weekly or bi-weekly facial routine for reduction on the appearance of fine lines on forehead and around mouth.  </li>
      <li>First off, I highly suggest if you&#x27;ve never done a lactic acid peel before, please do not start with this level.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After one use my face is brighter Very glowy.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much improvement....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work made me darker</li>
    <li> Ladies and Gents, let me tell you that this product works extremely great!!!!!  Please be advised that you should only use the alloted timeframe (up to 10 mins) that is listed otherwise, you may burn your skin. I was very iffy about purchasing this product only beceause I was under the impression it would not work as great as the one&#x27;s the professionals use (for $80- $400) of dollars, SHAME on me. I saw improvement in as little as 24hrs. Did this on a Fri afternoon and saw results the next day around late evening time. I was a bit concerned about the paleness in my face (im african american) and thought it would take a few days to fade away and I was wrong. The dark spots are 3x&#x27;s lighter with this product (SERIOUSLY). I will be doing another application this evening. Peeling has been happening both nothing to flaky or that would make someone wonder if I EVER washed my face lol...  The only thing I question is the Acid Repair Cream, it works great however it smells like milk which I hate. I suggest you try it out after you do the peel at nite before bed that way you never  really have to deal with the smell. Other than that this is a very great product to invest your coins into for healthy looking skin!!!!!!!  Please try, you won&#x27;t be diappointed.</li>
    <li> Be careful, this is strong stuff. You will burn holes in your face if you leave it on too long. Other than that, it&#x27;s an extremely effective peel.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! This product is the gentler of all the peels meaning it doesn&#x27;t go to medium depths it is just superficial but it does, however, stimulate collagen renewal AND clears off dead skin to reveal a newer, brighter you. I love how my skin feels afterwards and the downtime is great! Would highly recommend and I have ^_^</li>
    <li> Great item, securely packaged and thank goodness for the cream...I moved up from a 70% and the cream is a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using MUAC 40% peel for a while and decided to step up the strength.  I did get a little ambitious and overdid a couple patches by my lips, but it healed quickly and completely.  Lactic peels are one of the gentler and you would have to try really hard to do any kind of permanent damage to your skin and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s possible.  The the reviewer who complained the peel burned their skin...DUH...it&#x27;s a chemical peel that works by burning off the top layer of the skin, stronger the acid and concentration the deeper the burn goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months of use I am definitely seeing more results than with the 40% solution.  I&#x27;m nearing 40, have fair, freckled skin, grew up in the sun, and am fighting hard to remain fresh looking.  This is a must have product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I think the brush included is WAY too big.  I was afraid I would accidentally swipe my eye.  I already had a smaller fan brush.  The included lotion is nice, though I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to order more.  I recommend just ordering the acid.</li>
    <li> First off, I highly suggest if you&#x27;ve never done a lactic acid peel before, please do not start with this level.&lt;br /&gt;I began doing lactic acid peels a few months ago.  I have several acne scars, freckles, and a very predominant smile line on the right side of my mouth.  I only do treatments before bed and on my days off.  It is advised not to use makeup for 24 hours following treatment. I started off using perfect image 50% and seen noticeable results after the 6th use.  It is instructed to one treatment every 7-10 days.  Please follow this!!  I wanted to bump it up a notch and came across this product.  After reading the reviews I decided to try it out.  It came with the lactic acid, moisturizing cream and fan brush.  It was delivered 3 days after I placed my order.  I used it for the first time tonight and there is definitely a difference from what I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with Luke warm water and patted dry and pulled my hair back.  Keep a wash rag on standby under the faucet and soak it with cool water.  I saturated a couple of cotton swabs with the acid and gently applied it to my forehead going in circles then gradually worked my down to my cheek bones, across my nose, under my nose, over my jaw line and chin lastly.  After just a few seconds the stinging sensation began.  But I was surprised it wasn&#x27;t as intense as the 50% I used before.  After one minute it really started to sting and my skin was getting red patches.  Time to wash off!! Don&#x27;t rub your face with the cloth, soak it with cool water then press it against your skin gently. I did this for about 2 minutes before I felt the acid was rinsed off completely.  I immediately applied the cream.  Your skin is going to be pretty sensitive and red for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;The pictures I included aren&#x27;t meant to scare anyone off.  I just want to show what this product can do to your skin and why you should not repeat treatments sooner than instructed.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton swabs don&#x27;t have makeup on them, that&#x27;s skin.  There used to be a zit on my nose but it got cpmpeltely taken off.that&#x27;s skin.  There used to be a zit on my nose but it got cpmpeltely taken off.</li>
    <li> In my opinion , it is a good product .&lt;br /&gt;It work for me.I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This gave me itch!  I tried this three times hoping it was just an initial reaction but I couldn&#x27;t stand the itch.  I had to throw it away.  Sorry.  It might work for you but not for me.</li>
    <li> For some reason this did not help my rough bumpy skin</li>
    <li> The percentage does not seem to be accurate to me. I have used it 4 weeks in a row, starting with 1 minute and increasing to 6 minutes and have yet to have any sloughing or peeling. The directions warn about strength, and I generally am very conservative, so I follow directions. It says you are not to leave it on more than 10 minutes. I am more than halfway there and have no change yet. 88% would seem very strong to me logically, and I know it is the more gentle of the hyaluronic acids, but I certainly expected some change with 5 minutes. It stings, but not uncomfortably. I am giving it an extra 2 minutes each week to see what the outcome is before I make a decision to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing. I went over and over the instructions and this product did nothing. I used it twice. I will like my money back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used half of the bottle thus far and there is absolutely no change at all. I see no skin flaking off, no redness, not even the tiniest bit of irritation.to my skin that would indicate the product is doing something...anything. Isn&#x27;t this supposed to be acid? It says not to leave it on for more than 10 minutes but I could leave it on for I/2 hr and it sill wouldn&#x27;t do anything. I have no idea what the purpose of the fan brush is when the instructions tell you to use a cotton ball. The only redeeming quality about this kid is the cream it comes with but I didn&#x27;t buy this kit just to make my blotchy skin shinier.</li>
    <li> This peel was easy to use. I am on my fourth peel and have been starting to see some results. Friends and family have commented on how much younger I look. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> It did not give me a good peel and I tried three times.  I don&#x27;t believe this is a high quality product.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Got an excellent peel from this solution.  The brush is not of the greatest quality so I tossed it.  The cream feels good.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t peel my even after I did more than 3 times it burn for no reason</li>
    <li> Use with caution it works very well it is extremely strong I got minor burns first time using dropped time to 30 seconds works great I use it once a week on the same day !</li>
    <li> Very Strong Peel.  Works very well on dark skin. Weekly peels along with sunblock use as well as washing face with kogic acid soap assists in lightening the skin. Will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> Did not burn at all, minor peeling today&lt;br /&gt;Tickling which is expected&lt;br /&gt;Need 100%&lt;br /&gt;post later after three more,&lt;br /&gt;lol...</li>
    <li> Came 6 days before it was due to get here  , totally awesome ! The product works great , so pleased I ordered this product ! Will most definitely order it again !</li>
    <li> I loved the glow that I received from this product.  Made the mistake of keeping it on for 2 minutes.  I burned of course! That was a mistake.  For me 30 seconds tops.</li>
    <li> As of right now,it&#x27;s not working for me. I don&#x27;t see any results on my skin</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I had always planned to being getting facials bi weekly in my 40&#x27;s, but due to the horrible economy I just wasn&#x27;t able too till now!  This is just what the doctor ordered.  Easy to apply, only burns a bit and then you wash off with the baking soda / water mix, pat dry and VUALA you are looking at younger glowing skin!  I love it and will be using if from now on!</li>
    <li> I used it the first time and liked it very much it really does give a good result for the skin,&lt;br /&gt;and repairing cream it&#x27;s really good it is worth to buying I liked very much</li>
    <li> i love how clear my skin was once it healed from this face peel. it&#x27;s worth the money if you need step by step instruction just go to youtube for clarity..</li>
    <li> This product is great, but I am new to peels so my expectations were a bit high. Its better to start off your regimen with a major peel like TCA 15% then you do upkeep peels with this prouduct once your tca peel has completely heeled.DO NOT PUT THIS OVER YOUR ENTIRE FACE IT WILL BURN.My skin is sensitive and I have low tolerance for the pain so I can only keep it on for 3 mins tops I also have to divide the areas of my face and do one area at a time.&lt;br /&gt;1. I did&#x27;nt experience any type of peeling&lt;br /&gt;2. I was able to use my regular products of Vit A, alpha hydroxy, products both morning and light (wear sunblock)&lt;br /&gt;3. Its easier to use a lower % peel like this weekly, rather than a higher % and suffer more pain with less opportunitities to touch up. you will always look fresh with less peeled up skin.&lt;br /&gt;This peel is for only special trouble areas of your skin, not your entire face, it can do damage if done incorrectly.&lt;br /&gt;4. My skin was softer and I glows more. It takes time and you need to start focus this peel on trouble areas.&lt;br /&gt;5. Overall its a great product</li>
    <li> This product surprised me.  Very nice quality and works very well for line reduction as well as treatment of mild skin issues on my arms due to sun damage in my youth.  I would recommend it to add to weekly or bi-weekly facial routine for reduction on the appearance of fine lines on forehead and around mouth.  Be extra careful anywhere near eyes, his is not a product to get in your eyes.  It does seem to lighten age spots but I have only been using it a short time and think over time the affect will only be better.</li>
    <li> This peel works very well to smooth skin&#x27;s surface and diminish lines. I&#x27;ve even seen some improvement in my &amp;#34;marionette lines&amp;#34; which are hard to treat without plastic surgery. It&#x27;s easy to use, though the instructions didn&#x27;t specify if it could be put into a glass or plastic container for easier brush application. I used a clean, old ceramic cup. It does sting a little if you&#x27;re not used to facials. Fanning your face helps. Be careful not to get to close to sensitive areas like lips or nostrils. I use a little on a cotton ball to treat my hands and knees, which have dark discolored skin. For the price, I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Sucked. Did not work just uncomfortable.  Would not recommend.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Wish I had not purchased.  Will not ever buy again</li>
    <li> Great peel, I use it on my face, chest and hands. I get results just like the ones at the dermatologist and this is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> The lactic acid peel burned my skin and made it red, I did not get the peel that I expected. I had to wait about a month for my skin to clear up.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this strength on your face, you will be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that works really well.</li>
    <li> I could not leave this peel on my face for the recommended time. I had to immediately wash it off because it made my face itch like crazy! I tried it several times to see if I could build a tolerance, but same results each time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic value --  professional strength and results at this price instead of hundreds.</li>
    <li> This was delivered in 3 days which was extremely quick. I love this peel!!! Comes with precise directions extremely helpful and made the product very easy to use. It smells a little like brown sugar. I was expecting a more chemical type sent but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Please read the directions.. ..directions said a minute to three minutes the first time. I would adhere to this advice. Also have your neutralizer ready. Whoa my face started burning at a minute. I neutralized the peel perfectly. After one use my face is brighter Very glowy. I can&#x27;t wait til Sunday to use again. I would be here all day raving about this fabulous product. Thank you Planet Eden. I will order from your company a lot. Oh also this peel in a dermatologists office here in Philly runs about 120 dollars!!!!There are at least 20 something peels in this bottle. What a great deal.Also the cream is extremely hydrating... Filled with all kinds of good for the face oils. Thank you Amazon for bringing this wonderful product to the masses.Good luck peeling. This is just awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say this lactic Acid Peel was a let down for me.  I&#x27;m a guy who has spent a life time in the Arizona sun.  I hoped this peel with do more to lighten hyperpigmentation and soften some acne scars.  I really didn&#x27;t see much improvement....even after a second treatment weeks down the road.  I followed the directions as suggested but didn&#x27;t see what the seller/manufacturer implied should result.  Not a product I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected to</li>
    <li> I tried this acid on my face and it&#x27;s working wonders. My skin tone is more even and smooth. The first time I tried it, it felt like it was burning, so I left it on one minute. I&#x27;ve gradually  increased it to three minutes. So far, this product is doing what I&#x27;ve always dreamed of: perfect skin.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The cream and the fan brush are top notch.</li>
    <li> This is really a professional-strength product. It is very effective and very Strong - must use lightly at first, and really by a user who knows what he/she is doing.</li>
    <li> This is what I go to for a good peel without large areas of flaking. I get light flaking with this, but it only looks like dry skin--nothing like the deeper TCA peels. When I was on Retin-A I had to be extra carefully, because the peel was much deeper. So if you&#x27;re on Retin-A, don&#x27;t be surprised if you have to neutralize before the time is up. Whether you&#x27;re on Retin-A or not, have neutralizer on stand-by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recovery cream is perfect. It calms my burning skin after peels. I used it after this peel and after my at home TCA peels. Mild scent with anti-oxidants.</li>
    <li> Used 3 times so far, pretty gentle on the face area.  Used on my stretch marks made a them smoother and more even. Peels within 3 days.</li>
    <li> I had used a glycolic and lactic acid peel combo on a previous occasion with good results. I figured why not try the different types of peels separately. Be very careful with this peel because it is unbuffered and very intense. I only left it on for about two minutes and burned areas of my face, which have since healed but it looked really bad. I know what I did wrong and will correct it for next time because I will use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this, and glycol acid at the same time. So, far I&#x27;m liking this acid a little bit better. I get more redness, and irritation with this one, but I also get more significant results, primarily with discoloration. I did a lot of research, and watched a lot of Youtube videos before using these for the first time, I would highly recommend the same to anyone else considering using this or any other acid. Research, and a good understanding of what you are doing is key to success with these.</li>
    <li> I love it is great and it works  for me. It&#x27;s easy to follow instructions and it doesn&#x27;t hurt you if you follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> Used it twice... my skin looks better!</li>
    <li> is my fist time using this product , I apply and leave for 5 minutes, my skin star to peel, I think is working, I will update my review in a a month, to see if my dark spot  disappear.</li>
    <li> Serious and effective repair on your face and what ever damage is there that you wish to fix. You can always pay the doctor thousands of dollars to do the same thing you can do for yourself, for pennies.&lt;br /&gt; Some professions, I think are highly overrated, I don&#x27;t need to mention anyone at this time. Do your research. Know what this is supposed to be used for. Everything in moderation. You, know yourself better than anyone else, bottom line. This stuff works, and works well.</li>
    <li> This peel did not give me a true peel.  But, I use Retin-A so that may be the reason why.  However, since I began using it, I have received compliments on my skin, so it must be doing something. I have been using this product once a week, leaving it on for 5 minutes because it does burn like crazy.  I am working my way up to the full 10 minutes.  I personally do not stop using the Retin-A before the peel, usually because I forget.  Rinse off with baking soda and lots of cold water.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t peel, not even a little bit.</li>
    <li> does have a bit of a bite to it, dilute it for first time use. happy with purchase, brush and cream make this a complete set love the convenience</li>
    <li> product as described..love the smell of the creme...so natural ..wish they made a hand lotion smelling this good..Thanks..acid peel good strength helps remove dead skin</li>
