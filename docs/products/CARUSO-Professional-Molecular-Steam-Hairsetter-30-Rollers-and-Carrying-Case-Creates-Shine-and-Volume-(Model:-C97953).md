      <li>You will love them, I do</li>
      <li>These curlers give more volume and with spray the curls hold.  </li>
      <li>This product is okay.  </li>
      <li>but they may be just what YOU are looking for! : )</li>

      <li>Just love them</li>
      <li>is one product that more than lived up to its claims</li>
      <li>Also, the setting of the curl can get better results.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It is quite the trick though- avoiding a crease at the top of each curl.</li>
      <li>Children that age could get burn easily.</li>
      <li>I did receive a question about the rollers from an interested amazon friend and she was under the impression that I allowed my nieces to curl their own hair.</li>
      <li>just cheap Alberto V05 &#x27;</li>

      <li>I have very nice body and looser curls by the next day.  </li>
      <li>It has free super saver shipping.  </li>
      <li>Now I enjoy rolling it up (the routine gets easier) knowing that my hair will look really good and the style will LAST!!</li>
      <li>I can curl my hair with this set and the curl lasts a full 12 hours with NO styling products added.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Holds the curl doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like hot rollers and easy to use without pins they have like a clip that snap on.</li>
      <li>In terms of the hold, super silky/slippery hair does not hold well.  </li>
      <li>The Caruso  rollers are easy to use and gentle on your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight and fine</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and straight and doesn&#x27;t  hold a curl well.  </li>
      <li>They do not dry out your hair, takes 5 seconds easy!</li>
      <li>well - curls in just a few minutes which is great for getting ready in the morning.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and naturally wavy</li>
      <li>and I will now use it all the time instead of the hot rollers.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending time on my hair if the style  lasts for more than ten minutes.  </li>
      <li>We love that the Caruso Steam Hairsetter is not as damaging to our hair as regular heat!</li>
      <li>The foam lasts much longer this way!    </li>
      <li>I have fine, naturally poker straight hair.</li>
      <li>I curl their hair for them until they are old enough to curl their own.</li>
      <li>Only 10min in the moring makes your hair stylish the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I have VERY fine, light blonde, extremely long, straight hair that does not like to hold a curl.</li>
      <li>The petite makes beautifl ringlets for my daughters and the large and jumbo certainly give my hair volume.  </li>
      <li>They must stay in longer to set my long, thick, fine hair, but I love the look and the softness of my hair - it definitely is much more gentle</li>
      <li>I was very happy with this hairsetter, I have used this type for many years and it was time to replace my old one, however I was disappointed with the carrying case, it is nothing but a heavy plastic bag, not the kind of carrying case that it use to come with,</li>
      <li>I purchased these curlers because my coarser hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl (especially now that I am pregnant!)  </li>
      <li>The curl is so much nicer</li>
      <li>but it is very frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It curls in minutes and is so fast to heat the curler.</li>
      <li>This product works really</li>
      <li>and I have very fine,soft, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t stay curled.  </li>
      <li>I only wish I bought 2 more sets as they were so much better than those hard covers and produced a nicer curl w/o the \\&quot;curl cap dent\\&quot; that I was accustomed to with the Carusos.  </li>
      <li>I use small and medium curlers for nicely defined curls.  </li>
      <li>Carrying Case is nice because it holds all of the rollers, but it isn&#x27;t necessary if you have a random bag of your own that would serve the purpose.  </li>
      <li>I do have to set my hair with hairspray afterward &amp; let it cool/dry to maintain the results, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m not burning the hell out of my meager strands or creating more split ends.</li>

      <li>It is an extra step but it is so worth the effort.  </li>

      <li>I needed more large, medium, and small rollers but not tiny or extra large.  </li>

      <li>I purchased my first set of Molecular curlers back in the 80&#x27;s when big hair and spiral perms were fashionable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if this might work better with African American hair or hair that has a little texture.</li>
      <li>Before rolling my hair, I run a hair dryer through my hair and lightly spray my hair with ordinary hair spray.  </li>
      <li>The rollers were very easy to put in but left my hair damp, frizzy and the roller caps left behind a very noticeable print.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
      <li>While I am still learning more about the proper rolling technique, I at least do not have any frizzy results with the combination of clips and hair dryer.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an exciting idea--that you can add volume, wave or a little curl without killing your hair.</li>
      <li>As for the curlers, you may find that 30 rollers are not enough or that you don&#x27;t need any of the tiny ones, extra large ones, or any combination of any other size.  </li>
      <li>Steam heat does not dry or damage your hair plus the steam heat sanitizes the roller for a low maintenance hairsetter.</li>
      <li>I am a busy mom and my time is limited.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I started using Caruso Steam Hairsetter back when it first came out which was over 20 years ago. I gave that set to my sister and she still uses it and it still works great. I bought  this one for my nieces hair who are ages 7 and 9 and I love it.  It curls in minutes and is so fast to heat the curler. I have no doubt we will keep this one in the family another 20 years.  I did receive a question about the rollers from an interested amazon friend and she was under the impression that I allowed my nieces to curl their own hair. No, No, No and I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that. Children that age could get burn easily. I curl their hair for them until they are old enough to curl their own.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about Caruso Steam Hairsetter years ago as these were the only curlers that made her thick hair hold a curl.  I purchased these curlers because my coarser hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl (especially now that I am pregnant!)  My daughters have very fine hair that holds curling iron/hot roller curl only for a few hours.    We have all used the Caruso Steam Hairsetters and I am very satisfied with it!  I bought the multi-pack with roller sizes from petite to jumbo size.  The petite makes beautifl ringlets for my daughters and the large and jumbo certainly give my hair volume.  I use small and medium curlers for nicely defined curls.  Granted, these curls do relax a little each day, but when Caruso says the curls last for days, they do!  I have very nice body and looser curls by the next day.  We love that the Caruso Steam Hairsetter is not as damaging to our hair as regular heat!</li>
    <li> I have fine, naturally poker straight hair. I read every review and decided to take a risk on these, and now I&#x27;m just out $35. It&#x27;s an exciting idea--that you can add volume, wave or a little curl without killing your hair. But it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried it several times and have plenty of hair to work with (below the shoulders). I&#x27;m wondering if this might work better with African American hair or hair that has a little texture. For me, it&#x27;s junk. Even if my hair complies, the curls work their way out into a kinky mess within an hour. I&#x27;ve read the directions over and over. I&#x27;ve tried finishing with hair spray. Nothing works. Too bad!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this hairsetter, I have used this type for many years and it was time to replace my old one, however I was disappointed with the carrying case, it is nothing but a heavy plastic bag, not the kind of carrying case that it use to come with,</li>

    <li> I fell in love with this product over 20 years ago and I still use them everyday (not the same set). I have very fine thin hair and this works wonderfully without harming my hair. I never travel without them either.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and naturally wavy but it is very frizzy.  I set it with large/jumbo rollers to get rid of the frizz &amp; it works well.</li>
    <li> I have VERY fine, light blonde, extremely long, straight hair that does not like to hold a curl. However, these curlers work wonders for me. I do have to set my hair with hairspray afterward &amp; let it cool/dry to maintain the results, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m not burning the hell out of my meager strands or creating more split ends. It is quite the trick though- avoiding a crease at the top of each curl. I think that comes with the territory of having my hair-type, but I welcome any tips in that regard!</li>
    <li> I had a set of these curlers back when I was a kid of the 80s.  The one I had used salt in the water.  It broke a couple of years later, not for lack of quality but for my clumsiness.  I kept the curlers hoping to get another steamer.  But, alas, they ended up in the appliance graveyard in the back of my shelf.  When I once again desired to curl my hair, I instantly thought of this system.  Back then I was a novice and since I was out of practice, I fear I only got worse with using hot rollers.  But this time I bought 2 sets of Conair Pro Clips to use instead of the Caruso covers.  I only wish I bought 2 more sets as they were so much better than those hard covers and produced a nicer curl w/o the \\&quot;curl cap dent\\&quot; that I was accustomed to with the Carusos.  Also, the setting of the curl can get better results.  I tried to just roll the curlers, let them set while getting my makeup on, and then unroll.  But that did not yield the best results.  I now use a soft bonnet hair dryer over the curlers.  The curl is so much nicer and it seems to stay longer.  It is an extra step but it is so worth the effort.  While I am still learning more about the proper rolling technique, I at least do not have any frizzy results with the combination of clips and hair dryer.      Oh, I forgot to mention this:  Before rolling my hair, I run a hair dryer through my hair and lightly spray my hair with ordinary hair spray.  I don&#x27;t even use setting gels, foams, etc...just cheap Alberto V05 &#x27;Hard To Hold&#x27; spray.  Then I brush through my hair and start rolling.      As for the curlers, you may find that 30 rollers are not enough or that you don&#x27;t need any of the tiny ones, extra large ones, or any combination of any other size.  Instead of buying the extra rollers at $12.00 for a set of six, consider just purchasing another Caruso set.  I needed more large, medium, and small rollers but not tiny or extra large.  To buy three sets at $12.00 each, I would spend $36.00 plus shipping.  Why not just buy another unit at $34.00?  It has free super saver shipping.  You do get 30 curlers (I do use the larger and smaller ones...just not as often) and you have a back up unit or a travel unit.  On that note, the foam WILL eventually wear out and you will need to replace the curler or foam part.  I can&#x27;t find the foam part though.  So that is another reason to get extra curlers before you need them.      To keep the curler part (foam) fresher: after you remove your curler, put it back on the steamer to \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; back up.  I roll my hair pretty tight so the foam flattens tightly.  The foam lasts much longer this way!    Happy Curling!!!

    <li> I purchased my first set of Molecular curlers back in the 80&#x27;s when big hair and spiral perms were fashionable.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is stick straight, and slick as glass. I can curl my hair with this set and the curl lasts a full 12 hours with NO styling products added.&lt;br /&gt;I bought extra jumbo rollers, since i have long hair and wanted a looser curl.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this product is extremely durable. I&#x27;m on my second unit and it&#x27;s lasted 10 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;This is one product that more than lived up to its claims</li>
    <li> I had gone through the phase of curly voluminous hair. This does provide volume- in terms of curls/waves. However due to the constuction and steam, it is impossible to have volume at the roots. This is like most hairsetters- tedious to travel. In terms of the hold, super silky/slippery hair does not hold well.  I would recommend this hairsetter to those who do use hot rollers and do not want to damage thier hair to alternate with this product. I have not had any problems in Europe and Asia with  it breaking down (ie;voltage).</li>
    <li> This product works really well - curls in just a few minutes which is great for getting ready in the morning.  Steam heat does not dry or damage your hair plus the steam heat sanitizes the roller for a low maintenance hairsetter.</li>
    <li> The Caruso  rollers are easy to use and gentle on your hair. In ten  minutes you can add curls and volume to your hair. I am a busy mom and my time is limited. I love them and would definately recommend them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and I have very fine,soft, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t stay curled.  My initial idea was to try hot rollers but I don&#x27;t like a lot of heat on my hair and then I found the Caruso Steam Rollers.  I did a lot of research on them, read every review I could find and decided to take a chance since the positive comments outweighed the negative.  When I received my pacakage, I immediately tried them out only to be very disappointed in the end reults.  The rollers were very easy to put in but left my hair damp, frizzy and the roller caps left behind a very noticeable print.  I don&#x27;t hate the product, it just wasn&#x27;t made for my hair type but if you&#x27;re curious about them give them a try because they didn&#x27;t work for me but they may be just what YOU are looking for! : )</li>
    <li> I give 4 stars because my curls do not last days, as the ad says.  They do last for one day.  My hair is straight and fine but there&#x27;s a lot of it.  These curlers give more volume and with spray the curls hold.  Because of the steam, these curlers also tame fly-aways and give a sleek and put together look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not personally recommend heating the clips with hair of the same texture as mine.  I heated clips and took curlers out only to find dented hair.  Not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carrying Case is nice because it holds all of the rollers, but it isn&#x27;t necessary if you have a random bag of your own that would serve the purpose.  My thoughts are that this is the best of its class hairsetter, durable rollers with nice clips.</li>
    <li> I love this steam hair setter.  I use this daily and the curl holds all day.</li>
    <li> The Caruso Steam hairsetter #97953 was purchased to take to Europe on a 3 week trip, as an alternative to the usual hot rollers that end up breaking (the case). These packed easily and turned out to be quite easy and quick to use. They must stay in longer to set my long, thick, fine hair, but I love the look and the softness of my hair - it definitely is much more gentle and I will now use it all the time instead of the hot rollers. I thought the unit was dual voltage but it is not, but no problem with a converter.</li>
    <li> It does its work well. Only 10min in the moring makes your hair stylish the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff to have.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use I like .......................good .........good..... Good. Good good good good very good  easy to use for hair good</li>
    <li> The best curlers ever.. They do not dry out your hair, takes 5 seconds easy! You will love them, I do</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and straight and doesn&#x27;t  hold a curl well.  It has now reached about shoulder length and I wanted to give this hairsetter a try, thinking I could return  it to Sally&#x27;s if it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was skeptical but hopeful.  I don&#x27;t mind spending time on my hair if the style  lasts for more than ten minutes.  I am so pleased!  My style lasts for days!  I pull it up in a ponytail at night and it&#x27;s still  good to go in the morning.  My hair is also oily, so usually it gets grungy really fast.  I usually have to wash it every day or at least every other day.  When I have to tend to it all the time and the style doesn&#x27;t last, I tend to just let it go.  Now I enjoy rolling it up (the routine gets easier) knowing that my hair will look really good and the style will LAST!! The skeptic is satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Holds the curl doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like hot rollers and easy to use without pins they have like a clip that snap on. Just love them my hubby likes the way it curls my hair to.</li>
