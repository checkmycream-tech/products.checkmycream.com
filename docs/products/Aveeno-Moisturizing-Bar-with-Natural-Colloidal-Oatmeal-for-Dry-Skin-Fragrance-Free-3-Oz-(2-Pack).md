      <li>BTW--Aveeno fragrance free soap is fine, unscented, and a blessing if you have perfume-driven migraines, just find a reputable supplier.  </li>
      <li>It was alright , didn&#x27;t really make suds like I was expecting and it kind of got used up real quick.</li>
      <li>Ordering was easy and Delivery was prompt.</li>
      <li>My husband is very sensitive to fragrances, so I&#x27;m always looking for good fragrance-free skin products.</li>
      <li>Gluten sensitivity is not an uncommon problem, and the basic ingredient of this bar contains a bunch of it.</li>
      <li>The clincher competitive price and free shipping.</li>
      <li>If your primary goal is exfoliation, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>It does not transfer to the skin, nor can I smell the bar when I walk into the bathroom, which is important to me as I do not like perfumed or flowery soaps that (to me) stink up the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made of oat flour--and isn&#x27;t good for celiac/gluten sensitive people.</li>
      <li>I must agree with the masses when I say that this bar is worth its weight in gold!  </li>
      <li>I am happy with it and will stay with it as long as I can find it.</li>
      <li>I used it for a while and worked great for me, but I started dating someone gluten sensitive and her skin started to break out, and she got a rash in certain areas.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to use if you at all suffer from any dry skin or skin irritations.</li>
      <li>Treats my dry skin even more kindly than cetaphil or dove.</li>
      <li>The dog food that was with this order was damaged as the box was too large but the soap was fine.  </li>
      <li>After I tried different creams to treat dry skin in my hands, the Aveno Soap proof was the best choice.</li>
      <li>If I use any kind of facial soap, no matter how many &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; it has in it, it will dry out my face and cause my skin to produce even more oil.</li>
      <li>the Aveeno items calm and relax.</li>
      <li>(I rarely check luggage.)  </li>
      <li>The price was far more than I pay at the store.  </li>
      <li>you love this product, you might also enjoy using the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Aveeno Stress relief Body Wash or Aveeno Stress Relief</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too abrasive, just the right amount.</li>
      <li>I occasionally have mild eczema outbreaks, so I cannot speak for those with more severe cases or itching skin, but this bar and the moisturizer have worked wonders for me.</li>
      <li>I love their products, and this one is no different.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin feels, especially my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was worried that it would not be effective in removing makeup, especially mascara, but it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno also has a new product, a moisturizer for people with eczema</li>
      <li>Lets just say I&#x27;ve used many soaps for many years and never found one that actually added positive results to my skin visually other than making me smell and feel clean..this stuff works wonders.</li>
      <li>My skin (especially my leg skin) is itchy, flaky, cracked and bleeds easily when scratched.</li>
      <li>It is a nice soap to use in the tub but it has to be put in a dry place after your bath because it gets very creamy and soft and can be used up faster than you intend it to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a real &amp;#34;rip-off.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>The combination of oatmeal and rosemary seems to be very healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This soap seems to be very soothing.  </li>
      <li>I have VERY oily greasy skin.</li>
      <li>I went to the doctor and they told me it was a hormonal changes that lead him to have the pimples and the physician really did not have any recommendation.  </li>
      <li>It would make as much sense to call peanut butter hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Works very well.    </li>
      <li>Tips: After reading articles on proper skin care, I learned to avoid hot showers or hot showers for length amounts of time; avoid exfoliating daily; avoid use of harsh soaps; and (most important for me) wash the areas that need to be washed.</li>
      <li>This bar is less drying than most.  </li>
      <li>It is very mild, not much stronger than [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Or you can use regular soap throughout but make sure to lather Aveeno on your skin, rub it in, and wash off last.</li>
      <li>It is not unpleasant, just different.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind of Bar Soap that I can use due to having very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but it melts onto your skin leaving it soft and if you have irritated skin like excema or razor bumps its gentle on the skin..</li>
      <li>Lather was extremely poor and did not feel good on my skin.</li>
      <li>I tried many different cleansers that were recommended for dry skin, but my face never felt clean, and no matter what I used, it still felt incredibly dry.</li>
      <li>Without question, if you have any special need for irritated, dry or combination skin, this soap is miraculous.</li>
      <li>Seriously nothing else helps my skin except for Aveeno, it cleans it from all day dirt and makes me feel soo fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>The bar is not very foamy, but since I only use it for my face that is OK.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed but not &#x27;tight&#x27; or dry.</li>
      <li>but if you read dermatological reviews on dry skin, besides skin disorders, dry skin is mostly caused by improper showering/bathing measures by people.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Oatmeal soap and clear complexion lotion for 10 years and am still hooked.  </li>
      <li>Natural - Not a lot of chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by my ob-gyn for cleansing sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>Leaving skin soft...</li>
      <li>My doctor recommended it for me, help with skin rashes, do look in to it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If you find yourself washing your hands all day, use this one and you won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re washing away all of your skin&#x27;s natural protection.</li>
      <li>Years ago when I was a young girl a dermatologist recommended an oatmeal bar.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit gritty and doesn&#x27;t lather much at all.  </li>
      <li>Actually, you can&#x27;t even really smell it while showering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several weeks now and really like it.</li>
      <li>The most cleansing and least drying soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>But if you have sensitive skin or are prone to uit/yeast infections/psoriasis and</li>
      <li>It really nourishes my dry sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little bit gritty (for exfoliation), and it also does not lather a lot (it&#x27;s soap-free), but it makes my skin so soft and it feels clean.  </li>

    <li> Exactly as advertised. Delivered on time. The clincher competitive price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES will not honor their listing!      The item description I purchased was for 2 sets of 12-PACK bars, what I received were 2 INDIVIDUAL bars. I was shorted 22 bars of soap.  Repeated attempts to resolve this matter were met with \\&quot;sorry, technical error, Amazon&#x27;s fault, your order was for 2 individual bars\\&quot;. When presented with the facts and screenshots proving I ordered two 12-PACK sets equalling 24 bars, the company stopped communication. Fraudlent listing and horrible company. NEVER will I order from this company again.  You will NOT get a refund from this company or the remainder of your order.  BUYER BEWARE!    BTW--Aveeno fragrance free soap is fine, unscented, and a blessing if you have perfume-driven migraines, just find a reputable supplier.  Don&#x27;t buy it from BP MEDICAL SUPPLY.</li>
    <li> I love this soap for after shave.Whats great about this bar is that is doesnt lather up bubbles but it melts onto your skin leaving it soft and if you have irritated skin like excema or razor bumps its gentle on the skin..Leaving skin soft...</li>
    <li> It was alright , didn&#x27;t really make suds like I was expecting and it kind of got used up real quick. I use dove hypoallergenic with moisturizing cream and it works good now.</li>
    <li> Without question, if you have any special need for irritated, dry or combination skin, this soap is miraculous. If Aveeno makes it, buy without any doubt that it will satisfy!</li>
    <li> I was tired of applying lotion every time I got out of the shower to combat my dry skin. So, I decided to buy a moisturizing soap so I can cut back on how often I have to apply lotion.     The smell of this soap isn&#x27;t that pleasant. It says \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;, but it reminds me of the smell of my multivitamins. However, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger. Actually, you can&#x27;t even really smell it while showering. Just if you actually smell the bar.    The texture is gritty if you apply the bar directly to the skin. It&#x27;s not too abrasive, just the right amount. So, I now use this instead of a body scrub! Works very well.    I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin to be any softer. At all. I still have to use lotion every time I get out of the shower. I&#x27;ll keep using it and update this review if circumstances change. But, as of now, I&#x27;ll have to say this failed at moisturizing my skin.</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily greasy skin. If I use any kind of facial soap, no matter how many &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; it has in it, it will dry out my face and cause my skin to produce even more oil. But this Aveeno soap actually keeps it from doing that. I&#x27;ll be buying more of it.</li>
    <li> I did not like this hard, dry feeling bar of soap. Lather was extremely poor and did not feel good on my skin. I gave the two bars away</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for people with irritated skin.  I got it for someone who has psoriasis and washes his hands alot during the day.  All the other soaps made his hands red and irritated.  This soap seems to be very soothing.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  switched to Sappo Hill Oatmeal soap and since then he hasn&#x27;t had any problems with his fingers or hands being red or cracked and it&#x27;s usually cheaper per bar and just works fantastic.</li>
    <li> I must agree with the masses when I say that this bar is worth its weight in gold!  I have suffered from dry skin a majority of my life. My skin (especially my leg skin) is itchy, flaky, cracked and bleeds easily when scratched. I live in upstate New York so the temperature is frigid this time of the year and my skin has taken a beating - being parched, and ashy. I have dealt and suffered with this a long time and am tired of having unsightly, dry, skin. I have tried a number of creams and lotions, making sure to lather after baths - pat not rub - and all the other tricks of the trade. However, this winter I knew I&#x27;d have to step up my game and so I decided to delve into different health and personal care products - this being one of them.  After three weeks of use my skins has literally changed over night. Whereas before I would be putting on half a tub of lotion on my legs, I just put a minimal-moderate amount of lotion on my skin after a shower and that now lasts me the whole day long. I literally had fissures forming along my legs and that is no longer. I have no complaints - just that I wish I&#x27;d found this long time ago and used it. It would&#x27;ve saved me the number of scars and marks from fits of scratching.  Overview: This provides not only moisture but is also a cleanser so you can rest assured and know you&#x27;re getting cleaned. My skin was rough but has become considerably smoother. Now one needs to make sure that they are not allergic to oats/oatmeal and other ingredients but this product is wonderful.  Tips: After reading articles on proper skin care, I learned to avoid hot showers or hot showers for length amounts of time; avoid exfoliating daily; avoid use of harsh soaps; and (most important for me) wash the areas that need to be washed. So, I use a regular soap to wash my underarms. feet, etc. I use the Aveeno for my arms, abdomen, legs where dry skin is problematic. I do this 3-4 days a week and on other days I use my regular soap, and exfoliate. Or you can use regular soap throughout but make sure to lather Aveeno on your skin, rub it in, and wash off last. This isn&#x27;t a schedule everyone has to follow but if you read dermatological reviews on dry skin, besides skin disorders, dry skin is mostly caused by improper showering/bathing measures by people. So change your shower techniques, and use Aveeno!</li>
    <li> We use the Aveeno Body wash but when traveling I use this bar.  I pop it into a soap box and it does not have to be counted in the liquids zip top bag.  (I rarely check luggage.)  It is perfect for body and face.  Often in USA hotels, the soap is of unknown origin and can be irritating to the skin and overseas, soap is sometimes not included.</li>
    <li> This bar is less drying than most.  Years ago when I was a young girl a dermatologist recommended an oatmeal bar.  Then I had oily skin - now of course dry.  It is not as moisturizing though as I would like now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made of oat flour--and isn&#x27;t good for celiac/gluten sensitive people. I used it for a while and worked great for me, but I started dating someone gluten sensitive and her skin started to break out, and she got a rash in certain areas. I stopped using this product, and her symptoms resolved.  The term &#x27;hypo allergenic&#x27; is misleading on this product. Gluten sensitivity is not an uncommon problem, and the basic ingredient of this bar contains a bunch of it. It would make as much sense to call peanut butter hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of cleanser out there. This is the one I&#x27;m sticking with: no perfume-y scent, no irritation, it doesn&#x27;t overdry ... perfect.</li>
    <li> GREAT product and easily found through AMAZON but not so elsewhere. Doctors and healthcare providers have recommended this product . . . I am happy with it and will stay with it as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> The most cleansing and least drying soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Treats my dry skin even more kindly than cetaphil or dove.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use if you at all suffer from any dry skin or skin irritations. If you find yourself washing your hands all day, use this one and you won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re washing away all of your skin&#x27;s natural protection. I&#x27;ve occasionally used it to wash my face, and it does a complete job of removing my make-up without leaving it red and irritated. Definitely worth a try if bar-soaps have disappointed you before!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was glad to find it on Amazon.com. This is the only kind of Bar Soap that I can use due to having very sensitive skin. Ordering was easy and Delivery was prompt. I would order again when I need to refill my supply. Thank you</li>
    <li> The advertisement indicated that I would receive 4 Bars.  Instead, I received 1 bar.  The price was far more than I pay at the store.  This was a real &amp;#34;rip-off.&amp;#34;  I should have sent the one bar back; however, it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve been stung using Amazon, so I&#x27;m ahead of the game.  Unfortunately, it will probably be my last purchase on Amazon.  They get one star because I can&#x27;t give less on this site.</li>
    <li> My husband is very sensitive to fragrances, so I&#x27;m always looking for good fragrance-free skin products. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several weeks now and really like it. I have oily skin, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy but I can feel that it&#x27;s moisturizing it.</li>
    <li> Received this as expected.  The dog food that was with this order was damaged as the box was too large but the soap was fine.  I would order the soap again.</li>
    <li> Cleans and moisturizes without drying, and without leaving skin oily.  Minimizes acne flare ups.  I haven&#x27;t had any acne problems once I started using the product again.  Natural - Not a lot of chemicals.  Good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, especially in winter.  I use this soap and have no complaints.  It must be working because I don&#x27;t have the side effects of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,it&#x27;s god sent. Works amazing for eczema and acne,also makes your skin feel naturally fresh without all the soapy,chemical feel. The smell is nice,smells like oatmeal lol but it&#x27;s very light and nothing you will even notice. Lets just say I&#x27;ve used many soaps for many years and never found one that actually added positive results to my skin visually other than making me smell and feel clean..this stuff works wonders.</li>
    <li> Works perfect and hydrates my sensitive skin! I love this product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended it for me, help with skin rashes, do look in to it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Seriously nothing else helps my skin except for Aveeno, it cleans it from all day dirt and makes me feel soo fresh and clean! other products make my skin break out or extra dry, but this one is just right !</li>
    <li> Not long ago, I started putting oatmeal in a little bit of cheesecloth and added it to my bath. Then, I added rosemary and other herbs for variety. The combination of oatmeal and rosemary seems to be very healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this soap contains oat flour, it doesn&#x27;t contain herbs. It is a nice soap to use in the tub but it has to be put in a dry place after your bath because it gets very creamy and soft and can be used up faster than you intend it to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno products heal the skin and are comforting, soothing products. You will start to notice your skin looking much more smooth and healthy after using products with oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love this product, you might also enjoy using the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Aveeno Stress relief Body Wash or Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Aveeno items calm and relax. I especially love the Stress Relief Lotion in the 2.5 oz tube that can be kept in your purse. The burst of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is healing at any time of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;Lover of Long Baths with Essential Oils and a Poetry Book</li>
    <li> This bar was just okay for me.  It is a bit gritty and doesn&#x27;t lather much at all.  I found myself using regular soap and using this bar on the areas where my skin needed the Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I never thought a soap could make such a big difference.  I switched to this soap about ten days ago and I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin feels, especially my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno bar looks and feels completely different from any other bar soap.  It does not lather to any great extent, which may bother some people, but the fact is that lather serves no cleaning purpose.  It does feel creamy and pleasant.  It also has a smell that, well, smells like oatmeal, so that is an adjustment.  It is not unpleasant, just different.  It does not transfer to the skin, nor can I smell the bar when I walk into the bathroom, which is important to me as I do not like perfumed or flowery soaps that (to me) stink up the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that it would not be effective in removing makeup, especially mascara, but it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno also has a new product, a moisturizer for people with eczema [[ASIN:B0012JY4T6 Aveeno Active Naturals Eczema Care Moisturizing Cream, 6 Oz]], that I also started using a week ago, and the effects of the combination of the two is a marvel.  I occasionally have mild eczema outbreaks, so I cannot speak for those with more severe cases or itching skin, but this bar and the moisturizer have worked wonders for me.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but not for me I have a very sensitive face and it doesn&#x27;t help my face is red a lot of the time not from the product just because I am a diabetic and my face is so dry. I have to use a not soap product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to wash my super-sensitive skinned face. I have psoriasis and rosacea, and Aveeno&#x27;s bar gently washes away the dirt and grime without irritating my skin. It actually calms the redness on my cheeks, and I&#x27;ve seen improvements in my complexion over the few months I&#x27;ve been using it. The only place I could find it was here on Amazon, aside from a gift pack at the holidays.</li>
    <li> After I tried different creams to treat dry skin in my hands, the Aveno Soap proof was the best choice.Always in the winter the skin in my hands get very dry. After 1 week using this soap I saw the differnce.</li>
    <li> The key word here is &amp;#34;Natural.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s hard to find a bar soap that is non-drying and still makes you feel clean. Aveeno makes great products and I love this soap.</li>
    <li> I just turned 40 and I will actually break out if my skin gets too dry.  I tried many different cleansers that were recommended for dry skin, but my face never felt clean, and no matter what I used, it still felt incredibly dry. I tried this moisturizing bar two weeks ago, and I hope they never discontinue it because it is THE BEST cleanser I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s a little bit gritty (for exfoliation), and it also does not lather a lot (it&#x27;s soap-free), but it makes my skin so soft and it feels clean.  I used Cetaphyl cleansing bars, Neutrogena cleansing bars, and several other facial cleansers for dry skin, and none of them gave me the results I&#x27;ve gotten from Aveeno. I have tried other Aveeno products in the past (the lotions and oatmeal packets) for my boys who had eczema - nothing else worked to clear up their skin like Aveeno.  I love their products, and this one is no different.</li>
    <li> My son was less than a month and had pimples.  I went to the doctor and they told me it was a hormonal changes that lead him to have the pimples and the physician really did not have any recommendation.  I used this soap on him and the pimples cleared after three days.  We noticed when we soap using the soap, the pimples returned.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Oatmeal soap and clear complexion lotion for 10 years and am still hooked.  Keeps my skin tone even looking, less breakouts, never over dries my skin.  People can&#x27;t believe how young I look for a 45 year old female.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> The soap has a lot of texture.  Does not suds up.  Would&#x27;nt buy it again.</li>
    <li> this is not a good buy at all for the price.it does not clean very well and did not help my skin at all</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong thing</li>
    <li> Recommended by my ob-gyn for cleansing sensitive areas. Works like a charm. This is not your traditional hand-washing soap. But if you have sensitive skin or are prone to uit/yeast infections/psoriasis and the like &#x27;down there&#x27;, it is THE stuff to use. They also make an Aveeno oatmeal bath soak, which is great for psoriasis outbreaks.</li>
    <li> I love this for a soap on the go. It really nourishes my dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my face. It is very mild, not much stronger than [[ASIN:B00EZWS0VK Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin, 16 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed but not &#x27;tight&#x27; or dry. The bar lasts quite a long time, comparable to a Dove body soap bar. The bar is not very foamy, but since I only use it for my face that is OK. If your primary goal is exfoliation, look elsewhere. There is really no grit or abrasion to this soap at all.</li>
    <li> I have used before so I know it works on very dry skin.  Re-ask later for follow-up results</li>
    <li> THIS AVEENO SOAP BAR IS GREAT FOR YOUR FACE, THE SHIPPING TOOK FOREVER AND I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS ITEM FROM WALMART  FOR THE SAME PRICE AND I WOULD&#x27;NT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS ITEM TO COME IN THE MAIL.THANK ANYWAY*</li>
