      <li>I liked the product and have ordered it before.</li>
      <li>The scrub feels great in the shower on your pregnant</li>
      <li>The body scrub makes your skin feel soft and wonderful.</li>
      <li>This is a very good body scrub and leaves my skin soft with a glow.</li>
      <li>love this stuff-hard to find</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll smell and feel extra delicious.</li>
      <li>This is excellent for dry, working hands.</li>
      <li>For someone who has dry skin, this is wonderful stuff.  </li>
      <li>The sugar one is better that the salt one simply because if some of it gets into my mouth, it tastes great</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it as a good scrub that is moisturizing as well.  </li>
      <li>This item was just fine when we used it.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is fine.</li>
      <li>I figured a finer grain sugar scrub would be okay to rinse with every day just to keep my skin fresh.</li>
      <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>We were able to find more locally and that is why we did not buy more.</li>
      <li>You most certainly need to mix the contents before using it, otherwise, YES, it will feel greasy.</li>
      <li>Moreover, this stuff is super greasey.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions, and a friend of mine who lives in the desert said she couldn&#x27;t live without her sugar (or salt) scrub.   </li>
      <li>It works great and is never too harsh.</li>
      <li>it feels great after the shower when normally skin can feel kind of tight and dry when pregnant.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used sugar scrub products before, but this was the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Village Naturals product.      </li>
      <li>The top on this product was not screwed on properly and the body scrub leaked in the shipping box.</li>
      <li>Perhaps this is exactly what others are looking for in a scrub, but not me.  </li>
      <li>Since I started using this scrub, I no longer have the bumps and my skin is super soft!!  </li>
      <li>And yes, even though you mix it really well, the oil still exists in the product.</li>
      <li>I love this scrub and would recommend it to anyone with dry skin issues!!!</li>
      <li>For the review that complained about the greasy feeling, make sure to mix the scrub up with oil so that you get the right mix.  </li>
      <li>I occassionally want something a bit more abbrasive to get that extra layer of dirt off after a long day in the yard.  </li>
      <li>It was like early Christmas for me!</li>
      <li>You can clearly see it.</li>
      <li>the water just bounces off my skin leaving it ridiculously soft.</li>
      <li>but if I wanted to smell like that I would give a popsicle to my 5 year old and then give her a hug.  </li>
      <li>But there is such a high proportion of oil in this product that it left me and the bottom of my bathtub completely greasy.  </li>
      <li>I end my shower with this silky soft scrub before my final rinse.  </li>
      <li>I mixed it up, used it all over, and then went back over my skin with moisturizing body wash, and it left me soft, not greasy.     </li>
      <li>I have their salt scrub, and although I like it very much, it&#x27;s just a bit too harsh for daily use.</li>

<li> My skin is so dry, especially in the winter months.  </li>
<li> Helps scrub dead skin loose &amp; leaves hands very soft with the oil soaking into skin.</li>
<li> What I suggest is, scrubbing down with this first, then washing with your usual soap.</li>
<li> In the winter I still have to use lotion after I dry off, but my skin is hydrated!</li>
<li> I have always had a problem with dry skin and the little bumps on my upper arms and thighs.  </li>
<li> I have very dry skin in the winter.</li>
<li> Only scoop out a little bit at a time to put on one area of your body at a time to keep it from getting on the floor of the shower or bathtub.  </li>
<li> I plan on trying other Village Naturals products.</li>
<li> I had to follow up using this product with lots of plain old soap and water just to get the thick layer of grease off my skin.      </li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer on my regular site, hard to find brands.</li>
<li> And when you use it on your skin, it leaves a slight scent of it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m not the typical target demographic for salt rubs.  </li>
<li> a bit oily, so you have to mix it with your fingers before applying, which can get messy as you&#x27;re trying to mix it while in the shower (i was, anyway) and trying not to spill any of it</li>
<li> I mean, i finished it in less than 3 weeks.</li>
<li> No more pain and irritation.</li>
<li> It does it job, but its small.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and have been using this sugar scrub for at least 5 years.</li>
<li> I kept it anyway because it would have been too much trouble to return, but was disappointed in the mess and the loss of product.</li>
<li> So I was not happy with that and probably will not buy from amazon again.</li>

    <li> This is excellent for dry, working hands. Helps scrub dead skin loose &amp; leaves hands very soft with the oil soaking into skin.</li>
    <li> The body scrub makes your skin feel soft and wonderful. After working in the yard all day and coming in taking a shower and using the \\&quot;Body Scrub\\&quot; I feel I could go out and working 5 or 6 hours in the yard. A friend of mine turned me on to the \\&quot;Body Scrub\\&quot; and I thank her every time I use it.</li>
    <li> It does it job, but its small. I mean, i finished it in less than 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> i have this product and i use it in the shower when i want to indulge. i apply it as a lotion and the sugar just seems to melt into my skin, so when i do rinse it doesnt feel like im rinsing anything. the water just bounces off my skin leaving it ridiculously soft.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with dry skin and the little bumps on my upper arms and thighs.  Since I started using this scrub, I no longer have the bumps and my skin is super soft!!  Living in Colorado, I need all the moisturizer I can get and this wonderful scrub gives that to me.  Plus it cuts out having to apply lotion after getting out of the shower. For someone who has dry skin, this is wonderful stuff.  For the review that complained about the greasy feeling, make sure to mix the scrub up with oil so that you get the right mix.  Only scoop out a little bit at a time to put on one area of your body at a time to keep it from getting on the floor of the shower or bathtub.  I love this scrub and would recommend it to anyone with dry skin issues!!!</li>
    <li> The top on this product was not screwed on properly and the body scrub leaked in the shipping box. I kept it anyway because it would have been too much trouble to return, but was disappointed in the mess and the loss of product. The product itself is fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last week and it came in earlier this week! It was like early Christmas for me! I ordered this scrub as well as the salt scrub and foot scrub. You most certainly need to mix the contents before using it, otherwise, YES, it will feel greasy. I mixed it up, used it all over, and then went back over my skin with moisturizing body wash, and it left me soft, not greasy.     PLUS! I smell like sugar cookies all day! It is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sugar scrub products before, but this was the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Village Naturals product.      I followed the instructions on the label and stirred the product up until the ingredients were blended.  But there is such a high proportion of oil in this product that it left me and the bottom of my bathtub completely greasy.  I had to follow up using this product with lots of plain old soap and water just to get the thick layer of grease off my skin.      I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I liked the product and have ordered it before. I couldn&#x27;t find it any longer on my regular site, hard to find brands. I did find it at yours. I was a bit upset because I paid I think $8.95 and the very next day it went to $5.95. I called customer service to see if I could be honored a credit and they said no. So I was not happy with that and probably will not buy from amazon again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions, and a friend of mine who lives in the desert said she couldn&#x27;t live without her sugar (or salt) scrub.   I found this, read the label and was very happy to see that all (99 per cent) of the ingredients are real, good, natural, and what I was looking for. This stuff is perfect. In the winter I still have to use lotion after I dry off, but my skin is hydrated! No more pain and irritation. The sugar one is better that the salt one simply because if some of it gets into my mouth, it tastes great and it&#x27;s harmless.</li>
    <li> This body scrub was recommended to me to use during pregnancy and I was not disappointed.  The scrub feels great in the shower on your pregnant belly-- massages your itchy tummy nicely.  And it&#x27;s so moisturizing it feels great after the shower when normally skin can feel kind of tight and dry when pregnant.  I highly recommend it as a good scrub that is moisturizing as well.  I read reviews about it being too greasy and must say it wasn&#x27;t at all.  It was perfect.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep this in stock at all times even after pregnancy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m not the typical target demographic for salt rubs.  I occassionally want something a bit more abbrasive to get that extra layer of dirt off after a long day in the yard.  I wanted something that didn&#x27;t smell too feminine or feel to greasey.  This is both.  The scent is of the orange cream popsicles you had as a kid.  Neat to reminince but if I wanted to smell like that I would give a popsicle to my 5 year old and then give her a hug.  Moreover, this stuff is super greasey.  Once rubbed on it feels like I&#x27;ve rubbed butter or lard all over me - not that I&#x27;ve done that before.  It even leaves the floor of the shower extra slippery.  Perhaps this is exactly what others are looking for in a scrub, but not me.  I&#x27;ll be tossing this and looking for something else.</li>
    <li> love this stuff-hard to find</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and have been using this sugar scrub for at least 5 years. I use it during manicures to exfoliate. It works great and is never too harsh. Village Naturals Sugar Scrub is good stuff!</li>
    <li> This scrub is great. I couldn&#x27;t wait to smell it when I got it. Smells like chocolate and cocoa. So good. And when you use it on your skin, it leaves a slight scent of it. Not too strong, but still wonderful. I have their salt scrub, and although I like it very much, it&#x27;s just a bit too harsh for daily use. I figured a finer grain sugar scrub would be okay to rinse with every day just to keep my skin fresh. And yes, there is oil. You can clearly see it. And yes, even though you mix it really well, the oil still exists in the product. What I suggest is, scrubbing down with this first, then washing with your usual soap. You&#x27;ll smell and feel extra delicious.</li>
    <li> This is a very good body scrub and leaves my skin soft with a glow. I recommend this product to everyone that want to smell good and look good. After I got out of the tub I skipped the lotion because I didn&#x27;t need it. I plan on trying other Village Naturals products.</li>
    <li> I love this great body scrub.  My skin is so dry, especially in the winter months.  I end my shower with this silky soft scrub before my final rinse.  My winter itching has been greatly reduced.  Try it!</li>
    <li> smells delicious!  a bit oily, so you have to mix it with your fingers before applying, which can get messy as you&#x27;re trying to mix it while in the shower (i was, anyway) and trying not to spill any of it</li>
    <li> This item was just fine when we used it.  We were able to find more locally and that is why we did not buy more.</li>
    <li> this came to me and was all seperated, it didnt work well, I would not recommend it or buy it again.</li>
