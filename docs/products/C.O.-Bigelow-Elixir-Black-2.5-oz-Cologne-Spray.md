<ol>
      <li>It is so good and not overpowering that a buddy of mine was in a meeting together and asked what cologne I had on, as HE MUST GET IT!</li>
      <li>Smells like you just got out of the barber&#x27;s chair and makes me happy.</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>The bottle and box are both attractive and gift-worthy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you want to smell nice get this!</li>
      <li>There are a great value, nice smell and the scent lasts without being obnoxious.</li>
      <li>good thing</li>
      <li>from that description, you probably wouldn&#x27;t think this scent would be attractive or sexy, but in fact women remark on it all the time.  </li>
      <li>Matches their hair &amp; body wash fragrance and very pleased with both products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m somewhat of a cologne collector, and I honestly don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t wear this one more.</li>
      <li>To smell this good for so cheap is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also use the matching hair and body wash, which are very good shower gels that really go far and compliment the cologne nicely.</li>
      <li>If you want to smell nice, but also smell cheap, then this is the scent for you.</li>
      <li>But for the price and uniqueness of it, it should be in your collection if you like having more than one scent.</li>
      <li>This cologne is interesting.  </li>
      <li>I use the body wash and love the scent, so when I was searching for the body wash</li>
      <li>This is one of the most unique fragrances I own.</li>
      <li>It is a strong smell and you don&#x27;t want it mixing and becoming more strong.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, Black is a wonderfully balanced vanilla with tea and woods.</li>
      <li>Super Unique Men&#x27;s Must have Cologne!</li>
      <li>It smells cheap and looks cheap and sounds cheap.</li>
      <li>It is an old fashioned masculne scent, but sometimes what works just gets crowded out by what sounds good.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s clean &amp; not over powering....</li>
      <li>I found the cologne and am very with the light sweet&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>The sweet elements, the vanilla and tonka bean can become a bit much for some men&#x27;s noses.</li>
      <li>The package was delivered on time and was exactly what was pictured and described.</li>
      <li>The name of this stuff is \\&quot;Barber\\&quot; and when I smelled it, that&#x27;s exactly what I thought of.  </li>
      <li>I had other cologne I liked</li>
      <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s probably synthetic Agar and not real extracts; regardless this great formulation is a bit eyebrow raising to find in a Bath &amp; Body Works for this low of a price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is clean, masculine and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has a nice dark smell to it.</li>
      <li>It has OK projection only for the first couple hours and after about 3-4 hrs it&#x27;s barely noticeable...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful smell and everyone I know goes crazy over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Who wants to smell like a barber?</li>
      <li>It is a soft woody hue with a black elixir aroma that is so unique it has a clean, crisp smell that does not detract the sharpest nose!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the red and blue elixir prior to this and they are much milder scents, this is is a bit stronger for my taste but still a good cologne.</li>
      <li>However, when I did I found myself receiving frequent compliments and liking it very much myself.</li>
      <li>Classic... lot&#x27;s of compliments.</li>
      <li>It is a very sweet scent but also a bit of a dark scent and maybe some sort of a wood scent.</li>
      <li>Sometimes if I sweat, the vanilla can really take over; completely overrides the musk, woods and tea.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap - essentially a $85 bottle of Varvatos for $15; the only thing in BBW I would ever be caught purchasing.  </li>
      <li>Wow, talk about a stroke of luck!</li>
      <li>and that is why I was surprised to see it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>As a result, I consider this a younger man&#x27;s fragrance - definitely on the sweet side.</li>
      <li>Masculine scent</li>
      <li>product too old smells burnt</li>
      <li>Not too heavy, not too light.</li>
      <li>I was still determined to return to my old cologne, but when I compared the price to this one there was no contest.</li>
      <li>It can be a good formal scent to a casual every day one.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this cologne hidden secret by a friend who wanted to get my wife a nice fragrance and realizedit was for men when it was given to her!</li>
      <li>The Bigelow Elixir line is famed for their unapologetic clones of expensive popular fragrances marketed at bargain prices.</li>
      <li>There are a few parts of the scent but the first and foremost element is vanilla.  </li>

<li> Subtle but very masculine.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t use it forever, until one day when I ran out of my other cologne.</li>
<li> This cologne is something I got as a gift from my mother a few years ago.</li>
<li> This is not going to be an everyday wear for me</li>
<li> I have had just about every expensive men&#x27;s cologne there is.</li>
<li> It lasts quite a while and isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
<li> On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s crazy to find an agar wood scent in this price category.</li>

    <li> If you have oily skin, I would avoid this. It is a strong smell and you don&#x27;t want it mixing and becoming more strong. It has a nice dark smell to it. It lasts quite a while and isn&#x27;t expensive. You can also find this product at Bath and Body Works.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this cologne hidden secret by a friend who wanted to get my wife a nice fragrance and realizedit was for men when it was given to her! Wow, talk about a stroke of luck! It is so good and not overpowering that a buddy of mine was in a meeting together and asked what cologne I had on, as HE MUST GET IT! I ended up giving him the bottle and went out and bought me another! You can&#x27;t find it just anywhere and that is why I was surprised to see it on Amazon! It is a soft woody hue with a black elixir aroma that is so unique it has a clean, crisp smell that does not detract the sharpest nose! Well, my secret is no secret, anymore! C.O. Bigelow Barber...Super Unique Men&#x27;s Must have Cologne! Wear and Beware!!</li>
    <li> Classic... lot&#x27;s of compliments.</li>
    <li> This cologne is something I got as a gift from my mother a few years ago. I had other cologne I liked so I didn&#x27;t use it forever, until one day when I ran out of my other cologne. However, when I did I found myself receiving frequent compliments and liking it very much myself. I was still determined to return to my old cologne, but when I compared the price to this one there was no contest. To smell this good for so cheap is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that it can only be found online, for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> I have had just about every expensive men&#x27;s cologne there is. This stuff tops them all. Not too heavy, not too light. Just right. Smells like you just got out of the barber&#x27;s chair and makes me happy. Great price. It seemed like I got it the day after I ordered it too.</li>
    <li> I use the Black daily, and have given several other colors as gifts. This is a spicy, peppery long lasting scent that is manly and not overpowering. There are a great value, nice smell and the scent lasts without being obnoxious. I also use the matching hair and body wash, which are very good shower gels that really go far and compliment the cologne nicely.</li>
    <li> Matches their hair &amp; body wash fragrance and very pleased with both products.  Masculine scent that&#x27;s clean &amp; not over powering....</li>
    <li> The name of this stuff is \\&quot;Barber\\&quot; and when I smelled it, that&#x27;s exactly what I thought of.  It took me instantly back to when I was a little boy when my father would take me to an old style barbershop where there was seldom any customers under 50.  It reminded me of the aftershave they&#x27;d rub on your neck after trimming it close with the electric blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now from that description, you probably wouldn&#x27;t think this scent would be attractive or sexy, but in fact women remark on it all the time.  It is an old fashioned masculne scent, but sometimes what works just gets crowded out by what sounds good.</li>
    <li> This cologne is interesting.  There are a few parts of the scent but the first and foremost element is vanilla.  This is not going to be an everyday wear for me but I can see wearing it on a date or maybe to a party or something.  Not a cologne I would wear to the office.  It is a very sweet scent but also a bit of a dark scent and maybe some sort of a wood scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is trash in my opinion. It smells cheap and looks cheap and sounds cheap. Barber? Who wants to smell like a barber? The spritz cap eventually came off of my bottle and then the insides began to congeal (if it was proper perfume it would never do this). On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible. If you want to smell nice, but also smell cheap, then this is the scent for you. But its time for me to move up.</li>
    <li> The Bigelow Elixir line is famed for their unapologetic clones of expensive popular fragrances marketed at bargain prices. As elixir White is a clone of Allure Homme Sport and elixir Green is a clone of Polo Blue, Black is a direct lift from John Varvatos.  As with JV, same basic woody oriental formula with a creamy vanilla warmth. Being an EDC, it&#x27;s longevity is pretty poor, par for the course of any $15 bottle of cologne. Nonetheless, Black is a wonderfully balanced vanilla with tea and woods. It&#x27;s crazy to find an agar wood scent in this price category. Yeah, it&#x27;s probably synthetic Agar and not real extracts; regardless this great formulation is a bit eyebrow raising to find in a Bath &amp; Body Works for this low of a price.  It has OK projection only for the first couple hours and after about 3-4 hrs it&#x27;s barely noticeable... good thing it&#x27;s cheap - essentially a $85 bottle of Varvatos for $15; the only thing in BBW I would ever be caught purchasing.  Why would you not like this cologne? The sweet elements, the vanilla and tonka bean can become a bit much for some men&#x27;s noses. Sometimes if I sweat, the vanilla can really take over; completely overrides the musk, woods and tea. As a result, I consider this a younger man&#x27;s fragrance - definitely on the sweet side. Hands down this stands head and shoulders above any other $15 cologne you&#x27;ll find in a mall bargain bin. This frag is a steal at this price.</li>
    <li> I use the body wash and love the scent, so when I was searching for the body wash I found the cologne and am very with the light sweet&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.</li>
    <li> product too old smells burnt</li>
    <li> I get all kinds of compliments on this cologne. Subtle but very masculine. Lots of husbands owe me big time!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most unique fragrances I own. I&#x27;m somewhat of a cologne collector, and I honestly don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t wear this one more. I think I just have my favorites. But for the price and uniqueness of it, it should be in your collection if you like having more than one scent. It can be a good formal scent to a casual every day one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been to 3 malls, online and allot of stores. And found it. It&#x27;s a wonderful smell and everyone I know goes crazy over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell nice get this!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this cologne. The bottle and box are both attractive and gift-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is clean, masculine and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the red and blue elixir prior to this and they are much milder scents, this is is a bit stronger for my taste but still a good cologne.</li>
    <li> The package was delivered on time and was exactly what was pictured and described.</li>
