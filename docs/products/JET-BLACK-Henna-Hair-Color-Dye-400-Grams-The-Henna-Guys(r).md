<ol>
      <li>Truly impressed with the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>very good product</li>
      <li>i bought the brazillian henna and then read that it wasnt very good for you.</li>
      <li>The Henna Guy tech support has been great.</li>
      <li>Great delivery time.</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>the indigo wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>My cousin directed me to a great website that explained the process</li>
      <li>lol..</li>
      <li>I may have to leave it on a bit longer than instructions, but I am happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Neither are ideal and I am still searching for a better solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Happy to use a chemical free product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The henna was amazing.</li>
      <li>a teabag or lemon to the warm water before mixing in the henna</li>
      <li>No matter what kind of hair rinse I used.</li>
      <li>this may be a good and healthy product for some people hair</li>
      <li>Still working to perfect the color, but I like how my hair looks so far.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;No more chemicals&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>it should have worked even better since my hair was already dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>would order henna from this seller again but search elsewhere for some indigo with more tinting power.</li>
      <li>Then I sat under the soft bonnet dryer (love this dryer) laying on my bed, rinsed thoroughly and all of my grays were an orangish like color 27, and it looked nice.  </li>
      <li>To be fair my hair has chemical damage, but like I said, I barely saw any dye release from the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product, I used it for the first time this month, and I will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>I even tried to dilute it so there would be more, but no, i was unsuccessful in saturating my whole head.</li>
      <li>I really wish these Henna products came with detailed instructions  </li>
      <li>I really wish henna products would come with detailed instructions because someone like me who NEEDS to use Henna and wont go without coloring the hair.  </li>
      <li>it left my hair like a burnt orange which I really liked.</li>
      <li>and I was right.</li>
      <li>Used this product for the first time, it was totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good product, it is 100% natural.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to permanent dye ingredients including PPD and tried pretty much everything that claim PPD free permanent dye but none really worked.</li>
      <li>I am glad I finally found something that works and stays on months+.</li>
      <li>patience, and more patience is the key when applying the two sets of dye on your hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color but not what I wanted from the two-step process.</li>
      <li>he only issue is that there are too many processes need to achieve the color I wanted.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love and will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>first try!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>while emailing the Henna Guys, they first said they&#x27;d send me another one and asked for my info</li>
      <li>This is very high-quality dye!</li>
      <li>it was my first</li>
      <li>researched further and found that 2 step process gives better results so I bought this product.  </li>
      <li>the copper tones that show when the indigo has faded is still better than grey.  </li>
      <li>I tested it on them, one with just pure henna and one with the 2 step process.</li>
      <li>but all of my long 3c/4a hair came out a beautiful jet black.</li>
      <li>Really finely sifted and made my already-dark hair almost a deep burgundy color!</li>
      <li>No orange at all really.</li>
      <li>so i don&#x27;t really have much options to choose from.</li>
      <li>maximize the color required, you need to let the dye stay on your hair from 2 to 3 hours for each application.&lt;br /&gt;The dye drips from your hair slowly as you let it stay, so make sure you have paper towel available to wipe it</li>
      <li>It is the first time I used this brand, the first time I sat under the dryer to shorten the time and the first time I mixed in Kalpi tone.  </li>
      <li>at first they said I need to try several times after my first time</li>
      <li>It washes out great, doesn&#x27;t clump, and my hair actually came out jet black!!!</li>
      <li>have an old doll with synthetic hair and one with real hair.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve given me a nice natural black but there were still red highlights in the sun, so</li>
      <li>There could be some strands not affected by the dye, but this gives that natural look where a few hair strands could be gray/white while most strands will be black.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
      <li>I noticed that it was not enough when i was doing the first step, i could not cover all my hair</li>
      <li>First I followed the step one process, I left in my hair for two hours.  </li>
      <li>I did it in two separate steps (sometimes I have done it in one step with exactly the same results as in two steps).  </li>
      <li>The purple tints were clearly visible on close up and in daylight.  </li>
      <li>I bought the henna because I wanted to dye my hair with a natural product.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like how soft my hair is and</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have much to say about this haven&#x27;t use it yet because you have to leave it on for 3 hours at a time which is six hours total.  </li>
      <li>It has been such a long time since my hair was all black with no grays or no orangish red highlights (which look good by the way if you want highlights).  </li>
      <li>apply the Henna first (reddish color), let it stay for 3 hours, wash it off, and let it dry (and you may use a hair dryer) before applying the Indigo dye.  </li>
      <li>Some so called PPD free products even contained small quantities of PPD.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>This is the first time my grays were jet black.  </li>
      <li>I have natural thick hair and wanted it jet black, shiny and strong.  </li>

<li> This is the first time my grays were jet black.  </li>
<li> I have natural thick hair and wanted it jet black, shiny and strong.  </li>
<li> my hair is natural black, the blackest a human can be born with.</li>
<li> I initially tried one step black natural henna from another vendor.  </li>
<li> The info about says that it is enough to cover someone with very long hair -- i do not have long hair.</li>
<li> Then I sat under my gold no hot soft bonnet dryer for about 30 minutes and spent about 30 additional minutes not under the dryer using the phone.  </li>
<li> I also let the Indigo (with bluish color) stay on my hair for 3 hours, so it takes me at least a half day to complete the whole process.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s too long of a process</li>
<li> So if you have really long hair order two packs of the two step packs</li>
<li> When I washed my face, I had patches of white, orange, red, blue, green and black hair.  </li>
<li> id understand if I wanted to dye my hair RED, but I tried to dye it JET black.</li>
<li> I mixed with salt, olive oil and half of one box of Kalpi tone.</li>
<li> It did make my hair a little darker, but it still had a mahogany tint, and it&#x27;s VERY red in sunlight.</li>
<li> I mixed henna with 1 tbs of olive oil and a little salt and used immediately.  </li>
<li> The smell is awful, it smells like algae or whatever that stuff at the bottom of your fish tank, lol.</li>
<li> careful with staining your bathroom.  </li>
<li> I am just annoyed that i am going to have to do this whole messy process again next week.</li>
<li> After step 1, my beard hair turned orange which I expected.  </li>
<li> The net effect on my hair is dark black hair.  </li>
<li> Even when I do a henna/indigo one-step mix, the indigo usually stains my gloves blue, but this stuff didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> now use a single step black henna product from another company that gives me black and less purple tint</li>
<li> and then they said it wouldnt work on dark hair?</li>
<li> wont be surprised if my house gets broken into while im out.</li>
<li> That gave me black and purple tints on my face.  </li>
<li> I wanted to dye my hair jet black with this</li>
<li> So, i am doing the two step process to get jet black hair.</li>
<li> and then I use the black mascara made for beard to cover purple.  </li>
<li> but its not JET black.</li>
<li> so I trimmed my beard and then applied a black mascara like</li>
<li> but, did not get the color I was looking for which is black</li>
<li> product didn&#x27;t cover my greys and  after all that work left my dark hair looking lighter, dryer and just unhealthy.</li>
<li> The indigo faded after a few washes.  </li>
<li> I usually use Harvest Moon</li>

    <li> You need time of at least half-a-day and someone to assist you in the application of each product on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;To maximize the color required, you need to let the dye stay on your hair from 2 to 3 hours for each application.&lt;br /&gt;The dye drips from your hair slowly as you let it stay, so make sure you have paper towel available to wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious with clothes that could be stained by the dye when it drips from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Henna first (reddish color), let it stay for 3 hours, wash it off, and let it dry (and you may use a hair dryer) before applying the Indigo dye.  I also let the Indigo (with bluish color) stay on my hair for 3 hours, so it takes me at least a half day to complete the whole process.  The net effect on my hair is dark black hair.  There could be some strands not affected by the dye, but this gives that natural look where a few hair strands could be gray/white while most strands will be black.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with staining your bathroom.  I wash off the dye from my hair using the laundry tub.&lt;br /&gt;Patience, patience, and more patience is the key when applying the two sets of dye on your hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The indigo faded after a few washes.  I like how soft my hair is and the copper tones that show when the indigo has faded is still better than grey.  I had to order two packages because I knew 100 grams was not going to be enough and I was right.</li>
    <li> my hair is natural black, the blackest a human can be born with. but its not JET black. I wanted to dye my hair jet black with this and it didn&#x27;t work. ive been emailing back and forth The Henna Guys and they were a bit suspicious.....at first they said I need to try several times after my first time and then they said it wouldnt work on dark hair? tf?! id understand if I wanted to dye my hair RED, but I tried to dye it JET black. it should have worked even better since my hair was already dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an old doll with synthetic hair and one with real hair. I tested it on them, one with just pure henna and one with the 2 step process. it left their BLONDE hair yellow! didn&#x27;t work! while emailing the Henna Guys, they first said they&#x27;d send me another one and asked for my info, I asked what else they&#x27;d do with my info and they never answered my question, they just proceeded to ask for it. I finally gave in. it took them a day to reply versus emailing me back and forth as if we were texting. now I asked them to explain why the dye didn&#x27;t work and they never replied. they were kinda rude as well. Anyways, all I know now is that they have my address and name and theyre not replying to me....wont be surprised if my house gets broken into while im out.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I used it for the first time this month, and I will continue to use it.  I may have to leave it on a bit longer than instructions, but I am happy with the product. &amp;#34;No more chemicals&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have natural thick hair and wanted it jet black, shiny and strong.  This product didn&#x27;t disappoint at all.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have much to say about this haven&#x27;t use it yet because you have to leave it on for 3 hours at a time which is six hours total.  Don&#x27;t know it I&#x27;m gonna spend three hours with dye on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to permanent dye ingredients including PPD and tried pretty much everything that claim PPD free permanent dye but none really worked. Some so called PPD free products even contained small quantities of PPD. I am glad I finally found something that works and stays on months+. I use 2 steps after a hair cut and just 1 step then on until my next hair cut.</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely bad, crumbly powder and didn&#x27;t cover my grays... I am very disappointing. I am not going to order again.</li>
    <li> Currently using this product. Happy to use a chemical free product. Still working to perfect the color, but I like how my hair looks so far. Will continue to use this product. The Henna Guy tech support has been great. I receive prompt and helpful response to questions.</li>
    <li> this may be a good and healthy product for some people hair but, did not get the color I was looking for which is black</li>
    <li> for me. product didn&#x27;t cover my greys and  after all that work left my dark hair looking lighter, dryer and just unhealthy. did find a henna somewhere else that did as was advertised. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t release dye</li>
    <li> I had a bad experience with this product.  Before I go further let me suggest that you have a backup solution in place when coloring experiment goes wrong.  I will mention my backup solution later in the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 90% white beard hair.  I initially tried one step black natural henna from another vendor.  That gave me black and purple tints on my face.  Obviously that experiment went bad and I shaved my beard after people told me about it.  The purple tints were clearly visible on close up and in daylight.  I wish that vendor was on Amazon so i could give them 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched further and found that 2 step process gives better results so I bought this product.  After step 1, my beard hair turned orange which I expected.  I applied step 1 for 3-4 hours and then I washed my face.  I moved to step 2 and applied for close to 2 hours.  When I washed my face, I had patches of white, orange, red, blue, green and black hair.  Don&#x27;t tell me that I didn&#x27;t apply the product evenly.  This is the reason for 1 star rating.  Of course I couldn&#x27;t go out like that so I trimmed my beard and then applied a black mascara like product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use a single step black henna product from another company that gives me black and less purple tint and then I use the black mascara made for beard to cover purple.  If you want to know product names then send me a note.  Neither are ideal and I am still searching for a better solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can use chemical dyes then go with that.  I am allergic so can&#x27;t use chemical products.</li>
    <li> I bought the henna because I wanted to dye my hair with a natural product.  he only issue is that there are too many processes need to achieve the color I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have been using Henna and Indigo for over a year.  I usually use Harvest Moon and I like their products but tried this company because it was cheaper and the price went up on HM.  I did it in two separate steps (sometimes I have done it in one step with exactly the same results as in two steps).  I washed my hair with Ion clarifying shampoo and t-shirt dryed.  I mixed henna with 1 tbs of olive oil and a little salt and used immediately.  Then I sat under the soft bonnet dryer (love this dryer) laying on my bed, rinsed thoroughly and all of my grays were an orangish like color 27, and it looked nice.  I then I put on the indigo.  I mixed with salt, olive oil and half of one box of Kalpi tone. Then I sat under my gold no hot soft bonnet dryer for about 30 minutes and spent about 30 additional minutes not under the dryer using the phone.  I usually wait 2-4 hours without the dryer.  This is the first time my grays were jet black.  It is the first time I used this brand, the first time I sat under the dryer to shorten the time and the first time I mixed in Kalpi tone.  I don&#x27;t know if it was one of those things or a combination but all of my long 3c/4a hair came out a beautiful jet black. It has been such a long time since my hair was all black with no grays or no orangish red highlights (which look good by the way if you want highlights).  Coloring this way makes my AA hair healthier and contributes to its strength and length.</li>
    <li> Great delivery time. great product. I had an allergic reaction to  Hair dye. so i have been using henna for over a year now. I started out using a Turkish brand that a family member got me. Very hard to read directions . i bought the brazillian henna and then read that it wasnt very good for you. so i bought from the henna guys . I really wish henna products would come with detailed instructions because someone like me who NEEDS to use Henna and wont go without coloring the hair.  My cousin directed me to a great website that explained the process and i found that for a year i have been doing it wrong!!! the henna guys sent 2 packages of henna and i thought they were sending me extra.. lol.. NO  you have to use both of them seperate. i didnt know this. so messed it up . I really wish these Henna products came with detailed instructions  thats the only reason i only gave it  4 stars</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too long of a process</li>
    <li> This is very high-quality dye! It washes out great, doesn&#x27;t clump, and my hair actually came out jet black!!! first try!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add a teabag or lemon to the warm water before mixing in the henna powder.&lt;br /&gt;Rince the henna out with only water. no conditioner, no shampooo.&lt;br /&gt;Add a teaspoon of salt to indigo powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer you leave each in, the blacker your hair will end up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can condition after the indigo</li>
    <li> I love this product. First I followed the step one process, I left in my hair for two hours.  it left my hair like a burnt orange which I really liked. I was going to leave it like that. But later on I decided to finish it off with step two. I left that in for three hours. I rinsed that out and omg. My hair has never been this jet back in my life  No matter what kind of hair rinse I used. Absolutely love and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So, i am doing the two step process to get jet black hair. The info about says that it is enough to cover someone with very long hair -- i do not have long hair. It is thick shoulder length hair. I noticed that it was not enough when i was doing the first step, i could not cover all my hair and i had to leave holes and patches where there was not enough henna to cover it. So now i am on the 2nd step because i did not want to walk around with red/orange hair. I even tried to dilute it so there would be more, but no, i was unsuccessful in saturating my whole head. I am just annoyed that i am going to have to do this whole messy process again next week. So if you have really long hair order two packs of the two step packs so you can be guaranteed coverage. Overall it is a good product, it is 100% natural. The smell is awful, it smells like algae or whatever that stuff at the bottom of your fish tank, lol. But hey, i&#x27;m allergic to hair dye so i don&#x27;t really have much options to choose from.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used pre-packaged henndigo mixes from the health food store. They&#x27;ve given me a nice natural black but there were still red highlights in the sun, so I decided it was time to go all out and try the two-step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna was amazing. Really finely sifted and made my already-dark hair almost a deep burgundy color! No orange at all really. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the indigo wasn&#x27;t that great. Even when I do a henna/indigo one-step mix, the indigo usually stains my gloves blue, but this stuff didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t see any visible dye release, actually. It did make my hair a little darker, but it still had a mahogany tint, and it&#x27;s VERY red in sunlight. It&#x27;s a pretty color but not what I wanted from the two-step process. To be fair my hair has chemical damage, but like I said, I barely saw any dye release from the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order henna from this seller again but search elsewhere for some indigo with more tinting power.</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time, it was totally worth the money. Truly impressed with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> it was my first i used this product.&lt;br /&gt;its very good product and i will order another one as soon as possible</li>
